reading of our nomination that we began um last week and so even as we listen to the message it is aligned to the aspect of leadership and after the message we will translit into uh giving us the first reading of the report I sit time is spent I will try to summarize what I'm prepared for 45 minutes I see I have like 25 minutes to go I so pray for me that God may give me Grace and summarize my thoughts let's pray as we begin gracious Father in heaven Hallowed be thy name thy kingdom come thy will be done in this place and for this message as it is in heaven for thine is the kingdom the power and glory Lord I pray that I may not speak now but may you speak through me touch my thoughts and my lips and summarize what you've wanted me to say this day and give Clarity to that message in Jesus name we pray amen [Music] the subject for our message this morning is um Beyond titles the Jesus effect Beyond titles the Jesus effect this will be based on the book of 2 Corinthians Chapter 3 Verse 18 2 Corinthians chapter 3: 18 the Bible says but we all with unveiled face beholding as in a mirror the glory of the Lord are being transformed into the same image from glory to glory just as by the spirit of the Lord but we all with unveiled Fai beholding as in a mirror the glory of the Lord are being transformed into the same image from glory to glory just as by the spirit of the Lord now this particular passage in in a highly summarized view Paul is talking about the effect of the ministry of Jesus in the lives of Believers where Jesus is being portrayed as a standard and everyone else is converging towards him and as they come to him they are being transformed to look like him is a situation where he is glorious and the people that are following him or coming to him are struggling and he attracts them and he changes them to be like him now Paul is telling us those who believe in Jesus they have a journey to walk through and that journey is one that ought to be transformative so when you come to Jesus when you believe in Jesus your life begins changing but it changes after his character you start being aligned to his character now Jesus is not only a preacher and a savior but Jesus is a leader in fact he is a good leader a master leader and so when we talk about leadership then we have Jesus as an example and so if if we apply that to this particular context then those who be leaders are being transformed from their image to the image of Jesus in other words those who become leaders after Jesus they begin acquiring the traits and the characters and the principles that Jesus espouses in his ministry Christian leadership is fundamentally about being the clearest one can be in reflecting Jesus but you see friends the world often defines leadership by status power and control but Jesus came and portrayed the kingdom of God and the leadership therein as one that is about mirroring himself as the true leader looking at his heart and his mind and as it attitude and how he learned the church and the mission that he came for now Paul says beholding as in a mirror that Jesus is the mirror that we check ourself through that we see whether we aligned we see whether we are dressed well we see whether we are standing well Jesus is the mirror for every leader to see whether you are leading well in the Church of God or Not Jesus is the mirror for every Pastor for every every Elder for every Deacon for every Deacon Jesus is the miror for you to check yourself to see what you have done whether you are in the principles of God or not and it says through looking at this mirror then you begin being transformed the implication is as a leader cast Their Eyes On Jesus they will be like him in their thoughts in their deeds and in their spoken was so when I talk about Beyond titles Jesus effect I am seeing that Jesus came with a body and I am going to bring out that very briefly that Jesus came to serve the B he came to a people he came into a nation he came into a society that leadership was completely distorted you see in the world titles often signify possession Authority and achievement they are marked with tons of success and the systems are designed in a way that those who occupy places of influence they become powerful they portrayed to be very powerful well titles can be valuable they also sometimes lean to Pride competition and self centeredness now Jesus came to challenge that sers now the Jesus effect in his leadership when when you SC through Jesus ministry as a leader his service his leadership was transformative the power that transforms transforming lives and focus is on servant leadership humility and empowering those that you serve you see friends this season of nomination often inspires the hearts of Believers not just in the church but everywhere but sometimes for the wrong reasons you know positions in church are meant to service or to serve not for status yet there is often a clamor for power a struggle for recognition for prominen a desire to be esteemed to be seen that Jesus comes and defines a society that is so deeply lost in the clamor for power struggle for prominen and desire for recognition one day he is with his disciples and in fact as we check the stories of Jesus with his disciples there are three critical incidences where Jesus and a moment to speak to the heart of his disciples three times they came to him strongly with a question who is greatest Among Us now three incidences that Jesus and to face the reality of what was happening in the lives of his disciples now let me Begin by giving us a text of the Book of Matthew CH 20 vers number 25 through 28 now the Bible says but Jesus called them to himself and say you know that the rulers of the Gentiles Lord itat over them and those who are great exercise authority over them yet it shall not be so among you but whoever desires to become great among you let him be your servant and whoever desires to be first among you let him be your slave just as the son of man did not come to be served but to serve and to give his life asome for many now in this passage Jesus is unpacking very deep message of church leadership he creating a transformative view a paradigm shift of the view of leadership in the house of God now Jesus is redefining power and influence he says your people the society where you belong the leaders there Le it over the people that they lead but that is not what God designed it to be you have come to me you need to have a different perspective of leadership it is not where we Embrace possession power and authority no this ought not be so among you but whoever deserve that he goes to State what ought to be practiced in the house of God whoever desires to be a leader let him first know he ought to serve those he came to lead not just service but he need to know that when you desire to become a leader you are actually deciding to become a slave very radical thinking you know leadership in the World review is not slavery it's the power but according to the kingdom of God those who desire to be leaders they have asked to become slaves now he says now if you are confused on what I'm talking about look at me I am your leader I am your S I am your master I am God have come to you but I've come not that I you may serve me as your boast but I've come that I may serve you just the son of man did not come to be served but to serve you see friends Jesus approach to leadership stands in St contrast to traditional Notions of authority and Power in his time leadership was often characterized by dominance control and the pass for personal glory and gain yet Jesus introduced a radical different Paradigm where leadership is not power is not Authority but leadership a service is I came to serve and did not come to be served I came to serve leadership in the view of Heaven leadership in the Kingdom principle is service not Power Authority and cognition his life and teachings demonstrated that true goodness is found not in loing over others but in humbling oneself to serve them and so we see Jesus redefining leadership redefining power redefining Authority now Jesus did this by demonstrating the power of leadership and he D that by speaking and practicing the principle of humility now Jesus says humility is the strength is the power is the authority in leadership you see John Chapter 13 Verse number one uh through five Jesus to demonstrate the power of leadership which is humility than Authority he he was with his disciples and the Bible tells us you know he took he took a tower wrapped around his waist went down on the feets of of the disciples he began washing and cleaning their feet we all know the story but as they were doing that some of them were very uncomfortable in fact when he came to Peter told him no Jesus you can't do this to me now this is contrary to our traditions this is irregular Jesus you know the Traditions the law of the land the custom demands that we wash your feet because you are a PA man you are a leader you have authority we are your subject but Jesus look at them and tell let me tell you I have come to correct this mistake that has scripped in the church the church leadership is not for power and authority not for recognition as for service if I am your leader have come to serve you can somebody say Amen this is the Jesus effect in the church leadership that every leader ought to know you've not be nominated into an office to be a man or a woman of power influence and Authority but you have come to serve Jesus was their feed in this Jesus is teaching disciples and the church today that by performing the manual tax in church by performing the LLY responsibility in church by serving where no one recognizes you you are illustrating the leadership is a not about asserting status but relinquishing status Jesus when when he went down on the disciples feet and was their feet the principle he was teaching them is that leadership is not about asserting your status but as relinquishing your status now let me summarize this way you see Jesus as God the Bible says in the book of Philippians that even though he was equal with God he did not count that he qu to be anything but what did he do but he empty himself of the status of being God and he came and he was born he took the form of man that he may Ser man know leadership is relinquishing your status to be able to serve let me speak to somebody this morning and say you cannot serve effectively if you are serving in your status let me speak to my elders here let me speak to my pastors here as I must speak to myself and to every leader of the church we cannot sit and serve in our status we must be able to remove our status and go down to the very level of a child then we can begin speaking like a child can somebody say Amen Jesus removed everything that made him be a God and left it there and he came as a servant this is what we want to see in his church you see ass setting status is the old riew of leadership we people seek to climb to the ranks asserting their Authority climbing on other people oppressing other people they want to be there by every means by relinquishing your status it is willing to volunteer your office for other people to sit there and to Ser can somebody say Amen you see let me speak to us friends you see when we come to church leadership even though we have possessions these are not possessions of power they are possessions of service possessions of humility so Paul says let this mind be in you which also was in Christ Jesus who being in the form of God did not consider it Rob to be equal with God but made himself of no reputation so many of us we are so much concerned with our reputation you see as simple thing as being changed you know you have been serving as as as a deacon and this time you have been elected to Ser as a Sabbath School clerk a c law teacher you Pastor why did you demot me what will people say what will people say what are they have to say what did you expect them to say were you serving people you are serving God and God's work has no status has no recognition in fact let me speak to us this morning let us know the more you serve in the L estate of our society in the church the more God will exalt you to Higher Ground can somebody say Amen because that is exactly what Jesus did anyone who had is bent to for popularity and prestigious Poss that we create in our minds we are in contrast and in conflict with the very Spirit of the ministry of Jesus he came and says I have left everything so I look at Jesus emptying himself of godliness and then he comes and he goes on the tree as a slave he dies on the tree as a criminal that he has taken down into a grave just for the sake of service serving his people dying for his people not for him to gain anything but willing to lose everything just to serve this how came not to be served but to serve this is what I feel the church needs today that Jesus effect in our minds that Jesus effect in our Ministries that Jesus effect in our church that we may be able to see the power that transforms the house of God is not in Authority but in humility can somebody say Amen friend let me summarize this way I say Jesus contrasting two things the the culture of building powerfulness and the culture of building empowerment these are two cultures that are in church in the world today a culture of building pness and the culture of building empowerment now when Jesus came he came and he met a culture of building powerfulness men who are powerful in the church they will tell him anything they would tell him off they would call him names they would despise him because they were P men they and acquired status in the society that was so powerful one day they looked at him but what you think you have are you not just that son of Mary and Joseph in fact we have a lot of questions about your being now that they were so powerful one day they dragged the woman before him we know according to the law power people like you ought to give a decree to Stone such a woman but what do you say they were challenging Jesus because of the culture of powerfulness but Jesus looked at them and says I came not to build the culture of pness but to build the culture of empowerment can somebody say Amen this woman is struggling in sin I am not here to Stone her to condemn her I have come to empower to experience the grace of God the culture of powerfulness today is still alive in church I don't know who I'm talking to this morning I wish they didn't take my time I would have discussed it that point a little more but let me tell us friends the culture of powerfulness is not only in the church but actually is destroying the church one church member called me and asked me Pastor do church leaders get saries you didn't you didn't hear me CH leaders paid you a youth leader you are paid you're an elder you are paid she ask me ask sister why you asking me this you know pastor at times I look at the church and I see how leaders struggle and fight and they wonder how much have they paid every month sister it is not about money there is an idol called Power it doesn't have to come with any but power is so strong than money and you see in our society we are all building on the culture of powerfulness now Jesus came to challenge the concept of powerness and says I was powerful in fact the Bible tells us in the beginning was the word and the Word was the God and the Word was God is somebody with me he says this particular word is the one who created everything nothing that has been made that was made without him he is a Creator a power of God but he relinquished that power to come and empower the church can somebody say Amen the church leadership is here not to Hest power but to empower the body of Christ formation every single leader should bear in their heart the Buren to win the next Soul awaiting the line not the next status not the next recognition not the next office where are you going with those offices leadership is a posture not a Poss leadership is a person not a possession what I mean here is very simple you know possession is the idea of rank office and people who Ser there understand that that their inflence comes from actions not Authority aure means prioritizing people over your possession and I see Jesus in his PR shift of leadership he is telling Christian leaders today leadership that I'm calling a person not a position is not about sitting at the head of the table no leadership is kneeling down and washing other people's feet can somebody say Amen leadership is not about holding the loudest microphone but about listening to the quietest voice and Shing everyone feels Hur and valued leadership is not about leading from front but about supporting From The Trenches helping others over come the struggles that collectively you may win for Jesus leadership is not about giving commands from the podium but about rolling up our sleeves to serve our Master leadership is not about being the boss who assigns tax and supervises with authority but about being teammate who asks how can I help you to serve the Lord better leadership is not about wearing the crown but about carrying the cross I don't know what you understand when you think about leadership in church I don't know what is in your mind even as you wait to read the report that we have today I don't know who you're expecting to be where and what you feel if he is not where you expected him to be maybe you're struggling with understanding the concept of leadership in the house of God I rate once again the church leadership has nothing to do with the power with authority with ranks it has everything to do with service so then you've been asked for for the next two years your service is cleaning the microphone for the next two years your service in the church you'll be coming out in the morning pick the microphone clean it clean the microphone there down you have served the Lord my sister the heaven will be smiling you see I just preparing you to receive the report because I've been doing nominations for a while now and I remember one Christian calling me someday and asked me pastor are you with me I need to I need to understand Pastor was like what happening here you see this good Christian was moved from an office that in our human understanding and standards is an elevated office then he was placed in another in his standards and understanding is the low office he struggled with that communication he called me he told me Pastor I can't even share with you over the phone I need to come sit with you face to face and so I wome he came to my house as Pastor I want to make me understand then he went ahead and asked me Pastor honestly you couldn't Mo me from that office and you put so and so I looked at this Christian I love him because I saw a Christian who is struggling to understand the kingdom of God Christians let me speak to us today the church leadership and office we have is not permanent and pensionable and I want to encourage this church to have a culture where you can say I have served enough in this department I want to go to another department not a culture where when you are moved from one Department you start fighting and hating pastor and hating the Committee Member did you know that there are people when the nomination report is brought they don't sleep some get sick I am praying today that no one gets sick because the report receive it and accept it because the Lord is the master of his church he knows who you want to serve he knows who you want to place well and if youve been serving at this time you're not serving thank the Lord sit and minister to your soul maybe let me let me say this friends it is it is good at time for you to value your soul and Eternity at times you need to retreat back and feel the Lord speaking and and nuring you and re energizing you for you to come back again and serve don't continue serving in one Department from 1902 to 2004 the same Department the same department and any nominated Comm attempt to move you a little bit this way they'll be in a hot soup no no Jesus said that is the worldly view but for you it ought not to be so can somebody say Amen look at the person next to you tell him or her sister brother it ought not be so with us not be so but he says but but but but but but but but but if granted you desire to serve then accept and agree to become a slave let me see how many of us today are so desire us to become slaves to prit do you even understand why he means to become a slave look at the life of Jesus in fact Isaiah tells us he was dragged to the Cross like a sheep are you with me he was beat down everything and all he could say is Lord my father forgive them for they do not know what they are doing he was a slave of us we did everything we could do to him but he bore all that just because of service are you willing I pray that we may have the Jesus effect in naobi Central Church I pray that we may have Jesus effect in our church today that we will value the soul more than the position we will value service more than the rank we will say Jesus if this is where you pleas me to serve you I will serve you with all my heart with all my mind and with all my soul how many of us today say Jesus doesn't matter where you place me and by the way let me tell us the our church is large and the entire leadership that we put place is about 57 something now to some people that is Ah that's a very large number but how many Are we more than that so it simply tells you not everyone has been nominated it's as simple as that not everyone I mean you start expecting now you may not be in that list and make peace with that reality because there is no way we can all Feit in the few slot the church has for leadership so some of us will be serving from the benches supporting the leaders because even those who are holding the hands of the man of God we as important as the man of God can somebody say Amen we are one body and we cannot afford to entertain the evil one distracting us on the issues of authority and the ranks and The Possession we are building the body of Christ and the mission of wiing source is our agenda and we shall join together no matter where I am placed to serve the Lord because you know the time is very short I invite you prayerfully to consider the Jesus effect the Lord bless us

[195.2s] [Music]
[196.4s] the subject for our message this
[201.2s] morning is um Beyond
[206.1s] titles the Jesus effect
[210.1s] Beyond titles the Jesus
[215.3s] effect this will be based on the book of
[218.2s] 2 Corinthians Chapter 3 Verse
[223.8s] 18 2 Corinthians chapter 3: 18 the Bible
[228.3s] says but we all with unveiled face
[232.3s] beholding as in a mirror the glory of
[235.4s] the Lord are being transformed into the
[239.8s] same image from glory to glory just as
[244.4s] by the spirit of the
[247.5s] Lord but we all with unveiled Fai
[251.0s] beholding as in a mirror the glory of
[253.3s] the Lord are being transformed into the
[256.3s] same image from glory to glory just as
[260.1s] by the spirit of the
[262.4s] Lord
[264.0s] now this particular
[268.4s] passage in in a highly summarized
[272.0s] view Paul is talking
[274.9s] about the effect of the ministry of
[280.0s] Jesus in the lives of
[283.7s] Believers where Jesus is being portrayed
[287.9s] as a
[288.9s] standard and everyone else is converging
[291.8s] towards him and as they come to him they
[295.8s] are being transformed to look like him
[299.9s] is a situation where he is glorious and
[302.9s] the people that are following him or
[304.9s] coming to him are struggling and he
[307.9s] attracts them and he changes them to be
[310.2s] like him
[314.3s] now Paul
[317.2s] is telling us those who believe in
[320.7s] Jesus they have a journey to walk
[324.0s] through and that journey is one that
[326.7s] ought to be transformative
[330.5s] so when you come to Jesus when you
[332.4s] believe in
[334.1s] Jesus your life begins changing but it
[337.8s] changes after his character you start
[341.5s] being aligned to his character now Jesus
[345.2s] is not only a preacher and a savior but
[349.0s] Jesus is a leader in fact he is a good
[351.8s] leader a master leader and so when we
[355.0s] talk about leadership then we have Jesus
[357.7s] as an example and so if if we apply that
[360.5s] to this particular context then those
[363.2s] who be leaders are being transformed
[367.4s] from their image to the image of Jesus
[370.1s] in other words those who become leaders
[372.6s] after Jesus they begin acquiring the
[375.8s] traits and the characters and the
[377.7s] principles that Jesus espouses in his
[381.2s] ministry Christian
[383.4s] leadership is fundamentally about being
[386.6s] the clearest one can be in
[390.3s] reflecting
[392.2s] Jesus but you see friends the world
[394.6s] often defines leadership by status power
[399.1s] and
[400.0s] control but Jesus came and portrayed the
[404.0s] kingdom of God and the leadership
[406.1s] therein as one that is about
[410.5s] mirroring himself as the true
[414.2s] leader looking at his heart and his mind
[418.1s] and as it attitude
[420.5s] and how he learned the church and the
[424.3s] mission that he came
[426.6s] for now Paul says beholding as in a
[430.6s] mirror that Jesus is the mirror that we
[433.3s] check ourself through that we see
[436.4s] whether we aligned we see whether we are
[438.3s] dressed well we see whether we are
[439.7s] standing well Jesus is the mirror for
[441.9s] every leader to see whether you are
[444.1s] leading well in the Church of God or Not
[447.0s] Jesus is the mirror for every Pastor for
[449.3s] every every Elder for every Deacon for
[451.2s] every Deacon Jesus is the miror for you
[453.9s] to check yourself to see what you have
[456.6s] done whether you are in the principles
[460.4s] of God or not and it says through
[463.7s] looking at this mirror then you begin
[465.9s] being
[468.2s] transformed the implication is as a
[470.6s] leader cast Their Eyes On
[473.5s] Jesus they will be like him in their
[476.6s] thoughts in their deeds and in their
[478.9s] spoken
[481.1s] was so when I talk about Beyond
[485.3s] titles Jesus
[487.7s] effect I am seeing that Jesus came with
[490.8s] a body and I am going to bring out that
[494.2s] very briefly that Jesus came to serve
[497.3s] the B he came to a people he came into a
[501.6s] nation he came into a society that
[505.0s] leadership was completely
[507.8s] distorted you see
[510.6s] in the world titles often signify
[513.8s] possession Authority and
[517.5s] achievement they are
[520.4s] marked with tons of
[524.7s] success and the systems are designed in
[527.6s] a way that those who occupy places of
[530.8s] influence they become powerful they
[533.0s] portrayed to be very
[534.8s] powerful well titles can be valuable
[539.7s] they also sometimes lean to Pride
[542.8s] competition and self
[545.8s] centeredness now Jesus came to challenge
[549.0s] that
[550.2s] sers now the Jesus effect in his
[553.1s] leadership when when you SC through
[554.8s] Jesus ministry as a
[558.0s] leader his service his leadership was
[561.7s] transformative the power that
[564.9s] transforms transforming
[568.1s] lives and focus is on servant
[571.3s] leadership humility and empowering those
[575.2s] that you
[576.5s] serve you see friends this season of
[580.4s] nomination often inspires the hearts of
[583.9s] Believers not just in the church but
[587.5s] everywhere but sometimes for the wrong
[591.1s] reasons you know positions in church are
[594.0s] meant to
[595.4s] service or to
[597.6s] serve not for
[600.6s] status yet there is often a clamor for
[605.1s] power a struggle for recognition for
[609.3s] prominen a desire to be esteemed to be
[614.0s] seen that Jesus comes and defines a
[618.3s] society that is so deeply lost in the
[623.1s] clamor for power struggle for prominen
[626.0s] and desire for
[628.3s] recognition one day he is with his
[631.6s] disciples and in fact as we check the
[633.7s] stories of Jesus with his disciples
[637.0s] there are three critical incidences
[639.8s] where Jesus and a moment to speak to the
[643.2s] heart of his disciples three times they
[645.3s] came to him strongly with a question who
[649.1s] is greatest Among Us now three
[653.1s] incidences that Jesus and to face the
[655.7s] reality of what was happening in the
[657.7s] lives of his disciples now let me Begin
[660.2s] by giving us a text of the Book of
[661.4s] Matthew CH 20 vers number 25 through 28
[663.8s] now the Bible says but Jesus called them
[666.2s] to himself and say you know that the
[668.6s] rulers of the Gentiles Lord itat over
[671.4s] them and those who are great exercise
[675.2s] authority over them yet it shall not be
[678.8s] so among you but whoever desires to
[682.0s] become great among you let him be your
[684.4s] servant and whoever desires to be first
[686.9s] among you let him be your slave
[689.8s] just as the son of man did not come to
[692.7s] be served but to serve and to give his
[697.2s] life asome for many now in this passage
[701.0s] Jesus is
[703.2s] unpacking very deep message of church
[706.3s] leadership he creating a transformative
[709.5s] view a paradigm shift of the view of
[713.7s] leadership in the house of God now Jesus
[717.5s] is redefining power and influence he
[721.0s] says your people the society where you
[724.4s] belong the leaders there Le it over the
[728.3s] people that they
[731.5s] lead but that is not what God designed
[735.0s] it to be you have come to me you need to
[738.1s] have a different perspective of
[740.0s] leadership it is not where we Embrace
[742.7s] possession power and authority no this
[746.0s] ought not be so among you but whoever
[748.6s] deserve that he goes to State what ought
[751.0s] to be practiced in the house of God
[752.8s] whoever desires to be a leader let him
[756.4s] first know he ought to serve those he
[759.2s] came to lead not just service but he
[762.5s] need to know that when you desire to
[764.8s] become a leader you are actually
[766.3s] deciding to become a
[768.1s] slave very radical thinking you know
[771.8s] leadership in the World review is not
[774.2s] slavery it's the power but according to
[777.4s] the kingdom of God those who desire to
[779.6s] be leaders they have asked to become
[782.8s] slaves now he says now if you are
[785.4s] confused on what I'm talking about look
[786.9s] at me I am your leader I am your S I am
[790.8s] your master I am God have come to you
[793.3s] but I've come not that I you may serve
[796.8s] me as your boast but I've come that I
[798.7s] may serve you just the son of man did
[801.8s] not come to be served but to serve you
[804.4s] see friends Jesus approach to leadership
[808.5s] stands in St contrast to traditional
[812.8s] Notions of authority and Power in his
[815.6s] time leadership was often characterized
[818.8s] by dominance control and the pass for
[822.2s] personal glory and gain yet Jesus
[826.0s] introduced a radical different Paradigm
[829.8s] where leadership is not power is not
[832.7s] Authority but leadership a service is I
[836.6s] came to serve and did not come to be
[839.4s] served I came to serve leadership in the
[843.4s] view of Heaven leadership in the Kingdom
[846.4s] principle is service not Power Authority
[850.0s] and cognition his life and teachings
[853.4s] demonstrated that true goodness is found
[856.8s] not in loing over others but in humbling
[861.3s] oneself to serve them and so we see
[864.3s] Jesus redefining leadership redefining
[867.8s] power redefining
[869.6s] Authority now Jesus did this by
[874.3s] demonstrating the power of
[877.0s] leadership and he D that by speaking and
[880.8s] practicing the principle of humility now
[883.2s] Jesus says humility is the strength is
[887.1s] the power is the authority in leadership
[890.6s] you see John Chapter 13 Verse number one
[894.2s] uh through five Jesus to demonstrate the
[897.4s] power of leadership
[899.9s] which is humility than
[902.8s] Authority he he was with his disciples
[905.6s] and the Bible tells us you know he took
[908.2s] he took a tower wrapped around his waist
[912.0s] went down on the feets of of the
[914.1s] disciples he began washing and cleaning
[917.0s] their feet we all know the story but as
[919.2s] they were doing that some of them were
[920.8s] very uncomfortable in fact when he came
[922.6s] to Peter told him no Jesus you can't do
[924.7s] this to me now this is contrary to our
[927.4s] traditions this is
[929.5s] irregular Jesus you know the Traditions
[932.0s] the law of the land the custom demands
[934.1s] that we wash your feet because you are a
[937.5s] PA man you are a leader you have
[940.0s] authority we are your subject but Jesus
[942.5s] look at them and tell let me tell you I
[944.5s] have come to correct this mistake that
[947.2s] has scripped in the church the church
[949.8s] leadership is not for power and
[951.8s] authority not for recognition as for
[954.2s] service if I am your leader have come to
[957.5s] serve you can somebody say Amen
[959.8s] this is the Jesus effect in the church
[963.2s] leadership that every leader ought to
[965.7s] know you've not be nominated into an
[968.3s] office to be a man or a woman of power
[971.2s] influence and Authority but you have
[973.5s] come to
[975.2s] serve
[976.9s] Jesus was their
[979.1s] feed in this Jesus is teaching disciples
[983.9s] and the church today that by performing
[989.3s] the manual tax in church by performing
[994.7s] the LLY responsibility in church by
[999.7s] serving where no one recognizes
[1004.8s] you
[1007.1s] you are
[1009.9s] illustrating the leadership is a not
[1013.2s] about asserting status but relinquishing
[1017.4s] status Jesus when when he went down on
[1020.9s] the disciples feet and was their feet
[1023.5s] the principle he was teaching them is
[1025.2s] that leadership is not about asserting
[1027.7s] your status but as relinquishing your
[1030.9s] status now let me summarize this way you
[1033.7s] see Jesus as God the Bible says in the
[1038.3s] book of Philippians that even though he
[1041.4s] was equal with God he did not count that
[1045.5s] he qu to be anything but what did he do
[1048.0s] but he empty himself of the status of
[1051.2s] being God and he came and he was born he
[1054.0s] took the form of man that he may Ser man
[1057.8s] know leadership is relinquishing your
[1060.9s] status to be able to serve let me speak
[1063.2s] to somebody this morning and say you
[1065.4s] cannot serve effectively if you are
[1068.0s] serving in your status let me speak to
[1071.5s] my elders here let me speak to my
[1073.5s] pastors here as I must speak to myself
[1075.6s] and to every leader of the church we
[1077.8s] cannot sit and serve in our status we
[1081.6s] must be able to remove our status and go
[1085.0s] down to the very level of a child then
[1088.1s] we can begin speaking like a child can
[1090.1s] somebody say Amen Jesus removed
[1094.2s] everything that made him be a God and
[1097.0s] left it there and he came as a servant
[1101.3s] this is what we want to see in his
[1104.0s] church you see ass setting status is the
[1107.5s] old riew of leadership we people seek to
[1110.2s] climb to the ranks asserting their
[1113.2s] Authority climbing on other people
[1115.6s] oppressing other people they want to be
[1117.9s] there by every
[1119.8s] means by relinquishing your status it is
[1123.8s] willing to volunteer your office for
[1126.6s] other people to sit there and to Ser can
[1128.4s] somebody say Amen you see let me speak
[1130.5s] to us
[1131.6s] friends you see when we come to church
[1134.4s] leadership
[1139.7s] even though we have
[1142.2s] possessions these are not possessions of
[1146.3s] power they are possessions of
[1149.5s] service possessions of
[1152.2s] humility so Paul says let this mind be
[1155.3s] in you which also was in Christ Jesus
[1158.4s] who being in the form of God did not
[1160.2s] consider it Rob to be equal with God but
[1163.4s] made himself of no
[1165.2s] reputation so many of us we are so much
[1168.2s] concerned with our
[1170.8s] reputation you see as simple thing as
[1174.4s] being changed you know you have been
[1176.3s] serving as as as a deacon and this time
[1180.1s] you have been elected to Ser as a
[1182.3s] Sabbath School
[1184.4s] clerk a c law teacher you Pastor why did
[1188.6s] you demot me what will people say what
[1191.8s] will people say what are they have to
[1195.3s] say what did you expect them to say
[1199.0s] were you serving people you are serving
[1201.4s] God and God's work has no status has no
[1205.2s] recognition in fact let me speak to us
[1207.1s] this morning let us know the more you
[1209.5s] serve in the L estate of our society in
[1212.8s] the church the more God will exalt you
[1215.8s] to Higher Ground can somebody say Amen
[1218.2s] because that is exactly what Jesus did
[1221.2s] anyone who had is bent to for popularity
[1224.9s] and prestigious Poss that we create in
[1227.5s] our minds we are in contrast and in
[1231.4s] conflict with the very Spirit of the
[1234.2s] ministry of Jesus he came and says I
[1237.8s] have left everything so I look at Jesus
[1241.7s] emptying himself of godliness and then
[1245.3s] he comes and he goes on the tree as a
[1248.7s] slave he dies on the tree as a criminal
[1251.9s] that he has taken down into a grave just
[1255.1s] for the sake of service serving his
[1258.0s] people dying for his people not for him
[1260.5s] to gain anything but willing to lose
[1263.0s] everything just to
[1265.0s] serve this how came not to be served but
[1269.5s] to serve this is what I feel the church
[1273.8s] needs today that Jesus effect in our
[1277.3s] minds that Jesus effect in our
[1279.5s] Ministries that Jesus effect in our
[1281.8s] church that we may be able to
[1286.5s] see the power that transforms the house
[1291.0s] of God is not in Authority but in
[1295.2s] humility can somebody say
[1297.2s] Amen friend let me summarize this
[1303.0s] way I say Jesus contrasting two
[1312.0s] things
[1313.9s] the the
[1316.0s] culture of building
[1320.5s] powerfulness and the culture of building
[1325.7s] empowerment these are two cultures that
[1328.5s] are in church in the world today a
[1332.1s] culture of building pness and the
[1335.4s] culture of building empowerment now when
[1337.9s] Jesus came he came and he met a culture
[1341.6s] of building
[1343.8s] powerfulness men who are powerful in the
[1346.6s] church they will tell him anything they
[1349.5s] would tell him off they would call him
[1351.8s] names they would despise him because
[1354.2s] they were P men they and acquired status
[1358.3s] in the society that was so
[1360.8s] powerful one day they looked at him but
[1363.5s] what you think you have are you not just
[1365.1s] that son of Mary and Joseph in fact we
[1367.5s] have a lot of questions about your being
[1370.8s] now that they were so powerful one day
[1373.0s] they dragged the woman before him we
[1375.3s] know according to the law power people
[1377.3s] like you ought to give a decree to Stone
[1379.6s] such a woman but what do you say they
[1381.6s] were challenging Jesus because of the
[1384.2s] culture of
[1386.2s] powerfulness but Jesus looked at them
[1389.0s] and says I came not to build the culture
[1392.3s] of pness but to build the culture of
[1394.8s] empowerment can somebody say Amen this
[1397.3s] woman is struggling in sin I am not here
[1400.0s] to Stone her to condemn her I have come
[1402.6s] to empower to experience the grace of
[1406.0s] God the culture of powerfulness today is
[1410.3s] still alive in
[1417.1s] church I don't know who I'm talking to
[1419.1s] this
[1421.7s] morning I wish they didn't take my
[1426.0s] time I would have discussed it that
[1428.4s] point a little more but let me tell us
[1432.4s] friends the culture of
[1436.6s] powerfulness is not only in the church
[1439.8s] but actually is destroying the
[1447.3s] church one church member called me and
[1450.6s] asked me
[1454.0s] Pastor do church leaders get
[1460.2s] saries you didn't you didn't hear me
[1468.5s] CH leaders
[1470.3s] paid you a youth leader you are paid
[1473.5s] you're an elder you are
[1475.3s] paid she ask me ask sister why you
[1478.0s] asking me this you know pastor at times
[1480.2s] I look at the church and I see how
[1482.6s] leaders struggle and fight and they
[1484.8s] wonder how much have they paid every
[1488.8s] month sister it is not about
[1492.8s] money there is an idol called
[1495.9s] Power it doesn't have to come with any
[1499.5s] but power is so strong than money and
[1503.8s] you see in our society we are all
[1506.4s] building on the culture of powerfulness
[1509.0s] now Jesus came to challenge the concept
[1512.3s] of powerness and says I was powerful in
[1516.0s] fact the Bible tells us in the beginning
[1519.3s] was the word and the Word was the God
[1522.7s] and the Word was God is somebody with me
[1525.5s] he says this particular word is the one
[1528.4s] who created everything nothing that has
[1531.4s] been made that was made without him he
[1535.4s] is a Creator a power of God but he
[1538.6s] relinquished that power to come and
[1541.2s] empower the church can somebody say Amen
[1544.2s] the church leadership is here not to
[1548.1s] Hest power but to empower the body of
[1552.0s] Christ
[1553.1s] formation every single leader should
[1556.1s] bear in their heart the Buren to win the
[1559.0s] next Soul awaiting the line not the next
[1562.9s] status not the next recognition not the
[1565.6s] next office where are you going with
[1568.2s] those
[1577.5s] offices
[1580.9s] leadership is a
[1583.2s] posture not a
[1586.3s] Poss leadership
[1589.0s] is a person not a
[1593.1s] possession what I mean here is very
[1597.9s] simple you know possession is the idea
[1601.0s] of
[1602.6s] rank
[1606.9s] office and people who Ser there
[1609.7s] understand that that their inflence
[1612.0s] comes from
[1615.8s] actions not Authority
[1620.9s] aure means prioritizing people over your
[1626.7s] possession and I see Jesus in his PR
[1629.8s] shift of
[1631.1s] leadership he is telling Christian
[1633.5s] leaders
[1636.3s] today
[1638.0s] leadership that I'm calling a person not
[1640.8s] a position is not about sitting at the
[1644.3s] head of the table no leadership
[1649.4s] is kneeling down and washing other
[1652.4s] people's feet can somebody say Amen
[1655.0s] leadership is not about holding the
[1658.2s] loudest microphone but about listening
[1661.1s] to the quietest voice and Shing everyone
[1665.5s] feels Hur and valued leadership is not
[1669.9s] about leading from
[1672.2s] front but about supporting From The
[1676.0s] Trenches helping others over come the
[1678.8s] struggles that collectively you may win
[1682.1s] for Jesus leadership is not about giving
[1685.7s] commands from the podium but about
[1687.4s] rolling up our
[1689.0s] sleeves to serve our Master leadership
[1693.4s] is not about being the boss who assigns
[1696.4s] tax and supervises with authority but
[1699.6s] about being teammate who asks how can I
[1704.3s] help you to serve the Lord better
[1707.0s] leadership is not about wearing the
[1709.0s] crown but about carrying the cross I
[1712.6s] don't know what you understand when you
[1715.5s] think about leadership in church I don't
[1717.4s] know what is in your mind even as you
[1719.3s] wait to read the report that we have
[1721.1s] today I don't know who you're expecting
[1724.1s] to be where and what you feel if he is
[1727.0s] not where you expected him to be maybe
[1729.5s] you're struggling with understanding the
[1732.2s] concept of leadership in the house of
[1733.8s] God I rate once again the church
[1736.6s] leadership has nothing to do with the
[1738.7s] power with authority with ranks it has
[1741.5s] everything to do with
[1744.4s] service
[1746.2s] so
[1748.0s] then you've been asked for for the next
[1751.4s] two years your service is cleaning the
[1756.8s] microphone for the next two
[1759.4s] years your service in the church you'll
[1762.4s] be coming out in the morning pick the
[1764.4s] microphone clean it clean the microphone
[1767.8s] there down you have served the Lord my
[1771.2s] sister the heaven will be
[1776.2s] smiling you
[1779.0s] see I just preparing you to receive the
[1783.4s] report because I've been doing
[1785.2s] nominations for a while now and I
[1787.6s] remember one Christian calling me
[1790.0s] someday and asked me pastor
[1800.2s] are you with
[1801.6s] me I need to I need to understand
[1805.1s] Pastor was like what happening
[1809.0s] here you see this good Christian was
[1813.3s] moved from an office that in our human
[1817.2s] understanding and standards is an
[1819.0s] elevated
[1821.6s] office then he was placed in another in
[1824.7s] his standards and understanding is the
[1827.1s] low office
[1830.2s] he struggled with that communication he
[1833.0s] called me he told me Pastor I can't even
[1835.6s] share with you over the phone I need to
[1837.4s] come sit with you face to face and so I
[1839.6s] wome he came to my house as Pastor I
[1841.8s] want to make me
[1851.2s] understand then he went ahead and asked
[1853.6s] me Pastor
[1856.4s] honestly you couldn't Mo me from that
[1858.7s] office and you put so and
[1864.1s] so I looked at this Christian I love him
[1868.3s] because I saw a Christian who is
[1870.3s] struggling to understand the kingdom of
[1875.2s] God Christians let me speak to us
[1877.9s] today the church leadership and office
[1880.6s] we have is not permanent and
[1884.9s] pensionable and I want to encourage this
[1887.4s] church to have a culture where you can
[1890.0s] say I have served enough in this
[1893.1s] department I want to go to another
[1895.2s] department not a culture where when you
[1897.7s] are moved from one Department you start
[1899.8s] fighting and hating pastor and hating
[1901.7s] the Committee Member did you
[1906.1s] know that there are people when the
[1909.5s] nomination report is brought they don't
[1911.6s] sleep some get
[1913.6s] sick I am praying today that no one gets
[1917.2s] sick because the report receive it and
[1920.2s] accept it because the Lord is the master
[1923.3s] of his church he knows who you want to
[1926.3s] serve he knows who you want to place
[1928.6s] well and if youve been serving at this
[1930.9s] time you're not serving thank the Lord
[1933.2s] sit and minister to your soul maybe let
[1935.8s] me let me say this friends it is it is
[1938.2s] good at time for you to value your soul
[1940.9s] and
[1941.8s] Eternity at times you need to retreat
[1944.8s] back and feel the Lord speaking and and
[1948.0s] nuring you and re energizing you for you
[1950.0s] to come back again and serve don't
[1952.4s] continue serving in one Department from
[1957.3s] 1902 to 2004 the same Department the
[1960.6s] same department and any nominated Comm
[1963.0s] attempt to move you a little bit this
[1964.8s] way they'll be in a hot
[1967.2s] soup no no Jesus said that is the
[1972.5s] worldly view but for you it ought not to
[1976.2s] be so can somebody say Amen
[1978.6s] look at the person next to you tell him
[1980.0s] or her sister brother it ought not be so
[1982.3s] with
[1985.8s] us not be
[1988.7s] so but he says but but but but but but
[1991.8s] but but but
[1993.8s] if granted you desire to
[1998.0s] serve then accept and agree to become a
[2002.0s] slave let me see how many of us today
[2005.2s] are so desire us to become slaves
[2012.1s] to
[2015.6s] prit do you even understand why he means
[2018.2s] to become a
[2019.3s] slave look at the life of Jesus in fact
[2022.7s] Isaiah tells us he was
[2025.1s] dragged to the Cross like a sheep are
[2029.2s] you with me he was beat down everything
[2032.5s] and all he could say is Lord my father
[2035.0s] forgive them for they do not know what
[2036.9s] they are doing he was a slave of us we
[2041.4s] did everything we could do to him but he
[2044.6s] bore all that just because of
[2048.0s] service are you
[2051.7s] willing I
[2054.2s] pray that we may have the Jesus
[2058.6s] effect in naobi Central
[2061.2s] Church I pray that we may have Jesus
[2064.8s] effect in our church today
[2068.5s] that we will value the soul more than
[2072.0s] the
[2072.9s] position we will value service more than
[2077.2s] the rank we will say Jesus if this is
[2080.6s] where you pleas me to serve you I will
[2083.1s] serve you with all my heart with all my
[2086.4s] mind and with all my
[2089.4s] soul how many of us today say Jesus
[2098.6s] doesn't matter where you place
[2100.7s] me and by the
[2103.6s] way let me tell
[2106.3s] us the our church is
[2109.2s] large and the entire leadership that we
[2113.0s] put place is about 57
[2117.5s] something now to some people that is Ah
[2119.8s] that's a very large number but how many
[2122.1s] Are
[2122.9s] we more than that so it simply tells you
[2126.4s] not everyone
[2128.6s] has been
[2130.6s] nominated it's as simple as that not
[2133.9s] everyone I mean you start expecting now
[2136.6s] you may not be in that
[2138.2s] list and make peace with that reality
[2140.9s] because there is no way we can all Feit
[2144.8s] in the few slot the church has for
[2148.1s] leadership so some of us will be serving
[2151.4s] from the benches supporting the leaders
[2154.3s] because even those who are holding the
[2156.3s] hands of the man of God we as important
[2159.1s] as the man of God can somebody say
[2161.1s] Amen we are one
[2163.3s] body and we cannot afford to entertain
[2167.3s] the evil one distracting us on the
[2169.6s] issues of authority and the ranks and
[2172.0s] The Possession we are building the body
[2174.7s] of Christ and the mission of wiing
[2176.6s] source is our agenda and we shall join
[2179.4s] together no matter where I am placed to
[2182.0s] serve the Lord because you know the time
[2184.0s] is very
[2185.1s] short I invite you
[2191.5s] prayerfully to
[2193.3s] consider the Jesus effect the Lord bless
[2196.9s] us
