FULL TRANSCRIPT:
A very happy Sabbath to all of us. The go uh the Lord is good. I know there is a cloud of sadness over the church, but we thank God that we have a sanctuary where we can return for divine consolation and comfort. And this morning I want to welcome you to a message uh the Christian life. The Christian life. Let me pray with you as we read the word of God. Father in Jesus name, we are thankful for your word. We pray of this day Lord when we are cognizant of the cloud of sadness over this church that your word will give us comfort, give us hope, and give us meaning for the life that you've given to us. Bless us who are here. Bless those who are listening and watching from far and allow your word Lord to revive us again to rejoice and again rejoice in Jesus name we pray. Amen. I want to thank my sister Caro for reading out the word of God. But I want you to open your book the Bible to second Timothy chapter 4 verse 7 to 8. 2 Timothy chapter 4 verse 7 to8. I'll be reading from the NIV version and I pray that you read your word in the version that you carried along. 2 Timothy chapter 4 verse 7 to8. And this is what NIV says. I have fought the good fight. I have finished the race. I have kept the faith. Now there is in store for me the crown of righteousness which the Lord, the righteous judge, will award to me on that day. and not only to me but also to all who have longed for his appearing. Now we live in a time when our Christian life seems to be defined by utopia. Meaning if you are a Christian, things should work out well for you. Anyway, we as preachers have made many of us believe that the Christian life is a utopia. Everything is good. It is certainly true that the Christian life may be mystical, may be spiritual, may be uh extraordinary in certain instances of divine encounters of spiritual gifts that are given to people. A Christian life is one of divine promises of a heaven that we all one day will truly go to. But children of God, as much as all this is true and is powerful, but the Christian life captures a very practical and redemptive experience in this life. God has called us, all of us, to respond to distress and brokenness and the destruction caused by sin by living out a Christian life. A Christian life is not an escapism from reality. A friend of mine was in in in China preaching and when he spoke about the good news of Jesus Christ, he was told that is good news for Africans because that is a place where people have problems. So it's better people go and be told about a heaven to win because that is a way they could escape the reality and the pains that are in life. But children of God, Christian life is not an escapism from reality. It's an engagement through healing power of God's grace to encounter the crisis, to encounter the pain and the destruction that this life brings to us. Through Christ Jesus, the believer is not only forgiven of his sins, but also empowered by God's grace to be able to live to restore the true image of life as a human being, knowing that Jesus came to live as a human being. If this life was anything that God did not desire of us to live, Jesus could not have come to live as you live. The Bible says in the book of Hebrews that he lived as we live except only for sin. And therefore, children of God, Christian life is not an escape from reality, but it is a call to live differently. It's a call to live in holiness, to live in hopefulness, to live redemptively as we move into the purposes of God. It is true that there are moments in life when all the noise seems to be silent. When all the singing seems to have gone off. It's true that the reality of death at times deems everything that is spicy and good for this life. When death comes around, there are moments when some of us regret. When some of us are fearful and some of us feel cheated. One sister recently called me after a certain death of a relative and told me, "Pastor, why did God have to create me to suffer all that I am suffering?" And I could not answer that question. But as I was thinking through this, we all at times get to this moment of despondence, disappointment of the life we are living in because we wonder if I have believed in God, why are bad things happening to me? Children of God, this morning I'm here to invite you to a journey to let you know that our life in Christ is not intended to be a passive life. It is a calling for being purposeful and actively engaged with the reality of a broken world. God has no template and God has no witness that you and me except you and me that can testify that in this broken world, in this messy life, we can still make meaning out of it. Praise the Lord. It is only you who has the testimony of Jesus Christ that can make people believe in God as we live out still a normal life in spite of the crisis, in spite of the pain, and in spite of all the unfortunate things that happen. Now, the Apostle Paul has the eminence of death before him. He's so sure that he's about to die as he pans down this particular life. He writes, "I have fought a good fight." In fact, in the original, in order to let the reader know that the emphasis is not even about the fight, it is written that the fight. In fact, it writes, "The good fight I have fought, the race I have run, the faith I have kept." In the sense that the author is trying to say what I am emphasizing is that there is a fight. You know at times when I am counseling with couples that are getting married I tell them that when we get into marriage it's not about how we are not going to fight but how are we going to manage the fights that are eminent in a marriage. It's the same thing with our Christian life. Paul seems to say that the fight is obvious that in this life you will fight. The race is set before you and the faith is entrusted to you. And therefore, children of God, this few moments of this morning, I want us to look at how Paul describes the Christian life. Paul seems to set out three things that I want us to reflect on on what is Christian life. You know at times unless you know what you are leaving out everything's everything looks like it doesn't have a meaning. If you don't know what you are engaged in it becomes more frustrating and disappointing. But when you understand what you are engaged in I want to believe there is meaning in it. And a Christian life is as such. Paul gives us three things about a Christian life that I want to consider with us. Number one, Paul tells us that the Christian life is a warfare. A Christian life is a warfare. In fact, in its original, he uses the world, it's an agon. It is an agonizing life. I have agonized. Paul says, a Christian life is a welfare in the sense that each one is invited to run a race. And finally, a Christian life is watchfulness, warfare, welfare, and watchfulness. Paul is not writing as I am in a pullpit with all comfort. Paul is in a dungeon ready to die. But it is in that moment he says in verse six, I am ready to be poured out as a drink offering. And he says that my time now he doesn't say that the calendar date of my time has come but he says my season of departure is at hand. Meaning Paul understands that God has set out this is an opportune time. Paul uses the word time in the sense not in chronology of date and months but he uses the word time in the sense of an opportune time that this is my set time. Paul understands one thing children of God that our lives are in the palm of God that God has predetermined your time and God has predetermined your place of existence. Acts chapter 17 verse 26 and 27 that God has determined your time. When your time come, Paul says it's an opportune time. It is a set time and he says my time of departure has come. It is in this place not of comfort but out of conviction that Paul says to Timothy, I have fought a good fight. I am a soldier. I am an athlete. But above all, I am a custodian of some precious treasure. Paul children of God is not saying these words because he's going to die. But he understand that at any time we are living on two set times. Either we are living on the brink of eternity that is the escatum meaning when all things will come to an end it's given or at a particular time we are living at the eminence of your death David would say as he was pursued by Saul that my my my death is only a step away from me I only have to make one step and I am dead the eminence of our dead But but Paul is not discouraged children of God. Paul is aware that God who has called him is orchestring everything in order that ultimately his life and history will be for God's glory. This morning, child of God, what if we could live our lives with such urgency and clarity? What of if this morning we could approach our lives in the sense of an agony or in the sense of warfare so that you are not frustrated in what you're going through because you understand that this is what defines your life. Nobody has bewitched you. You're just living the normal life. The normal life entails battlefield. It's not a playground. Your life is a battlefield. If at all you are not engaged in any combat at this time. It's just a matter of time before you get into a combat probably of a loss of a loved one, of a divorce or of being sucked from job. Life is a combat and we Christians are called to understand it better so that we don't fall in despondence. The enemy knows that if you are ignorant of that, then you are likely to be discouraged. And if you're discouraged, it's easy for you to be deceived. And when you're deceived, you die. That's the strategy strategy of the enemy. So our revelation and wisdom of God as a Christian is that we may not live in fear. As Christian we may live with an understanding that wherever we are we are in the right place. Hallelujah. Children of God wherever you are you are in the determined place that God has set you to be. And all that he needs is to have the testimony of Paul. I am fighting a good fight. I am running the good race and I am keeping faith to what God has entrusted with me. So children of God, let's look at these three points as we move forward. A fight of faithful engagement and a race that is fully run and a faith that must be kept. A Christian life is a warfare. I have fought a good fight. Paul says a statement that I want you to take is this. The Christian life is a battleground and not a playground. It demands spiritual courage, relentless perseverance and faithfulness to the commander in chief Jesus Christ. Paul uses the imagery of a soldier because he understands that you are daily in a warfare child of God. Our primary engagement in margin is not an offense. That is a beauty children of God that our call in this engagement is not to be on the offense but on the defense to occupy where you have been stationed until he comes. Hallelujah. You know there is a difference of engagement. We are not called to go out to off in offense but to defend to defend. The book of Ephesians 6 Paul says stand. You know the problem that at times brings so much despondence to the Christian is we think God has called us to go out into the battlefield in offensiveness. God is calling you into defense to protect to occupy the place you have been given. And therefore Paul says that you are well equipped as a warfare child of God. God is saying that the battle is real. The battle is real. We don't have time to look at these scriptures but 2 Corinthians chapter 5 chapter 10:5 says our engagement is of imaginations of thoughts that is our engagement children of God bringing our thoughts to the obedience of the word of God I want you to imagine what is stressing you now so much it's the train of thought that is running in your mind Paul is saying casting ing down arguments and every high thing that exalts itself against the knowledge of God and bringing every thought into captivity. Our main problem is the train of thought. Our warfare, Sister White attests to this that our warfare is the battle of the mind and the enemy understands that so well. So child of God, we wrestle not against flesh and blood, but we wrestle against principality. The warfare that we are engaged in is a warfare of principles and principalities. This is the warfare that every one of us is engaged in. What are we engaged against? One, we are engaged against the world system. Paul says in Romans 12 that therefore I beseech you, brethren, that you may not be confformed, that it means you may not be conformed to the principles and the the the powers that are in the world, but be transformed in your mind. Meaning you are in the war zone of a world system that is seeking to orient you in a certain way of thinking. The second place of our warf frontont is the flesh. Is the flesh the desires of my body the pride of this life. The status that I want to keep and also the desires of what I see. Children of God, this is where the battle is being waged. Not only in your mind, but in your feelings, in the things you see, in the status you desire that you may occupy. And finally, children of God, the warfare is against the devil. Satan himself is a powerful, relentless enemy that keeps deceiving and tempting. Peter says in 1 Peter 5:8 that the devil like a lion is roaring that he may defile someone somewhere. But children of God, the good news of God is in this battle God has not left us to ourselves. In the book of Ephesians chapter 6:14, Paul says that put on the full armor of God in all these battle fronts. God has equipped you enough to encounter them. He has equipped you with the truth that is supposed to guard yourself to keep you from deception to keep you from being disoriented from the wisdom and revelation that God gives you every day. The Lord has equipped you with righteousness as a breastplate that protects your heart. The enemy understands that your most vulnerable place is discouragement. Yeah, he understands. And therefore, God has equipped you with the righteousness of Jesus. God knows that you always feel unworthy. That is where the fall is. That's where we fail. Always feeling unworthy. You always feel that you don't matter. You are not one who counts among many. And that's where the righteousness of Jesus covers you. When you don't feel like you're worthy, when you don't feel like you count among many, then Jesus covers you with his righteousness. Hallelujah. He makes you feel that you are countable. You are worthy. People of God, at times when we speak about righteousness, we make it so religious. We make it so moral that sometimes it lacks its practicality. Righteousness is right doing for real. But righteousness is intended to appease your guilt so that you can always walk in peace. That's why Romans chapter 5 verse one Paul says, "Therefore now, having been justified by faith, we have peace with God." Who doesn't love peace? All the pursuits of life today, children of God, we are pursuing every other thing because we seek peace. Unfortunately, the things we seek to find peace don't give us peace. It's only the righteousness of Jesus that renders us peace. Hallelujah. So the battlefield, God is equipped you with righteousness that may give you peace. And he's given you the gospel of peace in Jesus Christ. And above all, he's given you the faith as a shield to extinguish the flaming arrows of doubt, doubt, and temptation. Faith is the shield against your doubtful life. We all live in doubt. In fact, the Greek philosophers believe that the more you doubt, the more wiser you are. But we know that that is a fallacy. It's not the more you doubt, the more wise you are. Is the more you believe that the more wise you are. Hallelujah. Faith is our victory. And in your mind, child of God, when your mind is bombarding you with every kind of thought that seems to be oppressing and suppressing you, the Bible says God has given you a helmet of salvation. The sword of the helmet of salvation to guard your mind with assurance. I love what Sister White says in the book Great Controversy, the latter pages, I think it's 500. She says this, "Unless we fortify our minds with the truth of his word, we will not overcome the crisis that are ahead of us." Unless you fortify, meaning you h your mind with the word of God, the crisis ahead are going to break your heart. Jesus says that the hearts of many will faint because of the troubles that are ahead of us. So children of God, Jesus leaves us not without weapons. He says that let's take the sword of the spirit, the only offensive weapon that we are given. And he says lastly, the engagement of this war, the engagement of this war is persistent prayer. Hallelujah. Persistent prayer. Child of God, don't wait for crisis to pray. You will not pray. Pray. Make it a custom of life that you pray even when it doesn't mean sense. Prayer is not about what we get from God. Prayer is about communion with God. Learning to be there even when he's not making your ATM drop some coins. It's just that you have the joy. Let it be with you. As David says, one day in the house of the Lord is more than a thousand days in the house of the princes. Children of God. Paul says it's a good fight. It's a fight that is intense. It's a fight that is distressing. But Paul says it's a good fight. Why is it a good fight? It's a good fight, people of God. Because God has ordained it for you. Hallelujah. It's a good fight because God has ordained it for you. You know people of God, if God could carry us to heaven the way we are, we ourselves will not love heaven. You will not enjoy being in heaven. Just imagine the ills that we experience now and then we transport them to heaven. So God in his own wisdom has purposed us to engage in this fight that we may dispose off of all the ills so that when we get into heaven we have fought a good fight that has disposed off every ill that this world has imprinted on our lives. Hallelujah. It has to come. It has to come child of God that God enables you or allows you to engage in a good fight to an extent that you say I am tired of this life. I don't enjoy anything in this life. God desires that in this good fight, he brings you to a place where you can say with Paul, I am ready now to be poured out as a drink offering. I am ready now to be poured out. I am ready to depart. I'm ready to tell somebody somewhere, excuse me, can I go? Hallelujah. Excuse me, can I go? You know when you are leaving friends that you have been engaged with, what do we normally tell them? Excuse me, I have to leave. I am I decide that when my time of death comes I can tell brothers I can tell my wife I can tell my children excuse me can I go because I have lived it out. I think God I owe him nothing. I have come to a place where I say excuse me brothers please let me go and you my wife my children my members you can say yeah farewell good soldier farewell because I have understood that I have fought a good fight it is a good fight because it's a righteous cause for the kingdom of God it's a good fight people of God it's a good fight because we said it's a defensive fight. It's a good fight because you are not on the fence. You're not fighting to occupy, but you're fighting so that you can keep what already you have won. Hallelujah. In Jesus Christ, it's a good fight because you're not fighting to exploit, but you're fighting to keep what you already have earned in Jesus Christ. Hallelujah. Praise the Lord. The second point children of God is that this Christian life is a welfare. Paul says, "I have finished the race. I have finished the race." A statement that I make on this is that while the Christian life is filled with warfare, but the good news here is it is sustained by the grace of God and strengthened to finish the race that God has set before us. Now Paul uses an imagery of an athlete. He says, "I have run the race. Paul wants to remind us children of God that your life as a Christian is not a sprint but it's a marathon." They're two different things. A sprinter focuses on speed, but one who runs marathon focuses on endurance and perseverance. The frustration we have with life is because we always have a mental set of a sprinter. I want to do this. I want to finish my career. I want to build this. It's a sprinter. Children of God, God wants us to have a mentality of an athlete that is running a marathon rather than a 100meter dash. This race, Paul says he has finished. As he draws from Hebrews 12, he has finished. Because in Hebrews 12, Paul says, "Therefore having this cloud of witnesses, Paul is saying, I am not running this race on my own." There's a cloud of witnesses. Uh we don't have time to consider Hebrews 11 to see those who have run the race before. And the Bible says in Hebrews 11:39 that God has not granted to them the crown because he wants us all to be there together. Hallelujah. And Paul says that I have run the race and I finished the race because the race I don't know how to say it better but I hope somebody will catch it. This race it is empowered by grace as the winds and our arms. Hallelujah. We have an advantage of the grace of God. Paul says I have finished the race. The finishing here, Paul says, is not that I am finished, but I have completed in faithfulness. Two things that I want you to capture there, people of God. Paul's finished the race. It could be because he says the race figuratively is that Paul has identified the purpose for his life. The purpose for his life. He has known why am I here? Why am I here? One of the frustrations of life is when we don't know why we are here. We are scavenging for everything to make meaning in our lives. But Paul is saying, I have finished the race because he has identified that he has been called by God to be an apostle to the Gentiles. And since he has fulfilled that purpose of God, now he says, "I have finished my race." The thing that is frustrating your life, the things that is causing you to be disappointed and discouraged of your life is because you are a jack of all trade. You think that you set out to do everything. Child of God, God has crafted you out for a special mission in this world. It may not be the mission of prestige and status, but that is what God has called you. You know sometimes when I am walking in life and I am just lowering my head like this and I look down and I see the small ants and I ask myself, God, what did you intend for these ants to accomplish in life? Then I remember God set out these ants to decompose things that could bring harm to me. Hallelujah. that these ants that look nothing that at times they step on and consciously God has set them also with a purpose. Now I want to imagine that your your life may just be like an ant. But because you live in comparison with your neighbor, you always imagine that your life is a junk. Your life is an accident. I come to tell you like Paul is saying, I have finished my race. For I have known why I am here and I have accomplished what God has called me to do. So let me depart. Let me go. I have done what God wanted me to do. And that is the satisfaction. I'm reminded of Simeon. When Jesus is born and brought to the temple, Simeon would say this. Oh, now your servant has seen the salvation of the Lord. Let your servant now depart in peace. Simeon understood that all his life was to come to a point to see Jesus. And when he saw Jesus, he said, "Now let me go. I have I've done it all." children of God. It's it it it is it it may be very mundane. You could you just be a gatekeeper. You could be just a watchman. Whatever you know all these categories that we have the world has set us in that somehow have disoriented us that we feel as if we are nothing. God has just set you out for that. Have you not heard a story? I think I've told it here one day of one of my lure brothers who went back home and he was crossing I think he was going uh to Mashima's place TJ and he was crossing the lake I think you've heard the story and he was with this man in the canoe and he was telling the man whether he has studied materology whether he has studied geology or marine life and the poor man in the boat didn't know anything about the geology or geology or marine life. The poor man says, "Me, I don't know anything." And the learned man from Nairobi told the poor man in the canoe, "You are the most foolish thing. How can you engage in such a trade and you don't understand the weather, you don't understand the marine life?" The man said, "Me, I don't know." But as they went on in the boat, it is said that the wind started blowing and the poor man in the boat said, "Do you know how to swim?" And the learned guy from Nairobi said, "I don't know how to swim." And the fisherman told him, "You are not only foolish, you're going to die." At times all the learnedness we have in the city, when we go home, we find ourselves unable to cope up. But yet still in that very humble life, somebody's finishing that which God has assigned him to do. And that is where the peace of life is. What Paul is telling us in the race that the Christian life is a race that we need endure a race. We need to run. We need to finish that which God has set out for you to do. Remaining faithful until you finish. It's a race that you need to run according to the rules. That is what Paul says in 1 Corinthians chapter 9 verse 24. Each one of us is called to run within. Don't run in somebody's lane. That's where your frustration is. You are not finishing because you're running somebody's else race. Run your race, child of God. It's not easy, but run your race. Paul says, "Lay aside the weights." The weights. The weights, children of God. In the book of Hebrews 12, when Paul says, "Lay aside the the weights," what he means is there are good things in life. Good things. Good things. It could be a husband, it could be a wife, it could be your job, it could be a profession that is hampering you to finish well because it's become a weight. Child of God, Paul distinguishes two things in Hebrews 12 in running this race. He says, "Let's set aside every weight and every sin." Yes, there is sin that besets us from running, but also there is weight. I'm more concerned about the weight for us who are in church because the weight is the good things, the blessings that God gives to you. And once he gives them to you, they become a burden. [Applause] So child of God, run the lay aside the weight. What are the blessing? Children of God, these blessings are hampering you. Yeah. You know, some of us were barren. We didn't have babies. Immediately the baby came, we started overshadowing the baby that now we don't even come for Sabbath school. We come for divine service. Some of you children of God have been exalted. You are maybe a clock but now you are the director of a farm and now because you are a director you cannot come the directorship has become your weight ah some of you people of God have been exalted like Daniel to be statesmen of the country and that statesmanship has now become the weight that is weighing you down you are missing in action Paul is saying, "I have finished my race. I have run the race." Meaning Paul says, "I have endured what is is there." The good news, child of God, that in his race, God has made a provision for you. He is he's strengthening you. His eyes are on you. You know children of God, the Bible says that the angels the worlds that are unfallen are are we are like in a stadium running and the worlds that are fallen and the angels are all focusing on us. We are a spectacle of the things that are defined. I don't know how you want to run your race, but as we bring this message to an end, God is saying remain faithful within the race that God calls you. And finally, children of God, Paul is not only saying that a good fight I have fought. Paul is not saying the race I have run, but Paul is saying the faith I have kept. Meaning our life is not only a life of a soldier. Our life is not only a life of an athlete but our life is a life of a watcher. I couldn't get the best way to capture the thought of Paul but in every sense it could come in thinking of it as a watcher as a custodian as a gatekeeper to the to to the treasures of a kingdom. Paul says, "I have kept the faith." I have kept the faith. Paul says that the Christian life is lived watchfully under the eye of the righteous judge. Watchfully over what has been entrusted to us. The faith, the faith, Jude says, the faith once delivered to the saints is what we have. We are custodian people of God. Paul says in Romans chapter 3, is there anything worthy? Is there anything important for somebody being a Jew? And he says in every manner there is significance of being a Jew because to us or to the Jew God has in entrusted the oracles. Children of God, is there any significance of being a Christian? Is there any any any significance? You know, we live in a life, we live in a world where people trivialize being a Christian. You know, is there any benefit of you being a Christian? This is what Paul says. Hallelujah. That you and me are custodian of the treasures of the kingdom of God. That's what Paul says. That's why he uses the word kept. Kept here is Paul is saying, "I've kept my eye. I've kept my eye on something." so precious. I've kept my watch. The idea is of protecting and guarding. You know the expressions that I've kept. I didn't want to engage in some things here that are very profound. But Paul is not saying that I I have just I have just kept it now when it's entrusted me. Paul is acknowledging of the privilege of becoming a custodian because he says the keeping has not started with me. The keeping started long time ago, but the results of the keeping are continuing with me. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. I don't know whether somebody had that. Paul is understanding the privilege. The way he phrases himself, he says this this this entrustment is not with me. I'm part of the custodians of the faith. I have kept the faith children of God. And the conceivable thing about this expression is about guarding and preserving, treasuring and keeping that which is for forever. So keeping keeping child of God is that to remind us of God's watchfulness over you as you yourself become watchful on what he has entrusted in you. Keeping child of God is in a sense telling you that the message God has entrusted with you, it is for you to preserve until the time of the end. And Paul gives the greatest motivation, child of God. In all these, Paul gives you the greatest motivation. He says, having fought a good fight and having run the race according to the rules and having been a good custodian, he says this, "A crown is set up for me." Hallelujah. Now, now the Bible distinguishes crowns. Paul is not speaking about the kingly crown here because the kingly crown the word is diadem. But here the word is stephanos. Stefanos is a is is is a crown for the victor. The crown that is given for one who is the victor. Meaning it's a crown for all of us. The crown of righteousness is for everyone who overcomes. So Paul's motivation here is the stephanos. The crown the reward now listen to this encourage yourself of this. The reward here is not for the perfect as much as that is necessary. But the crown is for those who love his appearing. The ultimate act of it all is that the crown is for the faithful, the faithful soldier, the faithful athlete and the faithful custodian. Those are the ones the crown has been set up as Paul says and those who love is appearing. I don't know about you but I love the appearing appearing. So Paul says my life is poured out. My life is poured out. Child of God, let's finish this in the next one minute. What Paul is saying as a Christian, acknowledge life as a battle, but claim your victory in Jesus Christ. Paul is saying this life, don't pity yourself. Paul is saying endure and persevere because it's a race that we are in. Yeah, it's a marathon. Endure. And finally, Paul is saying, keep the faith because that is the ground. That is your stability. And Paul says, "Look up for Jesus has prepared a crown of righteousness for you. A crown for every victor." This morning, child of God, I don't know where your heart is weary. If your heart is weary, Christ says, "I understand. But a good fight you fight, for the victor is already won." Jesus is saying, "Are you struggling to finish the race? You are a workmanship. You are a specimen of his work. He wants to display you before the world because you have run a good race. I want to invite you child of God. Leave your life today as a Christian with the end in mind. Good fight, fight. Good race, run and finish. Ultimately, child of God, be a good watchman. Be a good watcher. For the one who was promised will appear with your crown of righteousness in Jesus name. God bless you.

[43.8s] when we are cognizant of the cloud of
[46.2s] sadness over this church that your word
[49.8s] will give us comfort, give us hope, and
[52.8s] give us meaning for the life that you've
[55.3s] given to us. Bless us who are here.
[58.5s] Bless those who are listening and
[60.8s] watching from far and allow your word
[63.8s] Lord to revive us again to rejoice
[67.4s] and again rejoice
[69.8s] in Jesus name we pray. Amen. I want to
[73.7s] thank my sister Caro for reading out the
[75.8s] word of God. But I want you to open your
[78.3s] book the Bible to second Timothy chapter
[83.2s] 4 verse 7 to 8.
[87.8s] 2 Timothy chapter 4 verse 7 to8.
[93.4s] I'll be reading from the NIV
[96.2s] version and I pray that you read your
[98.4s] word in the version that you carried
[101.0s] along.
[102.9s] 2 Timothy chapter 4 verse 7 to8.
[110.2s] And this is what NIV says.
[114.0s] I have fought the good fight.
[118.2s] I have finished the race. I have kept
[123.2s] the faith. Now there is in store for me
[127.0s] the crown of righteousness which the
[130.6s] Lord, the righteous judge, will award to
[134.6s] me on that day. and not only to me but
[139.7s] also to all who have longed
[143.6s] for his
[145.4s] appearing.
[147.8s] Now we live in a time when our Christian
[150.7s] life seems to be defined by utopia.
[155.5s] Meaning if you are a Christian, things
[158.0s] should work out well for you. Anyway, we
[161.6s] as preachers have made many of us
[164.6s] believe that the Christian life is a
[169.4s] utopia. Everything is good.
[172.9s] It is certainly true that the Christian
[175.3s] life may be mystical, may be spiritual,
[181.3s] may be uh extraordinary in certain
[184.9s] instances of divine encounters of
[188.2s] spiritual gifts that are given to
[190.0s] people. A Christian life is one of
[193.3s] divine promises of a heaven that we all
[197.0s] one day will truly go to. But children
[200.2s] of God, as much as all this is true and
[203.8s] is powerful, but the Christian life
[207.2s] captures a very practical and redemptive
[211.8s] experience in this life. God has called
[215.4s] us, all of us, to respond to distress
[219.2s] and brokenness and the destruction
[221.8s] caused by sin by living out a Christian
[226.1s] life. A Christian life is not an
[229.0s] escapism from reality. A friend of mine
[232.7s] was in in in China preaching and when he
[236.0s] spoke about the good news of Jesus
[238.3s] Christ, he was told that is good news
[241.1s] for Africans because that is a place
[243.4s] where people have problems. So it's
[245.4s] better people go and be told about a
[248.7s] heaven to win because that is a way they
[251.8s] could escape the reality and the pains
[254.4s] that are in life. But children of God,
[257.9s] Christian life is not an escapism from
[260.7s] reality.
[262.2s] It's an engagement through healing power
[265.5s] of God's grace to encounter the crisis,
[269.8s] to encounter the pain and the
[272.1s] destruction that this life brings to us.
[275.5s] Through Christ Jesus, the believer is
[279.0s] not only forgiven of his sins, but also
[283.3s] empowered by God's grace to be able to
[287.0s] live to restore the true image of life
[292.1s] as a human being, knowing that Jesus
[294.9s] came to live as a human being. If this
[298.1s] life was anything that God did not
[301.4s] desire of us to live, Jesus could not
[304.2s] have come to live as you live. The Bible
[306.8s] says in the book of Hebrews that he
[309.4s] lived as we live except only for sin.
[313.8s] And therefore, children of God,
[315.8s] Christian life is not an escape from
[319.0s] reality, but it is a call to live
[322.7s] differently. It's a call to live in
[325.5s] holiness, to live in hopefulness, to
[328.8s] live redemptively
[330.9s] as we move into the purposes of God.
[335.4s] It is true that there are moments in
[337.2s] life when all the noise seems to be
[341.4s] silent. When all the singing seems to
[345.4s] have gone off. It's true that the
[348.5s] reality of death at times deems
[352.6s] everything that is spicy and good for
[355.7s] this life. When death comes around,
[358.2s] there are moments when some of us
[360.6s] regret. When some of us are fearful and
[365.2s] some of us feel cheated.
[368.2s] One sister recently called me after a
[370.6s] certain death of a relative and told me,
[373.6s] "Pastor, why did God have to create me
[377.1s] to suffer all that I am suffering?" And
[380.4s] I could not answer that question. But as
[382.6s] I was thinking through this, we all at
[385.4s] times get to this moment of despondence,
[389.0s] disappointment of the life we are living
[391.7s] in because we wonder if I have believed
[394.6s] in God, why are bad things happening to
[398.1s] me? Children of God, this morning I'm
[401.0s] here to invite you to a journey to let
[403.7s] you know that our life in Christ is not
[407.4s] intended to be a passive life. It is a
[410.8s] calling for being purposeful and
[413.9s] actively engaged with the reality of a
[418.6s] broken world. God has no template and
[422.8s] God has no witness that you and me
[427.4s] except you and me that can testify that
[430.6s] in this broken world, in this messy
[434.5s] life, we can still make meaning out of
[438.6s] it. Praise the Lord. It is only you who
[442.0s] has the testimony of Jesus Christ that
[445.0s] can make people believe in God as we
[447.9s] live out still a normal life in spite of
[453.0s] the crisis, in spite of the pain, and in
[457.4s] spite of all the unfortunate things that
[460.6s] happen. Now, the Apostle Paul has the
[464.8s] eminence of death before him. He's so
[468.4s] sure that he's about to die as he pans
[471.8s] down this particular life. He writes, "I
[475.6s] have fought a good fight." In fact, in
[478.2s] the original, in order to let the reader
[481.4s] know that the emphasis is not even about
[484.8s] the fight, it is written that the fight.
[490.5s] In fact, it writes, "The good fight I
[493.0s] have fought, the race I have run, the
[497.5s] faith I have kept." In the sense that
[500.9s] the author is trying to say what I am
[503.7s] emphasizing is that there is a fight.
[507.6s] You know at times when I am counseling
[510.0s] with couples that are getting married I
[512.4s] tell them that when we get into marriage
[515.0s] it's not about how we are not going to
[518.0s] fight but how are we going to manage the
[521.0s] fights that are eminent in a marriage.
[524.6s] It's the same thing with our Christian
[526.3s] life. Paul seems to say that the fight
[530.0s] is obvious that in this life you will
[534.1s] fight. The race is set before you and
[538.7s] the faith is entrusted to you. And
[543.1s] therefore, children of God, this few
[545.4s] moments of this morning, I want us to
[548.3s] look at how Paul describes the Christian
[551.6s] life. Paul seems to set out three things
[555.0s] that I want us to reflect on on what is
[558.3s] Christian life. You know at times unless
[561.1s] you know what you are leaving out
[563.8s] everything's everything looks like it
[567.3s] doesn't have a meaning. If you don't
[569.4s] know what you are engaged in it becomes
[572.2s] more frustrating and disappointing. But
[574.7s] when you understand what you are engaged
[577.4s] in I want to believe there is meaning in
[580.1s] it. And a Christian life is as such.
[583.3s] Paul gives us three things about a
[585.7s] Christian life that I want to consider
[587.5s] with us. Number one, Paul tells us that
[590.2s] the Christian life is a warfare. A
[593.4s] Christian life is a warfare. In fact, in
[597.0s] its original, he uses the world, it's an
[599.8s] agon. It is an agonizing life. I have
[603.9s] agonized. Paul says, a Christian life is
[607.0s] a welfare in the sense that each one is
[610.9s] invited to run a race. And finally, a
[615.4s] Christian life is watchfulness,
[619.2s] warfare,
[620.7s] welfare, and watchfulness.
[624.6s] Paul is not writing as I am in a pullpit
[628.8s] with all comfort. Paul is in a dungeon
[632.2s] ready to die. But it is in that moment
[635.3s] he says in verse six, I am ready to be
[639.5s] poured out as a drink offering. And he
[643.0s] says that my time now he doesn't say
[647.8s] that the calendar date of my time has
[651.3s] come but he says my season of departure
[655.0s] is at hand. Meaning Paul understands
[657.5s] that God has set out this is an
[660.2s] opportune time. Paul uses the word time
[663.0s] in the sense not in chronology of date
[666.1s] and months but he uses the word time in
[669.1s] the sense of an opportune time that this
[673.0s] is my set time. Paul understands one
[676.4s] thing children of God that our lives are
[679.4s] in the palm of God that God has
[682.6s] predetermined your time and God has
[685.4s] predetermined your place of existence.
[688.5s] Acts chapter 17 verse 26 and 27 that God
[692.8s] has determined your time. When your time
[695.5s] come, Paul says it's an opportune time.
[698.8s] It is a set time and he says my time of
[702.2s] departure has come. It is in this place
[705.7s] not of comfort but out of conviction
[709.4s] that Paul says to Timothy, I have fought
[712.7s] a good fight. I am a soldier. I am an
[716.1s] athlete. But above all, I am a custodian
[720.4s] of some precious
[723.0s] treasure.
[725.5s] Paul children of God
[728.7s] is not saying these words because he's
[730.7s] going to die. But he understand that at
[735.2s] any time we are living on two set times.
[740.4s] Either we are living on the brink of
[743.4s] eternity that is the escatum meaning
[746.6s] when all things will come to an end it's
[749.4s] given or at a particular time we are
[752.7s] living at the eminence of your death
[756.8s] David would say as he was pursued by
[759.3s] Saul that my my my death is only a step
[763.0s] away from me I only have to make one
[765.6s] step and I am dead the eminence of our
[769.5s] dead But but Paul is not discouraged
[772.3s] children of God. Paul is aware that God
[776.2s] who has called him is
[779.3s] orchestring everything
[782.2s] in order that ultimately his life and
[786.2s] history will be for God's glory.
[790.5s] This morning, child of God, what if we
[794.2s] could live our lives with such urgency
[797.4s] and clarity? What of if this morning we
[801.2s] could approach our lives in the sense of
[805.6s] an agony or in the sense of warfare so
[810.2s] that you are not frustrated in what
[812.6s] you're going through because you
[814.6s] understand that this is what defines
[817.0s] your life. Nobody has bewitched you.
[820.4s] You're just living the normal life. The
[822.9s] normal life entails
[825.5s] battlefield. It's not a playground. Your
[829.6s] life is a battlefield. If at all you are
[832.6s] not engaged in any combat at this time.
[836.6s] It's just a matter of time before you
[839.0s] get into a combat probably of a loss of
[841.7s] a loved one, of a divorce or of being
[845.1s] sucked from job. Life is a combat and we
[850.0s] Christians are called to understand it
[852.4s] better so that we don't fall in
[854.9s] despondence. The enemy knows that if you
[857.8s] are ignorant of that, then you are
[860.0s] likely to be discouraged. And if you're
[862.7s] discouraged, it's easy for you to be
[865.3s] deceived. And when you're deceived, you
[867.8s] die. That's the strategy strategy of the
[870.9s] enemy. So our revelation and wisdom of
[874.6s] God as a Christian is that we may not
[877.2s] live in fear. As Christian we may live
[880.2s] with an understanding that wherever we
[882.7s] are we are in the right place.
[886.4s] Hallelujah. Children of God wherever you
[889.4s] are you are in the determined place that
[892.9s] God has set you to be. And all that he
[896.1s] needs is to have the testimony of Paul.
[898.9s] I am fighting a good fight. I am running
[901.6s] the good race and I am keeping faith to
[905.7s] what God has entrusted with me. So
[909.0s] children of God, let's look at these
[911.0s] three points as we move forward. A fight
[915.8s] of faithful engagement and a race that
[919.4s] is fully run and a faith that must be
[923.0s] kept.
[925.0s] A Christian life is a warfare. I have
[927.6s] fought a good fight. Paul says a
[930.2s] statement that I want you to take is
[931.9s] this. The Christian life is a
[934.0s] battleground and not a playground. It
[937.1s] demands spiritual courage, relentless
[940.8s] perseverance and faithfulness to the
[944.0s] commander in chief Jesus Christ. Paul
[947.2s] uses the imagery of a soldier because he
[950.8s] understands that you are daily in a
[953.9s] warfare child of God. Our primary
[956.5s] engagement in margin is not an offense.
[960.7s] That is a beauty children of God that
[963.6s] our call in this engagement is not to be
[966.6s] on the offense but on the defense to
[970.3s] occupy where you have been stationed
[973.5s] until he comes. Hallelujah. You know
[976.1s] there is a difference of engagement. We
[978.9s] are not called to go out to off in
[982.1s] offense but to defend to defend.
[987.0s] The book of Ephesians 6 Paul says stand.
[992.6s] You know the problem that at times
[994.6s] brings so much despondence to the
[996.9s] Christian is we think God has called us
[999.0s] to go out into the battlefield in
[1002.3s] offensiveness.
[1003.9s] God is calling you into defense to
[1007.5s] protect to occupy the place you have
[1011.2s] been given. And therefore Paul says that
[1015.5s] you are well equipped as a warfare child
[1019.5s] of God. God is saying that the battle is
[1022.0s] real. The battle is real. We don't have
[1025.5s] time to look at these scriptures but 2
[1027.5s] Corinthians chapter 5 chapter 10:5 says
[1031.6s] our engagement is of imaginations
[1036.6s] of thoughts that is our engagement
[1039.3s] children of God bringing our thoughts to
[1042.1s] the obedience of the word of God I want
[1045.6s] you to imagine what is stressing you now
[1048.0s] so much it's the train of thought that
[1051.4s] is running in your mind Paul is saying
[1053.9s] casting ing down arguments and every
[1056.0s] high thing that exalts itself against
[1058.5s] the knowledge of God and bringing every
[1061.1s] thought into captivity.
[1063.8s] Our main problem is the train of
[1067.5s] thought. Our warfare, Sister White
[1070.6s] attests to this that our warfare is the
[1075.1s] battle of the mind and the enemy
[1078.1s] understands that so well. So child of
[1081.0s] God, we wrestle not against flesh and
[1084.1s] blood, but we wrestle against
[1086.2s] principality.
[1087.8s] The warfare that we are engaged in is a
[1091.1s] warfare of principles and
[1093.7s] principalities.
[1095.9s] This is the warfare that every one of us
[1099.0s] is engaged in. What are we engaged
[1102.2s] against? One, we are engaged against the
[1106.3s] world system. Paul says in Romans 12
[1110.5s] that therefore I beseech you, brethren,
[1113.8s] that you may not be confformed,
[1117.0s] that it means you may not be conformed
[1119.3s] to the principles and the the the powers
[1122.0s] that are in the world, but be
[1123.6s] transformed
[1125.3s] in your mind. Meaning you are in the war
[1130.1s] zone of a world system that is seeking
[1133.8s] to orient you in a certain way of
[1136.7s] thinking. The second place of our warf
[1140.3s] frontont is the flesh. Is the flesh the
[1144.6s] desires of my body the pride of this
[1148.3s] life. The status that I want to keep and
[1152.0s] also the desires of what I see. Children
[1156.0s] of God, this is where the battle is
[1157.8s] being waged. Not only in your mind, but
[1161.2s] in your feelings, in the things you see,
[1164.7s] in the status you desire that you may
[1167.4s] occupy. And finally, children of God,
[1170.5s] the warfare is against the devil. Satan
[1174.0s] himself is a powerful, relentless enemy
[1177.4s] that keeps deceiving and tempting. Peter
[1181.0s] says in 1 Peter 5:8
[1184.2s] that the devil like a lion is roaring
[1186.6s] that he may defile someone somewhere.
[1189.8s] But children of God, the good news of
[1191.8s] God is in this battle God has not left
[1194.6s] us to ourselves. In the book of
[1196.9s] Ephesians chapter 6:14, Paul says that
[1200.6s] put on the full armor of God in all
[1204.2s] these battle fronts. God has equipped
[1207.0s] you enough to encounter them. He has
[1210.2s] equipped you with the truth that is
[1212.7s] supposed to guard yourself to keep you
[1215.8s] from deception to keep you from being
[1218.5s] disoriented from the wisdom and
[1221.1s] revelation that God gives you every day.
[1224.2s] The Lord has equipped you with
[1226.1s] righteousness as a breastplate that
[1228.9s] protects your heart. The enemy
[1231.2s] understands that your most vulnerable
[1234.1s] place is discouragement.
[1237.4s] Yeah, he understands. And therefore, God
[1241.6s] has equipped you with the righteousness
[1243.3s] of Jesus.
[1245.2s] God knows that you always feel unworthy.
[1248.8s] That is where the fall is. That's where
[1251.4s] we fail. Always feeling unworthy.
[1255.8s] You always feel that you don't matter.
[1258.7s] You are not one who counts among many.
[1262.3s] And that's where the righteousness of
[1264.7s] Jesus covers you. When you don't feel
[1267.3s] like you're worthy, when you don't feel
[1269.2s] like you count among many, then Jesus
[1272.2s] covers you with his righteousness.
[1274.2s] Hallelujah. He makes you feel that you
[1277.1s] are countable. You are worthy. People of
[1279.5s] God, at times when we speak about
[1281.8s] righteousness, we make it so religious.
[1285.4s] We make it so moral that sometimes it
[1288.5s] lacks its practicality.
[1290.7s] Righteousness is right doing for real.
[1293.8s] But righteousness is intended to appease
[1297.5s] your guilt so that you can always walk
[1301.0s] in peace. That's why Romans chapter 5
[1304.2s] verse one Paul says, "Therefore now,
[1307.5s] having been justified by faith, we have
[1311.1s] peace with God." Who doesn't love peace?
[1314.6s] All the pursuits of life today, children
[1316.9s] of God, we are pursuing every other
[1319.0s] thing because we seek peace.
[1321.6s] Unfortunately, the things we seek to
[1323.6s] find peace don't give us peace. It's
[1326.1s] only the righteousness of Jesus that
[1329.0s] renders us peace. Hallelujah. So the
[1331.9s] battlefield, God is equipped you with
[1333.5s] righteousness that may give you peace.
[1335.4s] And he's given you the gospel of peace
[1337.7s] in Jesus Christ. And above all, he's
[1339.8s] given you the faith as a shield to
[1342.6s] extinguish the flaming arrows of doubt,
[1346.8s] doubt, and temptation. Faith is the
[1351.0s] shield against your doubtful life. We
[1353.9s] all live in doubt. In fact, the Greek
[1357.2s] philosophers believe that the more you
[1359.8s] doubt, the more wiser you are. But we
[1362.4s] know that that is a fallacy. It's not
[1365.4s] the more you doubt, the more wise you
[1367.0s] are. Is the more you believe that the
[1369.7s] more wise you are. Hallelujah. Faith is
[1373.0s] our victory. And in your mind, child of
[1376.1s] God, when your mind is bombarding you
[1379.0s] with every kind of thought that seems to
[1381.4s] be oppressing and suppressing you, the
[1384.1s] Bible says God has given you a helmet of
[1386.7s] salvation. The sword of the helmet of
[1390.0s] salvation to guard your mind with
[1392.6s] assurance. I love what Sister White says
[1394.6s] in the book Great Controversy, the
[1397.0s] latter pages, I think it's 500. She says
[1399.3s] this, "Unless we fortify our minds with
[1403.1s] the truth of his word, we will not
[1405.5s] overcome the crisis that are ahead of
[1408.2s] us." Unless you fortify, meaning you h
[1412.6s] your mind with the word of God, the
[1415.3s] crisis ahead are going to break your
[1417.6s] heart. Jesus says that the hearts of
[1419.9s] many will faint because of the troubles
[1422.6s] that are ahead of us. So children of
[1424.2s] God, Jesus leaves us not without
[1426.3s] weapons. He says that let's take the
[1428.7s] sword of the spirit, the only offensive
[1431.0s] weapon that we are given. And he says
[1433.5s] lastly, the engagement of this war, the
[1437.3s] engagement of this war is persistent
[1440.6s] prayer. Hallelujah.
[1443.1s] Persistent prayer. Child of God, don't
[1446.7s] wait for crisis to pray. You will not
[1449.5s] pray.
[1451.2s] Pray. Make it a custom of life that you
[1454.3s] pray even when it doesn't mean sense.
[1456.5s] Prayer is not about what we get from
[1458.4s] God. Prayer is about communion with God.
[1463.0s] Learning to be there even when he's not
[1465.6s] making your ATM drop some coins. It's
[1469.1s] just that you have the joy. Let it be
[1472.2s] with you. As David says, one day in the
[1475.6s] house of the Lord is more than a
[1477.6s] thousand days in the house of the
[1479.5s] princes. Children of God. Paul says it's
[1482.7s] a good fight. It's a fight that is
[1486.6s] intense. It's a fight that is
[1489.2s] distressing. But Paul says it's a good
[1493.3s] fight. Why is it a good fight? It's a
[1496.3s] good fight, people of God. Because God
[1498.9s] has ordained it for you. Hallelujah.
[1502.1s] It's a good fight because God has
[1504.7s] ordained it for you. You know people of
[1506.6s] God, if God could carry us to heaven the
[1510.2s] way we are, we ourselves will not love
[1513.5s] heaven. You will not enjoy being in
[1517.4s] heaven. Just imagine the ills that we
[1521.0s] experience now and then we transport
[1523.2s] them to heaven. So God in his own wisdom
[1527.0s] has purposed us to engage in this fight
[1529.8s] that we may dispose off of all the ills
[1534.2s] so that when we get into heaven we have
[1536.6s] fought a good fight that has disposed
[1539.2s] off every ill that this world has
[1542.7s] imprinted on our lives. Hallelujah. It
[1545.9s] has to come. It has to come child of God
[1549.1s] that God enables you or allows you to
[1552.5s] engage in a good fight to an extent that
[1555.3s] you say I am tired of this life. I don't
[1559.8s] enjoy anything in this life. God desires
[1564.6s] that in this good fight, he brings you
[1567.1s] to a place where you can say with Paul,
[1569.6s] I am ready now to be poured out as a
[1573.0s] drink offering. I am ready now to be
[1576.3s] poured out. I am ready to depart. I'm
[1579.7s] ready to tell somebody somewhere, excuse
[1582.6s] me, can I go? Hallelujah.
[1586.6s] Excuse me, can I go? You know when you
[1588.8s] are leaving friends that you have been
[1590.2s] engaged with, what do we normally tell
[1592.0s] them? Excuse me, I have to leave. I am I
[1597.1s] decide that when my time of death comes
[1599.4s] I can tell brothers I can tell my wife I
[1602.2s] can tell my children excuse me can I go
[1606.4s] because I have lived it out. I think God
[1611.0s] I owe him nothing. I have come to a
[1613.6s] place where I say excuse me brothers
[1615.6s] please let me go and you my wife my
[1619.7s] children my members you can say yeah
[1623.5s] farewell good soldier farewell because I
[1627.9s] have understood that I have fought a
[1629.6s] good fight it is a good fight because
[1632.0s] it's a righteous cause for the kingdom
[1633.8s] of God it's a good fight people of God
[1636.9s] it's a good fight because we said it's a
[1640.0s] defensive fight.
[1642.5s] It's a good fight because you are not on
[1644.4s] the fence. You're not fighting to
[1646.4s] occupy, but you're fighting so that you
[1649.1s] can keep what already you have won.
[1651.1s] Hallelujah. In Jesus Christ, it's a good
[1654.6s] fight because you're not fighting to
[1657.8s] exploit, but you're fighting to keep
[1661.3s] what you already have earned in Jesus
[1664.0s] Christ. Hallelujah.
[1666.2s] Praise the Lord. The second point
[1668.6s] children of God
[1670.9s] is that this Christian life is a
[1674.0s] welfare. Paul says, "I have finished the
[1677.0s] race. I have finished the race." A
[1680.1s] statement that I make on this is that
[1681.8s] while the Christian life is filled with
[1683.8s] warfare, but the good news here is it is
[1687.5s] sustained by the grace of God and
[1690.8s] strengthened to finish the race that God
[1693.4s] has set before us. Now Paul uses an
[1695.6s] imagery of an athlete. He says, "I have
[1699.1s] run the race. Paul wants to remind us
[1702.6s] children of God that your life as a
[1705.5s] Christian is not a sprint but it's a
[1709.5s] marathon." They're two different things.
[1712.8s] A sprinter focuses on speed, but one who
[1717.9s] runs marathon focuses on endurance and
[1722.8s] perseverance.
[1724.6s] The frustration we have with life is
[1727.2s] because we always have a mental set of a
[1730.4s] sprinter. I want to do this. I want to
[1733.4s] finish my career. I want to build this.
[1735.9s] It's a sprinter. Children of God, God
[1738.5s] wants us to have a mentality of an
[1741.1s] athlete that is running a marathon
[1743.4s] rather than a 100meter dash.
[1747.1s] This race, Paul says he has finished. As
[1751.2s] he draws from Hebrews 12,
[1754.3s] he has finished. Because in Hebrews 12,
[1757.0s] Paul says, "Therefore
[1759.8s] having this cloud of witnesses, Paul is
[1762.9s] saying, I am not running this race on my
[1765.8s] own." There's a cloud of witnesses. Uh
[1769.2s] we don't have time to consider Hebrews
[1771.3s] 11 to see those who have run the race
[1774.0s] before. And the Bible says in Hebrews
[1777.0s] 11:39 that God has not granted to them
[1780.6s] the crown because he wants us all to be
[1782.9s] there together. Hallelujah. And Paul
[1785.7s] says that I have run the race and I
[1788.6s] finished the race because the race I
[1792.6s] don't know how to say it better but I
[1794.0s] hope somebody will catch it. This race
[1797.4s] it is empowered by grace as the winds
[1801.1s] and our arms. Hallelujah. We have an
[1804.0s] advantage of the grace of God. Paul says
[1807.4s] I have finished the race. The finishing
[1810.2s] here, Paul says, is not that I am
[1813.2s] finished, but I have completed in
[1817.0s] faithfulness. Two things that I want you
[1819.4s] to capture there, people of God. Paul's
[1822.4s] finished the race. It could be because
[1825.0s] he says the race figuratively is that
[1829.3s] Paul has identified the purpose for his
[1832.3s] life. The purpose for his life. He has
[1835.8s] known why am I here? Why am I here? One
[1839.7s] of the frustrations of life is when we
[1842.0s] don't know why we are here. We are
[1844.4s] scavenging for everything to make
[1846.6s] meaning in our lives. But Paul is
[1849.0s] saying, I have finished the race because
[1851.4s] he has identified that he has been
[1853.8s] called by God to be an apostle to the
[1856.5s] Gentiles. And since he has fulfilled
[1859.4s] that purpose of God, now he says, "I
[1862.5s] have finished my race." The thing that
[1865.3s] is frustrating your life, the things
[1867.3s] that is causing you to be disappointed
[1869.0s] and discouraged of your life is because
[1871.2s] you are a jack of all trade. You think
[1874.3s] that you set out to do everything. Child
[1877.0s] of God, God has crafted you out for a
[1879.8s] special mission in this world. It may
[1882.5s] not be the mission of prestige and
[1884.8s] status, but that is what God has called
[1887.4s] you. You know sometimes when I am
[1889.2s] walking in life and I am just lowering
[1892.6s] my head like this and I look down and I
[1895.6s] see the small ants and I ask myself,
[1899.4s] God, what did you intend for these ants
[1902.4s] to accomplish in life? Then I remember
[1905.6s] God set out these ants to decompose
[1909.5s] things that could bring harm to me.
[1911.4s] Hallelujah. that these ants that look
[1914.6s] nothing that at times they step on and
[1917.2s] consciously God has set them also with a
[1920.2s] purpose. Now I want to imagine that your
[1923.0s] your life may just be like an ant. But
[1926.3s] because you live in comparison with your
[1929.0s] neighbor, you always imagine that your
[1931.1s] life is a junk. Your life is an
[1933.8s] accident. I come to tell you like Paul
[1936.1s] is saying, I have finished my race. For
[1939.5s] I have known why I am here and I have
[1943.0s] accomplished what God has called me to
[1945.0s] do. So let me depart. Let me go. I have
[1949.4s] done what God wanted me to do. And that
[1952.3s] is the satisfaction. I'm reminded of
[1955.4s] Simeon. When Jesus is born and brought
[1958.1s] to the temple, Simeon would say this.
[1961.0s] Oh, now your servant has seen the
[1964.5s] salvation of the Lord. Let your servant
[1966.7s] now depart in peace. Simeon understood
[1970.6s] that all his life was to come to a point
[1973.4s] to see Jesus.
[1976.4s] And when he saw Jesus, he said, "Now let
[1978.9s] me go. I have I've done it all."
[1983.0s] children of God.
[1985.3s] It's it it it is it it may be very
[1988.2s] mundane.
[1990.1s] You could you just be a gatekeeper. You
[1993.0s] could be just a watchman. Whatever you
[1996.4s] know all these categories that we have
[1999.0s] the world has set us in that somehow
[2002.4s] have disoriented us that we feel as if
[2006.6s] we are nothing. God has just set you out
[2009.5s] for that. Have you not heard a story? I
[2012.6s] think I've told it here one day of one
[2015.3s] of my lure brothers who went back home
[2018.9s] and he was crossing I think he was going
[2021.5s] uh to Mashima's place TJ and he was
[2024.2s] crossing the lake I think you've heard
[2026.6s] the story and he was with this man in
[2029.4s] the canoe and he was telling the man
[2031.8s] whether he has studied materology
[2034.7s] whether he has studied geology or marine
[2038.2s] life and the poor man in the boat didn't
[2040.9s] know anything about the geology or
[2042.9s] geology
[2044.5s] or marine life. The poor man says, "Me,
[2048.0s] I don't know anything." And the learned
[2050.6s] man from Nairobi told the poor man in
[2052.3s] the canoe, "You are the most foolish
[2054.4s] thing. How can you engage in such a
[2055.9s] trade and you don't understand the
[2057.8s] weather, you don't understand the marine
[2059.4s] life?" The man said, "Me, I don't know."
[2062.0s] But as they went on in the boat, it is
[2064.6s] said that the wind started blowing and
[2067.5s] the poor man in the boat
[2070.2s] said, "Do you know how to swim?"
[2073.4s] And the learned guy from Nairobi said,
[2075.2s] "I don't know how to swim." And the
[2077.9s] fisherman told him, "You are not only
[2079.5s] foolish, you're going to die."
[2083.2s] At times all the learnedness we have in
[2086.4s] the city, when we go home, we find
[2089.0s] ourselves unable to cope up.
[2091.7s] But yet still in that very humble life,
[2096.0s] somebody's finishing that which God has
[2098.2s] assigned him to do. And that is where
[2100.7s] the peace of life is. What Paul is
[2103.4s] telling us in the race that the
[2104.7s] Christian life is a race that we need
[2107.4s] endure a race. We need to run. We need
[2109.9s] to finish that which God has set out for
[2112.2s] you to do. Remaining faithful until you
[2115.0s] finish. It's a race that you need to run
[2117.6s] according to the rules. That is what
[2120.1s] Paul says in 1 Corinthians chapter 9
[2122.6s] verse 24. Each one of us is called to
[2126.6s] run within. Don't run in somebody's
[2129.0s] lane. That's where your frustration is.
[2131.7s] You are not finishing because you're
[2133.2s] running somebody's else race. Run your
[2136.4s] race, child of God. It's not easy, but
[2139.4s] run your race. Paul says, "Lay aside the
[2142.5s] weights." The weights. The weights,
[2145.4s] children of God. In the book of Hebrews
[2147.4s] 12, when Paul says, "Lay aside the the
[2149.4s] weights," what he means is there are
[2151.5s] good things in life. Good things. Good
[2154.8s] things. It could be a husband, it could
[2156.4s] be a wife, it could be your job, it
[2158.5s] could be a profession that is hampering
[2161.4s] you to finish well because it's become a
[2165.2s] weight. Child of God, Paul distinguishes
[2168.8s] two things in Hebrews 12 in running this
[2171.3s] race. He says, "Let's set aside
[2174.8s] every weight and every sin." Yes, there
[2178.7s] is sin that besets us from running, but
[2182.1s] also there is weight. I'm more concerned
[2184.2s] about the weight for us who are in
[2186.4s] church because the weight is the good
[2189.1s] things, the blessings that God gives to
[2192.2s] you. And once he gives them to you, they
[2194.8s] become a burden.
[2208.1s] [Applause]
[2226.5s] So child of God, run the
[2229.3s] lay aside the weight.
[2232.6s] What are the blessing? Children of God,
[2234.7s] these blessings are hampering you. Yeah.
[2239.0s] You know, some of us were barren. We
[2242.2s] didn't have babies.
[2244.1s] Immediately the baby came, we started
[2246.4s] overshadowing the baby that now we don't
[2249.0s] even come for Sabbath school. We come
[2251.2s] for divine service.
[2253.6s] Some of you children of God have been
[2255.7s] exalted. You are
[2258.5s] maybe a clock but now you are the
[2260.8s] director of a farm and now because you
[2263.0s] are a director you cannot come the
[2265.5s] directorship has become your weight
[2268.8s] ah some of you people of God have been
[2271.5s] exalted like Daniel to be statesmen
[2275.8s] of the country and that statesmanship
[2278.8s] has now become the weight that is
[2280.7s] weighing you down you are missing in
[2284.0s] action
[2286.5s] Paul is saying, "I have finished my
[2289.0s] race.
[2290.5s] I have run the race."
[2293.4s] Meaning Paul says, "I have endured what
[2295.7s] is is there." The good news, child of
[2298.2s] God, that in his race, God has made a
[2300.4s] provision for you. He is he's
[2302.6s] strengthening you. His eyes are on you.
[2305.7s] You know children of God, the Bible says
[2307.3s] that the angels the worlds that are
[2309.4s] unfallen are are we are like in a
[2313.0s] stadium running and the worlds that are
[2315.4s] fallen and the angels are all focusing
[2318.5s] on us. We are a spectacle
[2321.7s] of the things that are defined. I don't
[2324.3s] know how you want to run your race, but
[2326.6s] as we bring this message to an end, God
[2329.5s] is saying remain faithful within the
[2332.9s] race that God calls you. And finally,
[2335.7s] children of God, Paul is not only saying
[2338.1s] that a good fight I have fought. Paul is
[2340.9s] not saying the race I have run, but Paul
[2344.2s] is saying the faith I have kept.
[2349.7s] Meaning our life is not only a life of a
[2352.9s] soldier. Our life is not only a life of
[2356.4s] an athlete
[2358.2s] but our life is a life of a watcher. I
[2363.8s] couldn't get the best way to capture the
[2365.5s] thought of Paul but in every sense it
[2368.1s] could come in thinking of it as a
[2371.1s] watcher as a custodian as a gatekeeper
[2375.0s] to the to to the treasures of a kingdom.
[2377.8s] Paul says, "I have kept the faith." I
[2381.8s] have kept the faith.
[2384.1s] Paul says that the Christian life is
[2385.9s] lived watchfully under the eye of the
[2388.1s] righteous judge. Watchfully over what
[2391.0s] has been entrusted to us. The faith, the
[2395.1s] faith, Jude says, the faith once
[2397.6s] delivered to the saints is what we have.
[2401.4s] We are custodian people of God. Paul
[2404.2s] says in Romans chapter 3, is there
[2406.8s] anything worthy? Is there anything
[2409.3s] important for somebody being a Jew? And
[2413.0s] he says in every manner there is
[2416.3s] significance of being a Jew because to
[2419.4s] us or to the Jew God has in entrusted
[2423.6s] the oracles. Children of God, is there
[2426.8s] any significance of being a Christian?
[2438.3s] Is there any any any significance? You
[2440.9s] know, we live in a life, we live in a
[2443.0s] world where people trivialize being a
[2445.2s] Christian. You know,
[2457.8s] is there any benefit of you being a
[2460.0s] Christian? This is what Paul says.
[2470.2s] Hallelujah. That you and me are
[2473.0s] custodian of the treasures of the
[2475.9s] kingdom of God.
[2479.4s] That's what Paul says. That's why he
[2480.9s] uses the word kept. Kept here is Paul is
[2484.4s] saying, "I've kept my eye. I've kept my
[2488.8s] eye on something." so precious. I've
[2491.4s] kept my watch. The idea is of protecting
[2494.4s] and guarding. You know the expressions
[2496.7s] that I've kept.
[2498.9s] I didn't want to engage in some things
[2500.7s] here that are very profound. But Paul is
[2503.3s] not saying that I I have just I have
[2506.2s] just kept it now when it's entrusted me.
[2508.8s] Paul is acknowledging of the privilege
[2512.2s] of becoming a custodian because he says
[2515.8s] the keeping has not started with me. The
[2518.6s] keeping started long time ago, but the
[2521.0s] results of the keeping are continuing
[2523.0s] with me. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. I don't
[2526.8s] know whether somebody had that. Paul is
[2529.0s] understanding the privilege. The way he
[2530.8s] phrases himself, he says this this this
[2534.1s] entrustment is not with me.
[2543.4s] I'm part of the custodians of the faith.
[2547.0s] I have kept the faith children of God.
[2549.5s] And the conceivable thing about this
[2551.9s] expression is about guarding and
[2554.6s] preserving, treasuring and keeping that
[2557.1s] which is for forever. So keeping keeping
[2560.4s] child of God is that to remind us of
[2563.1s] God's watchfulness over you as you
[2565.8s] yourself become watchful on what he has
[2568.2s] entrusted in you. Keeping child of God
[2570.9s] is in a sense telling you that the
[2572.9s] message God has entrusted with you, it
[2575.3s] is for you to preserve until the time of
[2578.0s] the end. And Paul gives the greatest
[2580.2s] motivation, child of God. In all these,
[2582.6s] Paul gives you the greatest motivation.
[2584.9s] He says,
[2586.6s] having fought a good fight and having
[2589.4s] run the race according to the rules and
[2591.6s] having been a good custodian, he says
[2593.9s] this, "A crown is set up for me."
[2597.7s] Hallelujah.
[2599.2s] Now, now
[2602.6s] the Bible distinguishes crowns. Paul is
[2605.9s] not speaking about the kingly crown here
[2609.3s] because the kingly crown the word is
[2611.5s] diadem. But here the word is stephanos.
[2615.8s] Stefanos is a is is is a crown for the
[2619.1s] victor.
[2620.7s] The crown that is given for one who is
[2623.4s] the victor. Meaning it's a crown for all
[2626.3s] of us.
[2627.5s] The crown of righteousness is for
[2629.4s] everyone who overcomes.
[2631.9s] So Paul's motivation here is the
[2635.1s] stephanos. The crown the reward now
[2638.3s] listen to this encourage yourself of
[2640.2s] this. The reward here is not for the
[2644.1s] perfect as much as that is necessary.
[2648.2s] But the crown is for those who love his
[2651.4s] appearing.
[2653.3s] The ultimate act of it all is that the
[2655.6s] crown is for the faithful, the faithful
[2658.9s] soldier, the faithful athlete and the
[2662.0s] faithful custodian. Those are the ones
[2664.8s] the crown has been set up as Paul says
[2668.1s] and those who love is appearing. I don't
[2671.0s] know about you but I love the appearing
[2673.9s] appearing. So Paul says my life is
[2676.9s] poured out. My life is poured out. Child
[2680.8s] of God, let's finish this in the next
[2682.7s] one minute. What Paul is saying as a
[2686.6s] Christian, acknowledge life as a battle,
[2690.2s] but claim your victory in Jesus Christ.
[2694.1s] Paul is saying this life,
[2698.1s] don't pity yourself.
[2703.2s] Paul is saying endure and persevere
[2707.5s] because it's a race that we are in.
[2711.0s] Yeah, it's a marathon. Endure. And
[2713.6s] finally, Paul is saying, keep the faith
[2717.8s] because that is the ground. That is your
[2719.6s] stability. And Paul says, "Look up for
[2724.4s] Jesus has prepared a crown of
[2726.8s] righteousness for you. A crown for every
[2729.8s] victor."
[2731.6s] This morning, child of God, I don't know
[2734.6s] where your heart is weary. If your heart
[2737.1s] is weary, Christ says, "I understand.
[2740.6s] But a good fight you fight, for the
[2743.0s] victor is already won." Jesus is saying,
[2746.2s] "Are you struggling to finish the race?
[2749.4s] You are a workmanship.
[2751.4s] You are a specimen
[2753.7s] of his work. He wants to display you
[2756.6s] before the world because you have run a
[2759.0s] good race.
[2760.7s] I want to invite you child of God. Leave
[2763.8s] your life today as a Christian with the
[2766.6s] end in mind.
[2768.9s] Good fight,
[2770.6s] fight.
[2772.2s] Good race, run and finish.
[2776.1s] Ultimately, child of God, be a good
[2779.1s] watchman. Be a good watcher. For the one
[2783.1s] who was promised
[2785.0s] will appear with your crown of
[2787.8s] righteousness
[2789.3s] in Jesus name. God bless you.
