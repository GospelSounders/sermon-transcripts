is about a small brown fox I shall proceed to read it excited chatter filled the school van as it whistled down the two land Road in Arizona seven Native American boys talked enthusiastically about the fun day that they had spent skiing the White Mountains they were happy tired and relaxed as they headed back to Holbrook 7th Day Adventist Indian School where they lived the sun was setting in the East and Long Shadows were starting to form on the desert ground suddenly a small brown fox darted across the road in unison all seven boys GED sharply uhoh the van driver teacher Allison didn't notice oh look she cried out happily there is a fox foxes were one of her favorite animals and this one was so beautiful she was excited but the boys were horrified their faces turned pale and serious they stopped talking then teacher Allison noticed the silence she was surprised that the boys weren't excited to see the fox didn't all boys like foxes what's wrong she said the boys looked at one another for a long moment then one said quietly well in our culture that's a bad what kind of woman teacher Allison asked she was not a Native American and she didn't understand what they meant we can't talk about it the boy said well okay teach me she said the boys looked at each other then the boy explained that Native Americans see it bad luck if a fox crosses your path at Sunset it means something bad is going to happen or someone in your family he said teacher Allison was astonished what he said well the boy said someone in our family will probably get sick and die or maybe die in a car accident you never know how it's going to happen but someone will die in the next month teacher Allison pulled the school B School van over to the side of the road she thanked the boys for bravely share sharing their fears she thanked thank them for teaching her about Native American culture she said she wanted to share something as well here is what a fox meant to me she said a fox is a beautiful creature created by God for our enjoyment it doesn't have the power to impact our family just because it crossed the road she said she wanted the boys to know that they didn't need to be scared when they were with God so I'm just going to pray for the folks and for us she said bowing her head she prayed dear God please give the folks a safe journey please give us a safe journey too keep the boys familyes safe and keep the boys too know you the boys were surprised that their teacher had taken the time to pray several didn't look pleased with the prayer but teach Allison didn't mind the boys didn't need to need to like the prayer they had to had a good skiing with a good day skiing with with her and she hoped that they would know the power of God the boys sat in silence for the rest of the drive back to school no one wanted to talk teer Allison turned on some Christian music a month passed then a boy from the van came toer Allison he said that he and the other boys from the van realized that a month has passed since they saw the FKS crossing the road and no one in their family had died you know we were talking about it and we realized that nothing happened to our families after you prayed he said teacher Allison was so happy not only had God heard her prayer but the boys also are beginning to trust God pray for the children of H Brook 7th Day Adventist Indian School to know God as their special friend this 13th Sabbath offering have supported Mission work at the school for many years the most recent 13th Sabbath School offering for the North American Division is helping to construct a new student Life Center on the school campus thank you for your offering this quarter [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] no oh oh [Music] know [Music] oh go [Music] [Music] yes good morning good afternoon and good evening my fellow listeners the young people and each and everyone of us who is tuned in and listening to today's lesson so today's lesson as you build up from the previous one is entitled build it um and equally which also comes from the prophet and Kings chapter 48 which is also entitled not by power nor by might and as we focus on today's lesson which will be trying to encourage us to allow God you know like Romans chapter Malachi chter 3: 6 which speaks about that God never changes or does not change we are being encouraged today we try to look at the story of building of the Temple of how we should allow God to build the same Temple that was built physically in our hearts so that is my prayer today and as you listen to us even as we do an introduction of our panelist that we ought to have this call in our minds we ought to call have this call in our hearts that of encouraging of Allowing God to use us and of Allowing God to be with us as we go about this life because if God doesn't have a place in our hearts like build a temple in our hearts then we may not be able to push through so however as we think about that I would want to request my panelist to introduce themselves starting from my left um good morning my name is Sid i i am miss samban I'm excited to jump into this lesson with you and I really like the pun you used as you were starting your introduction thank you hello my name is teacher Joan I am happy to dive into this yes yeah thank you very much so I think to start us up I'll request my brother Sid to pray with us so that we can start okay let believe and pray our heavenly father you come through you this morning we thank you for Gift of Life your guidance and protection and for all the things that you've given unto us Lord as we about to start this lesson I pray that you may help us understand and that we may be able to apply it in our our lives for this I pray in Jesus name amen amen thank you very much for taking us through so I think from today's lesson it's actually clear that in every of our daily engagements in every of our usual engagements whether we are at school whether we are working whether we run businesses we will definitely face objection we usually come through challenges and similar to our lives every other day we also learned today that there was a bit of rejection when the remnant of Judah led by zeru barel Were Meant to build the temple there was lots of objection there was lots of issues here and there and and above all Beyond everything all as a title of prophet and King's mention not by power nor by might at the end of it all it happened because the temple and the Church of God was neither B to This World by any of us it was brought by God so whether the rejection comes or doesn't come at the end of the day the person who preserves the church which actually should be in our hearts is God so it all tells you beyond the rejection that we Face even as you try you know to you young person as you listen to this lesson even as you try to do your things every day you trying to maybe share the gospel you are trying to minister to people you are trying to do something for God you will definitely face rejection but you are being encouraged this day that we should not falter because of the rejection but we should instead remain and keep strong and so as you try to delve in a little bit I would want to request um my sister to slightly guide us to tell us what the lesson is all about I know it comes from Zachariah chapter 2 and also e chapter 6 and equally also Zariah 4 but maybe she could give us maybe in a brief what do you expect from today's lesson um some of the things that we expect from today's lesson is that um we may be encouraged and uh we may be encouraged to know that God is calling us to do great things and though there are times that we will face discouragement we'll face um hard times this story is meant to be um the strength that we need and the hope that we have been looking for to encourage us to move forward without um any hindrances the second thing is that uh we are to learn that if we trust God then God will give us the peace that we need to carry out his work regardless of the situation that we're in and finally we are to this is to help us to respond to the call that the call that God is making to each and every one of us that it is our responsibility to carry out God's plan as young people in this last day and age and if we trust him then we will surely fulfill that which he has called us to do thank you very much for giving us the expectations for the lesson and even as I'll be coming to you a little bit later on let me come to my brother Sid who will lead us into what do you think maybe can take us through a question or two so that we can get to understand some of these questions how they will spear us into aiming forward and into understanding more so please take us through okay so in the what do you think section we we will check it says we check all the answers below that describe God's end time church and then we'll read the following passages from the Bible and try to find these and other characteristics of God's end time Church um so we'll read Matthew 7: 24 and 25 um maybe miss you can read that one for us right so brilliant so Matthew chapter 7 verse 24 and 25 therefore whoever hears these sayings of mine and does them I will liken him to a wise man who built his house on the rock and the rain descended the floods came and and the winds blew and beat on that house and it did not fall for it was founded on the Rock okay can um then we have Matthew chap 28 verse 19 and 20 maybe Joan you could read that for us um Matthew 289 and um 20 this is what it says 28 19 and 20 says go ye therefore and teach All Nations baptizing them in the name of the father and of the son and of the Holy Ghost verse 20 teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I have commanded you and lo I Am With You Always way even until the end of the world Amen we have Ephesians 2: 19 and 22 um teacher Kevin you can read that one for us Ephesians chapter 2: 19 to 22 um this how he says now therefore you are no longer strangers and foreigners but fellow citizens with the Saints and members of the household of God vers 20 having been built on the foundation of the Apostles and Prophets Jesus Christ himself being the Chief Cornerstone in whom the whole building being fitted together grows into a holy Temple of the Lord vers 22 in whom you also are being built together for a Dwelling Place of God in the spirit we also have also have Revelation 12:17 maybe you can go back to me sat and the dragon was enraged with a woman and he went to make war with the rest of our Offspring who keep the Commandments of God and have the test testimony of Jesus Christ and finally we have Revelation 19: 10 Revelation 197 it says let us be glad and rejoice and give honor to him for the marriage of the Lamb is come and his wife hath made herself ready and I fell at his feet to worship but he said to me see that you do that not I am your fellow servant and of your brethren who have the testimony of Jesus worship God for the testimony of Jesus is a spirit of Prophecy okay um uh so uh how is this knowledge about the church important for us who are living in the 21st century right I I one thing is as I see it this knowledge allows us to be able to accurately pinpoint God end time church cuz I believe this is giving defining characteristics and one thing I can say for a fact is that pretty much every denomination or religion and whatnot claims to be the Endtime church I would say so is that not the case that is they all make the same claims not withstanding they don't all fit the the criteria a good number come close but based to based on a few doctrinal things that are that deviate from the Bible they fail to achieve to the full specification yeah else yeah I think I could add onto the knowledge is it important is the knowledge you learn from the Bible important for this Century that we are living in of course because as you go to what do you think section I think there's something that one of the one of the points that mention is that the church has a worldwi mission and message and that is important for us the aspect have realized is that Jesus is the head of the church and the Chief Cornerstone so that means Beyond everything if Christ was not in the middle of this then there wouldn't be need for us to worship for us to to have relevance for us to for even this knowledge you know for even this Mission there wouldn't be need and and equally the third one that that comes across is that God's end time church has a spirit of prophecy through the writings of Val and white and that is actually true which we find that from Revelation I think 12:17 and equally elaborated further in re CH 19 and: 10 you know so I think for me for I as a person individually if I was to learn this knowledge and I don't get to share it with others and I don't get to uh put myself in the context that I'm supposed to be like you know if you learn something then you're supposed to change accordingly then there wouldn't be any need but practically and today then this information is important so that you can even know what is happening in the world mhm okay that's it for the what do you think section yeah thank you very much and I think um as you go on we've also learned that from um prophet and Kings chapter 48 that the story of rebuilding the temple was an interesting story and and there are a number of things that you get to learn and and one of it is from the flashlight even as I will invite my brother to take us through chapter 48 but I would love to read the flashlight which says throughout the history of God's people great mountains of difficulty apparently insurmountable have loomed up before those who are trying to carry out purposes of Heaven such obstacles are permitted by the Lord as a test of faith when you are hedged about on every side this is a Time above all others to trust in God and the power of His Spirit the exercise of our living faith means an increase of spiritual strength and the development of UN falter in trust that is Page 594 prophet and Kings my brother please take us briefly and expon more on prophet and Kings and the thing is I believe this is expounded even further when we take a step a page forward 595 we are informed that the way of the world is to begin with pump and boasting God's way is to make the day of small things the beginning of the Glorious Triumph of Truth and righteousness and I I dare say that the way the building happened it seemed such a small thing at first I believe even the tribes around were like what are you guys doing but of course it was from that small thing of oh high this is a rubbel he is like fresh he has no idea where he is but now he Scouts the place then he's encouraged by Zarah that you know what even though this may not look like much we can still raise this to a great deal and of course over time the the obstacle seems insurmountable they were surrounded on all sides by people who all they wanted is they wanted just to crush them like insects however they stood firm that is they were willing to stand strong in what the Lord had said and that is how SAS I know let me not spoil that could you kindly take us through that section the interesting story um the interesting story that you get to go through is um basically the story of um a man called zabel who was a Jewish leader and he was determined to build the walls of Jerusalem and there was so much discouragement that was happening um around him and God in his Mercy sends Zechariah who gives encouragement to him and tells him do not worry um actually we can read something from the book of Zechariah just to see what he said to him as a means of encouragement that's Zechariah 4:6 if someone gets there they can read that for us yes and I have I am right there so he answered and said to to me this is the word of the Lord to zerubabel not by might nor by power but by my spirit says the Lord of hosts exactly so this is what Zechariah tells him and zerubabel um is thinking we we've already started we've had the plans and so many things are are are are starting to happen but then it looks like there's so much discouragement around and God in his Mercy s Zariah and one lesson I'd want us to pick from this is that many times when we are discouraged God can see it and God can send people our way who can be able to encourage Us in the journey or who can be able to give us strength to do that which he has called us to do so Zechariah encourages him and years later there comes a king called King Cyrus who eventually um gives a decree that the temple should be built and the temple is built and it is amazing how everything that concerns the temple is taken care of by King Cyrus all the money in fact King Cyrus goes ahead and says all the animals that will be needed for sacrifices um he ordered that all the money should be gotten from the Royal uh reserve and that money should be given to these people so that they can be able to do all the sacrifices they need for the temple I don't know what you get from that MTI something applicable to your life today so that's that's that's an interesting thing that that despite insurmountable obstacles I believe we are able to face through them and I love to hear from you Sid that is so from this story this insm seemingly I'd say seemingly insurmountable obstacles but seem the Lord had already made Provisions so what what do you see from this and how can this be impactful in our lives I'm sorry um I didn't quite understand the question so looking at this story of zerubabel the way that God said not by might not by power but by my spirit says the Lord of hosts will this thing be done so what insights do you get from this what strikes you from this the way it can be applicable in our lives um so it's it's really it's it's it's it's kind of hits you you know you can't do this on your own mhm yeah can't do this on your own so you need you'll need God's help in order to do certain things that's that's really something that not many people would understand but it's it's it's really an interesting thing to know cuz you know sometimes your your ego it's it's like oh you can do this one on your own and then you come to realize you can't and you need the help of God to to do some of these things so it's it's quite interesting yeah absolutely yeah I think for me if I was to just get back to the prophet and kings that um that's page 595 that says human power and human did not establish the Church of God and neither can they destroy it not on the rock of human strength but on Christ Jesus the Rock of Ages was a church founded and the Gates of Hell shall not Prevail against it and you get something also from Matthew 16:18 so that means that the temple was established on God's strength and that is the same strength and power that can be able to destroy it so in the similar case it is neither by our power or by our might that we overcome the challenges you go through you know um I I came across something also from the same book that says success will come to them as they struggle against difficulties so in other words we as young people as you go through the lesson we get to learn that when you go through challenges success will come yes when you go through trying and tough times we will even face more difficulties but we are not to give up because it is not by our power but by God's spirit that we are able to overcome so it gives you the trend that it could be a test of faith yes God may allow the challenge or the test to come yes but are we to fight it on our own no because neither or none of us created themselves so whoever is our creator then understands the person they created so we are to go to God and not only when you're going through challenges but all the time so I think that's how I understand it and I believe it should be my guide even when you're trying to come up with a plan proposal you know you at school you're trying to come up with these suggestions or something it's always good to consult God actually he's told us that commit your plans to him and they will establish them thank you so back to teacher Johan yeah absolutely there are questions in that story that I would really love for you to ask us cuz I think they allow us to really explore this story in such a fascinating manner so you can handpick one or two to allow us to explore this okay so let's do the first question uh this will go to you Miss it says what do you find unique about Ezra's message the first part of into the story absolutely so the thing is and I'll read this in our hearing that is so Ezra declared let the temple be rebuilt as a place to present sacrifices and let its foundations be laid and this is where he goes into like the mathematics 60 cubits high 60 cubits wide three cses of large stones and one of Timbers the cost are to be paid by the Royal Treasury gold silver which Nebuchadnezzar took and whatnot and he also decreed to do for these Elders of Jews in the like the elders like the house of the Lord expenses are to be fully paid out of the real treasury from the revenues and what not I mean the thing is this is this is interesting I have to say and wow I'd say wow I me it seems it seems fascinating like Ezra is showing us that King Cyrus was so dedicated to this like his heart was moved with so much love and compassion that he was like you know what you see all those taxes you see every single thing that was taken away from you I am giving it back and I'm giving it back with interest I think it's almost like like it's a throwback to like when these guys left Egypt when they left with the gold of the Egyptians of course and so and that gold is what beautified the temple so it's some sort of par where God is showing that truly he is who he says he is yes amen amen thank you so much so this goes to seed what do these passages tell us about God's love for Humanity um really I think it it shows how much God cares for us and um and how much he he he loves us so I I think that's that's what um I would say for this question he this passage it TR shows us how much he loves and cares for his people and he would go to any extent just to you know thank you yes maybe I can also add I think just to add on to what he just mentioned is that God will be with us even through this trying and challenging times yeah because come to think about it you will wake up settle down ready for work and then all of a sudden you get to the workplace and guys you know what um we have to dismiss you because the company is struggling and we realize that you know what you guys are so many and and they actually have to pick you but we've been encouraged today that even so in those tests of faith we are still to hold on firm and strong so I think that is one of them and actually you find it can happen even in school you preparing for this exam you preparing for this grade uh maybe you can talk of maybe year five year 10 year 12 you know those exams or form one form two and as you prepare and and you ready for it then all of a sudden on the exam day you realize hey I can't even do the exam because you unw you didn't do anything wrong you ready and all that but you have to go to hospital and they tell you you know what we'll have to set another exam and give you at our wish so some of these things will happen because um we've learned this In Our Lifetime that not all that we have planned may come to be not all things that we put together may come to be at the end but that which happens even if there are challenges then today's encouragement is God is with us so I think that's how I'll answer that and uh yeah I don't know if actually come to think of it and even in our challenges you know the word of the Lord that came to zerubabel after God declared that it is not by might not by power but he goes on to declare even further and this is actually so it's reported and actually has so many exclamations like who are you oh great Mountain before zerubabel you shall become a plane and he shall bring forth the Capstone with shouts of Grace Grace to it that's the thing so not only does God say that it shall be by might or by power and he goes on to say that by my power or by by the power of the spirit zerubabel shall level mountains you know the thing where Christ says is if you have faith the size of a master seed you shall say unto this mountain be moved and throw yourself into the sea and it shall be plunged Into the Depths and I believe that is the power of God yeah thank you very much for that and even as we wind up with our lesson this uh morning or this afternoon I would want to request my brother to take us through there's a certain story very interesting story that comes in our in our lesson whereby we get to learn of the aspect of even faith and I would want my brother just take us through maybe in a minute or so and so that we can learn something my brother s um so in um our teacher lesson we have a a small illustration where we have an Olympic gold medalist who was called darl peace and he wanted to give an arery exhibition in Central Park that's in New York so he would he wanted to shoot an arrow at an apple and someone was holding on to the apple and he was supposed to hit it directly or he misses and he hits the person and all go it goes bad and yeah so someone someone volunteered themselves to to do this and personally I think I wouldn't I think I wouldn't cuz it takes a lot of gut to put yourself on the line like on the line you could die you could M hit you you end up in hospital that's a lot of money being spent there I I personally wouldn't so someone volunteered themselves and surprisingly he hit it he hit the target and everyone applauded him k I want I want I just want to ask you would you would you put yourself in this situation if you were given the option two never I think that's that's I mean that's scary that's extremely scary I mean it either means you have a lot of trust in yourself that you won't die or like you can dodge the arrow flying at like Hulan speeds or you really trust this person which is hard that's really hard you've never met this person your whole life you only hear that are good Med medalist maybe you have seen them in Action a bit and know I'm not doing that I I presently like my life a little too much to take that risk yeah I think for me it will be such a difficult one considering should you know the guy was at a 30 Mard and beyond that all the media are covering the story so I think after the event there was a big celebration because heyen we survived and then the other guy we made it so on my part I wouldn't take that but I think coming to its application this is what we've been called as Christians to have this kind of an arrow sh at us every other day like that's the challenge you have so I think as Christians beyond the fact that this was a real thing as Christians this happens to us not just once but many other times like someone is shooting at you and should they miss you are gone but should you you overcome then you push through so I think for me as Christians as young people this is our test beyond the physical practical one which most of us may want to keep off but every day there comes at test so I I don't know yeah yourself did you say you would do it or I I would not do it no if if you were to do it I think you'd be very daring mhm in order for you to you know bring yourself into a situation like this so I I personally would not would not do that okay thank you very much thank you very much for that I think as we we share the bits the last bits of today's lesson maybe there are two or three questions I would want to ask to you the viewer one of the question ask us if think carefully about the following question and maybe you can answer through the chat or I don't know any of us who can respond if something happened to your church perhaps a fire that destroy the entire structure what would you be determined to do along with other members of the congregation so that is a question I'm asking to you if if fire just put on your structure that has been there for more than 20 or 30 years like our our church has been here for many years and then the other question is now think how the church would react if a wealthy neighbor a neighbor within the Valley Road you know the church is located a Long Valley Road within the Valley Road or milman Road um decided to rebuild the whole church at their own expense how do you think guys you will feel and that's another question and lastly how do you think the people of God responded to the decree to help rebuilding the temple so the two question relate to The Bu rebuilding of the temple so I would want to set it apart and ask you guys to tell us what you think um because it's it's such a question and a half you know it's such a question and a half considering someone is just coming from nowhere to the church and I would want just to ask um Miss to take us to a very small thing that is on the Friday Part just to ask us the very first question and I think all of us can give their closing points um maybe before Miss starts Sid you can tell us your Parting Shot maybe um um as we close today's lesson I just like to see you know um we just have to trust God like you enter the tunnel the light there's always at the end of the tunnel there's always light so you just have to trust God and he will lead you to that light thank you um few seconds teacher Johan also um sometimes building does not have to be building a church sometimes it looks like building better character maybe you want to start studying your Bible or you want to do something and there are so many challenges around um media many things happening but I hope this story will always remind us that God is also in the business of helping us in building our own lives and building better characters for heaven and then m can just read through the question maybe for our viewers absolutely so I mean the question here is like what Foundation are you choosing to build your life on that is like will you accept a shallow Sunday Foundation or will you dig down into the Bedrock but even as you build one should remember that one should be still and know that he is God Amen thank you and the last question from the same is think about your future where would you want to be let's say in five years 10 years or 15 that is something we leave to you my dear um um viewer that can challenge you and as we come to the end of the lesson mine is to pray that you keep on looking at it and that it may be a blessing too so let me request um the only lady to take us through the closing prayer teacher Joan okay let's pray dear Lord we come before you today we thank you because we have learned that when you have called us to build you have also called us to seek you to be our help and to be our guide I pray that Lord any time and discouragement is brought our way it may be a call to prayer and a call to a greater realization that we need you so much in our lives above all Lord I pray that we may not sink just because we have discouragement just because failure comes our way that that as we have learned in the story of zerubabel that will give us strength and even um increase our faith in you above all Lord please keep us and help us to continue to trust in you every single day it is in Christ's name that I pray trusting and believing amen amen

[165.6s] know how it's going to happen but
[167.9s] someone will die in the next month
[170.2s] teacher Allison pulled the school B
[172.4s] School van over to the side of the road
[174.9s] she thanked the boys for bravely share
[177.7s] sharing their fears she thanked thank
[180.1s] them for teaching her about Native
[181.8s] American culture she said she wanted to
[185.0s] share something as well here is what a
[187.5s] fox meant to me she
[189.5s] said a fox is a beautiful creature
[192.7s] created by God for our enjoyment it
[196.2s] doesn't have the power to impact our
[198.0s] family just because it crossed the road
[201.2s] she said she wanted the boys to know
[202.8s] that they didn't need to be scared when
[204.5s] they were with God so I'm just going to
[206.9s] pray for the folks and for us she said
[210.1s] bowing her head she prayed dear God
[213.3s] please give the folks a safe journey
[215.7s] please give us a safe journey too keep
[218.5s] the boys familyes safe and keep the boys
[221.2s] too know you the boys were surprised
[224.6s] that their teacher had taken the time to
[226.9s] pray several didn't look pleased with
[229.1s] the prayer but teach Allison didn't
[231.8s] mind the boys didn't need to need to
[235.1s] like the prayer they had to had a good
[237.7s] skiing with a good day skiing with with
[240.0s] her and she hoped that they would know
[242.2s] the power of God the boys sat in silence
[245.4s] for the rest of the drive back to school
[247.6s] no one wanted to talk teer Allison
[250.0s] turned on some Christian music a month
[252.6s] passed then a boy from the van came toer
[254.9s] Allison he said that he and the other
[258.7s] boys from the van realized that a month
[261.1s] has passed since they saw the FKS
[264.1s] crossing the road and no one in their
[265.8s] family had
[267.0s] died you know we were talking about it
[270.2s] and we realized that nothing happened to
[272.0s] our families after you prayed he said
[275.2s] teacher Allison was so happy not only
[277.8s] had God heard her prayer but the boys
[280.0s] also are beginning to trust God pray for

[332.3s] [Music]
[340.2s] [Music]
[354.7s] no
[386.9s] oh oh
[392.5s] [Music]
[396.6s] know
[406.2s] [Music]
[438.2s] oh
[449.8s] go
[467.5s] [Music]
[478.2s] [Music]
[483.6s] yes good morning good afternoon and good
[486.1s] evening my fellow listeners the young
[490.1s] people and each and everyone of us who
[492.5s] is tuned in and listening to today's
[494.8s] lesson so today's lesson as you build up
[498.2s] from the previous one is entitled build
[500.4s] it um and equally which also comes from
[504.6s] the prophet and Kings chapter 48 which
[507.1s] is also entitled not by power nor by
[509.6s] might and as we focus on today's lesson
[512.5s] which will be trying to encourage us to
[515.5s] allow God you know like Romans chapter
[518.5s] Malachi chter 3: 6 which speaks about
[521.5s] that God never changes or does not
[524.4s] change we are being encouraged today we
[526.5s] try to look at the story of building of
[528.5s] the Temple of how we should allow God to
[532.2s] build the same Temple that was built
[535.0s] physically in our hearts so that is my
[537.2s] prayer today and as you listen to us
[539.9s] even as we do an introduction of our
[541.8s] panelist that we ought to have this call
[545.7s] in our minds we ought to call have this
[547.9s] call in our hearts that of encouraging
[551.0s] of Allowing God to use us and of
[553.7s] Allowing God to be with us as we go
[556.7s] about this life because if God doesn't
[559.3s] have a place in our hearts like build a
[561.0s] temple in our hearts then we may not be
[562.9s] able to push through so however as we
[565.3s] think about that I would want to request
[567.4s] my panelist to introduce themselves
[569.6s] starting from my
[571.6s] left um good morning my name is
[575.9s] Sid i i am miss samban I'm excited to
[579.4s] jump into this lesson with you and I
[581.4s] really like the pun you used as you were
[583.3s] starting your introduction thank you
[586.4s] hello my name is teacher Joan I am happy
[589.3s] to dive into this yes yeah thank you
[592.4s] very much so I think to start us up I'll
[594.6s] request my brother Sid to pray with us
[596.7s] so that we can
[598.0s] start okay let believe and pray our
[600.9s] heavenly father you come through you
[602.3s] this morning we thank you for Gift of
[604.4s] Life your guidance and protection and
[605.9s] for all the things that you've given
[607.1s] unto us Lord as we about to start this
[609.5s] lesson I pray that you may help us
[611.2s] understand and that we may be able to
[613.5s] apply it in our our lives for this I
[616.8s] pray in Jesus name amen amen thank you
[620.2s] very much for taking us through so I
[621.8s] think from today's lesson it's actually
[624.3s] clear that in every of our daily
[628.8s] engagements
[630.2s] in every of our usual engagements
[633.5s] whether we are at school whether we are
[635.5s] working whether we run businesses we
[637.3s] will definitely face objection we
[639.8s] usually come through challenges and
[642.2s] similar to our lives every other day we
[644.5s] also learned today that there was a bit
[646.4s] of rejection when the remnant of Judah
[650.3s] led by zeru barel Were Meant to build
[655.4s] the temple there was lots of objection
[658.1s] there was lots of issues here and there
[660.7s] and and above all Beyond everything all
[664.0s] as a title of prophet and King's mention
[666.6s] not by power nor by might at the end of
[669.2s] it all it happened because the temple
[673.0s] and the Church of God was neither B to
[675.5s] This World by any of us it was brought
[678.0s] by God so whether the rejection comes or
[680.6s] doesn't come at the end of the day the
[682.2s] person who preserves the church which
[684.2s] actually should be in our hearts is God
[687.0s] so it all tells you beyond the rejection
[689.4s] that we Face even as you try you know to
[692.2s] you young person as you listen to this
[694.0s] lesson even as you try to do your things
[697.1s] every day you trying to maybe share the
[698.9s] gospel you are trying to minister to
[700.4s] people you are trying to do something
[702.0s] for God you will definitely face
[704.0s] rejection but you are being encouraged
[706.4s] this day that we should not falter
[709.3s] because of the rejection but we should
[711.6s] instead remain and keep strong and so as
[714.6s] you try to delve in a little bit I would
[716.6s] want to request um my sister to slightly
[721.3s] guide us to tell us what the lesson is
[723.0s] all about I know it comes from Zachariah
[725.1s] chapter 2 and also e chapter 6 and
[727.6s] equally also Zariah 4 but maybe she
[730.0s] could give us maybe in a brief what do
[732.1s] you expect from today's
[734.2s] lesson um some of the things that we
[736.6s] expect from today's lesson is that um we
[740.5s] may be encouraged and uh we may be
[743.8s] encouraged to know that God is calling
[745.7s] us to do great things and though there
[747.8s] are times that we will face
[749.5s] discouragement we'll face um hard times
[753.1s] this story is meant to be um the
[756.2s] strength that we need and the hope that
[757.8s] we have been looking for to encourage us
[760.0s] to move forward without um any
[763.2s] hindrances the second thing is that uh
[766.0s] we are to learn that if we trust God
[769.8s] then God will give us the peace that we
[771.5s] need to carry out his work regardless of
[773.5s] the situation that we're in and finally
[776.4s] we are to this is to help us to respond
[779.6s] to the call that the call that God is
[781.8s] making to each and every one of us that
[783.9s] it is our responsibility to carry out
[786.1s] God's plan as young people in this last
[789.0s] day and age and if we trust him then we
[791.8s] will surely fulfill that which he has
[793.3s] called us to do thank you very much for
[796.3s] giving us the expectations for the
[798.0s] lesson and even as I'll be coming to you
[799.9s] a little bit later on let me come to my
[802.0s] brother Sid who will lead us into what
[804.1s] do you think maybe can take us through a
[806.0s] question or two so that we can get to
[808.6s] understand some of these questions how
[811.2s] they will spear us into aiming forward
[814.0s] and into understanding more so please
[815.6s] take us
[816.4s] through okay so in the what do you think
[819.5s] section we we will check it says we
[823.4s] check all the answers below that
[826.4s] describe God's end time
[829.5s] church and then we'll read the following
[833.9s] passages from the Bible and try to find
[837.7s] these and other characteristics of God's
[839.9s] end time Church um so we'll read Matthew
[844.4s] 7: 24 and
[847.6s] 25 um maybe miss you can read that one
[850.6s] for us right so brilliant so Matthew
[853.8s] chapter 7 verse 24 and 25 therefore
[858.5s] whoever hears these sayings of mine and
[861.0s] does them I will liken him to a wise man
[864.0s] who built his house on the rock and the
[866.4s] rain descended the floods came and and
[869.2s] the winds blew and beat on that house
[872.2s] and it did not fall for it was founded
[875.2s] on the
[877.6s] Rock okay can um then we have Matthew
[882.3s] chap 28 verse 19 and 20 maybe Joan you
[886.9s] could read that for
[890.3s] us um Matthew
[892.8s] 289 and um 20 this is what it says
[902.5s] 28 19 and 20 says go ye therefore and
[907.2s] teach All Nations baptizing them in the
[909.4s] name of the father and of the son and of
[911.9s] the Holy Ghost verse 20 teaching them to
[914.6s] observe all things whatsoever I have
[916.8s] commanded you and lo I Am With You
[919.6s] Always way even until the end of the
[921.4s] world
[922.9s] Amen we have Ephesians 2: 19 and 22
[931.9s] um teacher Kevin you can read that one
[933.6s] for
[935.0s] us Ephesians chapter
[938.3s] 2: 19 to 22 um this how he says now
[944.8s] therefore you are no longer strangers
[946.3s] and foreigners but fellow citizens with
[948.3s] the Saints and members of the household
[950.2s] of God vers 20 having been built on the
[953.0s] foundation of the Apostles and Prophets
[955.2s] Jesus Christ himself being the Chief
[957.7s] Cornerstone
[959.3s] in whom the whole building being fitted
[961.6s] together grows into a holy Temple of the
[963.4s] Lord vers 22 in whom you also are being
[966.6s] built together for a Dwelling Place of
[969.1s] God in the
[971.4s] spirit we also
[974.5s] have also have Revelation
[978.0s] 12:17 maybe you can go back to me sat
[980.7s] and the dragon was enraged with a woman
[983.2s] and he went to make war with the rest of
[985.0s] our Offspring who keep the Commandments
[987.2s] of God and have the test testimony of
[989.9s] Jesus
[991.4s] Christ and finally we have Revelation
[995.0s] 19:
[998.2s] 10 Revelation
[1000.4s] 197 it says let us be glad and rejoice
[1004.4s] and give honor to him for the marriage
[1006.7s] of the Lamb is come and his wife hath
[1008.8s] made herself ready and I fell at his
[1011.3s] feet to worship but he said to me see
[1015.2s] that you do that not I am your fellow
[1017.4s] servant and of your brethren who have
[1020.0s] the testimony of Jesus worship God for
[1022.8s] the testimony of Jesus is a spirit of
[1026.5s] Prophecy okay
[1029.0s] um uh so uh how is this knowledge about
[1033.8s] the church important for us who are
[1036.8s] living in the 21st
[1040.8s] century right I I one thing is as I see
[1044.0s] it this knowledge allows us to be able
[1046.4s] to accurately pinpoint God end time
[1049.3s] church cuz I believe this is giving
[1051.3s] defining characteristics and one thing I
[1053.2s] can say for a fact is that pretty much
[1056.4s] every denomination or religion and
[1058.7s] whatnot claims to be the Endtime church
[1062.7s] I would say so is that not the case that
[1065.4s] is they all make the same claims not
[1068.6s] withstanding they don't all fit the the
[1071.6s] criteria a good number come close but
[1074.6s] based to based on a few doctrinal things
[1078.3s] that are that deviate from the Bible
[1081.2s] they fail to achieve to the full
[1084.9s] specification
[1087.6s] yeah else yeah I think I could add onto
[1092.1s] the knowledge is it important is the
[1095.0s] knowledge you learn from the Bible
[1096.2s] important for this Century that we are
[1097.7s] living in of course because as you go to
[1100.0s] what do you think section I think
[1101.1s] there's something that one of the one of
[1103.3s] the points that mention is that the
[1104.7s] church has a worldwi mission and message
[1106.9s] and that is important for us the aspect
[1109.3s] have realized is that Jesus is the head
[1110.8s] of the church and the Chief Cornerstone
[1112.6s] so that means Beyond everything if
[1114.6s] Christ was not in the middle of this
[1116.4s] then there wouldn't be need for us to
[1117.9s] worship for us to to have relevance for
[1120.3s] us to for even this knowledge you know
[1122.5s] for even this Mission there wouldn't be
[1124.0s] need and and equally the third one that
[1126.0s] that comes across is that God's end time
[1128.5s] church has a spirit of prophecy through
[1130.6s] the writings of Val and white and that
[1132.2s] is actually true which we find that from
[1134.9s] Revelation I think 12:17 and equally
[1137.1s] elaborated further in re
[1139.4s] CH 19 and: 10 you know so I think for me
[1143.7s] for I as a person individually if I was
[1146.6s] to learn this knowledge and I don't get
[1149.1s] to share it with others and I don't get
[1152.7s] to uh put myself in the context that I'm
[1155.7s] supposed to be like you know if you
[1156.9s] learn something then you're supposed to
[1158.2s] change accordingly then there wouldn't
[1160.1s] be any need but practically and today
[1163.7s] then this information is important so
[1165.4s] that you can even know what is happening
[1167.9s] in the world
[1169.8s] mhm okay that's it for the what do you
[1172.8s] think section yeah thank you very much
[1175.0s] and I think um as you go on we've also
[1179.1s] learned that from um prophet and Kings
[1181.7s] chapter 48 that the story of rebuilding
[1185.4s] the temple was an interesting story and
[1188.0s] and there are a number of things that
[1189.4s] you get to learn and and one of it is
[1191.2s] from the flashlight even as I will
[1193.0s] invite my brother to take us through
[1194.4s] chapter 48 but I would love to read the
[1196.7s] flashlight which says throughout the
[1198.3s] history of God's people great mountains
[1200.8s] of difficulty apparently insurmountable
[1203.9s] have loomed up before those who are
[1206.0s] trying to carry out purposes of Heaven
[1208.4s] such obstacles are permitted by the Lord
[1211.5s] as a test of faith when you are hedged
[1213.6s] about on every side this is a Time above
[1216.7s] all others to trust in God and the power
[1219.8s] of His Spirit the exercise of our living
[1223.1s] faith means an increase of spiritual
[1226.2s] strength and the development of UN
[1228.7s] falter in trust that is Page 594 prophet
[1231.7s] and Kings my brother please take us
[1233.5s] briefly and expon more on prophet and
[1236.0s] Kings and the thing is I believe this is
[1237.8s] expounded even further when we take a
[1240.4s] step a page forward
[1243.5s] 595 we are informed that the way of the
[1246.0s] world is to begin with pump and boasting
[1248.6s] God's way is to make the day of small
[1251.1s] things the beginning of the Glorious
[1253.1s] Triumph of Truth and righteousness and I
[1256.6s] I dare say that the way the building
[1258.8s] happened it seemed such a small thing at
[1261.6s] first I believe even the tribes around
[1263.9s] were like what are you guys doing but of
[1266.3s] course it was from that small thing of
[1268.7s] oh high this is a rubbel he is like
[1271.5s] fresh he has no idea where he is but now
[1273.9s] he Scouts the place then he's encouraged
[1276.2s] by Zarah that you know what even though
[1278.6s] this may not look like much we can still
[1282.0s] raise this to a great deal and of course
[1285.0s] over time the the obstacle seems
[1287.5s] insurmountable they were surrounded on
[1290.0s] all sides by people who all they wanted
[1293.2s] is they wanted just to crush them like
[1295.7s] insects however they stood firm that is
[1299.2s] they were willing to stand strong in
[1302.4s] what the Lord had said and that is how
[1304.4s] SAS I know let me not spoil that could
[1307.1s] you kindly take us through that section
[1309.1s] the interesting story um the interesting
[1311.8s] story that you get to go through is um
[1315.5s] basically the story of um a man called
[1318.6s] zabel who was a Jewish leader and he was
[1322.9s] determined to build the walls of
[1324.7s] Jerusalem and there was so much
[1326.8s] discouragement that was happening um
[1328.7s] around him and God in his Mercy sends
[1331.1s] Zechariah who gives encouragement to him
[1333.8s] and tells him do not worry um actually
[1337.1s] we can read something from the book of
[1339.2s] Zechariah just to see what he said to
[1341.0s] him as a means of encouragement that's
[1343.4s] Zechariah 4:6 if someone gets there they
[1346.6s] can read that for us yes and I have I am
[1349.4s] right there so he answered and said to
[1351.6s] to me this is the word of the Lord to
[1354.4s] zerubabel not by might nor by power but
[1358.8s] by my spirit says the Lord of hosts
[1362.4s] exactly so this is what Zechariah tells
[1364.2s] him and zerubabel um is
[1368.2s] thinking we we've already started we've
[1370.6s] had the plans and so many things are are
[1373.2s] are are starting to happen but then it
[1375.0s] looks like there's so much
[1375.9s] discouragement around and God in his
[1378.2s] Mercy s Zariah and one lesson I'd want
[1381.8s] us to pick from this is that many times
[1384.3s] when we are discouraged God can see it
[1386.7s] and God can send people our way who can
[1389.3s] be able to encourage Us in the journey
[1391.4s] or who can be able to give us strength
[1394.5s] to do that which he has called us to do
[1396.1s] so Zechariah encourages him and years
[1399.4s] later there comes a king called King
[1401.6s] Cyrus who eventually um gives a decree
[1405.5s] that the temple should be built and the
[1408.6s] temple is built and it is amazing how
[1412.0s] everything that concerns the temple is
[1414.2s] taken care of by King Cyrus all the
[1416.8s] money in fact King Cyrus goes ahead and
[1419.0s] says all the animals that will be needed
[1421.9s] for
[1422.7s] sacrifices um he ordered that all the
[1425.0s] money should be gotten from the Royal uh
[1426.9s] reserve and that money should be given
[1428.8s] to these people so that they can be able
[1430.6s] to do all the sacrifices they need for
[1433.2s] the temple I don't know what you get
[1434.5s] from that MTI something applicable to
[1436.5s] your life today so that's that's that's
[1438.8s] an interesting thing that that despite
[1441.5s] insurmountable obstacles I believe we
[1444.0s] are able to face through them and I love
[1446.5s] to hear from you Sid that is so from
[1449.7s] this story this insm seemingly I'd say
[1452.3s] seemingly insurmountable obstacles but
[1454.5s] seem the Lord had already made
[1456.5s] Provisions so what what do you see from
[1458.5s] this and how can this be impactful in
[1460.8s] our
[1462.3s] lives I'm sorry um I didn't quite
[1465.9s] understand the question so looking at
[1468.1s] this story of zerubabel the way that God
[1470.7s] said not by might not by power but by my
[1473.7s] spirit says the Lord of hosts will this
[1475.8s] thing be done so what insights do you
[1478.6s] get from this what strikes you from this
[1481.4s] the way it can be applicable in our
[1483.3s] lives um so it's it's
[1489.0s] really it's it's it's it's kind of hits
[1492.8s] you you know you can't do this on your
[1494.3s] own mhm yeah can't do this on your own
[1497.2s] so you need
[1499.1s] you'll need God's help in order to do
[1502.3s] certain things that's that's really
[1505.7s] something
[1506.8s] that not many people would
[1510.0s] understand
[1511.5s] but
[1513.1s] it's it's it's really an interesting
[1516.0s] thing to know cuz you know sometimes
[1519.2s] your your ego it's it's like oh you can
[1522.4s] do this one on your own and then you
[1523.7s] come to realize you can't and you need
[1526.8s] the help of God to to do some of these
[1529.6s] things so it's it's quite interesting
[1531.6s] yeah
[1532.9s] absolutely yeah I think for me if I was
[1535.9s] to just get back to the prophet and
[1540.7s] kings that um that's page 595 that says
[1544.3s] human power and human did not establish
[1547.6s] the Church of God and neither can they
[1549.6s] destroy it not on the rock of human
[1551.4s] strength but on Christ Jesus the Rock of
[1553.7s] Ages was a church founded and the Gates
[1556.5s] of Hell shall not Prevail against it and
[1558.9s] you get something also from Matthew
[1560.6s] 16:18 so that means
[1563.5s] that the
[1566.2s] temple was established on God's strength
[1571.7s] and that is the same strength and power
[1574.3s] that can be able to destroy it so in the
[1577.4s] similar case it is neither by our power
[1581.6s] or by our might that we overcome the
[1584.2s] challenges you go through you know um I
[1586.9s] I came across something also from the
[1588.5s] same book that says success will come to
[1590.5s] them as they struggle against
[1592.4s] difficulties so in other words we as
[1595.6s] young people as you go through the
[1598.0s] lesson we get to learn that when you go
[1600.4s] through challenges success will come yes
[1603.0s] when you go through trying and tough
[1604.9s] times we will even face more
[1607.3s] difficulties but we are not to give up
[1609.4s] because it is not by our power but by
[1613.8s] God's spirit that we are able to
[1615.8s] overcome so it gives you the trend that
[1617.6s] it could be a test of faith yes God may
[1620.5s] allow the challenge or the test to come
[1622.5s] yes but are we to fight it on our own no
[1625.5s] because neither or none of us created
[1627.8s] themselves so whoever is our creator
[1630.3s] then understands the person they created
[1632.1s] so we are to go to God and not only when
[1634.1s] you're going through challenges but all
[1635.7s] the time so I think that's how I
[1636.9s] understand it and I believe it should be
[1638.6s] my guide even when you're trying to come
[1640.4s] up with a plan proposal you know you at
[1642.5s] school you're trying to come up with
[1644.1s] these suggestions or something it's
[1646.0s] always good to consult God actually he's
[1648.6s] told us that commit your plans to him
[1650.8s] and they will establish them thank
[1653.9s] you so back to teacher Johan yeah
[1656.2s] absolutely there are questions in that
[1658.0s] story that I would really love for you
[1659.7s] to ask us cuz I think they allow us to
[1662.6s] really explore this story in such a
[1666.0s] fascinating manner so you can handpick
[1668.2s] one or two to allow us to explore
[1671.7s] this okay so let's do the first
[1675.3s] question uh this will go to you Miss
[1679.4s] it says what do you find unique about
[1681.5s] Ezra's message the first part of into
[1684.1s] the story absolutely so the thing is and
[1687.5s] I'll read this in our hearing that is so
[1690.8s] Ezra declared let the temple be rebuilt
[1693.5s] as a place to present sacrifices and let
[1696.0s] its foundations be laid and this is
[1697.6s] where he goes into like the mathematics
[1699.7s] 60 cubits high 60 cubits wide three cses
[1703.2s] of large stones and one of Timbers the
[1705.9s] cost are to be paid by the Royal
[1707.4s] Treasury gold silver which
[1710.7s] Nebuchadnezzar took and whatnot and he
[1713.6s] also decreed to do for these Elders of
[1716.1s] Jews in the like the elders like the
[1719.5s] house of the Lord expenses are to be
[1721.3s] fully paid out of the real treasury from
[1723.5s] the revenues and what not I mean the
[1725.9s] thing is this is this is interesting I
[1727.5s] have to say
[1729.6s] and wow I'd say wow I me it seems it
[1734.0s] seems fascinating like Ezra is showing
[1736.4s] us that King Cyrus was so dedicated to
[1739.7s] this like his heart was moved with so
[1742.4s] much love and compassion that he was
[1744.3s] like you know what you see all those
[1746.1s] taxes you see every single thing that
[1748.0s] was taken away from you I am giving it
[1751.0s] back and I'm giving it back with
[1754.0s] interest I think it's almost like like
[1756.7s] it's a throwback to like when these guys
[1758.4s] left Egypt when they left with the gold
[1761.5s] of the Egyptians of course and so and
[1764.1s] that gold is what beautified the temple
[1766.7s] so it's some sort of par where God is
[1769.6s] showing that truly he is who he says he
[1772.8s] is yes amen amen thank you so much so
[1775.8s] this goes to seed what do these passages
[1778.2s] tell us about God's love for
[1782.5s] Humanity
[1787.2s] um really I
[1789.4s] think it it shows how much God cares for
[1794.2s] us and um and how much he he he loves
[1799.4s] us so I I think that's that's what um I
[1804.1s] would say for this question he this
[1806.8s] passage it TR shows us how much he loves
[1809.0s] and cares for his people and he would go
[1812.2s] to any extent just to you
[1815.9s] know thank you yes maybe I can also add
[1819.1s] I think just to add on to what he just
[1821.5s] mentioned is that God will be with us
[1823.9s] even through this trying and challenging
[1826.8s] times yeah because come to think about
[1828.9s] it you will wake up settle down ready
[1831.4s] for work and then all of a sudden you
[1833.2s] get to the workplace and guys you know
[1835.4s] what um we have to dismiss you because
[1838.4s] the company is struggling and we realize
[1841.0s] that you know what you guys are so many
[1843.2s] and and they actually have to pick you
[1844.8s] but we've been encouraged today that
[1847.1s] even so in those tests of faith we are
[1851.6s] still to hold on firm and strong so I
[1853.8s] think that is one of them and actually
[1855.9s] you find it can happen even in school
[1858.0s] you preparing for this exam you
[1859.8s] preparing for this grade uh maybe you
[1862.1s] can talk of maybe year five year 10 year
[1864.8s] 12 you know those exams or form one form
[1867.2s] two and as you prepare and and you ready
[1869.9s] for it then all of a sudden on the exam
[1872.6s] day you realize hey I can't even do the
[1874.9s] exam because you unw you didn't do
[1876.6s] anything wrong you ready and all that
[1878.7s] but you have to go to hospital and they
[1880.3s] tell you you know what we'll have to set
[1882.1s] another exam and give you at our wish so
[1883.8s] some of these things will happen because
[1886.4s] um we've learned this In Our Lifetime
[1889.4s] that not all that we have planned may
[1893.0s] come to be not all things that we put
[1897.0s] together may come to be at the end but
[1899.8s] that which happens even if there are
[1901.9s] challenges then today's encouragement is
[1905.3s] God is with us so I think that's how
[1907.4s] I'll answer that and uh yeah I don't
[1909.6s] know if actually come to think of it and
[1912.0s] even in our challenges you know the word
[1913.6s] of the Lord that came to zerubabel after
[1916.2s] God declared that it is not by might not
[1918.3s] by power but he goes on to declare even
[1921.7s] further and this is actually so it's
[1923.0s] reported and actually has so many
[1925.0s] exclamations like who are you oh great
[1928.5s] Mountain before zerubabel you shall
[1931.5s] become a plane and he shall bring forth
[1934.8s] the Capstone with shouts of Grace Grace
[1938.2s] to it that's the thing so not only does
[1941.7s] God say that it shall be by might or by
[1944.4s] power and he goes on to say that by my
[1947.3s] power or by by the power of the spirit
[1950.2s] zerubabel shall level mountains you know
[1952.7s] the thing where Christ says is if you
[1954.6s] have faith the size of a master seed you
[1957.0s] shall say unto this mountain be moved
[1959.3s] and throw yourself into the sea and it
[1961.5s] shall be plunged Into the Depths and I
[1964.0s] believe that is the power of God yeah
[1966.8s] thank you very much for that and even as
[1968.6s] we wind up with our lesson this uh
[1971.1s] morning or this afternoon I would want
[1973.2s] to request my brother to take us through
[1975.2s] there's a certain story very interesting
[1977.4s] story
[1978.4s] that comes in our in our lesson whereby
[1981.1s] we get to learn of the aspect of even
[1983.6s] faith and I would want my brother just
[1985.5s] take us through maybe in a minute or so
[1987.5s] and so that we can learn something my
[1989.3s] brother s um so
[1992.1s] in um our teacher lesson we have a a
[1996.5s] small illustration where we have an
[1999.9s] Olympic gold medalist who was called
[2002.9s] darl peace and he wanted to give an
[2006.1s] arery exhibition in
[2008.6s] Central Park that's in New
[2010.5s] York so he would he wanted to shoot an
[2015.0s] arrow at an apple and someone was
[2017.7s] holding on to the apple and he was
[2020.8s] supposed to hit it
[2023.0s] directly or he misses and he hits the
[2026.3s] person and all go it goes bad and yeah
[2031.2s] so someone someone volunteered
[2033.8s] themselves to to do this and personally
[2038.4s] I think I
[2040.2s] wouldn't I think I wouldn't cuz it takes
[2043.4s] a lot of gut to put yourself on the
[2047.8s] line like on the line you could die you
[2051.4s] could M hit you you end up in hospital
[2054.4s] that's a lot of money being spent there
[2056.2s] I I personally wouldn't so someone
[2058.8s] volunteered themselves and surprisingly
[2061.1s] he hit it he hit the target and everyone
[2065.3s] applauded him k I want I want I just
[2068.9s] want to ask you would you would you put
[2071.5s] yourself in this
[2073.2s] situation if you were given the option
[2077.2s] two
[2080.2s] never I think that's that's I mean
[2082.5s] that's scary that's extremely scary I
[2085.0s] mean it either means you have a lot of
[2087.4s] trust in yourself that you won't die or
[2089.6s] like you can dodge the arrow flying at
[2092.1s] like Hulan speeds or you really trust
[2095.1s] this person which is hard that's really
[2098.4s] hard you've never met this person your
[2099.8s] whole life you only hear that are good
[2101.6s] Med medalist maybe you have seen them in
[2103.7s] Action a bit and know I'm not doing that
[2106.4s] I I presently like my life a little too
[2108.5s] much to take that risk yeah I think for
[2111.9s] me it will be such a difficult one
[2116.7s] considering should you know the guy was
[2119.5s] at a 30 Mard and beyond that all the
[2122.8s] media are covering the story so I think
[2124.9s] after the event there was a big
[2127.0s] celebration because heyen we survived
[2129.8s] and then the other guy we made it so on
[2132.2s] my part I wouldn't take that but I think
[2135.1s] coming to its application this is what
[2137.8s] we've been called as Christians to have
[2140.4s] this kind of an arrow sh at us every
[2142.8s] other day like that's the challenge you
[2144.7s] have so I think as Christians beyond the
[2147.1s] fact that this was a real thing as
[2148.9s] Christians this happens to us not just
[2151.3s] once but many other times like someone
[2153.7s] is shooting at you and should they miss
[2156.0s] you are gone but should you you overcome
[2158.5s] then you push through so I think for me
[2160.5s] as Christians as young people this is
[2162.7s] our test beyond the physical practical
[2165.8s] one which most of us may want to keep
[2168.8s] off but every day there comes at test so
[2172.7s] I I don't know yeah yourself did you say
[2175.9s] you would do it or I I would not do it
[2179.3s] no if if you were to do it I think you'd
[2182.4s] be very daring mhm in order for you to
[2185.7s] you know bring yourself into a situation
[2187.3s] like this so I I personally would not
[2190.6s] would not do that okay thank you very
[2193.3s] much thank you very much for that I
[2195.1s] think as we we share the bits the last
[2198.9s] bits of today's lesson maybe there are
[2200.9s] two or three questions I would want to
[2202.6s] ask to you the viewer one of the
[2204.8s] question ask us if think carefully about
[2207.5s] the following question and maybe you can
[2209.6s] answer through the chat or I don't know
[2211.9s] any of us who can respond if something
[2213.8s] happened to your church perhaps a fire
[2216.2s] that destroy the entire structure what
[2218.1s] would you be determined to do along with
[2220.5s] other members of the congregation so
[2222.2s] that is a question I'm asking to you if
[2224.0s] if fire just put on your structure that
[2226.2s] has been there for more than 20 or 30
[2228.1s] years like our our church has been here
[2230.0s] for many years and then the other
[2232.0s] question is now think how the church
[2234.4s] would react if a wealthy neighbor a
[2236.6s] neighbor within the Valley Road you know
[2238.7s] the church is located a Long Valley Road
[2240.6s] within the Valley Road or milman Road um
[2243.4s] decided to rebuild the whole church at
[2245.2s] their own expense how do you think guys
[2247.5s] you will feel and that's another
[2248.8s] question and lastly how do you think the
[2251.3s] people of God responded to the decree to
[2255.1s] help rebuilding the temple so the two
[2257.4s] question relate to The Bu rebuilding of
[2259.0s] the temple so I would want to set it
[2261.1s] apart and ask you guys to tell us what
[2263.2s] you think um because it's it's such a
[2266.1s] question and a half you know it's such a
[2268.4s] question and a half considering someone
[2270.0s] is just coming from nowhere to the
[2271.6s] church and I would want just to ask um
[2274.9s] Miss to take us to a very small thing
[2277.2s] that is on the Friday Part just to ask
[2280.4s] us the very first question and I think
[2283.2s] all of us can give their closing points
[2285.8s] um maybe before Miss starts Sid you can
[2288.5s] tell us your Parting Shot maybe um um as
[2292.2s] we close today's lesson I just like to
[2294.7s] see you know um we just have to trust
[2299.0s] God like you enter the tunnel the light
[2302.8s] there's always at the end of the tunnel
[2304.5s] there's always light so you just have to
[2307.2s] trust God and he will lead you to that
[2309.8s] light thank you um few seconds teacher
[2312.7s] Johan also um sometimes building does
[2314.9s] not have to be building a church
[2316.8s] sometimes it looks like building better
[2319.2s] character maybe you want to start
[2320.5s] studying your Bible or you want to do
[2322.3s] something and there are so many
[2323.7s] challenges around um media many things
[2327.3s] happening but I hope this story will
[2329.3s] always remind us that God is also in the
[2331.7s] business of helping us in building our
[2333.5s] own lives and building better characters
[2335.4s] for heaven and then m can just read
[2338.2s] through the question maybe for our
[2339.9s] viewers absolutely so I mean the
[2341.2s] question here is like what Foundation
[2343.4s] are you choosing to build your life on
[2346.6s] that is like will you accept a shallow
[2349.7s] Sunday Foundation or will you dig down
[2352.2s] into the Bedrock but even as you build
[2355.2s] one should remember that one should be
[2357.0s] still and know that he is God Amen thank
[2361.6s] you and the last question from the same
[2363.5s] is think about your future where would
[2365.9s] you want to be let's say in five years
[2367.9s] 10 years or 15 that is something we
[2370.2s] leave to you my dear um um viewer that
[2373.8s] can challenge you and as we come to the
[2375.7s] end of the lesson mine is to pray that
[2377.4s] you keep on looking at it and that it
[2379.4s] may be a blessing too so let me request
[2381.9s] um the only lady to take us through the
[2385.7s] closing prayer teacher Joan okay let's
[2389.4s] pray dear Lord we come before you today
[2392.4s] we thank you because we have learned
[2393.9s] that when you have called us to build
[2396.0s] you have also called us to seek you to
[2399.0s] be our help and to be our guide I pray
[2401.6s] that Lord any time and discouragement is
[2404.2s] brought our way it may be a call to
[2405.8s] prayer and a call to a greater
[2407.6s] realization that we need you so much in
[2409.7s] our lives above all Lord I pray that we
[2412.2s] may not sink just because we have
[2413.9s] discouragement just because failure
[2415.6s] comes our way that that as we have
[2418.1s] learned in the story of zerubabel that
[2420.5s] will give us strength and even um
[2424.3s] increase our faith in you above all Lord
[2426.9s] please keep us and help us to continue
[2428.8s] to trust in you every single day it is
[2431.1s] in Christ's name that I pray trusting
[2433.1s] and believing amen amen
