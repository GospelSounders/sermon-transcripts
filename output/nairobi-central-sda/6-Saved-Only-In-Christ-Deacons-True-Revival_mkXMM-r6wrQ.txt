FULL TRANSCRIPT:
good morning and good evening depending on where you're watching us from uh we want to welcome you again to this week and uh reviewing the book uh to Revival and this week uh chapter is chapter six saved only in Christ I remember last week we talked about the balance in faith and works and we realized that uh we have called upon us as faithful Christians to to have a a life that is balanced together with me we have my brothers brother Nick and brother Steve I'll just have them to introduce themselves hello everyone glad you've joined us today hello good morning good evening welcome my name is Steven mug and I'm Nik thank you my my myself is uh brother hayanga and this week we being taken through by our brother Nick and uh brother nick uh please just before you pray uh after you pray please uh just tell us how you see this title he will save me now what does it really mean thank you okay we'll do that before we begin we can say a short prayer loving God and Father we are grateful that we have a chance to discuss this book once more please guide our thoughts and please fill us with your spirit and help us to understand how to be saved only in Christ in Jesus name amen he will save me now when I think about the thief on the cross I actually see somebody who was saved right now not at a l time when Christ say most assuredly I say to to you today you shall be with me in Paradise he wasn't saying that you'll be with me in heaven today but he was giving him a promise that when the Kingdom of Heaven is coming for sure the thief on the cross would be with Jesus in heaven we are so when we talk about he will save me now God is saying the moment you repent of your sin and accept the gift of the Son of God you cannot be overcome he will surely work to bring you to heaven and save you and this gives me assurance that God is serious about what he's saying he's not just looking to tell us that I have died for you he's saying I'm actually going to walk with you to ensure that you're saved I like the statement from this book that said this is Page 47 that a life in Christ is a life of restfulness a life in Christ is a life of restfulness I can imagine all the things that we go through in life and many times we might have all sorts of problems but Christ is saying if you come to me you will actually truly have rest I experienced this when talking to one of my friends the other day and the Sabbath was coming to an end and they said sometimes I dread the hours the Sabbath is coming to an end because the rest that they're experiencing is actually going to go now how do we ensure that we have rest even through the week such that we don't dread the things that will come to us in fact labor and work was given to us as a blessing but sometimes the labors May wear us out to the point we think when will we get rest now if we read this statement it's basically saying we can have rest during the week if we are dependent on Christ as we walk we can say a word of prayer as we go through our chores we can even take some time to read some of the promises that God has and if we are saved only in Christ it means that we can count on Christ to overcome any satanic or evil agencies that bring themselves to battle against us we're told that the devil is like a roaring lion walking about seeking to devour us and that's something we need to always be careful about the book says abundant grace has been provided that the believing soul may be kept free from sin this is actually from The Lord's Prayer where it says lead us not into temptation but Deliver Us from Evil it's a prayer that we can make to God every day asking him God save me from the Ws of the devil now there's something we are warned about which is called Peter's problem MH which is pride and self-sufficiency now pride and self-sufficiency is something which we need to be careful about and I'd like to just read a short statement here that says of all the sins it is the most hopeless and the most incurable now Peter didn't fall all at once he just thought that he could always obey God at all times but we actually learn that if we have self-sufficiency we might think that it is enough for us to actually be saved and Peter was a victim of this many times I don't know if panelists you can share with me some of the instances that you can think about when Peter was rush to do something then he had to walk back his statement any quick examples that come to your mind yes yes I remember during the the the Last Supper mhm when Christ uh Peter never understood the miss of Christ M then when he saw Christ washing the disciples feet when it was his turn he said Lord not me MH but Christ says that if you don't take part in this uh this holy convocation you're not part of me then it proceed and says now not just the the feet wash everything my head and my so we seeing that it was very actionable M but sometimes it was too fast without that thought process yeah so we can be we can be very active but the spirit is not leading so once we surrender that self-sufficient should die and always lean not on our own understanding but plug in into Christ and the Holy Spirit you'll find that now he'll be able to lead you thank you brother Steve amen amen I think Peter Peter indeed is a is a model Christian we we get so much from Peter and we live Peter's life on a on on an everyday basis because sometimes we are over zealous um you know and and we tend to rush we are quick to our feet on our feet and we tend to rush into decisions and for in case of Peter's examples remember when when Peter was was in the in the um in the courts it was cold at night and he was he was warming himself around the bonfire and and you know as Jesus predicted uh Peter denied Jesus m uh three times and and and and because he did not reflect of of God's warning or God's promise um or or or let me call it God's warning he did not sit back and reflect after he made that mistake he when he was quick again to do what to realize his sins and he quickly confessed I mean another quick um Cas is when um he slashed um or cut one of the soldiers yeah um yeah and and of course Christ ministered to him and um and I think what the lesson we get from Peter is that Peter accepted eventually Peter accepted Christ this is really the object lesson Peter later on accepted Christ repented you know true repentance and was confident to say that truly Christ saved him and he trusted in him um going forward so I think that those are the examples that we give pet yeah Peter Peter is an interesting character he said Christ I will never leave you and he denies him when he's called out to walk on the boat he sees that he's walking then he now starts feeling the self-sufficiency and he's telling the disciples you see I can also walk on water myself and when his heart just began to be lifted up he starts drowning and Christ tells him I am the one who can save you and that's why we say saved only in Christ because we're trying to understand that Christ is the one who is enabling us to do the things we are able to do Philippians 4:3 says I can do all things through Christ who strengthens me not through the strength that I have so as we've been talking about the several themes in this book through the various chapters faith and works faith it is God that gives us work it's God Christ that gives us so I wouldn't want us to be mistaken that this is things that we are doing ourselves because the moment you fall you now also get into depression because you think that it is your own power that is giving you this and I'd like us to read a very important verse in the Bible that talks about this 1 Corinthians chapter 10 verse2 1 Corinthians CH 10:12 the Bible says uh even as you get there I can start at verse 11 it says now all these things happen unto them as examples and they are written for admonition upon whom the ends of the world have come now this was talking about the experience of Moses and Israel in the wilderness and those are the things being written to us as examples now how does he conclude this in verse 12 he says wherefore let him that thinks he done take heed lest he thinking about this and I'm just trying to see that's the the pet syndrome that even ask you should have when you think you very good in church when you think you have been endowed with the gift of knowledge the gift of Tong prophecy and all these things that's when you're most susceptible before before that's now why when we are truly revived and we feel that the power of God is working in us it's the time when we need to be most humble because that's the time we are most susceptible to fall yes in fact there's a statement here that I think was really cutting deep because I I've seen it in some Churches where people say I am saved now this is what was written those who accept Christ and in their first confidence say I am saved are in danger of trusting to themselves they lose sight of their own weakness and the constant need of divine strength so what is our safety our only safety is in constant distrust of self and dependence on Christ absolutely so we have dying to self daily yes I Die daily which means you don't have life absolutely yeah and that's why I believe it's Galatians 2:20 says uh that I am crucified with Christ yet not I but Christ lives in me and the life which I now live in the flesh I live by the power of Jesus Christ because the moment we just think today that I am saved and I can't get lost that's the moment that get lost I don't know if any of you has any comments or additions here I no you you've expounded it so so well I I I don't think we have anything um to add here but I I agree I mean we need to kill that self-confidence in ourselves because we we are nothing and and you know often times we pray and tell God that you know reduces um as you increase and that that that ought to be um our mantra in this walk of Salvation in this walk of faith that every day it's only God that should be saved should only glorify God and how do we do that is by understanding that we are sinful in nature okay and I like I like that I would I would really like to repeat it brother ni it says those who accept Christ and in their first confidence say I am saved that is self-destruction itself St white tells us that you in danger of what of trusting to yourself and that is the beginning of self-destruction or self-sufficiency that's the bit that I want uh my my my my contribution will be just want to address this issue of becoming comfortable or becoming familiar with holy things here we realize that I've always given this example where the first time you gave your life to Christ even your walking style only it's it's so Majestic and uh and in humility it even portrays the character of Christ but with time you become familiar so we being to you don't don't rest don't be satisfied and you know this word satisfaction it's um I always find it like a bit of a very controversial word cuz you realize that uh I'll be feeling angry right now MH I'll have I'll take food to my feeling mhm but and then immediately I finish that food I say hey now satisfied then a few hours later I'm in the same cycle I need that food so this is we should hunger for this word of Christ every single day every single minute because we can't live without the bread of life thank you to you as as we bring this to a conclusion I liked the way Ellen White captured the relation that exists between us and Christ if we are saved only in Christ it means that we are connected to the True Vine Christ says I am the vine you the branches now it is here in the book as we read that as we grow closer to the vine even the branches will start looking like the vine so the more and more we grow closer to Christ the only evidence and way we can tell that we are saved is by our resemblance to the vine now this is not something that you go and tell people that I look like Christ but this is something that people see in you and by God's grace you may be saved not because you're the one professing it but it's because others say it but also when people start saying it sometimes I believe Ellen White writes even in another place that it's not good good to go and pray someone too much because you might cause them to stumble and fall so that's why First Corinthians said let him that things he turns take he so closing statement I give a union with Christ by Living Faith is enduring and every other Union must perish it is a union of utter dependence the branches are nourished only through connection to the vine if a branch is sered from the main Vine then it dies so there must be a painful work of Detachment as well as a work of attachment we detach from the things in the world mhm attach and cl closer to the vine so that we can be nourished with the nutrients that are there so after we have United with Christ we told this can only be preserved by an honest by Honest prayer and untiring effort and I liked it as you said it we die daily so that we might get life from the lifegiver himself something that we need to do constantly and every day then after that we deny ourself M conquer self we deny and Conquer self by watchfulness prayer and faith in God to be the one to sa and as a result we gain the victory so that was all chapter six about being saved only in Christ so please keep watching and reading the book with us and next week we want to look at chapter 7even which is Beware of the counter now we've talked about true Revival but there are some revivals that are fake what do this involve what does it mean that will be coming up in our next chapter of the book please tune in once more next week as we continue reading this book May God richly bless you yes brother Steve please close this for us with a word of prayer okay let us pray Our Father once again we come before you Lord you've given us the privilege and the blessing and gift of Prayer Lord we will not Tire to always come before your presence thank you so much for taking us through this week's lesson Lord it is our prayer dear father that you shall sustain us you shall help us to understand what the power of the Holy Spirit would like us to um to understand even as we walk this faith of Life as we prepare for next week Lord It's So prayer that you shall guide us you shall be with us protect us until then it is in Jesus name we pray amen amen and

TIMESTAMPED TRANSCRIPT:
[0.4s] good morning and good evening depending
[2.4s] on where you're watching us from uh we
[4.6s] want to welcome you again to this week
[7.4s] and uh reviewing the book uh to Revival
[12.1s] and this week uh chapter is chapter six
[14.8s] saved only in Christ I remember last
[17.7s] week we talked about the balance in
[20.0s] faith and works and we realized that uh
[23.6s] we have called upon us as faithful
[25.7s] Christians to to have a a life that is
[29.0s] balanced together with me we have my
[31.4s] brothers brother Nick and brother Steve
[34.3s] I'll just have them to introduce
[37.7s] themselves hello everyone glad you've
[40.2s] joined us
[42.4s] today hello good morning good
[46.3s] evening welcome my name is Steven mug
[49.4s] and I'm Nik thank you my my myself is uh
[54.1s] brother hayanga and this week we being
[57.9s] taken through by our brother Nick and
[61.0s] uh brother nick uh please just before
[64.1s] you pray uh after you pray please uh
[67.6s] just tell us how you see this title he
[70.9s] will save me now what does it really
[74.3s] mean thank you okay we'll do that before
[77.8s] we begin we can say a short
[80.2s] prayer loving God and Father we are
[82.8s] grateful that we have a chance to
[84.8s] discuss this book once more please guide
[87.5s] our thoughts and please fill us with
[89.2s] your spirit and help us to understand
[91.9s] how to be saved only in Christ in Jesus
[95.0s] name
[96.5s] amen he will save me
[99.2s] now when I think about the thief on the
[101.9s] cross I actually see somebody who was
[103.9s] saved right now not at a l time when
[107.5s] Christ say most assuredly I say to to
[110.6s] you today you shall be with me in
[113.0s] Paradise he wasn't saying that you'll be
[115.6s] with me in heaven today but he was
[117.8s] giving him a promise that when the
[120.0s] Kingdom of Heaven is coming for sure the
[122.5s] thief on the cross would be with Jesus
[124.4s] in heaven we are so when we talk about
[127.5s] he will save me now God is saying the
[130.8s] moment you repent of your sin and accept
[133.5s] the gift of the Son of God you cannot be
[137.3s] overcome he will surely work to bring
[140.6s] you to heaven and save you and this
[143.5s] gives me assurance that God is serious
[146.3s] about what he's saying he's not just
[148.6s] looking to tell us that I have died for
[151.2s] you he's saying I'm actually going to
[153.4s] walk with you to ensure that you're
[155.9s] saved I like the statement from this
[158.4s] book that said this is Page 47 that a
[162.6s] life in Christ is a life of restfulness
[167.1s] a life in Christ is a life of
[170.8s] restfulness I can imagine all the things
[173.4s] that we go through in life and many
[176.4s] times we might have all sorts of
[179.4s] problems
[180.6s] but Christ is saying if you come to me
[183.5s] you will actually truly have rest I
[186.7s] experienced this when talking to one of
[188.4s] my friends the other day and the Sabbath
[191.3s] was coming to an end and they said
[194.5s] sometimes I dread the hours the Sabbath
[196.8s] is coming to an end because the rest
[199.1s] that they're experiencing is actually
[201.2s] going to go now how do we ensure that we
[204.8s] have rest even through the week such
[208.0s] that we don't dread the things that will
[210.3s] come to us in fact labor and work was
[212.9s] given to us as a
[214.6s] blessing but sometimes the labors May
[217.4s] wear us out to the point we think when
[220.0s] will we get rest now if we read this
[223.0s] statement it's basically saying we can
[226.4s] have rest during the week if we are
[229.3s] dependent on Christ as we walk we can
[231.8s] say a word of prayer as we go through
[234.5s] our chores we can even take some time to
[237.2s] read some of the promises that God has
[241.2s] and if we are saved only in Christ it
[244.0s] means that we can count on Christ to
[247.2s] overcome any satanic or evil agencies
[251.1s] that bring themselves to battle against
[253.8s] us we're told that the devil is like a
[256.9s] roaring lion walking about seeking to
[260.0s] devour us and that's something we need
[262.4s] to always be careful about the book says
[265.7s] abundant grace has been provided that
[268.9s] the believing soul may be kept free from
[272.4s] sin this is actually from The Lord's
[276.3s] Prayer where it says lead us not into
[280.2s] temptation but Deliver Us from Evil it's
[284.0s] a prayer that we can make to God every
[286.0s] day asking him God save me from the Ws
[289.2s] of the
[290.1s] devil now there's something we are
[292.2s] warned about which is called Peter's
[294.9s] problem MH which is pride and
[297.5s] self-sufficiency
[300.2s] now pride and self-sufficiency is
[302.5s] something which we need to be careful
[305.8s] about and I'd like to just read a short
[309.8s] statement here that says of all the sins
[313.4s] it is the most hopeless and the most
[317.9s] incurable now Peter didn't fall all at
[321.3s] once he just thought that he could
[325.2s] always obey God at all times but we
[328.3s] actually learn that if we have
[331.0s] self-sufficiency we might think that it
[333.1s] is enough for us to actually be saved
[337.4s] and Peter was a victim of this many
[339.7s] times I don't know if panelists you can
[342.0s] share with me some of the instances that
[343.6s] you can think about when Peter was rush
[345.9s] to do something then he had to walk back
[348.1s] his statement any quick examples that
[350.4s] come to your mind yes yes I remember
[352.6s] during the the the Last Supper mhm when
[356.4s] Christ uh Peter never understood the
[359.4s] miss of Christ M then when he saw Christ
[362.8s] washing the disciples feet when it was
[365.4s] his turn he said Lord not me MH but
[368.8s] Christ says that if you don't take part
[370.7s] in this uh this holy convocation you're
[374.3s] not part of me then it proceed and says
[376.6s] now not just the the feet wash
[379.2s] everything my head and my so we seeing
[381.7s] that it was very actionable M but
[385.0s] sometimes it was too fast without that
[387.7s] thought process yeah so we can be we can
[391.0s] be very active but the spirit is not
[392.8s] leading so once we surrender that
[395.6s] self-sufficient should die and always
[398.5s] lean not on our own understanding but
[401.6s] plug in into Christ and the Holy Spirit
[403.9s] you'll find that now he'll be able to
[406.0s] lead you thank you brother Steve amen
[408.4s] amen I think Peter Peter indeed is a is
[410.6s] a model
[411.8s] Christian we we get so much from Peter
[415.1s] and we live Peter's life on a on on an
[418.2s] everyday basis because sometimes we are
[420.4s] over
[421.4s] zealous um you know and and we tend to
[424.4s] rush we are quick to our feet on our
[427.0s] feet and we tend to rush into decisions
[429.1s] and for in case of Peter's examples
[433.4s] remember when when Peter was was in the
[436.0s] in the um in the courts it was cold at
[439.8s] night and he was he was warming himself
[442.8s] around the bonfire and and you know as
[445.3s] Jesus predicted uh Peter denied Jesus m
[449.7s] uh three times and and and and because
[454.0s] he did not
[455.4s] reflect of of God's warning or God's
[458.4s] promise um or or or let me call it God's
[461.7s] warning he did not sit back and reflect
[464.5s] after he made that mistake he when he
[466.5s] was quick again to do what to realize
[469.3s] his sins and he quickly confessed I mean
[471.8s] another quick um Cas is when um he
[475.6s] slashed um or cut one of the soldiers
[479.2s] yeah um yeah and and of course Christ
[482.4s] ministered to him and um and I think
[485.1s] what the lesson we get from Peter is
[486.5s] that Peter accepted eventually Peter
[489.1s] accepted Christ this is really the
[491.3s] object lesson Peter later on accepted
[494.4s] Christ repented you know true repentance
[497.6s] and was confident to say that truly
[500.3s] Christ saved him and he trusted in him
[503.0s] um going forward so I think that those
[505.0s] are the examples that we give
[508.3s] pet yeah Peter Peter is an interesting
[511.0s] character he said Christ I will never
[513.2s] leave you and he denies him when he's
[515.9s] called out to walk on the boat he sees
[518.2s] that he's walking then he now starts
[519.8s] feeling the self-sufficiency and he's
[522.4s] telling the disciples you see I can also
[524.7s] walk on water myself and when his heart
[527.2s] just began to be lifted up he starts
[529.7s] drowning and Christ tells him I am the
[532.2s] one who can save you and that's why we
[534.4s] say saved only in Christ because we're
[537.2s] trying to understand that Christ is the
[539.6s] one who is enabling us to do the things
[542.5s] we are able to do Philippians 4:3 says I
[546.0s] can do all things through Christ who
[547.8s] strengthens me not through the strength
[550.1s] that I have so as we've been talking
[552.2s] about the several themes in this book
[554.0s] through the various chapters faith and
[556.2s] works faith it is God that gives us work
[559.0s] it's God Christ that gives us so I
[562.3s] wouldn't want us to be mistaken that
[564.5s] this is things that we are doing
[565.9s] ourselves because the moment you fall
[568.2s] you now also get into depression because
[570.6s] you think that it is your own power that
[572.6s] is giving you this and I'd like us to
[575.6s] read a very important verse in the Bible
[577.7s] that talks about this 1 Corinthians
[580.1s] chapter 10 verse2 1 Corinthians CH
[585.8s] 10:12 the Bible
[588.8s] says uh even as you get there I can
[592.7s] start at verse 11 it says now all these
[596.0s] things happen unto them as examples and
[599.6s] they are written for admonition upon
[602.4s] whom the ends of the world have come now
[604.6s] this was talking about the experience of
[606.6s] Moses and Israel in the wilderness and
[609.4s] those are the things being written to us
[612.0s] as examples now how does he conclude
[614.7s] this in verse 12 he says wherefore let
[618.2s] him that thinks he done take heed lest
[622.4s] he thinking about this and I'm just
[625.3s] trying to see that's the the pet
[627.3s] syndrome that even ask you should have
[629.7s] when you think you very good in church
[632.0s] when you think you have been endowed
[633.9s] with the gift of knowledge the gift of
[635.9s] Tong prophecy and all these things
[638.7s] that's when you're most susceptible
[640.8s] before before that's now why when we are
[643.3s] truly revived and we feel that the power
[646.0s] of God is working in us it's the time
[648.5s] when we need to be most humble because
[650.8s] that's the time we are most susceptible
[653.3s] to fall yes in fact there's a statement
[656.4s] here that I think was really cutting
[658.6s] deep because
[659.8s] I I've seen it in some Churches where
[661.7s] people say I am saved now this is what
[664.4s] was written those who accept Christ and
[667.3s] in their first confidence say I am saved
[670.6s] are in danger of trusting to themselves
[673.6s] they lose sight of their own weakness
[675.9s] and the constant need of divine strength
[679.4s] so what is our safety our only safety is
[683.5s] in constant distrust of self and
[687.4s] dependence on Christ absolutely so we
[691.2s] have dying to self daily yes I Die daily
[694.7s] which means you don't have life
[696.8s] absolutely yeah and that's why I believe
[699.0s] it's Galatians 2:20 says uh that I am
[702.3s] crucified with Christ yet not I but
[705.8s] Christ lives in me and the life which I
[708.6s] now live in the flesh I live by the
[710.9s] power of Jesus Christ because the moment
[713.8s] we just think today that I am saved and
[716.7s] I can't get lost that's the moment that
[720.3s] get lost I don't know if any of you has
[722.4s] any comments or additions here I no you
[725.6s] you've expounded it so so well I I I
[729.8s] don't think we have anything um to add
[732.4s] here but I I agree I mean we need to
[734.8s] kill that self-confidence in ourselves
[737.7s] because we we are nothing and and you
[740.0s] know often times we pray and tell God
[742.4s] that you know reduces um as you increase
[746.1s] and that that that ought to be um our
[748.8s] mantra in this walk of Salvation in this
[752.3s] walk of faith that every day it's only
[755.8s] God that should be saved should only
[757.8s] glorify God and how do we do that is by
[761.5s] understanding that we are sinful in
[763.7s] nature okay and I like I like that I
[766.4s] would I would really like to repeat it
[767.9s] brother ni it says those who accept
[770.2s] Christ and in their first confidence say
[773.0s] I am saved that is self-destruction
[775.7s] itself St white tells us that you in
[778.4s] danger of what of trusting to yourself
[782.3s] and that is the beginning of
[783.4s] self-destruction or
[785.1s] self-sufficiency that's the bit that I
[787.2s] want uh my my my my contribution will be
[790.6s] just want to address this issue of
[792.7s] becoming comfortable or becoming
[795.8s] familiar with holy things here we
[798.8s] realize that I've always given this
[800.6s] example where the first time you gave
[803.0s] your life to Christ even your walking
[805.0s] style
[806.8s] only it's it's so Majestic and uh and in
[810.4s] humility it even portrays the character
[812.6s] of Christ but with time you become
[815.4s] familiar so we being to you don't don't
[818.5s] rest don't be satisfied and you know
[821.1s] this word satisfaction it's um I always
[824.4s] find it like a bit of a very
[826.5s] controversial word cuz you realize that
[829.0s] uh I'll be feeling angry right now MH
[833.0s] I'll have I'll take food to my feeling
[835.3s] mhm but and then immediately I finish
[838.2s] that food I say hey now satisfied then a
[840.6s] few hours later I'm in the same cycle I
[843.0s] need that food so this is we should
[845.5s] hunger for this word of Christ every
[848.9s] single day every single minute because
[850.9s] we can't live without the bread of life
[853.5s] thank you to
[855.4s] you as as we bring this to a conclusion
[858.4s] I liked the way Ellen White captured the
[861.7s] relation that exists between us and
[864.2s] Christ if we are saved only in Christ it
[867.7s] means that we are connected
[869.6s] to the True Vine Christ says I am the
[872.2s] vine you the branches now it is here in
[876.4s] the book as we read that as we grow
[879.0s] closer to the vine even the branches
[882.7s] will start looking like the vine so the
[886.1s] more and more we grow closer to Christ
[888.8s] the only evidence and way we can tell
[891.2s] that we are saved is by our resemblance
[894.2s] to the vine now this is not something
[896.8s] that you go and tell people that I look
[898.8s] like Christ but this is something that
[901.2s] people see in you and by God's grace you
[904.6s] may be saved not because you're the one
[907.1s] professing it but it's because others
[909.2s] say it but also when people start saying
[911.8s] it sometimes I believe Ellen White
[913.8s] writes even in another place that it's
[915.8s] not good good to go and pray someone too
[917.9s] much because you might cause them to
[920.1s] stumble and fall so that's why First
[922.4s] Corinthians said let him that things he
[924.5s] turns take
[927.2s] he so closing statement I give a union
[932.2s] with Christ by Living Faith is enduring
[935.7s] and every other Union must perish it is
[939.8s] a union of utter dependence the branches
[942.8s] are nourished only through connection to
[945.2s] the vine if a branch is sered from the
[947.8s] main Vine then it dies so there must be
[951.0s] a painful work of Detachment as well as
[954.4s] a work of attachment we detach from the
[957.8s] things in the world mhm attach and cl
[960.2s] closer to the vine so that we can be
[963.1s] nourished with the nutrients that are
[965.6s] there so after we have United with
[968.2s] Christ we told this can only be
[970.7s] preserved by an honest by Honest prayer
[974.6s] and untiring effort and I liked it as
[977.0s] you said it we die daily so that we
[979.8s] might get life from the lifegiver
[981.8s] himself something that we need to do
[984.3s] constantly and every day then after that
[987.4s] we deny ourself M conquer self we deny
[991.2s] and Conquer self by watchfulness prayer
[994.6s] and faith in God to be the one to sa and
[997.8s] as a result we gain the victory so that
[1001.0s] was all chapter six about being saved
[1004.7s] only in Christ so please keep watching
[1009.2s] and reading the book with us and next
[1011.7s] week we want to look at chapter 7even
[1013.4s] which is Beware of the counter now we've

[1020.5s] some revivals that are fake what do this

[1028.2s] book please tune in once more next week
