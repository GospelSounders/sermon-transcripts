FULL TRANSCRIPT:
Welcome to our Cornerstone connection lesson today on our set we have teacher Eugene teacher Nico teacher Kevin and teacher Bridget Joy will be doing our sign language today and my name is Valerie before we start let us pray thank you Lord for this day given unto us thank you for good health and for life as you're about to start may your spirit be with us and guide us and protect us in Jesus name I pray and believe amen so today's Mission story is entitled big big prayer request when you pray to God do you ever ask for something that is very very big do you ever ask for something that is so big that it seems so impossible to get someone prayed for a sick relative someone prayed for a personal problem then Joy who was leading the prayer meeting said she has a big big prayer request the request was from a mother who had one child and was expecting a second but the mother wouldn't be able to care for the new baby she is asking for prayers to find a father and mother who would be willing to adopt the baby after he is born Joy said two people after the prayer meeting immediately looked at each other those same two people immediately said joy we need to talk to you after the prayer meeting those two people were a married couple named Frank and Robin they didn't have any children children of their own and they had longed to have a child for a very long time after the prayer meeting Frank and Robin talked with joy we interested in adopting the child Robin said yes we are Frank agreed Joy promised that she should give prank should give Frank and Robin contact information to the mother she cautioned however that one or two other sets of parents also were interested in adopting the baby Frank and Robin prayed Joy prayed the people from church prayer meeting prayed Joy told the mother about Frank and Robin and a day or two later the mother called them on the phone after talking the mother decided that she would like to meet Frank and Robin in person that evening they met at a restaurant and talked some more Frank and Robin prayed Joy prayed the people from the church prayer meeting prayed the next day the mother called she said she wanted a certain kind of person of parents for her baby she wanted the parents to be married she wanted both of the parents to have jobs and she wanted the parents to not have any other children Frank and Robin were married both Frank and Robin had jobs as nurses and Frank and Robin didn't have any other children in fact they didn't have any children at all the mother said she had decided that Frank and Robin would be the best parents for her baby Frank and Robin were so happy it looked like God was answering their big big prayer the final step was the hardest the mother was an Alaska native a native leaders had to agree to the adoption in Alaska the law says Alaska native children can only be adopted by other Alaskan native families but Frank and Robin were not Alaska natives in fact fact when they had first moved to bethl to work as nurses they had thought about adopting a child but when they had learned about the law they had given up hope now however they could adopt the baby if the Alaskan native leaders agreed Frank and Robin prayed Joy prayed the people from the church prayer meeting prayed when the mother told Alaskan native leaders about her desire for Frank and Robin to be the parents of her baby the agreed immediately if that is what you want we will honor your desire they said Frank and Robin were thrilled the big big prayer request had been answered Robin was in the delivery room when calb was born and she took him home from the hospital when calb was 5 months old the adoption was finalized Frank officially became CB's father and Robin officially became his mother today calb is an energetic 9-year-old boy he loves his parents he loves God and he loves going to the church where God had the big big prayer request part of your 13th Sabbath offering this

Cornerstone connection lesson we are privileged and we're actually thrilled to have you um today we have a very unique panel uh with us here it's a panel of the teens teachers what a blessing I'd like to invite each one of them to introduce themselves before we begin starting from my far right I welcome everyone to the lesson my name is niik opio um I greet you all my name is Kevin mangi and I'm glad to be here today I greet you all in the name of Jesus Christ my name is Eugene glad to be here thank you my name is Bridget also one of the teachers let's begin with prayer from teacher Kevin let us pray Our Father who are in heaven we come before you now today we want to thank you and we want to give you all the glory and honor for making this possible we've done many lessons from January all the way to today which is almost at the tail end we pray that as you start this very elaborate and very interesting and fascinating lesson that you be with each one of us and lead us through and in Jesus name pray and believe in amen amen amen welcome again to the second last lesson of this year this quarter of course and also of the year um it's entitled The servant hero now in our world today it's very unlikely that a hero will also be a servant so it seems to be quote unquote an oxymoron and if you're a good Bible student you may have realized that the Bible is full of numerous oxymorons one of them is there's gain through loss there's strength in weakness there's life in death or life through death so the Bible is full of so many of these oxymorons and so today we're going to study about you know the servant hero who is this servant hero and how can we emulate this servant who's a hero now as we begin I'd like us to get right into the what do you think section of our lesson today and I'd like to invite my panelists here um maybe we can start with you teer Eugene what do you think are some of the qualities of a hero that come to mind if you hear the word hero what quickly comes to mind um courage came to mind quite quickly yeah courage courage yes teacher Kevin um a hero is someone who is humble so can say humility yeah humility Tano I'd also think of a savior somebody who lightens your lord in a certain area in life somebody who makes you feel like you needed them in your life at a certain point right so a save someone who takes the burden or the load of you now maybe from when we were children we had the connotation that a hero is someone who probably has a cape and you know they're probably flying around or you know saving people those you know that connotation that we had as children um but today I want us to really come to an understanding um of what is a true hero who is a true hero and can each one of us be a hero in different people's lives so that's what our lesson is going to focus on today and I just like to get right um into the did you know section because our story today is mainly going to come from the book of Isaiah chapter 53 and I just like to highlight a few aspects that were given in the did youo section um that talks about Isaiah 53 is actually a very well-known passage to any Christian so any person who has been studying the Bible would know that Isaiah 53 we often title it as the suffering servant and you know we see Jesus Christ being referred to as a servant who went through a lot of suffering that we as Christians may be saved and it even says there that during Jesus ministry on Earth the Prophecies of Isaiah were among the most important scriptures that he used in explaining his mission and his role to his followers which is actually what we'll get right into and it goes on to say that the gospel writers used quotes from Isaiah to show that the scriptures pointed forward to Jesus now one thing that we'll also realize or learn from this lesson is that the Israelites to whom Jesus had come during his first Advent did not recognize that he was their hero because they already had a hero in mind just as I had told you maybe from like for me from when I was young you'd think a hero is someone who's having a cape and you know doing all these Supernatural things mhm likewise for them they felt that they already had a connotation of what kind of hero this was going to be and so when the hero actually came they were not able to recognize him and um you know it's also just um a lesson to us that when we're praying for things from God and he does not answer them in the way we already you know have the answers in our mind does it blind us to the actual blessings that he's given or the way he's answered it to us so it's it's a lesson for us to keep thinking about even as we move on so I'd like to invite um teacher Kevin to take us right into our key text for today right before we get into the main story of the day yeah so once again as you continue the lesson today's key text comes from Isaiah 53:3 which which says from the NIV version you may follow in any other that you may have he was despised and rejected by mankind a man of suffering and familiar with pain like one from whom people hide their faces he was despised and we held him in low esteem so that is the key text for today which um explains about this hero we talking about you know today's lesson is a very interesting one that tries to elaborate further about you know a hero who is a servant someone whom you had these expectations then all of a sudden the expectation were just pleted when you realize you've met with a real hero and this is not the person you experience so I'll pause at that as I as we continue the lesson amen thank you so much teacher Niko why don't you take us right into our story for today okay thank you Bridget so the into the story part will come from the book of Isaiah chapter 53 and we'll read from verse 2 to1 and also we'd like to read from verse 1 to 3 now the middle of this I'll ask some questions to my panel here so that we may be able to answer some of the things that are highlighted here so I'll just start by reading from Isaiah 61:1 to3 the Bible says the spirit of the Lord God is upon me because the Lord has anointed me to preach Good Tidings to the poor he has sent me to heal the brokenhearted to Proclaim Liberty to the captives and the opening of the prison to those who are bound so from this passage what is it that we see as Jesus mission because if the Jews did not understand jesus' Mission Isaiah actually prophesied about it what are some of the things you pick up from this Bridget anyone um I would say whenever God speaks in uh in Prophecy and in his through His prophets mhm there's usually two things being said at once mhm and um in this text when Isaiah writes that he has sent me to bind up the Brokenhearted to Proclaim freedom for the captives anointed me to Proclaim good news to the poor there is a natural and a spiritual connotation M you can be naturally poor and spiritually poor isn't it you can be a literal prisoner and a spiritual prisoner so the Israelites only took the natural they did not dig deeper to understand the spiritual and I think uh maybe Bridget has seen this in her field in medicine if you misdiagnose a patient you give them the wrong cure the Israelites misdiagnosed their situation you know they thought all they needed was an external Deliverance mhm and therefore all they were looking for was the hero The Stereotype hero who would come bash the Romans give them back their Nation mhm they did not diagnose their spiritual condition which requires a spirit King someone who can set them free from sin can say they were not looking for a servant they're looking for a leader yeah to go with them to war yeah then the next thing is what would be the effect of Jesus ministry on the Israelites and the context of this is in verse 2 and 3 of Isaiah 61: 1 to3 that says to proclaim the acceptable year of the Lord and the day of Vengeance of our God to comfort all who mourn to console those who mourn in Zion to give them Beauty for Ashes the oil of joy for mourning the Garment of Praise for the spirit of heaviness that they may be called Trees of Righteousness the planting of the Lord that he may be glorified so when Jesus came he was coming so that whatever they had as ashes would be turned into Beauty remember when something happened normally you could hear they were dressed in South suck cloth or they put ashes on themselves then the oil of joy for mourning maybe they might have been mourning as a result of the oppression of the Romans but Christ is saying I have come to give you Joy and it's not merely in being freed from the bondage of the Romans but it's the joy that lives in the heart then again it says the Garment of Praise for the spirit of heaviness anytime you're in captivity this is not something that you want and I can imagine when it says to Proclaim Liberty to the captives they are not literally in Chains but they could be free in Jesus Christ free from the bondage of sin that's why we say the spirit of heaviness sin weighs heavily against us so Christ is saying come unto me and I will take your burden upon myself but my burden is light so he wanted to free them from all the heavy burdens that occurring especially the sin that they had then it also says that they may be called Trees of Righteousness the planting of the Lord that he may be glorify so the salvation of the Israelites would actually result in the glory of God and that's why God says whatever we do whether we eat or drink do it so that uh we May glorify God could I request someone else to read from the book of Isaiah chapter 53 verse 225 teer Kevin Isaiah 53 verse 2 to5 and teacher Bridget you can also read verse 6 to1 yeah I'll take us through Isaiah that is chapter 53 mhm from vers uh 2 to 5 and H I'll be taking us um reading through the new King James version this is what he says for he shall grow up before him as a tender as a tender plant and as a root out of dry ground he has no form or cess and when he sees him there is no beauty that we should desire him vers three he is despised and rejected by men a men of Sorrows and acquainted with grief and we hid as it were our faces from him he was despised and we did not esteem him vers four surely he he has borne our Grieves and carried our sorrows yet we esteemed him stricken Smitten by God and Afflicted in the last verse but he was wounded for our transgression he was breed for our iniquities the chastisement for our peace was upon him and by his Tri we are healed thank youen that's another oximoron right there that Stripes can actually heal so verse 6 says all we like sheep have gone astray we have turned everyone to his own way and the Lord hath laid on him the iniquity of us all he was oppressed and he was afflicted yet he opened not his mouth he is brought as a lamb to the slaughter and as a sheep before her sharers is dumb so he open openeth not his mouth verse 8 he was taken from prison and from judgment and who shall declare his generation for he was cut off out of the land of the living for the transgression of my people was he stricken and he made his grave with the wicked and with the rich in his death because he had done no violence neither was any deceit in his mouth verse 10 yet it pleased the Lord to bruise him he hath put him to grief when thou shalt make his soul an offering for sin he shall see his seed he shall prolong his days and the pleasure of the Lord shall prosper in his hand finally verse 11 he shall see of the travail of his soul and shall be satisfied by his knowledge shall my righteous servant justify many for he shall bear their iniquities amen and amen it's a really deep passage that speaks about things that happened to Jesus if I may ask teacher Eugene what is it that strike you or which is a prophecy that has been mentioned today that you've thought of and you're saying okay I see this fulfillment um well mine what strikes me is isn't something that I think was noticed and for the longest time I didn't I didn't realize we we got it wrong you know when whenever the Lord is portrayed in movies he's portrayed us very handsome you know long hair soft skin you know very eloquent you know but the Bible says the opposite he says he he had no Beauty mhm you know that is striking mhm that God the maker of all things when it came to picking a body for himself chose a plain one and um it goes to show that um we can be very um surface in terms of how we judge one another reminds me of what God told his prophet Samuel men look on the outward but God looks at the heart so this is probably why they missed you know most people expect Heroes to be well built chiseled you know even if you talk about the heroes children love nowadays there's none of them who's like fat or you know who's uh you know doesn't look like the part you know who's not attractive but here we find Christ with unlikely uh demeanor and no Majesty to attract but one one more thing I would like to highlight is that Christ was silent throughout his passion throughout if you read the accounts in the gospels he really embodies this prophecy when they spat on him when they insulted him in fact what surprised pilot so much is that he said nothing in his defense you know know it's undeniable that this was talking about Christ yeah amen so Bridget any yeah just also to add um for me it's verse 9 that says uh he made his grave with the wicked and with the rich in his death it reminds me of how when he was on the cross he was crucified with people who had grave sins they had committed such grave sins yet he had done nothing and he had to suffer the same fate as they did and then following through fast forward to when he was buried and Joseph ofarim who was quite a you know rich man is the one who decided to ask for his body and take him to his tomb so it's just it just shows how accurately this prophecy was fulfilled and it's a confirmation that it's actually talking about Jesus Christ himself amen amen amen when I think about this I look at a hero at their highest point when they're doing their works of Salvation actually think of a hero looking their best when Christ was committing or doing the work of saving us if he was not desirable when he was living on Earth he was even more undesirable at the highest point of Salvation so you can imagine the Blood Stained brow the crown of thorns then he has stripes on on his back he's come from prison even if you to look at him as a stranger that's not somebody you'd want to be associated with in fact he was crucified in the midst of two other criminals which means at his highest point he was the most undesirable hero if eliud Kip were to win a marathon many people would like to take a selfie with him I don't think it was the same for Christ nobody would have loved to take a selfie there he'll be like no that not somebody who i' want to associate with so that really struck me as I was looking at this yeah and I don't know if there any other points about this that you'd like to share I'd like to hand it back to Bridget thank you so much for those beautiful insights um I think we can proceed to just get a few more insights from our spirit of Prophecy the book prophets and kings and I'd invite teacher Eugene to take us through that amen uh we had already preempted um the themes that she speaks about one of them being how they couldn't recognize the Lord because of um their expectations I had a preacher yesterday uh at lavington say blessed are those who have no high expectations but they will not be disappointed amen as a joke uh and um I would say it's not wrong to have uh high expectations of God mhm it's wrong to have them grounded elsewhere instead of his word if you expect much from God let it be something he has promised amen amen you know and um again they missed because they were looking at things from the natural they misdiagnosed their problem and and um every hero is made by a good villain you know and um you could almost say a hero is nothing without his villain he actually brings out the hero in you and in our story the story of the human race we have quite an enemy yes and our enemy has managed to deceive us into thinking that we don't need a hero you know it's very hard to save someone who doesn't think they need salvation and um we see this act as one of the reasons they could not see that they were standing in the presence of the Savior himself um in the further Insight we have a quote from prophets in Kings page 719 on every hand are the needy and the distressed it is ours to Aid in relieving and softening life's hardships and misery this is a powerful thought on every hand and it's not far-fetched if you walk out of this church and just look around there are needs everywhere needs abound chiefly the need for salvation and deliverance from sin but other needs as well Christ Echoes these words when he says look around you the Harvest is white right yes the laborers are few the Harvest is plenty but the laborers a few and there are two reasons I've come to find it could be more but there are two reasons I've come to find why the laborers are few number one is Christ when he sends out the 70 disciples to evangelism you know what he says he says I send you out as Lambs Among Wolves we know the relationship between lambs and wolves so the hesitation to Bear misery and ministered to people number one is fear we are afraid of what might happen you know one one preacher put it like this we we are very excited about being the hands and feet of Jesus Christ what we rarely remember is what happened to those hands and feet all right so that's one of the elements we Overlook and sometimes when we see it it leads us to be afraid to get involved the second is not fear but we feel as though God's reward is in the buy and buy feel like God doesn't pay his workers so why should I join the team and that is something that we see even today many as a pastor during the August period when they think they were doing camp meeting who asked how many in the congregation would like to be pastors the future the numbers were decimal it was it was very discouraging I think it's because people have come to believe that there is no reward in this life serving God but that is a lie Christ says to his disciples I think in the Book of Luke if I'm not wrong he says to them he who reaps receives wages mhm and bears fruit I believe in everlasting life so there's wages now eternal life later later you can never do anything for God and God not reward you for it so I just like to take the time to encourage people that in in spite of the dangers that are out there bearing people's miseries is reward rewarding cuz you get to share in something that the Lord shared in and and um ultimately you will see God better when you walk that path of suffering there's a sight to God you'll never get if you don't suffer with him amen amen thank you for those insights Eugene um before we invite um teacher Kevin to take us through our punch lines for today um interestingly and just from what you've disced there's a quote that someone said that you know true heroes or real heroes don't wear capes they actually are servants okay I've forgotten How It Ends but it brings a connotation of them actually serving so it's not someone who's out there outrightly showing that this is what I'm doing for people but it's someone who in their smallest capacity and I believe in uh we've been discussing also about the value of the little things so in the smallest way you can reach someone you can change their life serving as Jesus did is the importance of you know what a real hero does so I'll invite teacher Kevin to take us through our punch lines for today so you can just decide how to take help us go through it yeah I think um even as I go through one or two of the punch lines you know you mentioned something about expectations and and for sure for true if you don't have expectations then you're good to go you know because no one will heart break you or disappoint you and I think in our current world there are so many disappointment I'm trying to think about how life has been sometimes you've spoken with someone you supposed to meet them and and have this meeting on a certain serious engagement and then all of a sudden whoever you supposed to meet you call them hey bro I'm here or sister I'm here um you told me we meet at maybe a certain place a certain mall or it could even be in church on Sunday and then and the person says hey I forgot and you like wow so on your part you had planned you had scheduled and you had made sure that at 10: p.m. you'll meet not 10: p.m. at at 12: Mid midday or at 2: p.m. you'll meet someone but on their part other things came and after you canceled all your aspects for them they canceled theirs they canceled yours without even their knowledge and proceeded on so I think this world can disappoint you you know that's what happened to the time they expecting the Messiah they had other expectations but God had something else planned so I think it's ready for us to know that these disappointments will always be there so I'm going to take us through one of the punch lines then briefly in in a in a in a in a in a minute mention a certain illustration and one of the punch lines that we get today is from The Book of Luke 2425 to 27 I'm going to read it quickly how foolish are you and how slow to believe um all that the prophets have spoken did not the Messiah have to suffer these things and enter his glory and beginning with Moses and All His prophets he explained to them what was said in all the scriptures concerning himself so this is this was what Christ was trying to explain to them to the apostles you know or trying to explain didn't you guys know about what did you guys expect you know the question was how foolish are you and slow to believe all that the prophets have spoken it was more of a question because that which they had in their mind as teer was saying is not what came out so Christ was trying to find out you guys what really were you looking up to and then lastly from the illustration the illustration of our today is a very simple one it actually asks us a question from the many Heroes that you know most of them are those guys who when they get Authority all my enemies you shall know me my friends if I get to power h no I'm not lying you shall you shall know who Kevin is but from Christ's example we get to learn that when he got to Authority and the hero that he was he came he died for us and above all he was not that person of taking Revenge but he was he sympathized with people he was empathetic and above and beyond he was merciful and he worked with people he did everything to satisfy humankind as opposed to the heroes we have today who when they get Authority it's a d deal I think I'll stop at that and challenge you to ask yourself should you get the power you want should you get Authority what kind of a hero will you be amen thank you so much for that Insight um I really think that we are not too different from the Israelites that we have just read about well they may have missed to recognize that the Messiah had come during his first Advent well thank God that it is unlikely that any of us will miss the second Advent because it says that every eye shall see him but there are prophecies also that have been given in line with how we should live before that time comes that if we do not take seriously like those Israelites we may see Jesus and end up um you know dying the second death eventually so it is just um a reminder that you know we have time we like the Israelites have these prophecies that have given us the signs of the times they're like road maps showing us that indeed Jesus Second Coming is quite near and so we need to really introspectively look at our lives and decide to live for Jesus and choose to be heroes in various ways just as Jesus was so we'll get um just as before we close um we'll review um in Mark 11 11:4 maybe I'll invite Cho to open that and read it for us Mark 11:4 and even as he opens it um now that we've talked about expectations just a thought to think about do you think that it is possible that God may be having a different plan than you expected for you in your life so I'm sure that each one of us here right as we are we are actively praying for something so do you you you probably already have an answer that you would wish God to give in your own capacity you wish that God answers it in this specific way but what if he doesn't answer it in the way you want him to do you believe that the plan that he has for you is still good the other route or the other route that you're going to take is still the best so Tano you can read for us Mark 11: 24 uh the Bible says therefore I say to you whatever things you ask when you pray believe that you receive them and you will have them amen that's a powerful text it says that whenever we are praying we should believe and truly often times we believe but then the answer doesn't turn out the way we still wanted but one thing we can trust God for is that um you know he's quote unquote our manufacturer if you are to buy something from someone a manufacturer the things usually come with users manual and so it means that this person who made it knows how each and every single part of that um item works and should it malfunction the best person to take it back to would be the manufacturer yes similarly Our God who is our creator created us and he knows what is best for us he knows what when problems come to us you know how to fix those problems and that means that we can truly and surely trust him even when things don't go the way we as human beings want wanted them to go um I'd like to invite um our panelists for closing remarks um should there be any before we close in prayer maybe from teacher Eugene um um I'll just Echo what you said about submitting ourselves to God's will it is has often been the case in how God works that he gives us gifts that are wrapped in trials and things that are not very pleasant um and uh we shouldn't be too quick to judge God's will because it manifests in the long term I remember the story of Samson who found a honeycomb but it was inside a dead lion all right so that's how our God works most of the time he puts treasure in jws of clay it seems bad at first then you are thanking him for it in a matter of time so let's just keep walking with him and entrusting ourselves to him no matter what he send everything he sends is needful nothing he withholds is needful amen amen yeah I think for me you know this is just a few days towards the end of the year so it's possibly maybe a week and a few days then we done with this year I'll just do it simple short and precise learn to manage your expectations and for sure and for certain you shall not be disappointed that's it that's for me and I can certain you one year from now you remember my statement and then you shall not be heartbroken otherwise we may take you to hospital because you know you heart broken by so and so just learn to manage your expectation that's from me and I'm wishing you all the best yeah I'd also say that right now we are considered the Israel that is new that is spiritual Israel and not the Israelites spoken of in the Bible are we looking for Christ to come as a hero it's interesting to me that even when we go to heaven Christ will still be a servant ushering Us in welcoming us to his place taking us to Heaven showing us the things around I remember the text in zakariah that Christ is actually with children and there some people are wondering what are these wounds that you have in your hands and he says these are wounds I received in the house of my friends and I'm just thinking about this that Christ is a servant at heart it wasn't just a show that he came to put on the earth it's something that he did because of the love he has towards us so the thought that I have today is we also can be someone's hero and let's pray to God that our heroism may be seen in Acts of service and not in Acts that we wish others to do to us as a result of our heroic acts amen amen we will close with prayer let's pray Heavenly Father we thank you so much for your love towards us thank you that Lord you have been a servant to us we have read about you in Isaiah 53 and at that point no one really would have desired to have been involved with you but Lord it is through that that we are saved so we give you glory and honor and we pray that Lord you may teach us in your own spheres in your own ways to help us to be servant leaders just like you may we be heroes through servant through service oh dear God be with us um this day and may your will be done in our lives for it is in Jesus name we pray and believe amen amen amen

[71.2s] after he is born Joy said two people
[74.7s] after the prayer meeting immediately
[76.4s] looked at each other those same two
[78.8s] people immediately said joy we need to
[81.6s] talk to you after the prayer meeting
[84.1s] those two people were a married couple
[86.4s] named Frank and Robin they didn't have
[89.5s] any children children of their own and
[91.0s] they had longed to have a child for a
[92.7s] very long time after the prayer meeting
[96.2s] Frank and Robin talked with joy we
[99.2s] interested in adopting the child Robin
[101.5s] said yes we are Frank agreed Joy
[105.4s] promised that she should give prank
[108.1s] should give Frank and Robin contact
[110.4s] information to the mother she cautioned
[113.4s] however that one or two other sets of
[115.8s] parents also were interested in adopting
[118.7s] the baby Frank and Robin prayed Joy
[122.3s] prayed the people from church prayer
[124.6s] meeting prayed Joy told the mother about
[128.0s] Frank and Robin and a day or two later
[131.0s] the mother called them on the phone
[133.4s] after talking the mother decided that
[135.6s] she would like to meet Frank and Robin
[137.6s] in person that evening they met at a
[140.5s] restaurant and talked some more Frank
[143.3s] and Robin prayed Joy prayed the people
[146.1s] from the church prayer meeting prayed
[149.1s] the next day the mother called she said
[152.0s] she wanted a certain kind of person of
[154.7s] parents for her baby she wanted the
[157.4s] parents to be married she wanted both of
[159.9s] the parents to have jobs and she wanted
[162.3s] the parents to not have any other
[164.9s] children Frank and Robin were married
[168.0s] both Frank and Robin had jobs as nurses
[171.6s] and Frank and Robin didn't have any
[173.5s] other children in fact they didn't have
[176.2s] any children at
[177.7s] all the mother said she had decided that
[180.3s] Frank and Robin would be the best
[181.9s] parents for her baby Frank and Robin
[184.6s] were so happy it looked like God was
[187.3s] answering their big big
[189.8s] prayer the final step was the hardest
[193.1s] the mother was an Alaska native a native
[196.0s] leaders had to agree to the adoption in
[198.8s] Alaska the law says Alaska native
[201.7s] children can only be adopted by other
[204.0s] Alaskan native families but Frank and
[207.0s] Robin were not Alaska natives in fact
[209.9s] fact when they had first moved to bethl
[212.1s] to work as nurses they had thought about
[214.6s] adopting a child but when they had
[216.8s] learned about the law they had given up
[219.6s] hope now however they could adopt the
[222.9s] baby if the Alaskan native leaders
[225.4s] agreed Frank and Robin prayed Joy prayed
[229.6s] the people from the church prayer
[231.2s] meeting prayed when the mother told
[234.2s] Alaskan native leaders about her desire
[236.4s] for Frank and Robin to be the parents of
[238.6s] her baby the agreed immediately if that
[241.8s] is what you want we will honor your
[243.6s] desire they said Frank and Robin were
[247.1s] thrilled the big big prayer request had
[250.8s] been
[251.6s] answered Robin was in the delivery room
[254.3s] when calb was born and she took him home
[257.1s] from the hospital when calb was 5 months
[260.2s] old the adoption was finalized Frank
[263.3s] officially became CB's father and Robin
[266.1s] officially became his mother today calb
[269.8s] is an energetic 9-year-old boy he loves
[273.0s] his parents he loves God and he loves

[561.7s] Cornerstone connection lesson we are
[564.3s] privileged and we're actually thrilled
[566.3s] to have you um today we have a very
[568.7s] unique panel
[569.9s] uh with us here it's a panel of the
[572.5s] teens teachers what a blessing I'd like
[575.7s] to invite each one of them to introduce
[578.2s] themselves before we begin starting from
[580.1s] my far
[581.5s] right I welcome everyone to the lesson
[584.2s] my name is niik
[586.3s] opio um I greet you all my name is Kevin
[590.4s] mangi and I'm glad to be here
[592.9s] today I greet you all in the name of
[595.2s] Jesus Christ my name is Eugene glad to
[598.1s] be here thank you my name is Bridget
[600.9s] also one of the teachers let's begin
[603.2s] with prayer from teacher
[605.4s] Kevin let us pray Our Father who are in
[608.2s] heaven we come before you now today we
[610.6s] want to thank you and we want to give
[612.2s] you all the glory and honor for making
[613.8s] this possible we've done many lessons
[617.2s] from January all the way to today which
[619.9s] is almost at the tail end we pray that
[622.4s] as you start this very elaborate and
[625.6s] very interesting and fascinating lesson
[628.2s] that you be with each one of us and lead
[630.2s] us through and in Jesus name pray and
[632.2s] believe in amen amen amen welcome again
[636.8s] to the second last lesson of this year
[639.9s] this quarter of course and also of the
[641.7s] year um it's entitled The servant
[646.4s] hero now in our world today it's very
[650.9s] unlikely that a hero will also be a
[654.4s] servant so it seems to be quote unquote
[657.2s] an oxymoron and if you're a good Bible
[660.2s] student you may have realized that the
[662.2s] Bible is full of numerous
[664.8s] oxymorons one of them is there's gain
[668.4s] through loss there's strength in
[672.7s] weakness there's life in death or life
[676.2s] through death so the Bible is full of so
[679.1s] many of these oxymorons and so today
[681.2s] we're going to study about you know the
[683.4s] servant hero who is this servant hero
[686.7s] and how can we emulate this servant
[690.0s] who's a hero now as we begin I'd like us
[693.2s] to get right into the what do you think
[695.5s] section of our lesson today and I'd like
[699.1s] to invite my panelists here um maybe we
[702.7s] can start with you teer Eugene what do
[705.0s] you think are some of the qualities of a
[708.4s] hero that come to mind if you hear the
[710.7s] word hero what quickly comes to
[713.9s] mind um courage came to mind quite
[717.9s] quickly
[719.5s] yeah courage courage yes teacher Kevin
[722.6s] um a hero is someone who is humble so
[725.5s] can say
[726.8s] humility yeah humility
[730.0s] Tano I'd also think of a savior somebody
[734.2s] who lightens your lord in a certain area
[736.6s] in life somebody who makes you feel like
[739.1s] you needed them in your life at a
[741.2s] certain point right so a save someone
[744.0s] who takes the burden or the load of you
[747.3s] now maybe from when we were children
[749.8s] we had the connotation that a hero is
[752.8s] someone who probably has a cape and you
[755.6s] know they're probably flying around or
[758.0s] you know saving people those you know
[760.2s] that connotation that we had as children
[762.8s] um but today I want us to really come to
[765.4s] an understanding um of what is a true
[769.0s] hero who is a true hero and can each one
[772.2s] of us be a hero in different people's
[775.0s] lives so that's what our lesson is going
[777.6s] to focus on today and I just like to get
[780.6s] right um into the did you know section
[783.2s] because our story today is mainly going
[785.4s] to come from the book of Isaiah chapter
[787.6s] 53 and I just like to highlight a few
[790.7s] aspects that were given in the did youo
[792.8s] section um that talks about Isaiah 53 is
[796.5s] actually a very well-known passage to
[799.9s] any Christian so any person who has been
[802.3s] studying the Bible would know that
[804.4s] Isaiah 53 we often title it as the
[807.0s] suffering servant and you know we see
[809.6s] Jesus Christ being referred to as a
[812.8s] servant who went through a lot of
[814.4s] suffering that we as Christians may be
[817.2s] saved and it even says there that during
[819.8s] Jesus ministry on Earth the Prophecies
[822.5s] of Isaiah were among the most important
[824.8s] scriptures that he used in explaining
[827.4s] his mission and his role to his
[829.2s] followers which is actually what we'll
[830.8s] get right into and it goes on to say
[833.4s] that the gospel writers used quotes from
[836.5s] Isaiah to show that the scriptures
[839.2s] pointed forward to Jesus now one thing
[843.0s] that we'll also realize or learn from
[845.5s] this lesson is that the Israelites to
[849.2s] whom Jesus had come during his first
[851.9s] Advent did not recognize that he was
[854.8s] their hero because they already had a
[857.8s] hero in mind just as I had told you
[860.1s] maybe from like for me from when I was
[862.1s] young you'd think a hero is someone
[863.5s] who's having a cape and you know doing
[865.6s] all these Supernatural things mhm
[868.3s] likewise for them they felt that they
[870.0s] already had a connotation of what kind
[872.1s] of hero this was going to be and so when
[874.3s] the hero actually came they were not
[876.6s] able to recognize him and um you know
[879.7s] it's also just um a lesson to us that
[883.1s] when we're praying for things from God
[885.8s] and he does not answer them in the way
[888.1s] we already you know have the answers in
[890.5s] our mind does it blind us to the actual
[894.4s] blessings that he's given or the way
[896.5s] he's answered it to us so it's it's a
[899.4s] lesson for us to keep thinking about
[901.3s] even as we move on so I'd like to invite
[904.1s] um teacher Kevin to take us right into
[906.8s] our key text for today right before we
[909.0s] get into the main story of the day yeah
[912.0s] so once again as you continue the lesson
[914.0s] today's key text comes from Isaiah 53:3
[917.7s] which which says from the NIV version
[919.8s] you may follow in any other that you may
[922.0s] have he was despised and rejected by
[924.5s] mankind a man of suffering and familiar
[927.7s] with pain like one from whom people hide
[930.6s] their faces he was despised and we held
[934.2s] him in low
[936.2s] esteem so that is the key text for today
[939.4s] which um explains about this hero we
[942.6s] talking about you know today's lesson is
[944.2s] a very interesting one that tries to
[947.2s] elaborate further about you know a hero
[951.6s] who is a servant someone whom you had
[954.9s] these expectations then all of a sudden
[957.9s] the expectation were just pleted when
[961.2s] you realize you've met with a real hero
[963.7s] and this is not the person you
[964.8s] experience so I'll pause at that as I as
[967.5s] we continue the lesson amen thank you so
[970.6s] much teacher Niko why don't you take us
[972.4s] right into our story for today okay
[975.6s] thank you Bridget so the into the story
[978.8s] part will come from the book of Isaiah
[980.8s] chapter 53 and we'll read from verse 2
[983.7s] to1 and also we'd like to read from
[986.0s] verse 1 to 3 now the middle of this I'll
[989.5s] ask some questions to my panel here so
[991.8s] that we may be able to answer some of
[993.6s] the things that are highlighted here so
[996.1s] I'll just start by reading from Isaiah
[998.5s] 61:1 to3 the Bible says the spirit of
[1003.1s] the Lord God is upon me because the Lord
[1006.0s] has anointed me to preach Good Tidings
[1009.3s] to the poor he has sent me to heal the
[1012.7s] brokenhearted to Proclaim Liberty to the
[1016.1s] captives and the opening of the prison
[1019.2s] to those who are bound so from this
[1022.5s] passage what is it that we see as Jesus
[1025.7s] mission because if the Jews did not
[1029.2s] understand jesus' Mission Isaiah
[1031.2s] actually prophesied about it what are
[1033.4s] some of the things you pick up from this
[1037.2s] Bridget anyone um I would
[1041.5s] say whenever God speaks
[1044.7s] in uh in Prophecy and in his through His
[1048.2s] prophets mhm there's
[1050.5s] usually two things being said at once
[1053.5s] mhm and um in this
[1056.2s] text
[1057.8s] when Isaiah writes that he has sent me
[1060.9s] to bind up the
[1062.4s] Brokenhearted to Proclaim freedom for
[1064.7s] the captives anointed me to Proclaim
[1066.8s] good news to the
[1068.1s] poor there is a natural and a spiritual
[1071.7s] connotation M you can be naturally poor
[1075.4s] and spiritually poor isn't it you can be
[1078.4s] a literal prisoner and a spiritual
[1082.3s] prisoner so the Israelites only took the
[1087.8s] natural they did not dig deeper to
[1090.8s] understand the
[1092.6s] spiritual and I think uh maybe
[1095.1s] Bridget has seen this in her field in
[1098.4s] medicine if you misdiagnose a patient
[1101.4s] you give them the wrong
[1103.6s] cure the
[1106.0s] Israelites misdiagnosed their situation
[1110.3s] you know they thought all they needed
[1112.4s] was an external Deliverance mhm and
[1115.2s] therefore all they were looking for was
[1118.4s] the hero The Stereotype hero who would
[1120.8s] come bash the Romans give them back
[1123.8s] their Nation mhm they did not diagnose
[1127.1s] their spiritual condition which requires
[1129.8s] a spirit King someone who can set them
[1132.4s] free from
[1133.7s] sin can say they were not looking for a
[1136.3s] servant they're looking for a leader
[1139.0s] yeah to go with them to war yeah then
[1142.9s] the next thing is what would be the
[1145.0s] effect of Jesus ministry on the
[1148.8s] Israelites and the context of this is in
[1152.2s] verse 2 and 3 of Isaiah 61: 1 to3 that
[1155.9s] says to proclaim the acceptable year of
[1159.0s] the Lord and the day of Vengeance of our
[1162.0s] God to comfort all who mourn to console
[1166.0s] those who mourn in Zion to give them
[1169.1s] Beauty for Ashes the oil of joy for
[1173.5s] mourning the Garment of Praise for the
[1176.8s] spirit of heaviness that they may be
[1179.7s] called Trees of Righteousness the
[1182.6s] planting of the Lord that he may be
[1186.0s] glorified so when Jesus came he was
[1189.2s] coming so that whatever they had as
[1191.6s] ashes would be turned into Beauty
[1194.4s] remember when something happened
[1196.0s] normally you could hear they were
[1197.4s] dressed in South suck cloth or they put
[1199.9s] ashes on themselves then the oil of joy
[1203.6s] for mourning maybe they might have been
[1206.2s] mourning as a result of the oppression
[1208.1s] of the Romans but Christ is saying I
[1210.9s] have come to give you Joy and it's not
[1213.4s] merely in being freed from the bondage
[1215.9s] of the Romans but it's the joy that
[1218.9s] lives in the heart then again it says
[1221.9s] the Garment of Praise for the spirit of
[1225.7s] heaviness anytime you're in captivity
[1228.4s] this is not something that you want and
[1231.4s] I can imagine when it says to Proclaim
[1233.9s] Liberty to the captives they are not
[1236.9s] literally in Chains but they could be
[1241.1s] free in Jesus Christ free from the
[1244.0s] bondage of sin that's why we say the
[1246.7s] spirit of heaviness sin weighs heavily
[1249.4s] against us so Christ is saying come unto
[1251.8s] me and I will take your burden upon
[1255.6s] myself but my burden is light so he
[1259.2s] wanted to free them from all the heavy
[1261.6s] burdens that occurring especially the
[1264.8s] sin that they had then it also says that
[1268.4s] they may be called Trees of
[1270.0s] Righteousness the planting of the Lord
[1273.1s] that he may be glorify so the salvation
[1277.1s] of the Israelites would actually result
[1280.4s] in the glory of God and that's why God
[1283.2s] says whatever we do whether we eat or
[1285.6s] drink do it so that uh we May glorify
[1289.5s] God could I request someone else to read
[1292.1s] from the book of Isaiah chapter
[1295.3s] 53 verse 225 teer
[1299.1s] Kevin Isaiah 53 verse 2 to5 and teacher
[1303.0s] Bridget you can also read verse 6
[1306.8s] to1 yeah I'll take us
[1310.0s] through Isaiah that is chapter 53 mhm
[1314.2s] from vers uh 2 to 5 and H I'll be taking
[1321.0s] us um reading through the new King James
[1325.1s] version this is what he says for he
[1327.7s] shall grow up before him as a tender as
[1331.0s] a tender plant and as a root out of dry
[1334.3s] ground he has no form or cess and when
[1338.2s] he sees him there is no beauty that we
[1341.5s] should desire him vers three he is
[1343.9s] despised and rejected by men a men of
[1346.2s] Sorrows and acquainted with grief and we
[1349.4s] hid as it were our faces from him he was
[1353.3s] despised and we did not esteem him vers
[1356.1s] four surely he he has borne our Grieves
[1359.7s] and carried our sorrows yet we esteemed
[1362.3s] him stricken Smitten by God and
[1365.8s] Afflicted in the last verse but he was
[1368.3s] wounded for our transgression he was
[1370.5s] breed for our iniquities the
[1372.5s] chastisement for our peace was upon him
[1376.7s] and by his Tri
[1379.0s] we are healed thank
[1382.1s] youen that's another oximoron right
[1384.6s] there that Stripes can actually heal so
[1387.5s] verse 6 says all we like sheep have gone
[1391.5s] astray we have turned everyone to his
[1394.6s] own way and the Lord hath laid on him
[1397.8s] the iniquity of us all he was oppressed
[1401.5s] and he was afflicted yet he opened not
[1404.7s] his mouth he is brought as a lamb to the
[1407.6s] slaughter and as a sheep before her
[1409.9s] sharers is dumb so he open openeth not
[1413.4s] his mouth verse 8 he was taken from
[1416.9s] prison and from judgment and who shall
[1420.0s] declare his generation for he was cut
[1423.0s] off out of the land of the living for
[1425.6s] the transgression of my people was he
[1428.9s] stricken and he made his grave with the
[1431.9s] wicked and with the rich in his death
[1435.2s] because he had done no violence neither
[1438.6s] was any deceit in his mouth verse 10 yet
[1442.4s] it pleased the Lord to bruise him he
[1444.9s] hath put him to grief when thou shalt
[1447.9s] make his soul an offering for sin he
[1450.3s] shall see his seed he shall prolong his
[1453.4s] days and the pleasure of the Lord shall
[1456.2s] prosper in his hand finally verse 11 he
[1460.3s] shall see of the travail of his soul and
[1463.3s] shall be satisfied by his knowledge
[1466.6s] shall my righteous servant justify many
[1470.0s] for he shall bear their
[1472.6s] iniquities amen and amen it's a really
[1476.4s] deep passage that speaks about things
[1478.9s] that happened to Jesus if I may ask
[1481.8s] teacher Eugene what is it that strike
[1484.4s] you or which is a prophecy that has been
[1487.1s] mentioned today that you've thought of
[1489.4s] and you're saying okay I see this
[1492.4s] fulfillment
[1494.6s] um well mine what strikes me
[1499.0s] is isn't something that I think was
[1502.6s] noticed and for the longest time I
[1505.0s] didn't I didn't realize we we got it
[1507.4s] wrong you know when whenever the Lord is
[1509.6s] portrayed in movies he's portrayed us
[1511.9s] very handsome you know long
[1515.2s] hair soft skin you know very eloquent
[1519.0s] you know but the Bible says the opposite
[1521.9s] he says he he had no Beauty mhm you know
[1524.9s] that is striking mhm that God the maker
[1528.0s] of all things when it came to picking a
[1530.7s] body for himself chose a plain one and
[1535.6s] um it goes to show that um we can be
[1540.9s] very um surface in terms of how we
[1545.2s] judge one another reminds me of what God
[1549.3s] told his prophet Samuel men look on the
[1552.6s] outward but God looks at the heart so
[1555.2s] this
[1556.3s] is probably why they missed you know
[1558.9s] most people expect Heroes to be well
[1560.4s] built chiseled you know even if you talk
[1564.3s] about
[1565.9s] the heroes children love nowadays
[1569.8s] there's none of them who's like fat or
[1571.8s] you know who's uh you know doesn't look
[1575.8s] like the part you know who's not
[1578.2s] attractive but here we
[1580.3s] find Christ with
[1583.3s] unlikely
[1585.3s] uh demeanor and no Majesty
[1589.1s] to
[1589.9s] attract but one one more thing I would
[1592.4s] like
[1593.1s] to highlight is that Christ
[1597.4s] was silent throughout his
[1601.2s] passion throughout if you read the
[1603.4s] accounts in the
[1605.6s] gospels he really embodies this prophecy
[1608.9s] when they spat on him when they insulted
[1611.4s] him in fact what surprised pilot so much
[1614.3s] is that he said nothing in his
[1616.9s] defense you know know it's undeniable
[1619.6s] that this was talking about Christ yeah
[1623.0s] amen so Bridget any yeah just also to
[1626.9s] add um for me it's verse 9 that says uh
[1630.5s] he made his grave with the wicked and
[1632.7s] with the rich in his death it reminds me
[1636.5s] of how when he was on the cross he was
[1639.8s] crucified with people who had grave sins
[1642.4s] they had committed such grave sins yet
[1645.1s] he had done nothing and he had to suffer
[1647.7s] the same fate as they did and then
[1650.7s] following through fast forward to when
[1652.6s] he was buried and Joseph ofarim who was
[1655.9s] quite a you know rich man is the one who
[1658.8s] decided to ask for his body and take him
[1661.1s] to his tomb so it's just it just shows
[1664.4s] how accurately this prophecy was
[1667.3s] fulfilled and it's a confirmation that
[1669.6s] it's actually talking about Jesus Christ
[1671.9s] himself amen amen
[1675.0s] amen when I think about this I look at a
[1679.2s] hero at their highest point when they're
[1683.0s] doing their works of Salvation actually
[1686.3s] think of a hero looking their best when
[1690.2s] Christ was committing or doing the work
[1692.5s] of saving us if he was not desirable
[1696.0s] when he was living on Earth he was even
[1698.8s] more undesirable at the highest point of
[1701.6s] Salvation so you can imagine the Blood
[1704.4s] Stained brow the crown of thorns then he
[1707.3s] has stripes on on his back he's come
[1709.7s] from prison even if you to look at him
[1712.6s] as a stranger that's not somebody you'd
[1715.0s] want to be associated with in fact he
[1717.3s] was crucified in the midst of two other
[1720.4s] criminals which means at his highest
[1723.0s] point he was the most undesirable hero
[1726.8s] if eliud Kip were to win a marathon many
[1729.5s] people would like to take a selfie with
[1731.2s] him I don't think it was the same for
[1733.5s] Christ nobody would have loved to take a
[1735.9s] selfie there he'll be like no that not
[1738.4s] somebody who i' want to associate with
[1740.9s] so that really struck me as I was
[1742.9s] looking at this yeah and I don't know if
[1746.5s] there any other points about this that
[1748.3s] you'd like to share I'd like to hand it
[1751.6s] back to
[1754.4s] Bridget thank you so much for those
[1757.3s] beautiful
[1758.5s] insights um I think we can proceed to
[1761.6s] just get a few more insights from our
[1764.2s] spirit of Prophecy the book prophets and
[1766.8s] kings and I'd invite teacher Eugene to
[1769.4s] take us through that amen uh we had
[1773.8s] already
[1775.2s] preempted um the themes that she speaks
[1778.4s] about one of them being how they
[1782.2s] couldn't recognize the Lord because of
[1786.2s] um their
[1787.5s] expectations I had a preacher yesterday
[1789.9s] uh at lavington say blessed are those
[1792.9s] who have no high expectations but they
[1795.2s] will not be
[1796.4s] disappointed amen as a joke
[1799.8s] uh and um I would say it's not wrong to
[1803.5s] have uh high expectations of God mhm
[1807.7s] it's wrong to have them grounded
[1810.1s] elsewhere instead of his word if you
[1813.2s] expect much from God let it be something
[1815.0s] he has promised amen amen you know and
[1818.6s] um again they missed because they were
[1821.9s] looking at things from the
[1824.2s] natural they misdiagnosed their problem
[1827.8s] and and
[1829.7s] um every hero is made by a good villain
[1833.3s] you know and um you could almost say a
[1836.7s] hero is nothing without his villain he
[1839.4s] actually brings out the hero in you and
[1841.1s] in our story the story of the human race
[1844.1s] we have quite an
[1845.4s] enemy yes and our enemy has managed to
[1848.4s] deceive us into thinking that we don't
[1850.5s] need a
[1851.6s] hero you know it's very hard to save
[1854.3s] someone who doesn't think they need
[1855.8s] salvation
[1858.0s] and um we see
[1860.9s] this act as one of the reasons they
[1863.4s] could not see that they were standing in
[1866.4s] the presence of the Savior
[1869.5s] himself um in the further Insight we
[1872.8s] have a quote from prophets in Kings page
[1876.2s] 719 on every hand are the needy and the
[1881.2s] distressed it is ours to Aid in
[1883.5s] relieving and softening life's hardships
[1887.2s] and misery
[1888.8s] this is a powerful thought on every
[1892.3s] hand and it's not far-fetched if you
[1895.9s] walk out of this church and just look
[1897.4s] around there are needs everywhere needs
[1901.0s] abound chiefly the need for salvation
[1904.0s] and deliverance from sin but other needs
[1906.7s] as well Christ Echoes these words when
[1910.3s] he says look around you the Harvest is
[1913.1s] white right yes the laborers are few the
[1917.1s] Harvest is plenty but the laborers a few
[1919.7s] and there are two reasons I've come to
[1922.2s] find it could be more but there are two
[1924.2s] reasons I've come to find why the
[1927.0s] laborers are few number one is Christ
[1930.7s] when he sends out the 70 disciples to
[1933.0s] evangelism you know what he says he says
[1935.4s] I send you out as Lambs Among
[1939.6s] Wolves we know the relationship between
[1942.7s] lambs and wolves so the hesitation to
[1946.5s] Bear misery and ministered to people
[1949.9s] number one is fear we are
[1952.5s] afraid of what might happen you
[1958.2s] know one one preacher put it like this
[1962.6s] we we are very excited about being the
[1965.3s] hands and feet of Jesus
[1967.1s] Christ what we rarely remember is what
[1969.4s] happened to those hands and feet all
[1972.4s] right so that's one of the elements we
[1975.1s] Overlook and sometimes when we see it it
[1977.1s] leads us to be afraid to get involved
[1979.9s] the second is not fear but we feel as
[1985.4s] though God's reward is in the buy and
[1989.6s] buy feel like God doesn't pay his
[1991.8s] workers so why should I join the team
[1994.4s] and that is something that we see even
[1996.0s] today many as a pastor during the August
[2000.3s] period when they think they were doing
[2001.4s] camp
[2002.4s] meeting who asked how many in the
[2004.8s] congregation would like to be pastors
[2007.9s] the future the numbers were decimal it
[2010.6s] was it was very discouraging I think
[2013.2s] it's because people have come to believe
[2016.2s] that there is no reward in this life
[2019.1s] serving God but that is a
[2020.8s] lie Christ says to his disciples I think
[2023.5s] in the Book of Luke if I'm not wrong he
[2025.3s] says to
[2026.7s] them he who
[2029.5s] reaps receives
[2032.2s] wages mhm
[2036.2s] and bears
[2038.2s] fruit I believe in everlasting life so
[2042.6s] there's wages
[2044.0s] now eternal life later later you can
[2047.7s] never do anything for God and God not
[2049.5s] reward you for it so I just like to take
[2052.5s] the time to encourage people that in in
[2056.2s] spite of the dangers that are out
[2059.0s] there bearing people's miseries is
[2062.1s] reward rewarding cuz you get to share in
[2065.1s] something that the Lord shared in and
[2067.8s] and um ultimately you will see
[2071.9s] God
[2073.8s] better when you walk that path of
[2076.2s] suffering there's a sight to God you'll
[2078.2s] never get if you don't suffer with
[2082.5s] him amen amen thank you for those
[2086.7s] insights Eugene um before we invite um
[2090.0s] teacher Kevin to take us through our
[2092.8s] punch lines for
[2094.2s] today um interestingly and just from
[2097.1s] what you've disced there's a quote that
[2099.0s] someone said that you know true heroes
[2101.4s] or real heroes don't wear capes they
[2104.4s] actually are servants okay I've
[2106.3s] forgotten How It Ends but it brings a
[2108.7s] connotation of them actually serving so
[2111.5s] it's not someone who's out there
[2113.5s] outrightly showing that this is what I'm
[2116.0s] doing for people but it's someone who in
[2118.7s] their smallest capacity and I believe in
[2122.1s] uh we've been discussing also about the
[2123.6s] value of the little things so in the
[2126.2s] smallest way you can reach
[2128.2s] someone you can change their life
[2130.6s] serving as Jesus did is the importance
[2133.4s] of you know what a real hero does so
[2136.1s] I'll invite teacher Kevin to take us
[2138.6s] through our punch lines for today so you
[2141.7s] can just decide how to take help us go
[2144.0s] through it yeah I think um even as I go
[2147.3s] through one or two of the punch lines
[2149.6s] you know you mentioned something about
[2151.8s] expectations and and for sure for true
[2154.4s] if you don't have expectations then
[2156.1s] you're good to go you know because no
[2157.9s] one will heart break you or disappoint
[2159.5s] you and I think in our current world
[2161.8s] there are so many disappointment I'm
[2163.3s] trying to think about how life has been
[2165.6s] sometimes you've spoken with someone you
[2168.1s] supposed to meet them and and have this
[2170.4s] meeting on a certain serious engagement
[2173.9s] and then all of a sudden whoever you
[2176.0s] supposed to meet you call them hey bro
[2178.4s] I'm here or sister I'm here um you told
[2181.5s] me we meet at maybe a certain place a
[2184.0s] certain mall or it could even be in
[2185.9s] church on Sunday and then and the person
[2188.1s] says hey I forgot and you like wow so on
[2190.9s] your part you had planned you had
[2193.6s] scheduled and you had made sure that at
[2195.9s] 10: p.m. you'll meet not 10: p.m. at at
[2198.5s] 12: Mid midday or at 2: p.m. you'll meet
[2201.2s] someone but on their part other things
[2204.2s] came and after you canceled all your
[2206.5s] aspects for them they canceled theirs
[2209.2s] they canceled yours without even their
[2210.8s] knowledge and proceeded on so I think
[2212.9s] this world can disappoint you you know
[2214.8s] that's what happened to the time they
[2216.4s] expecting the Messiah they had other
[2218.3s] expectations but God had something else
[2220.5s] planned so I think it's ready for us to
[2222.1s] know that these disappointments will
[2224.4s] always be there so I'm going to take us
[2227.4s] through one of the punch lines then
[2230.2s] briefly in in a in a in a in a in a
[2232.7s] minute mention a certain illustration
[2235.2s] and one of the punch lines that we get
[2237.5s] today is from The Book of Luke 2425 to
[2241.9s] 27 I'm going to read it quickly how
[2244.8s] foolish are you and how slow to believe
[2248.9s] um all that the prophets have spoken did
[2251.4s] not the Messiah have to suffer these
[2253.3s] things and enter his glory and beginning
[2256.2s] with Moses and All His prophets he
[2257.8s] explained to them what was said in all
[2260.0s] the scriptures concerning himself so
[2262.2s] this is this was what Christ was trying
[2264.0s] to explain to them to the apostles you
[2267.2s] know or trying to explain didn't you
[2270.5s] guys know about what did you guys expect
[2273.3s] you know the question was how foolish
[2274.8s] are you and slow to believe all that the
[2277.7s] prophets have spoken it was more of a
[2280.0s] question because that which they had in
[2282.4s] their mind as teer was saying is not
[2286.0s] what came out so Christ was trying to
[2289.4s] find out you guys what really were you
[2292.0s] looking up to and then lastly from the
[2294.8s] illustration the illustration of our
[2296.5s] today is a very simple one it actually
[2298.5s] asks us a question from the many Heroes
[2300.8s] that you know most of them are those
[2302.8s] guys who when they get Authority all my
[2305.8s] enemies you shall know me my friends if
[2308.7s] I get to power h no I'm not lying you
[2311.5s] shall you shall know who Kevin is but
[2314.2s] from Christ's example we get to learn
[2316.0s] that when he got to Authority and the
[2318.2s] hero that he was he came he died for us
[2321.6s] and above all he was not that person of
[2324.1s] taking Revenge but he was he sympathized
[2327.0s] with people he was empathetic and above
[2330.0s] and beyond he was merciful and he worked
[2333.0s] with people he did everything to satisfy
[2336.1s] humankind as opposed to the heroes we
[2338.2s] have today who when they get Authority
[2340.5s] it's a d deal I think I'll stop at that
[2342.6s] and challenge you to ask yourself should
[2344.4s] you get the power you want should you
[2346.3s] get Authority what kind of a hero will
[2348.6s] you
[2349.3s] be amen thank you so much for that
[2352.4s] Insight um I really think that we are
[2355.4s] not too different from the Israelites
[2359.6s] that we have just read about well they
[2362.2s] may have missed to recognize that the
[2364.9s] Messiah had come during his first Advent
[2367.9s] well thank God that it is unlikely that
[2370.7s] any of us will miss the second Advent
[2372.8s] because it says that every eye shall see
[2374.7s] him but there are prophecies also that
[2377.2s] have been given in line with how we
[2379.6s] should live before that time comes that
[2383.2s] if we do not take seriously like those
[2386.1s] Israelites we may see Jesus and end up
[2389.8s] um you know dying the second death
[2392.2s] eventually so it is just um a reminder
[2395.2s] that you know we have time we like the
[2398.0s] Israelites have these prophecies that
[2399.8s] have given us the signs of the times
[2402.5s] they're like road maps showing us that
[2404.6s] indeed Jesus Second Coming is quite near
[2407.8s] and so we need to really introspectively
[2410.6s] look at our lives and decide to live for
[2413.6s] Jesus and choose to be heroes in various
[2416.8s] ways just as Jesus was so we'll get um
[2420.9s] just as before we close
[2423.0s] um we'll review um in Mark 11 11:4 maybe
[2428.7s] I'll invite Cho to open that and read it
[2431.2s] for us Mark
[2433.2s] 11:4 and even as he opens it um now that
[2437.5s] we've talked about
[2439.7s] expectations just a thought to think
[2442.6s] about do you think that it is possible
[2445.4s] that God may be having a different plan
[2447.9s] than you expected for you in your life
[2451.0s] so I'm sure that each one of us here
[2453.2s] right as we are we are actively praying
[2456.0s] for something
[2458.3s] so do you you you probably already have
[2461.5s] an answer that you would wish God to
[2463.5s] give in your own capacity you wish that
[2466.0s] God answers it in this specific way but
[2468.5s] what if he doesn't answer it in the way
[2470.4s] you want him to do you believe that the
[2472.9s] plan that he has for you is still good
[2475.4s] the other route or the other route that
[2477.0s] you're going to take is still the best
[2479.6s] so Tano you can read for us Mark 11:
[2484.2s] 24 uh the Bible says therefore I say to
[2488.3s] you whatever things you ask when you
[2491.2s] pray believe that you receive them and
[2494.1s] you will have them amen that's a
[2497.4s] powerful text it says that whenever we
[2499.8s] are praying we should believe and truly
[2503.2s] often times we believe but then the
[2505.5s] answer doesn't turn out the way we still
[2507.8s] wanted but one thing we can trust God
[2510.8s] for is that um you know he's quote
[2513.8s] unquote our manufacturer if you are to
[2516.4s] buy something from someone a
[2519.1s] manufacturer the things usually come
[2521.3s] with users manual and so it means that
[2524.4s] this person who made it knows how each
[2526.9s] and every single part of that um item
[2530.0s] works and should it malfunction the best
[2532.6s] person to take it back to would be the
[2534.7s] manufacturer yes similarly Our God who
[2537.5s] is our creator created us and he knows
[2541.0s] what is best for us he knows what when
[2544.2s] problems come to us you know how to fix
[2546.4s] those problems and that means that we
[2548.7s] can truly and surely trust him even when
[2551.6s] things don't go the way we as human
[2553.6s] beings want wanted them to go um I'd
[2557.0s] like to invite um our panelists for
[2559.9s] closing remarks um should there be any
[2562.9s] before we close in prayer maybe from
[2565.6s] teacher
[2566.9s] Eugene
[2569.1s] um um I'll just Echo what you said about
[2573.3s] submitting ourselves to God's
[2575.6s] will it is has often been the case in
[2579.0s] how God works that he gives us gifts
[2583.6s] that are wrapped in trials and things
[2586.8s] that are not very
[2588.4s] pleasant um and uh we shouldn't be too
[2592.0s] quick to judge God's will because it
[2595.4s] manifests in the long
[2597.7s] term I remember the story of Samson who
[2600.5s] found a honeycomb but it was inside a
[2604.3s] dead lion all right so that's how our
[2608.0s] God works most of the time he puts
[2609.6s] treasure in jws of clay it seems bad at
[2612.4s] first then you are thanking him for it
[2615.4s] in a matter of time so let's just keep
[2618.7s] walking with him and entrusting
[2621.0s] ourselves to him no matter what he
[2624.0s] send everything he sends is
[2627.9s] needful nothing he withholds is needful
[2631.2s] amen amen yeah I think for me you know
[2635.0s] this is just a few days towards the end
[2636.7s] of the year so it's possibly maybe a
[2638.8s] week and a few days then we done with
[2640.6s] this year I'll just do it simple short
[2644.4s] and precise learn to manage your
[2647.0s] expectations and for sure and for
[2649.3s] certain you shall not be disappointed
[2652.1s] that's it that's for me and I can
[2654.8s] certain you one year from now you
[2656.2s] remember my statement and then you shall
[2658.4s] not be heartbroken otherwise we may take
[2660.9s] you to hospital because you know you
[2663.6s] heart broken by so and so just learn to
[2665.8s] manage your expectation that's from me
[2667.6s] and I'm wishing you all the
[2670.4s] best yeah I'd also say that right now we
[2673.8s] are considered the Israel that is new
[2677.9s] that is spiritual Israel and not the
[2680.6s] Israelites spoken of in the
[2683.0s] Bible are we looking for Christ to come
[2686.8s] as a hero it's interesting to me that
[2689.6s] even when we go to heaven Christ will
[2691.4s] still be a servant ushering Us in
[2694.2s] welcoming us to his place taking us to
[2697.1s] Heaven showing us the things around I
[2699.5s] remember the text in zakariah that
[2701.7s] Christ is actually with children and
[2703.5s] there some people are wondering what are
[2705.3s] these wounds that you have in your hands
[2708.4s] and he says these are wounds I received
[2711.0s] in the house of my friends and I'm just
[2714.5s] thinking about this that Christ is a
[2717.8s] servant at heart it wasn't just a show
[2720.7s] that he came to put on the earth it's
[2723.0s] something that he did because of the
[2724.7s] love he has towards us
[2727.8s] so the thought that I have today is we
[2730.8s] also can be someone's hero and let's
[2734.0s] pray to God that our heroism may be seen
[2737.8s] in Acts of service and not in Acts that
[2740.7s] we wish others to do to us as a result
[2743.9s] of our heroic acts amen amen we will
[2748.7s] close with prayer let's
[2750.7s] pray Heavenly Father we thank you so
[2753.5s] much for your love towards us thank you
[2756.0s] that Lord you have been a servant to us
[2759.2s] we have read about you in Isaiah 53 and
[2761.8s] at that point no one really would have
[2764.0s] desired to have been involved with you
[2766.3s] but Lord it is through that that we are
[2768.7s] saved so we give you glory and honor and
[2771.2s] we pray that Lord you may teach us in
[2773.6s] your own spheres in your own ways to
[2776.5s] help us to be servant leaders just like
[2779.2s] you may we be heroes through servant
[2781.6s] through service oh dear God be with us
[2784.2s] um this day and may your will be done in
[2786.2s] our lives for it is in Jesus name we
[2788.6s] pray and believe amen amen amen
