FULL TRANSCRIPT:
Welcome to the lesson for today. My name is Ariana Kima and I'll be taking you through the mission story. Our story comes from Thailand and our main character is Pepe. And the title of our mission story today is a cupcake to share. Pepe had a sister called Shimshim who he loved very much. He loved her so much that anytime he was happy, he wanted her to be happy. When he was smiling, he wanted her to smile. When there was a special treat, he wanted her his sister also to enjoy it. Pepe had a friend in school who had a birthday celebration and he wanted to share the celebration with his sister. His friend brought a whole packet of cupcakes to school and it was distributed to everyone in his class. As everyone was picking the cupcakes, Pepe thought about his sister Shimshim. He took his cupcake, but he hesitated to eat it. As everyone was picking their cupcakes, Pepe thought about his sister, and he was like, "Should I eat my cupcake or not? Should I leave it for my sister or not?" He was very kind and decided that he was going to eat a small piece and leave it for his sister, Shimshim. And when his teacher noticed that he wasn't eating his cupcake, she went and asked him, "Paye, why aren't you eating your cupcake?" and he said that he wanted to leave it for his sister. So his teacher went back and sat at the back. Pepe looked back and saw that the packet of cupcakes was still almost full. And he went behind to ask the teacher if he could get one for his sister. And the teacher realized that Pepe wanted to actually share the cupcake with his sister and not have it for himself. So the teacher allowed Pepe to have an extra cupcake. And Pepe was very happy. When he reached home, he gave it to his sister and he was very happy that his sister was able to share the celebration with him. The 13th Sabbath offering given several years ago was helped to build Pepe School and his school is Korat Adventist International School. Just as Pepe was had a spirit of willing to give to his sister, we also should have the spirit of sacrificing to give in the 13th Sabbath offering. Let's pray. Our kind and heavenly father, we thank you for this day. Thank you for the gift of life. Thank you for the mission story that you've read about Pepe. Lord, I pray that you may give us a spirit of willing to share and to sacrifice an offering that will help to build and help the missionary kid pepe in his school. Father, thank you for this day for I pray in Jesus name. Amen. Greetings to all of you and thank you for joining us today. Our lesson last week, which was lesson number four of our cornerstone connections lesson, was appearance versus reality. This week we are going to move into lesson five to discuss at a maltus homecoming. Going home is always a pleasant event and most of the time when we look forward to going home we are either going to meet with our family, our parents, those whom we love most. But in this case we find that when Jesus went back home after starting his public ministry he had a tumultous homecoming. and we are going to be discussing this today. Joining me on the panel today is my brother on the left can introduce himself Javan. Javan Goombbo and on my right we have Salmon Sakati. Yes, Javon. Javan and Salmon will be guiding us through this lesson. Remember we are in lesson five called Atamalta's homecoming. Before we begin, I'd like to invite Javan to give us a word of prayer. Let's pray. Eternal and everlasting master, we come we come before you this morning with un heart. Oh Lord, we ask you to be to be with us for this lesson and help us to understand what we're about to take through. Lord your sins, forgive us all our sins and trespasses. Make us all and before thee in just name I pray trusting and believing. Amen. Amen. Amen. So let's get right into the lesson that we'll be discussing today. And I'd like Javan to actually take us through the what do you think section because these are some of the questions that can engage us from the beginning and help us to understand how this tamaltus homecoming occurred. So Javan please lead us through the what do you think section. Okay. In the what do you think section I'll just read this paragraph. Uh what would you expect to see today if you'd joined uh throng to hear a preacher you you'd heard about who spoke truth in a new powerful way brought out something strong reaction from his listeners and rebuked the religious establishment? Uh Salmon what would you think uh when such a an event would happen? Uh podcast is Salmon. Okay. And what about you Chaniko? Yeah, I honestly would go with the same thought. I think this is somebody who podcasts his sermons. You know, sometimes uh from what I'm seeing, people might not accept you so much. And especially if you go, you're wearing a sharp suit or you have a beautiful wife from what is written in the what do you think section. I was just thinking this is not what I'd expect from a preacher who's probably going against the establishment, right? cuz they'll actually be judged more critically than anyone else who's not speaking something that is unpopular. So nobody would want to give you their pulpit for example. So you'd probably be running your own podcast. So I'd also go with the same podcast your sermons. Yeah. To be honest, me too. also say also say the same thing because even if I was a an owner of if I was the church pastor of any church I wouldn't be really comfortable giving giving my church or to give him the pullpit to say some controversial messages. So I'd also go for the same answer to podcast sermons. Uh what if you found out a route that the preacher was a guy you'd grown you'd grown up with who was studious and attentive to duty as a child but who didn't appear to you to become someone who would grow up to be anything special. Then upon seeing him you realize that he doesn't have he doesn't fit what you envisioned him and and at all and that he is someone special. So, I'd actually be be shocked at this event that is taking place because as it says over here, you'd never expect anything really special from this guy because he he was attentive when he was a child, but he didn't really show much of potential when to be something especially in the future. So I'd actually be shocked and asked I would have asked myself what did this person do to make him reach this point. Salmon, what do you think about that? Yeah, I think I'd also be shocked if not mostly being shocked because as I said it's someone who you didn't see anything special in someone you probably looked down upon but here he's proving you wrong. So probably be shocked, surprised but uh people change. So yeah. What about you Shaniko? Yeah, it's it's an interesting question maybe also just engaging with you guys on this like is there a friend of yours today who you say there's no way this guy can be a pastor and without mentioning the name could you just say some of the characteristics maybe you've seen in some people who you're either in school with or you're studying with and you say there's no way I think this person will be a pastor in the future. What are some of the characteristics they're showing currently? Um, this person uh usually says a lot of cuss words first to say that I wouldn't really expect a pastor to be saying cuss words. Mhm. Uh he's a lustful person too. He's really he's really lustful. That's all I can say about this person. M. So you have a friend who is saying a lot of cuss words and swearing a lot and then you feel that they're a lustful person. So he's checking out maybe ladies or something like that. So you're very uncomfortable with that. Uh-huh. And you you think that in the future you really doubt this is the path they'll be going into. I'm very sure you want to be a pastor. Okay. Okay. Uh-huh. How about you Salmon? I also have a friend who uh he likes fighting. He so there's a time he fought and he was asked why do you love fighting? He said I just feel like I miss fighting so I have to fight. So the guy is just very hostile with people. So I don't think there is any way that that person may be a pastor because you're not going to talk to a congre congregation where if they if they're quiet, you want to fight them all of a sudden. So I really doubt that you become a pastor. Yeah. Thanks. Thanks. And yeah, as I think about it, I also have friends who I had somebody who like you said used to love fighting and if there was a frackus, he was the one causing it. almost the loudest mouth. Now, at this point in time that we are speaking, he's actually a priest and a pastor. When he actually announced this, we were very shocked that this is actually what he changed his career into. And if you to ask anyone who was with me in high school, that there was no way that could have happened. So, when I'm thinking about this instance, that has actually just come to mind. And I was saying maybe with time there are some people who we may write off because we grew up with them. But in eventually you can see the work of God. And this actually reminds me about the story of Paul. You can imagine if you're a child and you saw Paul coming to persecute people. Imagine maybe your parents were taken to prison as a result of preaching the gospel and Paul was the one who came into church at that time. Then a few years later you see Paul is the preacher coming to your church. For sure you'd be shocked, right? Yeah, it would be something so surprising. But that's actually what the gospel and the power of God does in our lives. So as we want to now dig deep into this Tamilas homecoming, I'd like you Salmon to actually take us through this story and show us what is it that happened in this Talas homecoming when Jesus actually went home. And you can take us through this from the book of Luke 4:E 16 all the way to verse 30. to someone please go ahead. So uh as you've heard this from the stories from Luke 4:16-30 it's a story of Jesus. So Jesus went back to Nazareth and he went to the synagogue as was his custom on the Sabbath day. So he stood up to read the word of God. So he took a scroll and it was of the prophet. He asked for a scroll and was given one of the prophet Isaiah. So he read what it was written, "The spirit of the Lord is on me because he has anointed me to proclaim good news to the poor. He has sent me to proclaim freedom for the prisoners and recovery of sight for the blind, to set the oppressed free, to proclaim the year of the Lord's favor." Then he rolled the scroll and he gave it back to the attendant. So he said today this prophecy has been fulfilled. So everyone spoke well of him and they were amazed at the words that he said. But then one person said is in this Joseph's son they so they start asking each other. So Jesus said to them, "Surely he quot this proverb to me, physician, heal yourself and you will tell me do here do here in your hometown what we have heard you did in Capernum." So Jesus was healing in other cities, other towns, but he hadn't healed in Nazareth. So the people were trying to make him prove his power by healing people. So Jesus said that truly no prophet is accepted in his hometown. And he started um assuring them about giving them basically their history about Elijah. There were many widows in Israel in Elijah's time. But he went to the widow. God sent him to the widow of Zarif, right? Which wasn't part of the region. Spoke about Elisha. Uh there were many lepers in Israel at that time, but he healed Nmon who was a Syrian. So Jesus was just trying to show them that a prophet isn't accepted in his own people. And this is basically for many reasons because find that people are seeing you as a child misbehaving but now you're trying to tell them what's the right thing to do. They really look down on you. This is a son of a carpenter. What can he tell us that this prophecy is being fulfilled? So all the people in the synagogue were furious with him after these words. So they took him, they wanted to take him to a cliff and throw him off, but he walked right through them, which basically shows the power that Jesus had as God and still has. Yeah. Amen. Amen. Now, just to engage your minds further on this subject. If if I look back at this story, I I look at something uh interesting in that when Jesus was telling them that this prophecy is fulfilled in your ears, you can imagine all the grand thoughts they had about what Jesus was saying because he was not only saying that he's Messiah, he was also saying that he's God. Now, let me ask you, if one of your friends today actually came and told you that I am God and you've grown up with him all the time, what would you say? Salmon, I wouldn't believe them. First, I' I'd tell them that's blasphemy. It's wrong. Mhm. Also, I'd say stop calling the name of the Lord God in vain because you don't say you're God. You I've been with you all this time misbehaving, so I don't think you are God. There is no way. There's no way. I wouldn't believe them. Mhm. How about you, Javan? If a friend of yours who you grew up with suddenly came one day back to your city and said, "I am God." What would you say? Uh, first of all, I'd really get annoyed. Mhm. Because that's blasphemy at first from the word go. You've already done something which is wrong and is not according to the Bible. Mhm. And it takes me back to when in the Bible where it says many will come calling calling saying that they are God in my name. And I' I'd really not believe him to be honest. Mhm. Uh that will not h that will not be really good. I'd tell them that that because it's it's it's not it's not a right thing to do to come all of a sudden then say you're God. M that is really not right. I'd tell him that. And if he doesn't listen to that, let him do whatever he's doing because I already know what what the truth is. If he continues lying to people, advise them accordingly. If they don't listen, well and good. Mhm. But I and reading the Bible, I know what the truth is. So I will really not believe him at all. No way I would. Yes. Yes. Thank you. Thank you, Javan. So, as we read this story, I'd like you people to actually understand that that's actually the case that happened. So, it wasn't like just some happen stance or something that came suddenly on them. They had been hearing that Jesus is doing miracles along around many cities in their midst and he's healing people. He's teaching. He's preaching and then that day he's come to Nazareth. You can imagine all the friends who grew up with him are there. His mother and father are there. His sisters are there. And then he goes and reads the verse in Isaiah. Then he says, "This scripture is today fulfilled in your hearing." Now you know at first when he read these words, the people loved the message that you're speaking. They could relate to all the things that you were saying. But eventually now he says this scripture is fulfilled in your hearing. And you know everyone knew that verse to be referring to the Messiah. And they're like wait what are you saying? Are you saying that you're the Messiah really? That was the question that went through all these people people's minds and now the people now started asking and wondering has he lost his mind? Has he come here to tell us these things to uh question our feelings? Then the Bible goes and says, "You will surely say to me this proverb, physician, heal yourself. Whatever you have done in Capernam, do also here in your country." Now, if you can do all the good things outside there to other people, why can't you also do this good deeds to us? Now, Jesus, instead of saying, "I will do for you guys a miracle." so that you can believe me. He says, "Even in the time of Elijah, there were many widows in Israel, but it was done to the other heathen nations. He went to a widow in a heathen nation. And during the time of Elisha, uh he was there were many lepers in Israel, but it was Nmon the Syrian who was actually healed." So we can see from this illustration that Christ was basically saying prophets are not accepted among their own people. The same way you have told me today that you might start doubting your friends and start thinking otherwise if they told you today that I am the Messiah or I am Christ. It's actually the same feeling the Nazarites were feeling at that time and they were saying I'm not sure this is actually the Messiah. This was the guy we used to work hard with here. If he was God, he would have just carried these things. There was no need to do hard work. He would have done a miracle to save himself. Now, the moment he said the illustrations about Elisha and Elijah, that's when they decided to kick him out of the synagogue. And remember, it was Sabbath. So, they said, "We actually want to kill someone on the Sabbath." Now the commandments clearly say thou shalt not kill. But these guys actually wanted to kill Jesus. And you can notice from the earliest onset of the time of his ministry, people already started saying they want to kill him. Now this brings out an important truth from the out of the story part which is that the truth hurts. So I'd like to pass back a question to both of you and I'll start with Javan then go to Salmon. Now we know that the truth hurts and in this story we see Jesus is protected from being thrown off the cliff because the people were angry with him. Now does God always protect us from the consequences of saying the truth even when it hurts other people? Does God always protect us? Uh first in the Bible there's a verse says that see the truth and the truth will set you free. I'm not really sure what the verse is but uh I think God will protect us but it depends with how you take it in different ways. Mhm. So, um if you if they persecute you for saying the truth, that means you are even they're trying to justify your point that you're seeing facts. And I think God will protect you and God will always protect you whenever you're standing up for the truth because that's that's what the Bible says. You need to stand for the truth. And when you say the truth, the truth will set you free. Amen. Yes. I think as I said it depends on what you take protection as because uh we know of the disciples. Peter was crucified upside down or saying the truth. John went through uh different types of torture but eventually he was put in uh is it boiling water or boiling oil? Boiling oil. willing God protected him from that but he was taken to an island where he was alone but he still wrote revelation so also we have the Christians in the dark ages he stood up for the truth but they were persecuted so I think we as human beings we may say God does not always protect us but if you if you have died for the truth you're guaranteed you're going to be in heaven so I think God has protected your future at that. Yeah. Amen. So the protection that we're looking for is not the protection in the current time, but it's what God has promised us, which is eternal life. So even if we die when seeing the truth, we should be happy that we didn't compromise. And that's why Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, for example, said to Nebuchadnezzar when he wanted to throw them in the fiery furnace, we will not worship and bow down to your image. Even if you take us into the fiery furnace and even if God doesn't protect us, that is fine with us. And the ultimate sacrifice we see of Jesus is that he spoke the truth. In fact, Jesus says, "I am the way, the truth, and the life." And Jesus wasn't God did not allow Jesus to be killed immediately because as the Bible says his time had not yet come. So we find that Christ eventually died for the truth that he spoke. But it was because God had postponed the time that he was to die. Because we notice from this verse that Luke 4 18 and 19 was a fulfillment of a prophecy. And so in going with the prophetic timeline, we also learn that Jesus died at the right time based on what what had been written by the prophets. So I'd like us to go into the key text and I'd like Javan for you to lead us in that. Okay. The key text is Luke 4:18 and 19. Says, "The spirit of the Lord is on me because he has he has anointed me to proclaim good news to the poor. He has sent me to proclaim freedom to the prisoners and re recovery of the sight of the blind to set the oppressed free to proclaim the year of the Lord's favor. Mhm. So um that is just uh the key text that we have read and what I would pick out from this key text is that uh this is Jesus speaking and he was sent and uh remember that Jesus said that he was sent to seek and save the lost. He was sent to go to people. So Jesus did not come for his own uh benefit but to benefit others. People were to be blessed for for his by his presence. So um that's what I would take from that key text. Yeah. Now there's a question that is in our lesson and I'll start with you Salmon. Yeah. This words was spoken in fulfillment of the prophecy about Jesus. So Jesus was actually reading about a prophecy about himself. Okay. Now are there certain words in the Bible which you feel are applicable to you and apply to you even at this moment? For example, at that time it said this scripture is fulfilled in your ears. So are there things that you feel apply to you not as a prophetic fulfillment but more with certainty and you can think about the promises of God in the Bible or anything that you've ever felt maybe in the past maybe not immediately but you've seen God working and telling you this is what you should do at this moment. Oh really trying to think about it. Okay. As you think Javan. Okay. Uh one verse that comes in mind the first that came in mind was many will come in my name saying that the Messiah. Mhm. Uh there are many who have come out saying that they they are God and and to surprisingly they still they have people who are following them. Mhm. Uh those are words that that's the first verse that came in mind when it was saying that when when you asked the question. So many people have come many many will come in my name proclaiming that they the me that they are Jesus. And another one is that wars uh diseases will be the uh what is this word will be a sign of my coming and to we have all seen that there have been wars you have had pandemics not some 5 years ago we had the coid9 pandemic and it it gives me hope that Christ return is soon and we need to We need to be stronger in our faith and be steadfast in him. Amen. Amen. Yes, someone. I think I found mine, but I don't think it's a promise. But in 1st Samuel 16:7, Mhm. Uh it says, "But the Lord said to someone, do not look at his appearance or his physical stature because I have refused him." For the Lord does not see as man sees. for man looks at the outward appearance but the Lord looks at the heart. So I think it's almost like a guarantee that no matter what you're doing, maybe you're applying for a job, you think your appearance may not be there, but maybe the person who's hiring you Mhm. Just like God does not look at the outward appearance, looks at your character, not necessarily what you've achieved. So Mhm. I think at this it's also there many people who look down on themselves. They think they're not enough. Mhm. But with this at least they can see that God does not look at you as man says. He looks in your heart. Yeah. Amen. Amen. Thank you. So going into the spirit of prophecy section for this lesson, we were supposed to read two chapters in the book Desire of Ages. Now Desire of Ages is a book written by Ellen White and it covers a lot of the concepts in Jesus' life. And one of the chapters is chapter 23 which talks about the kingdom is at hand and chapter 24 talks about is this not the carpenter's son? Now these two chapters highlight a few important points which we notice that Jesus came in direct fulfillment of the prophecy covered in the book of Daniel chapter 8 and 9 and this was about the 70we prophecy where the coming of the Messiah was prophesied to be exactly in the year AD27 and this was prophesied based on the start date of 457 BC in Daniel chapter 8 which was the time when the king Atacus gave the decree to restore and build Jerusalem and it says there'll be uh 69 weeks until the Messiah comes. So 69 weeks from that time you'd end up in the year AD27. And in AD27 Jesus started his public ministry at the time when he was baptized. When Jesus there was a voice from heaven saying this is my beloved son in whom I I am well pleased. That is the time the message began to go out stating that the kingdom is at hand. Christ had come to fulfill the work of starting to take away sin from the earth eventually culminating in his death in the year AD31. And after Jesus went to heaven, his disciples continued the work of spreading the gospel until eventually they stoned Steven to close the period of 70 weeks in the year AD.34 where they stoned Steven. And now the apostles decided we can now take this gospel to the Gentiles because the time of the probation for the Jews had actually been closed. Now going to the next chapter which is chapter 24. That was just a summary of chapter 23. Chapter 24 talks about is this not the carpenter's son. So Christ had been living with people in Nazareth for a while and they saw him working with his dad laboring hard to do all the things he could do to help his family make a living. And he still maintained his righteous character. He never sinned in any way. Now when he came back to Nazareth and preaches the sermon based on Isaiah chapter 61, the people got angry with him because the question was how can you be claiming that you are actually the Messiah and this really angered them because they had seen him grow up in Nazareth and they were wondering after you have done this few miracles and done all these good works is it possible that you are the Messiah? And you know they saw the life of struggle which he had and they thought that he'd come to liberate them from the Romans. But shock on them Christ had actually come to liberate them from sin because they didn't see that their captivity was not actually to sin itself. They thought they needed liberation from the Romans. So they thought that Christ would come to bring an earthly kingdom. But he actually came to preach the message of the gospel of the kingdom of God. And now together with all that we had said earlier, they really didn't like his words. And they decided that now is a good time to end his life. But the angels of God came and took him away from their midst. And instead of Jesus being killed that day, he was saved from the arms of the angry people in Nazareth. And we find that later in the gospel, he still came to try and plead with the people in Nazareth for them to be saved, but they still rejected him. So that was just a summary of the spirit of prophecy part and I'd like someone to actually give us uh some thoughts and questions from the out of the story part based on what we have shared and covered so far. Okay. So, here's one. Why do you think why do you think the listeners his listeners were amazed at the gracious words he spoke? Yeah. Uh they were amazed because especially when he said that these words are fulfilled this day. Uh as Chaniko said, they saw these these these they saw Jesus growing up. uh they knew he's the son of the carpenter. They knew that they knew the struggles that he went through to even get to to get where he was. And he he basically came for a from a black background and as I think that the the Israelites of that time thought that the Messiah is going to come from a royal family, he's going to come from a kingship but really it was the opposite. That is one thing that amazed them and the fact that uh they saw him growing up and they knew his background is what amazed them. I think that's why they were amazed because they saw Jesus growing up and all the challenges that he went through when he was a child and all of a sudden he comes and tells them that he's the Messiah. That's what I think about that. Okay. So okay let me add before I ask another one. Mhm. Also think they hadn't first before he added uh that he hadn't realized that he was describing himself. So they were still they thought oh so probably the king is going to be born today. Probably the the king is going to come and liberate us today. M they hadn't realized that Jesus was talking about himself. So the next one the amazement quickly turned to fury. I think Javan has answered that. So the last one why was the mob unsuccessful in its attempt to kill Jesus then and there? I think you can answer that. Yeah. Why was the mob unsuccessful in killing Jesus? The reason is because God is the one who actually has our lives in his hand. If God allows you to be killed today, he will actually allow it to happen. But if he decides that he will not allow you to die, he will not do it even if the devil wants to. And we can see that for example from the account of Job that Job, God said you do anything you want to him but do not take his life. And we actually see that Job did not die because God had said he cannot die. We see Elijah, not Elijah but Enoch for example who went to heaven. He did not taste death and God had ordained that he will never die. Now Moses struck the rock instead of speaking to the rock as God commanded him. And of course he was looking forward to actually going into the land of Canaan. And he begged God to allow him. Now God forgave him but he did not allow him to go into Canaan which actually shows us that God has your life in his hands and is the one who makes a determination on when you actually die. Now it's also true that you may make a decision to end your life early and God may allow it to happen. But if he still thinks his will needs to accomp be accomplished with you, then even if you try to kill your life, you'll still find that some people tried hanging themselves or overdosing on some drugs, but they still did not end up dying even though they took lethal doses. And that shows us that God is actually at work. And he's watching us. And if it is his will that he lets you rest or go to uh the grave, then he'll allow it. So I believe that Jesus was not allowed to die and I know some people normally say that's his time has reached and definitely it's God who only allows it. It's not without his permission that we die. So that's how I'd answer that question. Okay. Thank you. Thank you. Yeah. Thanks for taking us and you can go ahead and lead us through the punchlines as well. So I think everyone will take one starting from Java. Okay. When he was this is Luke 2 verse 42 to 49. It says when he was 12 years old they went up to the festival while his parents were returning home. The boy stay the boy Jesus stayed behind in Jerusalem. After 3 days they found him in the temple court sitting among the teacher listening to him and asking them questions. Everyone who heard him was amazed and his understanding and he at his understanding his answers. And when his parents saw him, they were astonished. They astonished. His mother asked him, "Son, why have you treated us like this? Your father and I have been anxiously searching for you. Why are you searching for me?" He asked, "Didn't you know that I'm in my father's house?" Amen. Amen. Now the other punchline is from Matthew 23:37 where the Bible says, "Jerusalem, Jerusalem, you who kill the prophets and stone those sent to you, how often have I longed to gather your children together as a hen gathers her cheeks under her wings, and you were not willing." Jesus wanted acceptance as one of the prophets from the people in Nazareth. But it's these people who decided that I'm killing him as a prophet. So it was quite sad that they rejected Jesus. That applies to me as I I can related to the story that is here. Okay. The last one is John 7:28-30. Then Jesus still teaching in the temple cried out, "Yes, you know me and you know where I am from. I'm not from here on my own authority, but he who sent me is true. You do not know him, but I know him because I am from him and he sent me. At this they tried to see him to seize him, but no one laid a hand on him because his hour had not yet come. I think as Nichol said, God is one who knows your time. He has your life in his hands. So his not come and that's why they weren't able to lay their hands on him. Amen. Amen. So, as you've joined us for this lesson, you've seen the Tamaltus homecoming. Christ went to Nazareth where he had been born, but they actually rejected him. The book Desire of Ages, page 239, Ellen White writes that our standing before God depends not upon the amount of light we have received, but upon the use of we make of what we have. God actually expects more from us and the Nazarites after seeing all that Jesus had done should have made more of the light which they had received. So before we close this I'll like to pass it to my panel Javan please give a closing thought on the lesson. I'll come to you Salmon next then we close. Um what uh the closing thought about this lesson is that um first of all God has our lives in his hands. Mhm. If today is the day that it was agreed that you're going to uh pass away. It is going to be today. First of all thing is that people change as Chaniko you said that you had a friend in high school who liked fighting. Then all of a sudden you heard that you was a priest. So God God saw that there was potential in this person to the point that he allowed that to he allowed him to become a priest. Um basically that's what I can I got it from this lesson. Thank you Javan. I think uh I'll take my finishing thought from the first part from desire ves page 235 says we have reached the period in fortold the period foretold in these scriptures the time of the end is come the visions of the prophets are unsealed and the solemn warnings point us to our lord's coming in glory as near at hand so I think this shows that we in the end times. So, we should really look upon the word of the Lord for guidance the final days. Yeah. Amen. Thank you all so much for joining us. We've seen Jesus as the fulfillment of prophecy and we've seen that those who know us the longest sometimes are the people who find it hard not to accept us. But it is my hope and prayer that we can all accept Jesus as the one who lead us into eternity. And let us not be like those in Nazareth who rejected him. And when Jesus comes back to take us home, it will be a tumultuous homecoming for those who have rejected Jesus, but it will be a blessing to those who receive him even as we desire to go to heaven. My name is Niko Opio, one of the teachers of the teens, and I've been sharing this lesson with Javan and Salmon. So, I'd like to invite you Salmon to pray for us as we close. Let's pray. Kind of loving father, thank you for being with us. Thank you for guiding us through the lesson. Be with us, guide us, and help us to look upon your word. Jesus name we pray and believe. Amen. Amen. Please join us next week for lesson six which is titled I am a follower. I am a follower. See you then. 

==================================================

TIMESTAMPED TRANSCRIPT:
[0.1s] Welcome to the lesson for today. My name
[2.3s] is Ariana Kima and I'll be taking you
[4.2s] through the mission story. Our story
[7.1s] comes from Thailand and our main
[9.3s] character is Pepe. And the title of our
[11.6s] mission story today is a cupcake to
[13.8s] share. Pepe had a sister called Shimshim
[16.7s] who he loved very much. He loved her so
[19.7s] much that anytime he was happy, he
[22.2s] wanted her to be happy. When he was
[24.1s] smiling, he wanted her to smile. When
[26.4s] there was a special treat, he wanted her
[28.7s] his sister also to enjoy it. Pepe had a
[32.1s] friend in school who had a birthday
[34.4s] celebration and he wanted to share the
[36.6s] celebration with his sister. His friend
[38.8s] brought a whole packet of cupcakes to
[41.6s] school and it was distributed to
[44.3s] everyone in his class. As everyone was
[46.7s] picking the cupcakes, Pepe thought about
[49.8s] his sister Shimshim.
[51.9s] He took his cupcake, but he hesitated to
[55.4s] eat
[56.3s] it. As everyone was picking their
[58.8s] cupcakes, Pepe thought about his sister,
[61.4s] and he was like, "Should I eat my
[63.4s] cupcake or not? Should I leave it for my
[65.8s] sister or not?" He was very kind and
[68.2s] decided that he was going to eat a small
[70.3s] piece and leave it for his sister,
[72.4s] Shimshim. And when his teacher noticed
[74.7s] that he wasn't eating his cupcake, she
[77.1s] went and asked him, "Paye, why aren't
[79.5s] you eating your cupcake?" and he said
[81.1s] that he wanted to leave it for his
[83.1s] sister. So his teacher went back and sat
[85.5s] at the back. Pepe looked back and saw
[88.2s] that the packet of cupcakes was still
[91.1s] almost full. And he went behind to ask
[93.7s] the teacher if he could get one for his
[96.0s] sister. And the teacher realized that
[98.6s] Pepe wanted to actually share the
[100.6s] cupcake with his sister and not have it
[102.4s] for himself. So the teacher allowed Pepe
[105.2s] to have an extra cupcake. And Pepe was
[108.2s] very happy. When he reached home, he
[110.7s] gave it to his sister and he was very
[113.2s] happy that his sister was able to share
[115.3s] the celebration with him. The 13th
[117.9s] Sabbath
[119.0s] offering given several years ago was
[121.6s] helped to build Pepe School and his
[124.9s] school is Korat Adventist International
[127.3s] School.
[128.9s] Just as Pepe was had a spirit of willing
[132.6s] to give to his sister, we also should
[134.8s] have the spirit of sacrificing to give
[137.3s] in the 13th Sabbath offering. Let's
[140.0s] pray. Our kind and heavenly father, we
[142.6s] thank you for this day. Thank you for
[143.8s] the gift of life. Thank you for the
[145.4s] mission story that you've read about
[147.0s] Pepe. Lord, I pray that you may give us
[149.2s] a spirit of willing to share and to
[151.6s] sacrifice an offering that will help to
[154.2s] build and help the missionary kid pepe
[157.8s] in his school. Father, thank you for
[159.6s] this day for I pray in Jesus name. Amen.
[162.2s] Greetings to all of you and thank you
[164.2s] for joining us today. Our lesson last
[166.8s] week, which was lesson number four of
[169.2s] our cornerstone connections lesson, was
[172.4s] appearance versus reality. This week we
[175.9s] are going to move into lesson five to
[178.3s] discuss at a maltus
[180.8s] homecoming. Going home is always a
[183.3s] pleasant event and most of the time when
[185.8s] we look forward to going home we are
[188.2s] either going to meet with our family,
[190.0s] our parents, those whom we love
[192.8s] most. But in this case we find that when
[196.2s] Jesus went back home after starting his
[199.3s] public ministry he had a tumultous
[202.8s] homecoming. and we are going to be
[204.9s] discussing this today. Joining me on the
[207.9s] panel today is my brother on the left
[211.1s] can introduce himself Javan. Javan
[214.5s] Goombbo and on my right we have Salmon
[217.4s] Sakati. Yes, Javon. Javan and Salmon
[220.5s] will be guiding us through this lesson.
[222.6s] Remember we are in lesson five called
[225.6s] Atamalta's homecoming. Before we begin,
[229.0s] I'd like to invite Javan to give us a
[231.3s] word of prayer.
[233.0s] Let's pray. Eternal and everlasting
[235.7s] master, we come we come before you this
[237.3s] morning with un heart. Oh Lord, we ask
[239.6s] you to be to be with us for this lesson
[241.4s] and help us to understand what we're
[242.8s] about to take through. Lord your sins,
[245.4s] forgive us all our sins and trespasses.
[246.9s] Make us all and before thee in just name
[248.6s] I pray trusting and believing. Amen.
[250.5s] Amen.
[252.5s] Amen. So let's get right into the lesson
[255.7s] that we'll be discussing today. And I'd
[258.6s] like Javan to actually take us through
[260.8s] the what do you think section because
[262.8s] these are some of the questions that can
[265.2s] engage us from the beginning and help us
[267.8s] to understand how this tamaltus
[270.6s] homecoming occurred. So Javan please
[273.1s] lead us through the what do you think
[274.4s] section. Okay. In the what do you think
[277.3s] section I'll just read this paragraph.
[280.0s] Uh what would you expect to see today if
[283.6s] you'd joined uh throng to hear a
[286.7s] preacher you you'd heard about who spoke
[289.6s] truth in a new powerful way brought out
[292.6s] something strong reaction from his
[295.0s] listeners and rebuked the religious
[297.7s] establishment? Uh Salmon what would you
[301.8s] think uh when such a an event would
[304.9s] happen? Uh podcast is Salmon. Okay. And
[308.2s] what about you Chaniko? Yeah, I honestly
[310.1s] would go with the same thought. I think
[311.9s] this is somebody who podcasts his
[313.9s] sermons. You know, sometimes uh from
[317.0s] what I'm seeing, people might not accept
[319.4s] you so much. And especially if you go,
[321.6s] you're wearing a sharp suit or you have
[324.3s] a beautiful wife from what is written in
[326.3s] the what do you think section. I was
[328.5s] just thinking this is not what I'd
[329.9s] expect from a preacher who's probably
[332.2s] going against the establishment, right?
[334.6s] cuz they'll actually be judged more
[337.3s] critically than anyone else who's not
[339.1s] speaking something that is unpopular. So
[342.2s] nobody would want to give you their
[344.6s] pulpit for example. So you'd probably be
[346.9s] running your own podcast. So I'd also go
[348.8s] with the same podcast your sermons.
[351.3s] Yeah. To be honest, me too. also say
[353.3s] also say the same thing because even if
[355.1s] I was a an owner of if I was the church
[359.9s] pastor of any church I wouldn't be
[362.1s] really comfortable giving giving my
[364.3s] church or to give him the pullpit to say
[368.7s] some controversial messages. So I'd also
[371.5s] go for the same answer to podcast
[374.1s] sermons.
[375.8s] Uh what if you found out a route that
[379.4s] the preacher was a guy you'd grown you'd
[382.7s] grown up with who was studious and
[385.4s] attentive to duty as a child but who
[388.5s] didn't appear to you to become someone
[390.6s] who would grow up to be anything
[392.3s] special. Then upon seeing him you
[394.6s] realize that he doesn't have he doesn't
[396.3s] fit what you envisioned him and and at
[399.9s] all and that he is someone special.
[404.8s] So, I'd actually
[409.5s] be be shocked at this event that is
[412.6s] taking place because as it says over
[415.4s] here, you'd never expect anything really
[419.6s] special from this guy because he he was
[423.8s] attentive when he was a
[425.5s] child,
[427.5s] but he didn't really show much of
[430.0s] potential when to be something
[432.8s] especially in the future. So I'd
[434.9s] actually be shocked and asked I would
[437.8s] have asked myself what did this person
[440.1s] do to make him reach this point. Salmon,
[444.1s] what do you think about that? Yeah, I
[446.8s] think I'd also be shocked if
[451.3s] not mostly being shocked because as I
[454.4s] said it's someone who you didn't see
[457.3s] anything special in someone you probably
[460.2s] looked down upon but here he's proving
[462.7s] you wrong. So probably be shocked,
[467.1s] surprised but
[469.6s] uh people change. So yeah.
[472.7s] What about you
[473.9s] Shaniko? Yeah, it's it's an interesting
[476.5s] question maybe also just engaging with
[478.8s] you guys on this like is there a friend
[481.4s] of yours today who you say there's no
[484.2s] way this guy can be a
[487.2s] pastor and without mentioning the name
[490.6s] could you just say some of the
[492.0s] characteristics maybe you've seen in
[493.8s] some people who you're either in school
[495.3s] with or you're studying with and you say
[498.2s] there's no way I think this person will
[500.0s] be a pastor in the future. What are some
[502.0s] of the characteristics they're showing
[503.6s] currently?
[506.8s] Um, this person
[509.8s] uh usually says a lot of cuss words
[512.7s] first to say that I wouldn't really
[516.2s] expect a pastor to be saying cuss words.
[519.4s] Mhm. Uh he's a lustful person too. He's
[524.4s] really he's really lustful. That's all I
[527.1s] can say about this person. M. So you
[530.0s] have a friend who is saying a lot of
[533.0s] cuss words and swearing a lot and then
[535.6s] you feel that they're a lustful person.
[537.7s] So he's checking out maybe ladies or
[540.2s] something like that. So you're very
[541.8s] uncomfortable with that. Uh-huh. And you
[544.0s] you think that in the future you really
[546.3s] doubt this is the path they'll be going
[548.2s] into. I'm very sure you want to be a
[549.8s] pastor. Okay. Okay. Uh-huh. How about
[553.0s] you Salmon? I also have a friend who
[557.0s] uh he likes fighting. He so there's a
[561.6s] time he fought and he was asked why do
[564.3s] you love fighting? He said I just feel
[567.2s] like I miss fighting so I have to fight.
[571.2s] So the guy is just very hostile with
[573.0s] people. So I don't think there is any
[575.8s] way that that person may be a pastor
[578.0s] because you're not going to talk to a
[579.9s] congre congregation where if they if
[583.7s] they're quiet, you want to fight them
[585.4s] all of a sudden. So I really doubt that
[587.8s] you become a pastor.
[590.6s] Yeah. Thanks. Thanks. And yeah, as I
[593.0s] think about it, I also have friends who
[595.8s] I had somebody who like you said used to
[598.6s] love fighting and if there was a
[600.5s] frackus, he was the one causing it.
[602.2s] almost the loudest mouth. Now, at this
[605.0s] point in time that we are speaking, he's
[607.4s] actually a priest and a pastor. When he
[609.8s] actually announced this, we were very
[611.4s] shocked that this is actually what he
[613.3s] changed his career into. And if you to
[616.1s] ask anyone who was with me in high
[618.0s] school, that there was no way that could
[620.2s] have happened. So, when I'm thinking
[622.7s] about this instance, that has actually
[624.7s] just come to mind. And I was saying
[627.3s] maybe with time there are some people
[629.0s] who we may write off because we grew up
[631.1s] with them. But in eventually you can see
[633.7s] the work of God. And this actually
[635.9s] reminds me about the story of Paul. You
[638.4s] can imagine if you're a child and you
[640.0s] saw Paul coming to persecute people.
[642.2s] Imagine maybe your parents were taken to
[644.0s] prison as a result of preaching the
[645.8s] gospel and Paul was the one who came
[647.8s] into church at that time. Then a few
[650.4s] years later you see Paul is the preacher
[652.3s] coming to your church. For sure you'd be
[654.6s] shocked, right? Yeah, it would be
[656.2s] something so surprising. But that's
[658.2s] actually what the gospel and the power
[659.9s] of God does in our lives. So as we want
[663.5s] to now dig deep into this Tamilas
[666.5s] homecoming, I'd like you Salmon to
[668.9s] actually take us through this story and
[671.0s] show us what is it that happened in this
[673.2s] Talas homecoming when Jesus actually
[675.9s] went home. And you can take us through
[677.9s] this from the book of Luke 4:E 16 all
[681.2s] the way to verse 30. to someone please
[684.5s] go ahead. So uh as you've heard this
[687.5s] from the stories from Luke
[691.2s] 4:16-30 it's a story of Jesus. So Jesus
[695.5s] went back to Nazareth and he went to the
[698.9s] synagogue as was his custom on the
[700.9s] Sabbath day. So he stood up to read the
[705.5s] word of God. So he took a scroll and it
[709.6s] was of the prophet. He asked for a
[712.4s] scroll and was given one of the prophet
[714.7s] Isaiah. So he read what it was written,
[717.3s] "The spirit of the Lord is on me because
[719.5s] he has anointed me to proclaim good news
[721.4s] to the poor. He has sent me to proclaim
[724.2s] freedom for the prisoners and recovery
[726.4s] of sight for the blind, to set the
[728.6s] oppressed free, to proclaim the year of
[730.6s] the Lord's
[731.6s] favor." Then he rolled the scroll and he
[734.9s] gave it back to the attendant. So he
[737.2s] said today this prophecy has been
[740.5s] fulfilled. So everyone spoke well of him
[744.4s] and they were amazed at the words that
[747.0s] he
[748.2s] said. But then one person said is in
[751.7s] this Joseph's son they so they start
[755.4s] asking each other. So Jesus said to
[759.1s] them,
[761.7s] "Surely he quot this proverb to me,
[765.4s] physician, heal yourself and you will
[767.9s] tell me do here do here in your hometown
[771.8s] what we have heard you did in Capernum."
[774.6s] So Jesus was healing in other cities,
[777.3s] other towns, but he hadn't healed in
[780.1s] Nazareth. So the people were trying
[783.3s] to make him prove his power by healing
[787.5s] people. So Jesus said that truly no
[792.9s] prophet is accepted in his
[795.3s] hometown. And he started um assuring
[798.7s] them about giving
[800.8s] them basically their history about
[803.6s] Elijah. There were many widows in Israel
[806.7s] in Elijah's time. But he went to the
[809.9s] widow. God sent him to the widow of
[812.4s] Zarif, right? Which wasn't part of the
[814.8s] region. Spoke about
[817.5s] Elisha. Uh there were many lepers in
[821.3s] Israel at that time, but he healed Nmon
[825.4s] who was a Syrian. So Jesus was just
[828.9s] trying to show them
[830.2s] that a prophet isn't accepted in his own
[834.0s] people. And this is basically for many
[837.7s] reasons because find that people are
[840.4s] seeing you as a child misbehaving but
[842.8s] now you're trying to tell them what's
[844.0s] the right thing to do. They really look
[846.0s] down on you. This is a son of a
[848.1s] carpenter. What can he tell us that this
[850.9s] prophecy is being fulfilled?
[852.8s] So all the people in the synagogue were
[855.2s] furious with him after these words. So
[858.2s] they took him, they wanted to take him
[860.0s] to a cliff and throw him off, but he
[863.5s] walked right through them, which
[865.6s] basically shows the power
[868.0s] that Jesus had as God and still has.
[872.4s] Yeah.
[874.5s] Amen. Amen. Now, just to engage your
[877.5s] minds further on this
[881.0s] subject. If if I look back at this
[883.7s] story, I I look at something uh
[886.3s] interesting in that when Jesus was
[889.6s] telling them that this prophecy is
[891.8s] fulfilled in your ears, you can imagine
[894.6s] all the grand thoughts they had
[897.6s] about what Jesus was saying because he
[901.4s] was not only saying that he's Messiah,
[903.7s] he was also saying that he's God. Now,
[906.7s] let me ask you, if one of your friends
[909.2s] today actually came and told you that I
[912.2s] am God and you've grown up with him all
[915.4s] the time, what would you say? Salmon, I
[918.1s] wouldn't believe them. First, I' I'd
[920.7s] tell them that's blasphemy. It's wrong.
[922.7s] Mhm. Also, I'd say stop calling the name
[925.8s] of the Lord God in vain because you
[928.0s] don't say you're God. You I've been with
[930.3s] you all this time misbehaving, so I
[933.1s] don't think you are God. There is no
[934.8s] way. There's no way. I wouldn't believe
[936.6s] them. Mhm. How about you, Javan? If a
[939.7s] friend of yours who you grew up with
[941.5s] suddenly came one day back to your city
[943.5s] and said, "I am God." What would you
[946.1s] say?
[948.9s] Uh, first of all, I'd really get
[952.2s] annoyed. Mhm. Because that's blasphemy
[955.2s] at first from the word go. You've
[957.6s] already done something which is wrong
[962.1s] and is not according to the Bible. Mhm.
[964.6s] And it takes me back to when in the
[968.5s] Bible where it says many will come
[970.8s] calling calling saying that they are God
[973.4s] in my name. And I' I'd really not
[977.9s] believe him to be honest. Mhm. Uh that
[981.2s] will not h that will not be really good.
[985.3s] I'd tell them that that because it's
[988.6s] it's it's not it's not a right thing to
[991.2s] do to come all of a sudden then say
[993.3s] you're God. M that is really not right.
[995.8s] I'd tell him that.
[998.4s] And if he doesn't listen to
[1001.4s] that, let him do whatever he's doing
[1003.9s] because I already know what what the
[1005.6s] truth is. If he continues lying to
[1008.2s] people, advise them accordingly. If they
[1010.6s] don't listen, well and good. Mhm. But
[1014.2s] I and reading the Bible, I know what the
[1017.6s] truth is.
[1019.4s] So I will really not believe him at all.
[1022.0s] No way I would. Yes. Yes. Thank you.
[1025.0s] Thank you, Javan. So, as we read this
[1027.2s] story, I'd like you people to actually
[1029.0s] understand that that's actually the case
[1030.7s] that happened. So, it wasn't like just
[1033.3s] some happen stance or something that
[1035.6s] came suddenly on them. They had been
[1037.8s] hearing that Jesus is doing miracles
[1039.8s] along around many cities in their midst
[1043.7s] and he's healing people. He's teaching.
[1046.0s] He's preaching and then that day he's
[1048.7s] come to Nazareth. You can imagine all
[1051.2s] the friends who grew up with him are
[1052.8s] there. His mother and father are there.
[1055.4s] His sisters are there. And then he goes
[1058.3s] and reads the verse in Isaiah. Then he
[1061.3s] says, "This scripture is today fulfilled
[1064.2s] in your hearing." Now you know at first
[1066.8s] when he read these words, the people
[1069.5s] loved the message that you're speaking.
[1072.4s] They could relate to all the things that
[1074.4s] you were
[1075.2s] saying. But eventually now he says this
[1079.0s] scripture is fulfilled in your hearing.
[1081.9s] And you know everyone knew that verse to
[1084.6s] be referring to the Messiah. And they're
[1087.0s] like wait what are you saying? Are you
[1089.5s] saying that you're the Messiah really?
[1091.6s] That was the question that went through
[1093.3s] all these people people's
[1096.4s] minds and now the people now started
[1100.0s] asking and
[1101.4s] wondering has he lost his mind? Has he
[1104.4s] come here to tell us these things to uh
[1108.4s] question our feelings? Then the Bible
[1110.9s] goes and says, "You will surely say to
[1114.0s] me this proverb, physician, heal
[1116.6s] yourself. Whatever you have done in
[1119.2s] Capernam, do also here in your country."
[1122.8s] Now, if you can do all the good things
[1125.1s] outside there to other people, why can't
[1127.4s] you also do this good deeds to us? Now,
[1130.7s] Jesus, instead of saying, "I will do for
[1132.6s] you guys a miracle." so that you can
[1134.2s] believe me. He
[1136.2s] says, "Even in the time of
[1139.5s] Elijah, there were many widows in
[1141.7s] Israel, but it was done to the other
[1143.7s] heathen nations. He went to a widow in a
[1146.3s] heathen nation. And during the time of
[1148.6s] Elisha,
[1150.6s] uh he was there were many lepers in
[1153.0s] Israel, but it was Nmon the Syrian who
[1155.8s] was actually healed." So we can see from
[1158.5s] this illustration that Christ was
[1160.9s] basically saying prophets are not
[1164.0s] accepted among their own people. The
[1167.4s] same way you have told me today that you
[1169.4s] might start doubting your friends and
[1171.3s] start thinking otherwise if they told
[1172.9s] you today that I am the Messiah or I am
[1175.4s] Christ. It's actually the same feeling
[1177.5s] the Nazarites were feeling at that time
[1179.9s] and they were saying I'm not sure this
[1182.8s] is actually the Messiah. This was the
[1185.0s] guy we used to work hard with here. If
[1187.4s] he was God, he would have just carried
[1188.9s] these things. There was no need to do
[1190.2s] hard work. He would have done a miracle
[1192.1s] to save
[1193.2s] himself. Now, the moment he said the
[1196.7s] illustrations about Elisha and
[1199.6s] Elijah, that's when they decided to kick
[1202.6s] him out of the synagogue. And remember,
[1205.5s] it was Sabbath. So, they said, "We
[1207.7s] actually want to kill someone on the
[1210.0s] Sabbath."
[1211.7s] Now the commandments clearly say thou
[1213.6s] shalt not kill. But these guys actually
[1216.4s] wanted to kill
[1217.7s] Jesus. And you can notice from the
[1220.7s] earliest onset of the time of his
[1223.0s] ministry, people already started saying
[1226.0s] they want to kill
[1227.5s] him. Now this brings out an important
[1230.4s] truth from the out of the story part
[1232.6s] which is that the truth hurts.
[1236.9s] So I'd like to pass back a question to
[1239.0s] both of you and I'll start with Javan
[1240.7s] then go to
[1242.1s] Salmon. Now we know that the truth hurts
[1245.8s] and in this story we see Jesus is
[1248.6s] protected from being thrown off the
[1250.4s] cliff because the people were angry with
[1253.0s] him. Now does God always protect us from
[1257.0s] the consequences of saying the truth
[1260.3s] even when it hurts other
[1262.5s] people? Does God always protect us? Uh
[1266.0s] first in the Bible there's a verse says
[1268.0s] that see the truth and the truth will
[1269.9s] set you free. I'm not really sure what
[1271.8s] the verse is but uh I think God will
[1275.4s] protect us but it depends with how you
[1277.8s] take it in different ways. Mhm. So, um
[1282.3s] if you if they persecute you for saying
[1284.8s] the truth, that means you are even
[1288.3s] they're trying to justify your point
[1289.9s] that you're seeing facts.
[1292.6s] And I think God will protect you and God
[1295.8s] will always protect you whenever you're
[1298.9s] standing up for the truth because that's
[1301.0s] that's what the Bible says. You need to
[1303.3s] stand for the truth. And when you say
[1305.3s] the truth, the truth will set you free.
[1308.2s] Amen.
[1309.6s] Yes. I think as I said it depends on
[1313.9s] what you take protection as because uh
[1317.5s] we know of
[1319.3s] the disciples.
[1321.9s] Peter was crucified upside down or
[1324.5s] saying the truth. John went through
[1328.5s] uh different types of torture but
[1331.4s] eventually he was put in uh is it
[1335.0s] boiling water or boiling oil? Boiling
[1336.8s] oil. willing God protected him from that
[1339.8s] but he was taken to an island where he
[1341.5s] was alone but he still wrote revelation
[1344.1s] so also we have the Christians in the
[1347.8s] dark ages he stood up for the truth but
[1350.8s] they were persecuted so I
[1353.7s] think we as human beings we may say God
[1357.9s] does not always protect us
[1359.6s] but if you if you have died for the
[1362.9s] truth you're guaranteed you're going to
[1364.7s] be in heaven so I think God has
[1366.8s] protected your future at that. Yeah.
[1369.7s] Amen. So the protection that we're
[1371.9s] looking for is not the protection in the
[1373.8s] current time, but it's what God has
[1376.2s] promised us, which is eternal life. So
[1378.5s] even if we die when seeing the truth, we
[1381.3s] should be happy that we didn't
[1382.6s] compromise. And that's why Shadrach,
[1384.6s] Meshach, and Abednego, for example, said
[1387.1s] to Nebuchadnezzar when he wanted to
[1388.9s] throw them in the fiery furnace, we will
[1391.1s] not worship and bow down to your image.
[1394.1s] Even if you take us into the fiery
[1396.2s] furnace and even if God doesn't protect
[1398.7s] us, that is fine with us. And the
[1402.0s] ultimate sacrifice we see of Jesus is
[1405.4s] that he spoke the truth. In fact, Jesus
[1408.1s] says, "I am the way, the truth, and the
[1410.7s] life." And Jesus wasn't God did not
[1413.7s] allow Jesus to be killed immediately
[1416.2s] because as the Bible says his time had
[1418.9s] not yet come. So we find that Christ
[1422.2s] eventually died for the truth that he
[1424.7s] spoke. But it was because God had
[1427.6s] postponed the time that he was to die.
[1430.3s] Because we notice from this verse that
[1432.9s] Luke 4 18 and 19 was a fulfillment of a
[1436.9s] prophecy. And so in going with the
[1439.1s] prophetic timeline, we also learn that
[1442.1s] Jesus died at the right time based on
[1445.4s] what what had been written by the
[1447.5s] prophets. So I'd like us to go into the
[1450.2s] key text and I'd like Javan for you to
[1452.2s] lead us in
[1454.4s] that. Okay. The key text is Luke 4:18
[1459.3s] and 19. Says, "The spirit of the Lord is
[1462.1s] on me because he has he has anointed me
[1464.3s] to proclaim good news to the poor. He
[1466.6s] has sent me to proclaim freedom to the
[1468.6s] prisoners and re recovery of the sight
[1472.7s] of the blind to set the oppressed free
[1474.9s] to proclaim the year of the Lord's
[1476.6s] favor. Mhm.
[1479.3s] So um that is just uh the key text that
[1483.0s] we have read and what I would pick out
[1486.9s] from this key text is that
[1490.8s] uh this is Jesus speaking and he was
[1494.0s] sent and
[1496.7s] uh remember that Jesus said that he was
[1499.0s] sent to seek and save the lost. He was
[1502.0s] sent to go to people. So Jesus did not
[1506.0s] come for his own uh benefit but to
[1509.0s] benefit others. People were to be
[1511.4s] blessed for for his by his presence. So
[1517.0s] um that's what I would take from that
[1518.7s] key text.
[1522.2s] Yeah. Now there's a question that is in
[1525.0s] our lesson and I'll start with you
[1526.8s] Salmon. Yeah. This words was spoken in
[1530.7s] fulfillment of the prophecy about Jesus.
[1534.7s] So Jesus was actually reading about a
[1537.1s] prophecy about himself. Okay. Now are
[1540.9s] there certain words in the Bible which
[1542.6s] you feel are applicable to you and apply
[1545.1s] to you even at this moment? For example,
[1548.0s] at that time it said this scripture is
[1550.6s] fulfilled in your ears. So are there
[1553.6s] things that you feel apply to you not as
[1556.4s] a prophetic fulfillment but more with
[1564.2s] certainty and you can think about the
[1566.5s] promises of God in the Bible or anything
[1570.1s] that you've ever felt maybe in the past
[1572.4s] maybe not immediately but you've seen
[1574.8s] God working and telling you this is what
[1576.7s] you should do at this moment.
[1585.3s] Oh really trying to think about it.
[1588.6s] Okay. As you think Javan. Okay. Uh one
[1592.8s] verse that comes in mind the first that
[1594.7s] came in mind was many will come in my
[1599.0s] name saying that the Messiah. Mhm.
[1602.0s] Uh there are many who have come out
[1605.8s] saying that they they are God
[1608.8s] and and to surprisingly they still they
[1612.9s] have people who are following them. Mhm.
[1615.5s] Uh those are words that that's the first
[1618.1s] verse that came in mind when it was
[1620.6s] saying that when when you asked the
[1623.1s] question. So many people have come many
[1626.4s] many will come in my name proclaiming
[1628.2s] that they the me that they are Jesus.
[1630.8s] And another one is that wars
[1634.6s] uh diseases will be the uh what is this
[1639.1s] word will be a sign of my coming and to
[1644.2s] we have all seen that there have been
[1646.4s] wars you have had pandemics not some 5
[1649.7s] years ago we had the coid9 pandemic
[1653.7s] and it it gives me hope that Christ
[1657.3s] return is soon and we need to
[1660.9s] We need to be stronger in our faith and
[1663.8s] be steadfast in him. Amen. Amen.
[1667.9s] Yes, someone. I think I found mine, but
[1670.6s] I don't think it's a promise. But in 1st
[1673.0s] Samuel 16:7, Mhm. Uh it says, "But the
[1677.0s] Lord said to someone, do not look at his
[1679.1s] appearance or his physical stature
[1681.8s] because I have refused him." For the
[1683.9s] Lord does not see as man sees. for man
[1686.2s] looks at the outward appearance but the
[1688.4s] Lord looks at the heart. So I think it's
[1693.4s] almost like a guarantee
[1696.2s] that no matter what you're doing, maybe
[1698.8s] you're applying for a job, you think
[1700.5s] your appearance may not be there, but
[1703.8s] maybe the person who's hiring you Mhm.
[1707.0s] Just like God does not look at the
[1708.5s] outward appearance, looks at your
[1710.2s] character, not necessarily what you've
[1712.6s] achieved. So Mhm. I think at
[1715.3s] this it's also there many people who
[1719.6s] look down on themselves. They think
[1721.7s] they're not enough. Mhm. But with this
[1724.3s] at least they can see that God does not
[1726.6s] look at you as man says. He looks in
[1730.2s] your heart. Yeah. Amen. Amen.
[1734.7s] Thank you.
[1736.7s] So going into the spirit of prophecy
[1739.4s] section for this lesson, we were
[1741.4s] supposed to read two chapters in the
[1743.6s] book Desire of Ages. Now Desire of Ages
[1746.6s] is a book written by Ellen White and it
[1748.6s] covers a lot of the concepts in Jesus'
[1751.0s] life. And one of the chapters is chapter
[1753.8s] 23 which talks about the kingdom is at
[1756.9s] hand and chapter 24 talks about is this
[1760.2s] not the carpenter's son?
[1762.7s] Now these two chapters highlight a few
[1765.1s] important points which we notice that
[1767.8s] Jesus came in direct fulfillment of the
[1771.2s] prophecy covered in the book of Daniel
[1773.8s] chapter 8 and 9 and this was about the
[1777.6s] 70we prophecy where the coming of the
[1780.6s] Messiah was prophesied to be exactly in
[1783.7s] the year
[1785.2s] AD27 and this was prophesied based on
[1788.7s] the start date of 457 BC in Daniel
[1792.5s] chapter 8 which was the time when the
[1795.0s] king Atacus gave the decree to restore
[1798.2s] and build Jerusalem and it says there'll
[1801.6s] be uh 69 weeks until the Messiah comes.
[1806.8s] So 69 weeks from that time you'd end up
[1810.1s] in the year
[1811.9s] AD27. And in
[1814.1s] AD27 Jesus started his public ministry
[1818.1s] at the time when he was baptized. When
[1820.1s] Jesus there was a voice from heaven
[1822.1s] saying this is my beloved son in whom I
[1825.3s] I am well pleased. That is the time the
[1828.8s] message began to go out stating that the
[1832.0s] kingdom is at hand. Christ had come to
[1835.2s] fulfill the work of starting to take
[1837.8s] away sin from the earth eventually
[1840.4s] culminating in his death in the year
[1843.5s] AD31. And after Jesus went to heaven,
[1847.4s] his disciples continued the work of
[1850.2s] spreading the gospel until eventually
[1853.5s] they stoned Steven to close the period
[1856.2s] of 70 weeks in the year
[1858.8s] AD.34 where they stoned Steven. And now
[1862.5s] the apostles decided we can now take
[1865.2s] this gospel to the Gentiles because the
[1867.8s] time of the probation for the Jews had
[1870.4s] actually been closed.
[1872.8s] Now going to the next chapter which is
[1875.0s] chapter 24. That was just a summary of
[1876.8s] chapter 23. Chapter 24 talks about is
[1880.0s] this not the carpenter's son. So Christ
[1883.4s] had been living with people in Nazareth
[1885.7s] for a while and they saw him working
[1888.5s] with his dad laboring hard to do all the
[1892.3s] things he could do to help his family
[1894.1s] make a
[1895.2s] living. And he still maintained his
[1897.8s] righteous character. He never sinned in
[1900.9s] any way.
[1902.3s] Now when he came back to Nazareth and
[1904.7s] preaches the sermon based on Isaiah
[1907.5s] chapter 61, the people got angry with
[1910.8s] him because the question was how can you
[1914.0s] be claiming that you are actually the
[1917.2s] Messiah and this really angered them
[1919.9s] because they had seen him grow up in
[1921.8s] Nazareth and they were wondering after
[1924.3s] you have done this few miracles and done
[1926.7s] all these good works is it possible that
[1930.4s] you are the Messiah?
[1932.1s] And you know they saw the life of
[1933.9s] struggle which he had and they thought
[1936.1s] that he'd come to liberate them from the
[1938.2s] Romans. But shock on them Christ had
[1941.2s] actually come to liberate them from sin
[1944.3s] because they didn't see that their
[1945.9s] captivity was not actually to sin
[1948.8s] itself. They thought they needed
[1950.6s] liberation from the Romans. So they
[1953.8s] thought that Christ would come to bring
[1955.8s] an earthly kingdom.
[1958.3s] But he actually came to preach the
[1960.6s] message of the gospel of the kingdom of
[1963.2s] God. And now together with all that we
[1966.6s] had said earlier, they really didn't
[1968.9s] like his words. And they decided that
[1971.6s] now is a good time to end his life. But
[1974.2s] the angels of God came and took him away
[1977.0s] from their midst. And instead of Jesus
[1979.5s] being killed that day, he was saved from
[1982.1s] the arms of the angry people in
[1984.1s] Nazareth. And we find that later in the
[1986.8s] gospel, he still came to try and plead
[1989.4s] with the people in Nazareth for them to
[1991.6s] be saved, but they still rejected
[1995.3s] him. So that was just a summary of the
[1998.7s] spirit of prophecy part and I'd like
[2001.1s] someone to actually give us uh some
[2004.2s] thoughts and questions from the out of
[2006.5s] the story part based on what we have
[2008.5s] shared and covered so far.
[2010.7s] Okay.
[2013.2s] So, here's one. Why do you think why do
[2017.5s] you think the listeners his listeners
[2019.8s] were amazed at the gracious words he
[2022.3s] spoke? Yeah. Uh they were amazed because
[2026.6s] especially when he said that these words
[2028.3s] are fulfilled this day. Uh as Chaniko
[2031.7s] said, they saw these these these they
[2035.0s] saw Jesus growing up.
[2037.6s] uh they knew he's the son of the
[2039.0s] carpenter.
[2040.8s] They knew that they knew the struggles
[2043.4s] that he went through
[2045.1s] to even get to to get where he was.
[2050.4s] And
[2052.5s] he he basically came for a from a black
[2056.0s] background and as I think that the the
[2059.2s] Israelites of that time thought that the
[2061.3s] Messiah is going to come from a royal
[2063.7s] family, he's going to come from a
[2066.1s] kingship but really it was the opposite.
[2069.7s] That is one thing that amazed them
[2072.6s] and the fact that uh they saw him
[2076.4s] growing up and they knew his background
[2078.4s] is what amazed them. I think that's why
[2081.3s] they were amazed because they saw Jesus
[2083.4s] growing up and all the challenges that
[2086.0s] he went through when he was a child and
[2088.9s] all of a sudden he comes and tells them
[2090.6s] that he's the Messiah. That's what I
[2093.0s] think about that.
[2095.0s] Okay.
[2096.2s] So okay let me add before I ask another
[2099.7s] one. Mhm. Also think they hadn't first
[2102.8s] before he added uh that he hadn't
[2105.8s] realized that he was describing himself.
[2109.9s] So they were
[2111.0s] still they thought oh so probably the
[2115.9s] king is going to be born today. Probably
[2117.8s] the the king is going to come and
[2120.4s] liberate us today. M they hadn't
[2122.5s] realized that Jesus was talking about
[2125.0s] himself. So the next one the amazement
[2129.2s] quickly turned to fury. I think Javan
[2131.2s] has answered that. So the last one why
[2134.2s] was the mob unsuccessful in its attempt
[2136.2s] to kill Jesus then and there? I think
[2139.9s] you can answer that.
[2142.1s] Yeah. Why was the mob unsuccessful in
[2144.4s] killing
[2145.3s] Jesus? The reason is because God is the
[2148.5s] one who actually has our lives in his
[2151.6s] hand. If God allows you to be killed
[2154.6s] today, he will actually allow it to
[2157.0s] happen. But if he decides that he will
[2159.2s] not allow you to die, he will not do it
[2161.7s] even if the devil wants to. And we can
[2164.0s] see that for example from the account of
[2166.0s] Job that Job, God said you do anything
[2169.4s] you want to him but do not take his
[2171.6s] life. And we actually see that Job did
[2173.8s] not die because God had said he cannot
[2176.8s] die. We see Elijah, not Elijah but Enoch
[2180.4s] for example who went to heaven. He did
[2183.0s] not taste death and God had ordained
[2185.5s] that he will never die. Now
[2188.5s] Moses struck the rock instead of
[2191.0s] speaking to the rock as God commanded
[2192.9s] him. And of course he was looking
[2195.1s] forward to actually going into the land
[2197.2s] of Canaan. And he begged God to allow
[2200.1s] him. Now God forgave him but he did not
[2203.7s] allow him to go into Canaan which
[2206.2s] actually shows us that God has your life
[2208.2s] in his hands and is the one who makes a
[2210.7s] determination on when you actually die.
[2213.8s] Now it's also true that you may make a
[2215.8s] decision to end your life early and God
[2218.7s] may allow it to happen. But if he still
[2221.1s] thinks his will needs to accomp be
[2223.0s] accomplished with you, then even if you
[2225.2s] try to kill your life, you'll still find
[2227.2s] that some people tried hanging
[2228.9s] themselves or overdosing on some drugs,
[2231.8s] but they still did not end up dying even
[2234.2s] though they took lethal doses. And that
[2236.8s] shows us that God is actually at work.
[2239.6s] And he's watching us. And if it is his
[2242.1s] will that he lets you rest or go to uh
[2245.2s] the grave, then he'll allow it.
[2248.2s] So I believe that Jesus was not allowed
[2251.2s] to die and I know some people normally
[2254.2s] say that's his time has reached and
[2258.2s] definitely it's God who only allows it.
[2260.8s] It's not without his permission that we
[2262.6s] die. So that's how I'd answer that
[2264.5s] question.
[2266.4s] Okay. Thank you.
[2269.6s] Thank you. Yeah. Thanks for taking us
[2271.4s] and you can go ahead and lead us through
[2273.4s] the punchlines as well.
[2276.6s] So I think everyone will take one
[2278.7s] starting from Java.
[2282.3s] Okay. When he was this is Luke 2 verse
[2287.1s] 42 to 49. It says when he was 12 years
[2290.6s] old they went up to the festival while
[2292.6s] his parents were returning home. The boy
[2295.4s] stay the boy Jesus stayed behind in
[2297.7s] Jerusalem. After 3 days they found him
[2300.0s] in the temple court sitting among the
[2301.7s] teacher listening to him and asking them
[2304.2s] questions. Everyone who heard him was
[2306.2s] amazed and his understanding and he at
[2309.9s] his understanding his answers. And when
[2312.6s] his parents saw him, they were
[2314.6s] astonished. They astonished. His mother
[2317.7s] asked him, "Son, why have you treated us
[2320.4s] like this? Your father and I have been
[2322.5s] anxiously searching for you. Why are you
[2324.7s] searching for me?" He asked, "Didn't you
[2327.7s] know that I'm in my father's house?"
[2331.5s] Amen. Amen.
[2333.5s] Now the other punchline is from Matthew
[2337.1s] 23:37 where the Bible says, "Jerusalem,
[2340.4s] Jerusalem, you who kill the prophets and
[2343.1s] stone those sent to you, how often have
[2346.1s] I longed to gather your children
[2348.1s] together as a hen gathers her cheeks
[2351.3s] under her wings, and you were not
[2354.4s] willing." Jesus wanted acceptance as one
[2358.1s] of the prophets from the people in
[2360.7s] Nazareth. But it's these people who
[2363.2s] decided that I'm killing him as a
[2365.3s] prophet. So it was quite sad that they
[2367.8s] rejected Jesus. That applies to me as I
[2370.6s] I can related to the story that is here.
[2373.7s] Okay. The last one is John
[2376.9s] 7:28-30. Then Jesus still teaching in
[2380.0s] the temple cried out, "Yes, you know me
[2382.9s] and you know where I am from. I'm not
[2385.4s] from here on my own authority, but he
[2388.2s] who sent me is true. You do not know
[2391.1s] him, but I know him because I am from
[2393.8s] him and he sent me. At this they tried
[2396.8s] to see him to seize him, but no one laid
[2399.2s] a hand on him because his hour had not
[2402.6s] yet come. I think
[2405.2s] as Nichol said,
[2408.6s] God is one who knows your time. He has
[2411.6s] your life in his hands. So his not come
[2414.6s] and that's why they weren't able to
[2417.7s] lay their hands on him.
[2420.2s] Amen.
[2421.8s] Amen. So, as you've joined us for this
[2424.3s] lesson, you've seen the Tamaltus
[2426.6s] homecoming. Christ went to Nazareth
[2429.0s] where he had been born, but they
[2431.6s] actually rejected him. The book Desire
[2434.4s] of Ages, page 239, Ellen White writes
[2438.0s] that our standing before God depends not
[2441.3s] upon the amount of light we have
[2443.1s] received, but upon the use of we make of
[2447.0s] what we have. God actually expects more
[2450.6s] from us and the Nazarites after seeing
[2453.4s] all that Jesus had done should have made
[2456.2s] more of the light which they had
[2458.6s] received. So before we close this I'll
[2461.3s] like to pass it to my panel Javan please
[2463.7s] give a closing thought on the lesson.
[2465.7s] I'll come to you Salmon next then we
[2467.5s] close.
[2470.4s] Um what uh the closing thought about
[2473.6s] this lesson is that
[2476.4s] um first of all God has our lives in his
[2480.4s] hands. Mhm. If today is the day that it
[2484.1s] was agreed that you're going to uh pass
[2487.0s] away. It is going to be today. First of
[2488.9s] all thing is that people change as
[2491.8s] Chaniko you said that you had a friend
[2494.1s] in high school who liked fighting. Then
[2496.6s] all of a sudden you heard that you was a
[2498.0s] priest.
[2499.6s] So God God saw that there was potential
[2503.2s] in this person to the point that he
[2505.7s] allowed that to he allowed him to become
[2508.0s] a priest.
[2510.0s] Um basically that's what I can I got it
[2513.3s] from this lesson.
[2515.2s] Thank you
[2516.3s] Javan. I think uh I'll take
[2520.5s] my finishing thought from the
[2523.6s] first part from desire ves page
[2527.6s] 235 says we have reached the period in
[2530.5s] fortold the period foretold in these
[2532.6s] scriptures the time of the end is come
[2535.4s] the visions of the prophets are unsealed
[2537.7s] and the solemn warnings point us to our
[2540.3s] lord's coming in glory as near at hand
[2543.2s] so I think this shows that we in the end
[2547.6s] times. So, we should really look upon
[2551.7s] the word of the Lord for guidance the
[2554.4s] final days. Yeah.
[2557.1s] Amen. Thank you all so much for joining
[2560.0s] us. We've seen Jesus as the fulfillment
[2562.8s] of prophecy and we've seen that those
[2565.8s] who know us the longest sometimes are
[2568.4s] the people who find it hard not to
[2571.0s] accept us.
[2573.1s] But it is my hope and prayer that we can
[2576.6s] all accept Jesus as the one who lead us
[2579.8s] into eternity. And let us not be like
[2582.6s] those in Nazareth who rejected him. And
[2585.7s] when Jesus comes back to take us home,
[2589.3s] it will be a tumultuous homecoming for
[2591.8s] those who have rejected Jesus, but it
[2594.4s] will be a blessing to those who receive
[2596.8s] him even as we desire to go to heaven.
[2600.3s] My name is Niko Opio, one of the
[2602.1s] teachers of the teens, and I've been
[2603.8s] sharing this lesson with Javan and
[2606.0s] Salmon. So, I'd like to invite you
[2607.8s] Salmon to pray for us as we close. Let's
[2611.0s] pray. Kind of loving father, thank you
[2613.0s] for being with us. Thank you for guiding
[2615.4s] us through the lesson. Be with us, guide
[2618.2s] us, and help us
[2620.0s] to look upon your word. Jesus name we
[2623.4s] pray and believe. Amen. Amen.
[2626.3s] Please join us next week for lesson six
[2629.1s] which is titled I am a follower. I am a
[2633.0s] follower. See you then.
