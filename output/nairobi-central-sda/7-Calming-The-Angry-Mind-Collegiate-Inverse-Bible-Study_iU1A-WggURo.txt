be Eugene the title of the mission is book worth reading when Eugene was 9 years old her mom gave her a book to read since you read a lot of books you should read this book too she said it's in Korean and English study it read it this is a good book it was a small book steps to Christ by Ellen White up to that point Eugene had only read books in Korean but mom wanted her to learn English an obedient child Eugene immediately began to read the book she read it every day on the bus as she traveled to and from school in South Korea she read during lunch break at school the English text was hard to read so she skipped it and finished the Korean part of the book in a week she didn't understand everything that she read but she felt a strong conviction that she needed to be baptized she went to Mom I want to be baptized she said mom smile when you grow up you can be baptized she said Korean children often started thinking about baptism when they were about 13 years old but Eugene was n and 13 was four long years away she wasn't happy about having to wait but she was an obedient child okay fine she said she didn't speak about baptism again as time passed she kept attending church every Sabbath as she had in the past but she went because she wanted to participate in Pathfinders and other fun activities not because she desired a close relationship with God when she turned 13 she was baptized with the rest of her friends but she didn't have the same conviction to be baptized as when she was nine as a te she spent more and more time with non-Christian friends and her love for God gradually deemed she ate like her friends and sometimes skipped Church on Sabbath she was tied on Sabbath morning and didn't want to make an effort to go to church doubts even crept into her mind about the existence of God then one summer when she was 16 she volunteered to help with an evangelism program her job was to invite other young people to come to the church meetings by handing over fly Flyers no young people came to the first meeting as a result of her invitation and she felt like a failure a missionary from the meeting saw her disappointment and prayed with her to Eugene's amazement several young people whom she had invited showed up at the next meeting a flake of Faith flashed in her heart then Heavy Rain threatened to disrupt a meeting she prayed and the rain stopped the meeting went ahead as planned Eugene was a new person when she returned to her Adventist high school in the fall she eagerly attended a student Le prayer group called ners that met every Friday evening after worship Services she got a new copy of steps to Christ but this time she didn't finish the book in a week she read with a group of other students at the rate of about a chapter a week for her it was like reading the book for the The First Time Eugene said she is glad that she read steps to Christ when she was nine when I read for the first time my heart was starred deeply to follow Jesus and to be baptized she said she's even more glad that she read it again she said the book cannot be read too many times surely the Lord is coming again she said Eugene go Eugene goes to hanook

and trusting in Jesus holy name amen amen amen good morning good evening good afternoon ladies and gentlemen from wherever you're watching this uh lesson we pray that you're well and I want to just welcome you as we dive in and look into the state of the Mind as a college at class we want to retrospect and diverge into what is a state of the mind this week we want to look at coming the angry mind why is do we have an angry mind and why do we have to come it I invite my panelist who will introduce themselves starting from a lovely lady um my name is rosu um I'm a member this beautiful panel my name is Henrik SMI I'm a member of the colleges class happy to be here and my name is Timothy Kuka I'm also happy to be here and for me your moderator for this session I'm Elijah Peter our key text for this for this week is James 1: 19- 21 I invite my brother kuo to read for us James chapter 1 verse 19- 21 and it says remember this my dear brothers and sisters everyone must be quick to listen but slow to speak and slow to become angry verse 20 human anger does not achieve God's right purpose verse 21 so get rid of every filthy habit and all Wicked conduct submit to God and accept the word for he plants in your hearts which is able to save you amen amen amen if you're able to just sit on James 1: 19 which has clearly is stated as as my brother's read you should be slow to speak slow to wrath wrath in other uh versions is known as anger why are we angry right now we have an anger pandemic belittling us and attacking us from every side a pandemic not related to the covid-19 which you understand came from a virus but an anger that arises from us an anger that is built inside us and why is that so okay so the title of the lesson is the anger pandemic thinking about a pandemic the first thing that came to my mind was covid and I think the effects of covid were were there for for us for all of us to see we saw it led to much shutdown of schools and public places there to massive deaths many people got sick some recovered got sick again and the effects were not only in one region but were throughout the whole world so in the same way covid was a pandemic in that time I think anger been a pandemic is that the world today so many people are angry you drive on the roads guys are hooting all over the place people are so stressed and I think the lesson really gives us a picture why this is happening allow me to read just one section of the lesson it says the anger pandemic has arrived and it is fears as a society we are facing increasing levels of stress caused by everything from job loss to social unrest social unrest you see the JZ movement here in Kenya and all those other things the leadership in the country really not doing what they're supposed to do is is causing men and women to be angry so I think those are some of the few reasons why really anger has become a pandemic and the the sad part is it's not localized in one area everywhere throughout the whole world people are angry because of the way life is unfair to say the least true yes he brings out the aspect of life being unfair and we're looking at an anger pandemic we as as has alluded earlier the pandemic we had uh previous years was the covid-19 pandemic right now it's not a virus that is causing us to have a Pand pic rather we have life itself being an pandemic in in in in in it of itself we we wonder life in itself is supposed to be enjoyed to the fullest I I I love a speaker who says in this life you supposed to live life to the fullest rather than survive why are people surviving in this day and era I I I invite my brother K toate Wow where do I begin um anger in itself doesn't come up just like that there has to be a root Source in it true and here I'll I'll I'll dive into the internal factors that might cause people to be so angry nowadays and in in most cases we see that anger is just an form of eruption from a pressure from within for instance like volcano they have erupt because there's pressure in within the Earth surface and in this case we see there are so many factors such as sadness disappointment I mean we we also have our traumas in the past and in in many cases some of us tend not to have dealt with those traumas and just uh REM it reminds us when when we remember such traumas it makes us channel that that disappointment or past experience to other people and I mean this is where um people are really lacking the aspect of calling to God during such times but before I even delve into that I'd want us uh to also reflect on the aspect of self-control which is a fruit of the Holy Spirit In the book of Galatians chapter 5 you'll find the fruits of the Holy Spirit there and selfcontrol is uh in in in a good examp example example if someone disappoints you or or or angers you we tend to um try to mitigate such uh bad uh effects to the other person so for instance what I normally do I normally breathe in in and out I normally just walk around um or I just want to exclude myself from others you you have to you also have to try and do um something that cannot affect your relationship sh with other people and but one of the best things we can do is to call upon God's name and we see it in Philippians chapter 4:6-7 Philippians chapter 4:6 to7 it says do not worry about anything but in all your prayers ask God for what you need always ask him with a thankful heart and God's peace Which is far beyond human understanding will keep your hearts and Minds safe in Union with Christ Jesus I mean amen amen we have we need to call upon God's name in times of when we feel like we are going to react in a very bad way in Anger we just say a soft prayer I'm telling you it worked I I had anger issues but I I'm still I'm still battling them but I normally just uh take some time I just pray to God God please let me not do anything bad and it actually works um but um we in this generation and time where as as my brothers have highlighted it's a pandemic we ought to seek God and so that we cannot be sucked in into this Global anger pandemic that we are experiencing yes thank you my brother Kalo he brings out the aspect of trauma and now brings out the aspect that this is a personal thing we might try and look at it from a world perspective say everyone out there is angry but right here right now each and everyone of us is facing a problem something that is causing them to to to be angry something that will push them to the wall and make them react in a way that has never been seen in most cases if as as as you said we need to act with self-control self-control is important I I'll we'll keep on referring to our key text this week which is James 1 19-21 and if I can just pick out a portion from that which says be swift to hear slow to speak slow to wrath if I can tie that to a quote that I recently came across which says that sometimes you need to be to to to to listen without being defensive listen without being def defensive true and as as I come to my sister this thing about self-control and controlled anger we we want to be control of this anger but yet how do we control this anger oura said prayer and calling unto God because he's the one who be able to control it for us but for my sister how many times have you seen this uncontrolled anger destroying relationships okay so I would love to say that uncontrolled anger anger in itself is not a sin because in many instances in the Bible we see how God becomes very angry with the Israelites and he wants to destroy but we listen we we we actually see that even God our Father listens to us if we we actually we actually we actually talk to him even in the anger because I remember there's a there's a the passage in the Bible when God was so angry at the Israelites because they were worshiping the golden Cal and Moses had come from the mountain and he was very angry to the point that he wanted to destroy the Israelites and God listened to Moses when Moses pleaded and said please do not do this we will look for a way to to fix it I feel I I think that uncontrolled anger is very prevalent in our society because people think that they can they can face and fix these things on their own while as a Christian we know that anger can lead to a lot of sins I think the writer says unrestrained anger has enous risks it it not only harms relationships family Dynamics and mental well-being but also NE negatively impacts physical health it's been shown to weaken the immune system and and a study in the Journal circulation found that people who are more prone to anger have twice normal risk of coronary heart disease um uncontrolled anger is not a good thing especially in relationships because every time we we we have challenges as human beings and and anytime you're in relationships or friendships you'll find that you will have something that you don't relate to with another person and I feel like if if you are too too too you're too fast to get to anger instead of trying to fix the problem then it becomes a problem because these relationships won't last and this Rel relationships will have a lot of problems every time and so I think just as we are taught to be Christlike we should deal with anger the way Jesus did every time Jesus I mean God was angry he would listen or look for a better solution to fix the problem instead of letting the anger um letting the the anger overcome you to a point that you do very bad things or you destroy very good relationships because you're angry back to you thank you very much I I feel my brother K has something to say but before I invite him also as I come to kiso uh there this trend that has been we we're in the technological era and I think the lesson writers had a vision of why this lesson was critical for this day and age right now people are facing mental problems this is not a key to solve your mental problems but it's more of a guiding principle if I can attach what my sister Rose said right now we have a a trend that is going where people are saying we listen but we do not judge and you wonder is that is is that the correct way to how to deal with anger I invite my brother to to just elucidate what are the appropriate ways and times to express anger okay so I think my sister Rose alled to the fact that anger in itself can be used for good because the the text she just highlighted was talking about unrestrained anger which means if you you are able to restrain your anger within some certain parameters this anger can be used to achieve good and a good example that has been given in the lesson is let's say you see maybe something like Injustice I think it can speak for us in our country Kenya here we see a lot of Injustice against people you hear people just I don't know my brothers here is a is a lawyer same to rul they'll tell me people just speaking for their rights just saying what they think is is is fair for them but you find that this expression is limited because if you go ahead and say what you think or what you think is right you are sort of abducted in this country guys have been abducted so I think appropriate anger is anger that is used to to achieve good if I am angry like Let me Give an example the story of Christ when Christ gets to the temple and he finds this guys buying and selling in the temple and he's so angry but one thing about that story some people think Christ actually beat people in that story but he didn't he just had a we but he was using it to I don't word scare them away but he didn't actually beat people because people use that story to say oh Christ be people in the church and all that but essentially my point is anger can be appropriate for times where you're fighting against Injustice where you want things to be done in the way that God wants them because God says that sin angers him anytime we commit sin it angers him because sin is the transation of his law indeed so essentially the the point or the take on point is anger can be appropriate when it is used to fight against Injustice or to fight against Things That Go contrary to the will of goded KH as I welcome Kalo he brings out the aspect that anger is appropriate when you're fighting against injustices I want to now bring this lesson home to us bring this lesson to those who are Kenyans those who are in different countries we we understand each country has their own share problems each country is facing an injustice that they never imagine could have been there as we are standing to speak with our anger boiled up inside of us just to try and tell them no do this because this the correct path according to what the Bible says my question to kou is sometimes other people their mental space might have been pushed to the world in the sense that they're now afraid to speak they listen with every everything that is happening they angry inside but they can't what is happening is that the correct way to go my friend that's that my friend is not the most uh uh I wouldn't prescribe that yeah because we we are humans we have our our ages our boiling point okay when and it just alludes to the aspect of um past traumas and I don't know if you've heard about the story of the two wolves okay the story of the two wolves I was told last uh last year by my friend um a good friend of mine we school together yeah so he so we were just walking and he told me have you heard the story of the two wolves and I asked him okay what's what's it about he tells me that one day there was a grandfather who who told his son about having two wolves in his heart one is um one is hatred and anger the other is peace and love so these two wolves always always um fight against uh against each other in our hearts and he and the young son said okay um who do you think will win okay which which wolf wins in our heart and the Grandfather said the wolf that you feed the most is the wolf that wins indeed I mean we if you feed by by this by this I mean that um if you focus so much on on um on on on hatred and anger it will just boil up boil up boil up and you will portray that towards others I'm telling you putting it inside and feeding that anger and hatred in your heart will come out externally and we we also have to focus on the aspect of forgiveness for in Colossians 3:13 it says forgive as the Lord forgives you so on the aspect of um just keeping that anger in one side there are certain things that we keep inside ourself in terms of our hearts that we just don't we just don't let it go there are aspects where we have to be we have to be forgiving so that we can move forward indeed and there's other aspect of having healthy conversations I mean when you're angry with someone the best thing you can do is to have healthy a healthy conversation and people are different there others who will have it at that point others will have it after a period of time I mean there others who need time for us for you to have healthy conversations so for me for people who normally put it and bottle it up my advice is hey if somebody angers you have a healthy conversation with them and also don't feed the aspect of hatred always seek to forgive others amen so that's that's my view on that indeed amen you you bring out the aspect of wolves two Wolves at home I hope you've learned something from the Wolves uh who are in the heart at the end of the day the back lies with you you are the one who chooses how to react at the beginning of the lesson my brother was telling us how he himself was angry at a point in time but how he handled it was he let himself breathe take a walk sometimes just breathing in and out taking in Long DPS of good fresh air alleviates the situation it might not solve what you're angry about but it just helps you to calm your mind this week we're looking at coming the angry mind we don't know what might be causing you to go back and and and react angrily but we want you yourself to become inside you I think the songwriter who wrote himym number 652 was very clear as he wrote there is beauty all around when there's love at home there is joy in every sound when there's love at home peace and plenty here abide smiling Fair on every side time does softly sweetly Glide when there's love at home this just is to show you that when you accept love into your own heart when Christ comes and you accept Christ into your own heart there's a paradigm shift on how things will go things will be peaceful things will be beautiful I cannot even for how it will be I'm just living in my own imagination how things will be but now if you now allow anger to come inside your peaceful home what are the ders that come with this we need now to look at the ders of indulging in Anger well anger is just as we have said anger is not a bad thing even in the Bible it's allowed because even our creator has anger sometimes in the Bible and uh also the writer of the lesson says that anger sometimes is a righteous response to evil but there are negative effects of anger that that might lead to a lot of a lot of Chaos in our world today and I think some of the of the effects of anger is that just as we had said earlier that relationships might be broken also it affects our physical being our physical well-being because anger is a suppression of other emotions maybe disappointment and sadness and all other things and now if we are going to we are going to project it towards the other people it it comes out as anger because the the emotions have been so sressed to the point that you feel like you are so Fierce and you want to you you can deal with a problem by yourself but instead of doing all this we can I think one of the ways just as kalu had said um one of the ways that you can you you can really suppress anger is through meditating and I think uh I think I have tried this um listening to hymns hymns really come the soul and once you listen to a hym um you feel like God God is talking to you also um have you ever been in a scenario where you pray immediately something bad happens and not something bad as as any other thing but something bad as you you have been in a situation with a friend or a any other person your family and then you get into an argument and now you you just pray on the instant literally there is nothing else this person can do after you have prayed because it it feels like you have you have you know you have calmed the situation and now it it might now result to you you people actually talking on a cordial basis yeah H I think that's all I would say on that thank you very much I see my brother K coming but even as comes in I'll throw a question across board yeah we are all looking at the lesson and what the lesson writer tries to bring but we ourselves here as a panelist yeah have we ever been angry that's the first question then how did we deal with that anger T yes so I've ever been angry myself and to add on to the previous question and answer this question as well so I I believe one of the effects of hunger another another effect is it it it destroys the amount of trust you have with someone and this is why we have to be soft in our answers as alluded in Proverbs chapter 15 verse1 it says a soft answer turns away wrath but a hard a harsh word uh stirs up anger so for myself I have been angry before and the best thing I did is to I I I didn't aggressively talk to that person and in in the way you approach that moment will determine how your relationship is going to go from that time so one of my examples is a time I was I wasn't happy with someone and I just said HRI just go and just talk to him in a good manner and and just follow the God's word and I just went we uh we talked a healthy conversation as alluded before and everything uh styled up and we are still friends till till now so yeah yeah I think for me uh I'll give two scenarios one scenario where I handled the anger in a way that I shouldn't have because I feel like we need to make this a bit practical it's not all the time that you have 100% success rate of managing your anger well so I think for me H there's a time I was angry at one of my siblings they had done something and I wasn't so happy about it and uh I reacted in a very aggressive way to say the least so I remember they angered me so much so I just left the room banged the door I was talking so much in my head as I was leaving and uh you know afterwards the brain has a very interesting of working after you do that there's this high level of extreme guilt that you feel after that so I think when when you just come down and sit you just asking yourself like bro why did I do that was that necessary I think that was an incident where I did not handle anger in the way that we have learned today to handle but maybe another incident I can give where I handled my anger in a better way at Le the same example okay for those of you who have young siblings you just have to understand that sometimes most of the time there's going to be a lot of commotion and a lot of strife between you so but this time what I did is when I got angry I just left the room and just went and took a walk first and just calmed my mind and calmed my nerves down then now came back we talked the situation out and the solution was amicable for both of us amen so I think lesson for for me from those two instances is that the way I respond to this anger will even dictate the solution that will come toward the end because if I leave the place angry and even come back you know the feeling is that oh the guy was angry when he left but if I just take the appropriate steps to ensure that this doesn't end in hatred it ends in US resolving this amicably I think that that is a better way going forward amen that that that remind me the Commandment that says the greatest commandment is love love should always dwell in every scenario love should be should always be there Rose have you ever been angry and yes I have been angry a lot of times and for someone who projects what I feel I I have said a lot of bad things you know and you know as an older sibling this these children these people make you feel feel so bad and you you really want to tell them all things but then you remember um in 1 Corinthians 13 is it the the chapter of love Yeah it it talks about love bears all things and that means you you know in some friendships in the Contemporary world today people say if you if you do this to me people have standards if you do this to me I cut you off if you do this to me I cut you off how many people are you going to cut off by the end of your lifetime you'll cut off everyone and even the the lesson says we are not built to be an island human beings have to have relationships and that is if it there's a place that says you will remain dry if you you don't have relationships so if you're going to be dealing with situations by cutting people off that that is not a way to deal with your issues so with me and my siblings we you take time apart and you relax and recall everything that has happened and you really find out it was such a small thing it would have been solved in the best way possible you are just making it a big deal just because you're angry and so you just relax talk to and I I think us as siblings we don't say sorry you just start talking you just start talking yeah you just say and then you just talk to each other in a better way and you realize that you guys are okay and I feel like in our world today things s is are really hard thing and I feel like if you have identified that you are the one with a problem or if if not God God wants us to actually me relationships if you even if you were on the right side God loved us really even every time we sin we still go back to God and he will still accept us and I think that is what we supposed to be doing for other people because love is the greatest superpower amen amen I I I hear I I I see my brother turning the Bible I I'll I'll just tell him to turn to Hebrews 3:13 as I also give my scenario I think most of the time when you're angry and as my said it's very difficult to say sorry yeah I'm not sure if we've been Harden to that extent that saying sorry is now like a burden things so is like we now told remove 30% of your of your income as taxes it has become that difficult we we we try and contemplate we try and fight in our minds should I say sorry was I on the wrong and I think my our brother here was was was saying that with his first reaction to anger he bang the door left but then as he left and he was calm his conscience came in and kicked in and he was like by the way you are at fault by the way just go back and and and and and and sit down and have an amical conversation no man is an island as much as we we we want to live alone as much as we may not know how to deal with the situation at that point in time it it it doesn't take a million shillings to just leave the room go take a walk listen to music calm down and then come and have a conversation Hebrews 3:13 Hebrews chter 3 uh verse 13 says instead in order that none of you be deceived by sin and become stubborn you must help one another every day as long as the the word today in the scripture applies to us amen true that verse is just telling us we need to help one another yeah we need to exalt one another we need to be there for one another we all understand even going back to the Garden of Eden Adam was given Eve hypothetically speaking in my Sanctified imagination I'm trying to imagine uh them having a a quarrel Adam is calling the lion lion but Eve is like No it should not be called Li it should be called XY Z and you're like it looks like a lion we just they had quarrels but then because they were in communion with God because we all understand that time God will come in the Garden of Eden greet Adam Adam Hi how are you doing how how was the day did you feed the lion did you eat the apple from that tree you're good we good they had that Fellowship so I'm trying to imagine Adam despite him being angry with Eve they will sit down try and sort out their issues by the way the way you were telling me this it didn't come out correctly just to bring out to just give you a full quote of what I had read earlier was in every every scenario speak without being offensive listen without being defensive in all scenarios leave the person with the person you're dealing with with the respect that they deserve sometimes we all want to give a response I don't know is that a we if if someone throws you at you you quick to it's more a give and take like it it doesn't pay to just keep quiet because I think key text for this week James 1 verse 19-21 I think wherever you may be just sit with that memory text meditate upon the words because what it says is be swift to hear be swift to hear why why do you think people are just quick to to to to thr at one another even as as you give contribution I believe is the main reason is that they they don't put their trust in God God offers before he left offers offered us peace and we see it in John uh 14:27 peace is what I leave you with it is my own peace that I give you I do not give it as the world does do not be worried and upset do not be afraid which people need to trust trust in God's word and believe that it is only in this way that we are going to handle our anger in a better manner so God's uh our God the Holy Spirit transforms us to to to undertake to undertake such circumstances in a peaceful and loving manner amen yes I I I don't know what happens when the lesson becomes sweet is when now time decides to do its thing and it's viewers I'm I'm I'm sorry we we're out of time but I think I'll just give each and everyone of us a second or 1 minute maximum to just give you pting short comaling the angry mind R the pting short is that we should actually strive to resolve our anger just like God did and we should be very slow to anger just as our creator is and in everything that we do we should strive to if you don't know how to Cal your angry mind just look into documentaries or you can look at examples in the Bible and I think that will be well with you amen as my friend has said as Christians we strive to be like Jesus every day so let us undertake righteous anger so that we may have good relationships with people around us and with God too amen thank you I think for me H something that stood out is anger if used appropriately can us to achieve good so maybe in our day-to-day life lives you need to ensure that even if you to get angry you ensure that this anger is directed towards do the good thing and as my fellows have said you just equate it to Jesus what what would Jesus do in the same situation amen my Parting Shot for you ladies and gentlemen come from Ellen White Desire of Ages page 310 which says those who are at any supposed provocation feel at Liberty to indulge anger or resentment are opening their heart to Satan bitterness and animosity must be banished from the soul if we will be in harmony with Heaven if you want to be a child of God don't indulge in anger or resentment and as I said earlier listen without being defensive and speak without being offensive may you be blessed I think I'll invite my sister Rose to just close us to the word of prayer let's pray Heavenly Master thank you so much for this day that youve granted unto us thank you that you have enabled us to do this uh this recording and actually make the lesson more easier for people to understand and as we we leave we ask you that you may be with us and thank you for everything in Jesus name amen amen

[65.9s] read but she felt a strong conviction
[67.6s] that she needed to be baptized she went
[69.8s] to Mom I want to be baptized she said
[72.7s] mom smile when you grow up you can be
[75.2s] baptized she said Korean children often
[77.8s] started thinking about baptism when they
[79.6s] were about 13 years old but Eugene was n
[82.4s] and 13 was four long years away she
[84.7s] wasn't happy about having to wait but
[86.5s] she was an obedient child okay fine she
[89.1s] said she didn't speak about baptism
[91.1s] again as time passed she kept attending
[93.4s] church every Sabbath as she had in the
[95.2s] past but she went because she wanted to
[97.2s] participate in Pathfinders and other fun
[98.8s] activities not because she desired a
[100.7s] close relationship with God when she
[102.7s] turned 13 she was baptized with the rest
[104.3s] of her friends but she didn't have the
[106.1s] same conviction to be baptized as when
[107.8s] she was nine as a te she spent more and
[110.6s] more time with non-Christian friends and
[112.5s] her love for God gradually deemed she
[114.7s] ate like her friends and sometimes
[116.2s] skipped Church on Sabbath she was tied
[118.7s] on Sabbath morning and didn't want to
[120.0s] make an effort to go to church doubts
[122.3s] even crept into her mind about the
[123.7s] existence of God then one summer when
[126.0s] she was 16 she volunteered to help with
[128.0s] an evangelism program her job was to
[130.4s] invite other young people to come to the
[131.8s] church meetings by handing over fly
[134.4s] Flyers no young people came to the first
[136.8s] meeting as a result of her invitation
[138.9s] and she felt like a failure a missionary
[141.4s] from the meeting saw her disappointment
[143.2s] and prayed with her to Eugene's
[145.2s] amazement several young people whom she
[147.4s] had invited showed up at the next
[148.8s] meeting a flake of Faith flashed in her
[151.3s] heart then Heavy Rain threatened to
[153.4s] disrupt a meeting she prayed and the
[155.3s] rain stopped the meeting went ahead as
[157.9s] planned Eugene was a new person when she
[160.4s] returned to her Adventist high school in
[161.9s] the fall she eagerly attended a student
[164.3s] Le prayer group called ners that met
[167.3s] every Friday evening after worship
[168.7s] Services she got a new copy of steps to
[171.1s] Christ but this time she didn't finish
[172.8s] the book in a week she read with a group
[174.9s] of other students at the rate of about a
[176.9s] chapter a week for her it was like
[179.1s] reading the book for the The First Time
[181.1s] Eugene said she is glad that she read
[183.3s] steps to Christ when she was nine when I
[185.9s] read for the first time my heart was
[187.5s] starred deeply to follow Jesus and to be
[189.6s] baptized she said she's even more glad
[192.0s] that she read it again she said the book
[193.9s] cannot be read too many times surely the
[196.3s] Lord is coming again she said Eugene go
[199.3s] Eugene goes to hanook samuk Academy
[202.6s] which will receive part of this quarter

[316.0s] diverge into what is a state of the mind
[320.0s] this week we want to look at coming the
[322.6s] angry
[323.5s] mind why is do we have an angry mind and
[327.7s] why do we have to come it
[330.4s] I invite my
[332.8s] panelist who will introduce themselves
[335.4s] starting from a lovely
[337.6s] lady um my name is
[340.2s] rosu um I'm a member this beautiful
[344.9s] panel my name is Henrik SMI I'm a member
[348.1s] of the colleges class happy to be here
[351.2s] and my name is Timothy Kuka I'm also
[354.2s] happy to be
[356.0s] here and for me your moderator for this
[358.9s] session I'm Elijah Peter our key text
[363.0s] for this for this week is James 1: 19-
[366.5s] 21 I invite my brother kuo to read for
[370.7s] us James chapter 1 verse 19- 21 and it
[375.8s] says remember this my dear brothers and
[379.2s] sisters everyone must be quick to listen
[382.6s] but slow to speak and slow to become
[385.4s] angry verse 20 human anger does not
[388.8s] achieve God's right
[390.4s] purpose verse 21 so get rid of every
[394.5s] filthy habit and all Wicked conduct
[397.6s] submit to God and accept the word for he
[400.7s] plants in your hearts which is able to
[404.6s] save you amen amen amen if you're able
[410.3s] to just sit on James 1: 19 which has
[414.5s] clearly is stated as as my brother's
[416.6s] read you should be slow to speak slow to
[420.8s] wrath wrath in other uh versions is
[424.6s] known as
[425.8s] anger why are we
[428.7s] angry right now we have an anger
[431.6s] pandemic belittling us and attacking us
[434.8s] from every side a pandemic not related
[437.8s] to the covid-19 which you understand
[439.9s] came from a virus but an anger that
[443.3s] arises from us an anger that is built
[447.9s] inside us and why is that so okay so the
[453.3s] title of the lesson is the anger
[454.6s] pandemic thinking about a pandemic the
[456.6s] first thing that came to my mind was
[458.7s] covid and I think the effects of covid
[461.0s] were were there for for us for all of us
[462.8s] to see we saw it led to much shutdown of
[465.5s] schools and public places there to
[467.6s] massive deaths many people got sick some
[469.6s] recovered got sick again and the effects
[471.7s] were not only in one region but were
[473.5s] throughout the whole world so in the
[475.3s] same way covid was a pandemic in that
[477.2s] time I think anger been a pandemic is
[479.0s] that the world today so many people are
[481.8s] angry you drive on the roads guys are
[484.8s] hooting all over the place people are so
[487.2s] stressed and I think the lesson really
[488.7s] gives us a picture why this is happening
[490.3s] allow me to read just one section of the
[492.1s] lesson it says the anger pandemic has
[494.5s] arrived and it is fears as a society we
[496.9s] are facing increasing levels of stress
[499.1s] caused by everything from job loss to
[501.2s] social unrest social unrest you see the
[503.2s] JZ movement here in Kenya and all those
[505.5s] other things the leadership in the
[507.1s] country really not doing what they're
[508.5s] supposed to do is is causing men and
[510.4s] women to be angry so I think those are
[512.4s] some of the few reasons why really anger
[514.3s] has become a pandemic and the the sad
[516.6s] part is it's not localized in one area
[518.8s] everywhere throughout the whole world
[520.2s] people are angry because of the way life
[522.2s] is unfair to say the least true yes he
[525.7s] brings out the aspect of life being
[527.2s] unfair and we're looking at an anger
[529.0s] pandemic we as as has alluded earlier
[532.1s] the pandemic we had uh previous years
[534.0s] was the covid-19
[535.5s] pandemic right now it's not a virus that
[538.4s] is causing us to have a Pand pic rather
[540.4s] we have life itself being an
[544.0s] pandemic in in in in in it of itself we
[547.6s] we wonder life in itself is supposed to
[550.5s] be enjoyed to the fullest I I I love a
[553.5s] speaker who says in this life you
[555.4s] supposed to live life to the fullest
[557.9s] rather than survive why are people
[560.3s] surviving in this day and
[562.8s] era I I I invite my brother K
[566.0s] toate Wow where do I begin um
[570.0s] anger in itself doesn't come up just
[572.2s] like that there has to be a root Source
[575.4s] in it true and here I'll I'll I'll dive
[579.2s] into the internal factors that might
[581.8s] cause people to be so angry nowadays
[586.0s] and in in most cases we see that anger
[590.4s] is just an form of eruption from a
[593.7s] pressure from within for instance like
[595.7s] volcano they have erupt because there's
[598.0s] pressure in within the Earth surface and
[601.4s] in this case we see there are so many
[603.5s] factors such as sadness
[606.0s] disappointment I mean we we also have
[609.4s] our traumas in the past and in in many
[612.4s] cases some of us tend not to have dealt
[616.0s] with those traumas and just uh REM it
[619.2s] reminds us when when we remember such
[621.2s] traumas it makes us channel that that
[624.8s] disappointment or past experience to
[627.5s] other people and
[629.9s] I mean this is
[631.4s] where
[633.2s] um people are really lacking the aspect
[636.8s] of calling to God during such times but
[640.2s] before I even delve into that I'd want
[642.5s] us uh to also reflect on the aspect of
[646.4s] self-control which is a fruit of the
[648.7s] Holy Spirit In the book of Galatians
[650.9s] chapter 5 you'll find the fruits of the
[652.6s] Holy Spirit there and selfcontrol
[656.2s] is uh in in in a good examp example
[659.3s] example if someone disappoints you or or
[662.0s] or angers you we tend to um try to
[666.4s] mitigate such uh bad uh effects to the
[670.7s] other person so for instance what I
[673.1s] normally do I normally breathe in in and
[675.5s] out I normally just walk
[678.2s] around um or I just want to exclude
[682.1s] myself from others you you have to you
[684.4s] also have to try and do um something
[687.2s] that cannot affect your relationship sh
[689.5s] with other people and but one of the
[692.7s] best things we can do is to call upon
[695.5s] God's name and we see it in Philippians
[700.3s] chapter 4:6-7
[703.0s] Philippians chapter 4:6 to7 it says do
[706.8s] not worry about anything but in all your
[709.2s] prayers ask God for what you need always
[712.4s] ask him with a thankful heart and God's
[715.0s] peace Which is far beyond human
[717.1s] understanding will keep your hearts and
[718.8s] Minds safe in Union with Christ Jesus I
[722.8s] mean amen amen we have we need to call
[726.5s] upon God's name in times of when we feel
[729.1s] like we are going to react in a very bad
[731.9s] way in Anger we just say a soft prayer
[734.2s] I'm telling you it worked I I had anger
[737.2s] issues but I I'm still I'm still
[739.9s] battling them but I normally just uh
[742.6s] take some time I just pray to God God
[744.5s] please let me not do anything bad and it
[747.1s] actually works um but um we in this
[751.8s] generation and time where as as my
[755.0s] brothers have highlighted it's a
[756.3s] pandemic we ought to seek God and so
[759.5s] that we cannot be sucked in into this
[764.1s] Global anger pandemic that we are
[766.4s] experiencing yes thank you my brother
[769.6s] Kalo he brings out the aspect of trauma
[772.4s] and now brings out the aspect that this
[774.4s] is a personal thing we might try and
[777.5s] look at it from a world perspective say
[780.0s] everyone out there is angry but right
[782.7s] here right now each and everyone of us
[785.8s] is facing a problem something that is
[788.6s] causing them to to to be angry something
[790.9s] that will push them to the wall and make
[793.1s] them react in a way that has never been
[795.2s] seen in most cases if as as as you said
[800.2s] we need to act with
[803.8s] self-control self-control is
[807.4s] important I I'll we'll keep on referring
[810.1s] to our key text this week which is James
[812.1s] 1
[813.7s] 19-21 and if I can just pick out a
[816.1s] portion from that which says be swift to
[819.7s] hear slow to speak slow to
[824.6s] wrath if I can tie that to a quote that
[826.9s] I recently came across which says that
[829.3s] sometimes you need to be to to to to
[831.6s] listen without being
[834.4s] defensive listen without being def
[837.0s] defensive true and as as I come to my
[839.2s] sister this thing about self-control and
[842.2s] controlled anger we we want to be
[844.4s] control of this anger but yet how do we
[848.5s] control this anger oura said prayer and
[851.8s] calling unto God because he's the one
[853.5s] who be able to control it for us but for
[855.7s] my
[856.6s] sister how many times have you seen this
[859.2s] uncontrolled anger destroying
[862.0s] relationships okay so I would love to
[864.2s] say that uncontrolled anger anger in
[867.8s] itself is not a sin
[869.8s] because in many instances in the Bible
[871.9s] we see how God becomes very angry with
[875.6s] the Israelites and he wants to destroy
[878.4s] but we listen we we we actually see that
[881.5s] even God our Father listens to us if we
[885.3s] we actually we actually we actually talk
[888.0s] to him even in the anger because I
[890.2s] remember there's a there's a the passage
[893.6s] in the Bible when God was so angry at
[896.1s] the Israelites because they were
[897.4s] worshiping the golden Cal and Moses had
[899.4s] come from the mountain and he was very
[903.1s] angry to the point that he wanted to
[904.7s] destroy the Israelites and God listened
[908.0s] to Moses when Moses pleaded and said
[911.0s] please do not do this we will look for a
[913.5s] way to to fix it I feel I I think that
[918.0s] uncontrolled anger is very prevalent in
[920.4s] our society because people think that
[923.4s] they can they can face and fix these
[926.0s] things on their own while as a Christian
[929.1s] we know that anger can lead to a lot of
[931.4s] sins I think the writer says
[933.3s] unrestrained anger has enous risks it it
[936.6s] not only harms relationships family
[939.4s] Dynamics and mental well-being but also
[942.0s] NE negatively impacts physical health
[944.6s] it's been shown to weaken the immune
[946.3s] system and and a study in the Journal
[949.4s] circulation found that people who are
[951.0s] more prone to anger have twice normal
[953.1s] risk of coronary heart disease um
[957.3s] uncontrolled anger is not a good thing
[959.3s] especially in relationships because
[961.6s] every time we we we have challenges as
[964.5s] human beings and and anytime you're in
[967.0s] relationships or friendships you'll find
[968.9s] that you will have something that you
[971.0s] don't relate to with another person and
[974.2s] I feel like if if you are too too too
[979.5s] you're too fast to get to anger instead
[982.7s] of trying to fix the problem then it
[985.3s] becomes a problem because these
[987.0s] relationships won't last and this Rel
[988.9s] relationships will have a lot of
[990.3s] problems every time and so I think just
[993.4s] as we are taught to be Christlike we
[996.9s] should deal with anger the way Jesus did
[999.7s] every time Jesus I mean God was angry he
[1003.1s] would listen or look for a better
[1005.9s] solution to fix the problem instead of
[1009.7s] letting the anger um letting the the
[1013.0s] anger overcome you to a point that you
[1015.0s] do very bad things or you destroy very
[1017.9s] good relationships because you're angry
[1020.5s] back to you thank you very much I I feel
[1022.8s] my brother K has something to say but
[1025.2s] before I invite him also as I come to
[1027.3s] kiso uh there this trend that has been
[1030.3s] we we're in the technological era and I
[1032.2s] think the lesson writers had a vision of
[1035.2s] why this lesson was critical for this
[1037.5s] day and age right now people are facing
[1040.2s] mental problems this is not a key to
[1042.8s] solve your mental problems but it's more
[1044.7s] of a guiding principle if I can attach
[1047.6s] what my sister Rose said right now we
[1049.4s] have
[1050.1s] a a trend that is going where people are
[1052.4s] saying we listen but we do not judge and
[1055.9s] you wonder is that is is that the
[1057.7s] correct way to how to deal with anger I
[1060.3s] invite my brother to to just elucidate
[1062.2s] what are the appropriate ways and times
[1064.8s] to express anger okay so I think my
[1067.8s] sister Rose alled to the fact that anger
[1070.5s] in itself can be used for good because
[1073.8s] the the text she just highlighted was
[1075.9s] talking about unrestrained anger which
[1078.2s] means if you you are able to restrain
[1079.9s] your anger within some certain
[1081.2s] parameters this anger can be used to
[1083.6s] achieve good and a good example that has
[1085.8s] been given in the lesson is let's say
[1089.1s] you see maybe something like Injustice I
[1091.7s] think it can speak for us in our country
[1093.5s] Kenya here we see a lot of Injustice
[1096.1s] against people you hear people just I
[1098.6s] don't know my brothers here is a is a
[1100.7s] lawyer same to rul they'll tell me
[1102.4s] people just speaking for their rights
[1104.3s] just saying what they think is is is
[1106.8s] fair for them but you find that this
[1109.4s] expression is limited because if you go
[1111.5s] ahead and say what you think or what you
[1113.4s] think is right you are sort of abducted
[1115.3s] in this country guys have been abducted
[1117.5s] so I think appropriate anger is anger
[1120.6s] that is used to to achieve good if I am
[1123.9s] angry like Let me Give an example the
[1126.1s] story of Christ when Christ gets to the
[1128.1s] temple and he finds this guys buying and
[1130.2s] selling in the temple and he's so angry
[1133.5s] but one thing about that story some
[1135.1s] people think Christ actually beat people
[1136.9s] in that story but he didn't he just had
[1139.0s] a we but he was using it to I don't word
[1141.9s] scare them away but he didn't actually
[1143.3s] beat people because people use that
[1144.9s] story to say oh Christ be people in the
[1146.4s] church and all that but essentially my
[1148.7s] point is anger can be appropriate for
[1151.0s] times where you're fighting against
[1152.7s] Injustice where you want things to be
[1154.5s] done in the way that God wants them
[1156.9s] because God says that sin angers him
[1159.6s] anytime we commit sin it angers him
[1161.8s] because sin is the transation of his law
[1164.2s] indeed so essentially the the point or
[1166.5s] the take on point is anger can be
[1169.0s] appropriate when it is used to fight
[1171.2s] against Injustice or to fight against
[1173.4s] Things That Go contrary to the will of
[1176.4s] goded KH as I welcome Kalo he brings out
[1180.8s] the aspect that anger is appropriate
[1184.0s] when you're fighting against injustices
[1186.7s] I want to now bring this lesson home to
[1188.8s] us bring this lesson to those who are
[1191.7s] Kenyans those who are in different
[1193.6s] countries we we understand each country
[1196.2s] has their own share problems each
[1198.2s] country is facing an injustice that they
[1200.8s] never imagine could have been there as
[1203.8s] we are standing to speak with our anger
[1206.0s] boiled up inside of us just to try and
[1208.4s] tell them no do this because this the
[1211.2s] correct path according to what the Bible
[1214.4s] says my question to kou is sometimes
[1219.2s] other people their mental space might
[1222.0s] have been pushed to the world in the
[1223.4s] sense that they're now afraid to speak
[1227.1s] they listen with every everything that
[1229.0s] is happening they angry inside but they
[1232.4s] can't what is
[1234.4s] happening is that the correct way to go
[1236.5s] my
[1238.2s] friend that's that my friend is not the
[1242.0s] most uh uh I wouldn't prescribe that
[1245.7s] yeah
[1247.0s] because we we are humans we have our our
[1251.2s] ages our boiling point okay when and it
[1255.5s] just alludes to the aspect of um past
[1258.9s] traumas and I don't know if you've heard
[1260.5s] about the story of the two
[1263.0s] wolves okay the story of the two wolves
[1265.9s] I was told last uh last year by my
[1269.1s] friend um a good friend of mine we
[1271.6s] school together yeah so he so we were
[1275.2s] just walking and he told me have you
[1277.1s] heard the story of the two wolves and I
[1278.6s] asked him okay what's what's it about he
[1281.0s] tells me that one day there was a
[1283.0s] grandfather who who told his son about
[1285.8s] having two wolves in his heart one is um
[1290.5s] one is hatred and anger the other is
[1293.4s] peace and love so these two wolves
[1296.1s] always always um fight against uh
[1300.1s] against each other in our hearts and he
[1302.6s] and the young son said okay
[1305.6s] um who do you think will win okay which
[1308.5s] which wolf wins in our heart and the
[1311.0s] Grandfather said the wolf that you feed
[1313.9s] the most is the wolf that wins indeed I
[1317.1s] mean we if you feed by by this by this I
[1321.2s] mean that um if you focus so much on on
[1325.3s] um on on on hatred and anger it will
[1329.4s] just boil up boil up boil up and you
[1333.8s] will portray that towards others I'm
[1336.6s] telling you putting it inside and
[1339.1s] feeding that anger and hatred in your
[1341.8s] heart will come out externally and we we
[1346.4s] also have to focus on the aspect of
[1351.1s] forgiveness for in Colossians 3:13 it
[1354.6s] says forgive as the Lord forgives you so
[1358.8s] on the aspect of um just keeping that
[1361.8s] anger
[1362.9s] in one side there are certain things
[1366.0s] that we keep inside ourself in terms of
[1369.6s] our hearts that we just don't we just
[1371.8s] don't let it go there are aspects where
[1374.3s] we have
[1375.1s] to be we have to be forgiving
[1379.3s] so that we can move forward indeed and
[1383.1s] there's other aspect of having healthy
[1385.6s] conversations I mean when you're angry
[1388.6s] with someone the best thing you can do
[1391.2s] is to have healthy a healthy
[1392.4s] conversation and people are different
[1394.2s] there others who will have it at that
[1397.4s] point others will have it after a period
[1400.4s] of time I mean there others who need
[1402.0s] time for us for you to have healthy
[1403.7s] conversations so for me for people who
[1406.2s] normally put it and bottle it up
[1409.2s] my advice is hey if somebody angers you
[1413.1s] have a healthy conversation with them
[1414.9s] and also don't feed the aspect of hatred
[1418.1s] always seek to forgive others amen so
[1421.4s] that's that's my view on that indeed
[1423.5s] amen you you bring out the aspect of
[1426.3s] wolves two Wolves at home I hope you've
[1429.0s] learned something from the Wolves uh who
[1431.3s] are in the heart at the end of the day
[1434.3s] the back lies with you you are the one
[1437.3s] who chooses how to react
[1439.7s] at the beginning of the lesson my
[1440.8s] brother was telling us how he himself
[1443.3s] was angry at a point in time but how he
[1445.7s] handled it was he let himself
[1449.3s] breathe take a walk sometimes just
[1452.7s] breathing in and out taking in Long DPS
[1455.0s] of good fresh air alleviates the
[1459.6s] situation it might not solve what you're
[1462.0s] angry about but it just helps you to
[1464.9s] calm your mind this week we're looking
[1467.6s] at coming the angry mind we don't know
[1469.8s] what might be causing you to go back and
[1472.4s] and and react angrily but we want you
[1476.2s] yourself to become inside you I think
[1481.1s] the songwriter who wrote himym number
[1483.1s] 652 was very clear as he wrote there is
[1487.0s] beauty all
[1489.0s] around when there's love at
[1492.0s] home there is joy in every sound when
[1496.5s] there's love at home
[1499.2s] peace and plenty here
[1502.1s] abide
[1503.9s] smiling Fair on every
[1506.6s] side time does softly sweetly
[1511.0s] Glide when there's love at
[1515.3s] home this just is to show you that when
[1518.5s] you accept love into your own heart when
[1521.0s] Christ comes and you accept Christ into
[1523.0s] your own
[1524.0s] heart there's a paradigm shift on how
[1527.1s] things will go things will be peaceful
[1530.2s] things will be
[1533.1s] beautiful I cannot even
[1536.3s] for how it will be I'm just living in my
[1539.8s] own imagination how things will be but
[1542.7s] now if you now allow anger to come
[1545.6s] inside your peaceful home what are the
[1549.1s] ders that come with this we need now to
[1551.8s] look at the ders of indulging in
[1556.2s] Anger well anger is just as we have said
[1561.0s] anger is not a bad thing even in the
[1563.0s] Bible it's allowed because even our
[1565.4s] creator has anger sometimes in the Bible
[1569.6s] and uh also the writer of the lesson
[1573.2s] says that anger sometimes is a righteous
[1576.2s] response to evil but there are negative
[1579.4s] effects of anger that that might lead to
[1583.2s] a lot of a lot of Chaos in our world
[1586.6s] today and I think some of the of the
[1592.4s] effects of anger is that just as we had
[1595.7s] said earlier that relationships might be
[1598.6s] broken also it affects our physical
[1602.5s] being our physical well-being because
[1605.7s] anger is a suppression of other emotions
[1608.4s] maybe disappointment and sadness and all
[1611.2s] other things and now if we are going to
[1614.2s] we are going to project it towards the
[1616.4s] other
[1617.2s] people it it comes out as anger because
[1620.6s] the the emotions have been so sressed to
[1623.4s] the point that you feel like you are so
[1626.4s] Fierce and you want
[1628.0s] to you you can deal with a problem by
[1630.7s] yourself but instead of doing all this
[1633.8s] we can I think one of the ways just as
[1637.0s] kalu had said um one of the ways that
[1639.5s] you can you you can really suppress
[1641.7s] anger is through meditating and I think
[1646.9s] uh I think I have tried this um
[1649.5s] listening to hymns hymns really come the
[1652.1s] soul and once you listen to a hym um you
[1656.3s] feel
[1657.2s] like God God is talking to you also um
[1661.8s] have you ever been in a scenario where
[1664.4s] you pray immediately something bad
[1667.2s] happens and not something bad as as any
[1670.3s] other thing but something bad as you you
[1672.8s] have been in a situation with a friend
[1675.3s] or a any other person your family and
[1679.4s] then you get into an argument and now
[1681.8s] you you just pray on the instant
[1684.9s] literally there is nothing else this
[1686.8s] person can do after you have prayed
[1688.6s] because it it feels like you have you
[1691.3s] have you know you have calmed the
[1694.7s] situation and now it it might now result
[1698.2s] to you you people actually talking on a
[1701.4s] cordial basis yeah H I think that's all
[1704.5s] I would say on that thank you very much
[1706.4s] I see my brother K coming but even as
[1708.3s] comes in I'll throw a question across
[1711.2s] board yeah we are all looking at the
[1713.9s] lesson and what the lesson writer tries
[1715.6s] to bring but we ourselves here as a
[1717.5s] panelist yeah have we ever been angry
[1719.9s] that's the first question then how did
[1721.8s] we deal with that anger
[1723.9s] T yes so I've ever been angry myself and
[1728.4s] to add on to the previous question and
[1731.5s] answer this question as well so I I
[1735.4s] believe one of the effects of hunger
[1737.1s] another another effect is it it it
[1740.1s] destroys the amount of trust you have
[1742.1s] with someone and this is why we have to
[1745.9s] be soft in our answers as alluded in
[1747.8s] Proverbs chapter 15 verse1 it says a
[1750.2s] soft answer turns away wrath but a hard
[1753.6s] a harsh word uh stirs up anger so for
[1757.5s] myself I have been angry before and the
[1761.1s] best thing I did is to I I I didn't
[1765.6s] aggressively talk to that person and in
[1768.8s] in the way you approach that moment will
[1770.9s] determine how your relationship is going
[1772.7s] to go from that time so one of my
[1775.8s] examples is a time I was I wasn't happy
[1778.8s] with someone and I just said HRI just go
[1782.2s] and just talk to him in a good manner
[1785.0s] and and just follow the God's
[1787.4s] word and I just went we uh we talked a
[1791.2s] healthy conversation as alluded before
[1793.5s] and everything uh styled up and we are
[1795.8s] still friends till till now so yeah yeah
[1800.8s] I think for me uh I'll give two
[1803.7s] scenarios one scenario where I handled
[1806.8s] the anger in a way that I shouldn't have
[1808.8s] because I feel like we need to make this
[1811.2s] a bit practical it's not all the time
[1813.2s] that you have 100% success rate of
[1815.0s] managing your anger well so I think for
[1818.0s] me H there's a time I was angry at one
[1821.6s] of my siblings they had done something
[1824.6s] and I wasn't so happy about it and uh I
[1828.1s] reacted in a very aggressive way to say
[1830.5s] the least so I remember they angered me
[1833.3s] so much so I just left the room banged
[1835.8s] the door I was talking so much in my
[1837.8s] head as I was leaving and uh you know
[1840.5s] afterwards the brain has a very
[1841.9s] interesting of working after you do that
[1843.7s] there's this high level of extreme guilt
[1846.6s] that you feel after that so I think when
[1848.7s] when you just come down and sit you just
[1850.5s] asking yourself like bro why did I do
[1852.8s] that was that necessary I think that was
[1855.2s] an incident where I did not handle anger
[1857.6s] in the way that we have learned today to
[1859.2s] handle but maybe another incident I can
[1861.3s] give where I handled my anger in a
[1862.9s] better way at Le the same example okay
[1865.0s] for those of you who have young siblings
[1866.4s] you just have to understand that
[1867.6s] sometimes most of the time there's going
[1869.6s] to be a lot of commotion and a lot of
[1871.3s] strife between you so but this time what
[1873.5s] I did is when I got angry I just left
[1876.9s] the room and just went and took a walk
[1879.1s] first and just calmed my mind and calmed
[1881.0s] my nerves down then now came back we
[1883.2s] talked the situation out and the
[1884.9s] solution was amicable for both of us
[1887.0s] amen so I think lesson for for me from
[1889.3s] those two instances is that the way I
[1892.9s] respond to this anger will even dictate
[1894.9s] the solution that will come toward the
[1896.5s] end because if I leave the place angry
[1898.8s] and even come back you know the feeling
[1900.2s] is that oh the guy was angry when he
[1902.1s] left but if I just take the appropriate
[1904.6s] steps to ensure that this doesn't end in
[1907.0s] hatred it ends in US resolving this
[1909.1s] amicably I think that that is a better
[1911.2s] way going forward amen that that that
[1913.7s] remind me the Commandment that says the
[1915.2s] greatest commandment is love love should
[1918.3s] always dwell in every scenario love
[1922.1s] should be should always be there Rose
[1925.5s] have you ever been angry and yes I have
[1928.8s] been angry a lot of times and for
[1930.8s] someone who projects what I feel
[1935.7s] I I have said a lot of bad things you
[1938.6s] know and you know as an older sibling
[1942.1s] this these children these people make
[1943.7s] you feel feel so bad and you you really
[1946.9s] want to tell them all things but then
[1949.1s] you remember um in 1 Corinthians 13 is
[1953.6s] it the the chapter of love Yeah it it
[1956.6s] talks about love bears all things and
[1959.3s] that means you you know in some
[1963.2s] friendships in the Contemporary world
[1965.2s] today people say if you if you do this
[1967.7s] to me people have standards if you do
[1969.8s] this to me I cut you off if you do this
[1971.6s] to me I cut you off how many people are
[1973.8s] you going to cut off by the end of your
[1975.2s] lifetime you'll cut off everyone and
[1978.2s] even the the lesson says we are not
[1981.1s] built to be an island human beings have
[1983.9s] to have relationships and that is if it
[1987.7s] there's a place that says you will
[1990.1s] remain dry if you you don't have
[1991.9s] relationships so if you're going to be
[1993.8s] dealing with situations by cutting
[1996.4s] people off that that is not a way to
[1998.8s] deal with your issues so with me and my
[2001.1s] siblings we you take time apart and you
[2006.6s] relax and
[2008.6s] recall everything that has happened and
[2011.4s] you really find out it was such a small
[2013.2s] thing it would have been solved in the
[2014.6s] best way possible you are just making it
[2016.6s] a big deal just because you're angry and
[2019.0s] so you just relax talk to and I I think
[2022.4s] us as siblings we don't say sorry you
[2024.7s] just start
[2025.6s] talking you just start talking yeah you
[2028.2s] just say and then you just talk to each
[2030.4s] other in a better way and you realize
[2032.8s] that you guys are okay and I feel like
[2035.0s] in our world today things s is are
[2037.5s] really hard thing and I feel like if you
[2040.3s] have identified that you are the one
[2042.3s] with a problem or if if not God God
[2045.9s] wants us to actually me relationships if
[2049.7s] you even if you were on the right side
[2052.3s] God loved us really even every time we
[2055.2s] sin we still go back to God and he will
[2057.5s] still accept us and I think that is what
[2059.5s] we supposed to be doing for other people
[2061.5s] because love is the greatest superpower
[2063.7s] amen amen I I I hear I I I see my
[2066.7s] brother turning the Bible I I'll I'll
[2068.9s] just tell him to turn to Hebrews 3:13 as
[2071.8s] I also give my scenario I think most of
[2074.2s] the time when you're angry and as my
[2076.0s] said it's very difficult to say sorry
[2079.4s] yeah I'm not sure if we've been Harden
[2081.6s] to that extent that saying sorry is now
[2084.0s] like a burden things so is like we now
[2086.5s] told
[2087.5s] remove 30% of your of your income as
[2090.6s] taxes it has become that difficult we we
[2094.9s] we try and contemplate we try and fight
[2096.6s] in our minds should I say sorry was I on
[2099.2s] the wrong and I think my our brother
[2101.9s] here was was was saying that with his
[2104.0s] first reaction to anger he bang the door
[2106.6s] left but then as he left and he was calm
[2110.3s] his conscience came in and kicked in and
[2112.4s] he was like by the way you are at fault
[2115.6s] by the way just go back and and and and
[2117.8s] and and sit down and have an amical
[2120.8s] conversation no man is an island as much
[2124.4s] as we we we want to live alone as much
[2126.5s] as we may not know how to deal with the
[2128.4s] situation at that point in time it it it
[2130.9s] doesn't take a million shillings to just
[2134.2s] leave the room go take a walk listen to
[2138.1s] music calm down and then come and have a
[2141.8s] conversation Hebrews 3:13 Hebrews chter
[2145.0s] 3 uh verse 13 says instead in order that
[2150.4s] none of you be deceived by sin and
[2153.4s] become stubborn you must help one
[2155.6s] another every day as long as the the
[2157.8s] word today in the scripture applies to
[2161.1s] us amen
[2163.9s] true that verse is just telling us we
[2169.4s] need to help one another
[2172.7s] yeah we need to exalt one another we
[2176.7s] need to be there for one
[2180.0s] another we all understand even going
[2183.2s] back to the Garden of Eden Adam was
[2186.0s] given Eve hypothetically speaking in my
[2188.8s] Sanctified imagination I'm trying to
[2190.8s] imagine uh them having a a quarrel Adam
[2194.6s] is calling the lion lion
[2197.5s] but Eve is like No it should not be
[2199.6s] called Li it should be called XY Z and
[2202.7s] you're
[2203.8s] like it looks like a lion we just they
[2208.4s] had quarrels but
[2210.9s] then because they were in communion with
[2214.1s] God because we all understand that time
[2217.0s] God will come in the Garden of Eden
[2218.6s] greet Adam Adam Hi how are you doing how
[2222.0s] how was the day did you feed the lion
[2223.9s] did you eat the apple from that tree
[2225.9s] you're good we good they had that
[2229.0s] Fellowship so I'm trying to imagine Adam
[2231.7s] despite him being angry with Eve they
[2233.6s] will sit down try and sort out their
[2236.3s] issues by the way the way you were
[2238.9s] telling me this it didn't come out
[2241.2s] correctly just to bring out to just give
[2243.8s] you a full quote of what I had read
[2245.3s] earlier was in every every
[2248.5s] scenario speak without being
[2251.9s] offensive listen without being
[2256.3s] defensive in all scenarios leave the
[2260.2s] person with the person you're dealing
[2262.2s] with with the respect that they
[2265.5s] deserve sometimes we all want to give a
[2267.8s] response I don't know is that a we if if
[2270.6s] someone throws you at you you quick to
[2273.9s] it's more a give and take like it it
[2277.5s] doesn't pay to just keep quiet because I
[2279.7s] think key text for this week James 1
[2284.4s] verse
[2285.9s] 19-21 I think wherever you may be just
[2289.9s] sit with that memory text meditate upon
[2294.2s] the words because what it says is be
[2298.7s] swift to
[2301.5s] hear be swift to
[2304.3s] hear why why do you think people are
[2306.3s] just quick to to to to thr at one
[2308.4s] another even as as you give
[2311.0s] contribution I believe is the main
[2313.7s] reason is that they they don't put their
[2315.5s] trust in God God offers before he left
[2319.6s] offers offered us peace and we see it in
[2323.5s] John uh 14:27 peace is what I leave you
[2327.0s] with it is my own peace that I give you
[2330.0s] I do not give it as the world does do
[2332.6s] not be worried and upset do not be
[2334.6s] afraid which people need to trust trust
[2337.7s] in God's word and believe that it is
[2341.1s] only in this way that we are going to
[2342.6s] handle our anger in a better manner so
[2345.8s] God's uh our God the Holy Spirit
[2348.8s] transforms us to to to undertake to
[2352.4s] undertake such circumstances in a
[2354.1s] peaceful and loving manner amen
[2356.8s] yes I I I don't know what happens when
[2359.2s] the lesson becomes sweet is when now
[2361.6s] time decides to do its thing and
[2364.9s] it's viewers I'm I'm I'm sorry we we're
[2368.0s] out of time but I think I'll just give
[2369.8s] each and everyone of us a second or 1
[2373.3s] minute maximum to just give you pting
[2375.5s] short comaling the angry mind R the
[2380.0s] pting short is that we should actually
[2383.1s] strive to resolve our anger just like
[2387.5s] God did and we should be very slow to
[2389.8s] anger just as our creator is and in
[2392.7s] everything that we do we should strive
[2394.6s] to if you don't know how to Cal your
[2396.8s] angry mind
[2398.0s] just look into documentaries or you can
[2401.3s] look at examples in the Bible and I
[2403.8s] think that will be well with you amen as
[2407.0s] my friend has said as Christians we
[2409.6s] strive to be like Jesus every day so let
[2412.4s] us undertake righteous anger so that we
[2415.4s] may have good relationships with people
[2417.5s] around us and with God too amen thank
[2419.6s] you I think for me H something that
[2421.7s] stood out is anger if used appropriately
[2425.0s] can us to achieve good so maybe in our
[2426.8s] day-to-day life lives you need to ensure
[2428.8s] that even if you to get angry you ensure
[2431.4s] that this anger is directed towards do
[2433.0s] the good thing and as my fellows have
[2435.3s] said you just equate it to Jesus what
[2437.8s] what would Jesus do in the same
[2439.1s] situation amen my Parting Shot for you
[2442.6s] ladies and gentlemen come from Ellen
[2445.0s] White Desire of Ages page
