fellow panelist on the far right we have brother opata next to me we have brother niik and uh as we begin I would just like to remind us um take us back quickly what we discussed last week last week we talked about is it's still a fight and we highlighted why we need to consider time factor in our walk with Christ we were reminded that we need to persevere in this walk of faith this week we want to tackle safeguarding new safeguarding the new experiences pardon me this is chapter 9 as we get as we come to the close we invite you to be with us I will pray and then I will hand it over to brother Nik who will be discussing chapter 9 for today let us pray Our Father Who Art in Heaven thank you so much once again for your blessings for bringing us together for uniting us Lord we pray that may your Holy Spirit descend and be with us even as we continue discussing and reviewing this book that you've granted unto us through your Prophet we want to thank you and ask you that youd be with us oh Lord from the beginning to the end it is in Jesus name we pray amen amen Amen brother Nik thank you see guing the new experience as you have become revived in Christ it's important for you to safeguard this experience that God has has given you now there's one thing we need to note you face the most attacks from the devil after you have been revived and we can see this even after Jesus baptism the moment he gets baptized he goes to the Wilderness and the Bible says he went to be tempted of the devil now A Narrative of the same nature happened in a place called Battle Creek where a Revival had taken place and this chapter starts with this statement after the outpouring of the spirit of God in Battle Creek it was proved in the college that a time of great spiritual light is also a time of corresponding spiritual Darkness Satan and his Legions of satanic agencies are on the ground pressing their powers upon every soul to make of none effect the showers of Grace that have come from Heaven to revive and Quicken the dant energies into decided action to impart that which God has imparted the Great Commission comes to us that go ye therefore and teach All Nations baptizing them in the name of the father and of the son and of the Holy Ghost teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I have commanded you that's what Matthew 28 verse 18 and 19 tells us and the disciples were charged and they were told when the spirit of God comes on you with power from high you can take this message to Jerusalem Judea and all other parts of the world now the disciples waited for the outpouring of the Holy Spirit then they went out to take the gospel and this is the experience that they had where they were revived and charged with the message to take out to people now what happens is when we have Revival meetings even in church we normally get all this power and suddenly you're excited about spiritual activity and then suddenly just dies down it's not something that is strange because we're told here it's the devil behind this world he tries to ensure that this message doesn't go out and those who keep up the Zeal are claimed to be Fanatics and sometimes even the work of the holy spirit is confused to be fanaticism and this is a work that the devil is doing so to walk in the light is to keep moving onward in the direction of light now if the one blessed becomes negligent and inattentive and does not watch un to prayer if he does not lift the cross and bear the Yoke of Christ if his love of amusements and strivings for the Mastery absorb his power or ability then God is not made the first and best and last in everything and Satan comes act his part in playing the game of the life life of his soul he can play much more honestly than they can play and make deepl plots for the ruin of the the devil has been a master of this game that he's been playing with our lives for years and he studied almost every kind of character in fact sometimes he sees us and he's saying I have seen that before I just know how this revival can be killed as soon as it comes because he also knows that he has no power to resist the spirit of God so he normally comes to take away this thing now sadly for Battle Creek it was the love of games amusements sports that was brought about to take away the work of Revival so there had been a great Revival at Battle Creek at that time but now when people started with the many sports that are there even boxing came up I don't know if it was the ball games that was there at that time you find that they were discussing ing which match is being played maybe even on Sabbath I think yeah and even during the week instead of planning the Evangelistic efforts they're talking about which team beat which one and I can imagine this the same thing that happened to the disciples when they were talking about who is the greatest greatest and that time Christ is telling them in a few days I'm going to be crucified and when he came find that even the disciples couldn't believe what happened then is when they went to read what was written in the prophecy so that's one of the easiest way to lose the blessing so the devil can bring various things and sports I know is one of the things that captivates people in the world today even in the church we have sports that take away the place and time when we should have been studying and making plans so the church illuminates the world not by their profession of godliness but by their manifestations of the transforming and sting find power of the truth of the life and character the best way for us to be a light to others is by them seeing the light in us not by us going to preach and minister to them the better sermone that we can preach is by the way we live our lives so we have this danger that the light can actually become Darkness if we don't cherish cherish so it's important for us us to actually understand some of these things now another thing that is spoken of in this chapter is to actually determine if we cherish blessings from God when I think about it I think God has blessed us immensely with so many things but the question is do we cherish these blessings from God and maybe I may ask what are some blessings which you think you should cherish more than you actually value I have a couple I'm thinking of in my life right now but maybe if I may ask Steve any of the top of your heads that comes to you is there something that God has given you which you think you should cherish more than you actually I to me I think it's it's everything God has given me because you see when God is giving you you is those blessings they come can I say in isolation it's you God speaking to you personally and you know the danger of taking it for granted is very high because maybe in your assumption you think that everybody has these things and it's normal for me to have these things but you realize that uh when you start moving around and interacting with Brethren you realize that there are some challenges that people are facing in life and only then is when you realiz like oh God uh please forgive me for I have not been uh I've not shown you gratitude for the gifts that you have given me especially just the gift of life that we are here we are we are sitting here we are reviewing this book there somebody out there watching this uh this uh podcast and he's just wishing that you could have that energy just to sit and discuss the word of God all his prayers maybe it's just for God to visit him because he's sick so God forgive us for we have not been grateful for what the blessing that you have distored upon us yes amen amen amen I I I think you you again we cannot overemphasize uh the blessings of God in our lives we we the the songwriter says count your blessings one by one and you know you cannot it it will actually surprise you that will go on and on and on and on our lives as Christians are full of blessings amen yeah and just by the mere fact that we are here you know we could throw that away and say we struggle to wake up in the morning but even that struggling to wake up in the morning as brother opata says there's someone who was not able to wake up or lift their head or hand or leg so I think they immense blessings the blessing of of of uh you know just the gift of Salvation you know the immens the the blessing of having uh uh Witnesses having um Elders having brothers who we we can look um up to you know we we have Moses we have Abraham so when we are we are burdened with with troubles uh in our walk of Faith then we have people who we can look up to who walked this life so I think there are several blessings that we can we can get or we can count from the Lord yes amen amen Battle Creek had all the blessings that God had actually bestowed on them but they didn't make light and use of this blessing unfortunately the institution burn down I believe in the 1900s as a result of the judgments of God in relation to this so we actually find that they did not cherish the blessings that God had given them statement here says the blessing was given you that it might produce fruit in sound practices and upright character so sometimes the blessings that God has given us are turned into cures and that's why multiple times we're cautioned that be careful when you revived be careful when you receive light because it's possible that this blessing might turn into a cur into a c and I think about the blessings we have even when you're given money you might start now using it in a way that you never used it before because God has blessed you with this money if you have children you might not be raising them up in the right way God has said this is what you need to do but you're doing the other thing so that's how God would like us to be careful about and of course Christ also reminds us that if we do not make use of our talents M um they will be taken away so I mean that is very right if your blessings could eily very easily turn into a curse and it will be your own doing yeah yeah amen yeah the blessing turned into a curse is one of the most dangerous things yeah so we pray that God may help us in this and lastly there's one more thing which is the sin of rejecting evidence when God has poured out his Spirit Upon Us taught us all we need to do about Revival sometimes I've met with couple of people who say the Bible says this and I know I need to do this but I don't feel like I'm ready to do it or I'll do it at a later time and in our previous episode we talked about the time we need to do something is now actually the past episode right it's still a fight that we need to keep on fighting if you're given evidence then we need to to obey and if we don't have strength remember the works we do are through Christ strength not ours amen so that's something that we need to be keen on Amen I don't have much more to say unless you have any closing thoughts everything I think it has well captured it's just to wet your appetite yes thank you gentlemen that's how we safeg guard the new experience amen make sure that the blessings of God are not curses Upon Us amen that's chapter 9 of the book true Revival and the next episode will be special appeals in public Ministry this may just be a review of some of the appeals that were done you can share some interesting stories about what happened and thank you so much for joining us for this episode and we pray that you'll join us next time you can get the book using the link or the QR code on screen and you can see what it means to be truly reviv Brother P please close for us with a word of prayer let's pray our gracious Heavenly Father we thank you for your wonderful words that you have given us this day you

TIMESTAMPED TRANSCRIPT:
[1.1s] good morning or good evening wherever
[4.0s] you're watching us from we thank you for
[6.7s] joining us we are discussing the book
[10.7s] true Revival we just giving highlights
[14.2s] but we encourage you to get a copy you
[16.2s] can either get it from the link or the
[18.0s] QR code that will be presented on screen
[21.5s] or you can buy the book physically from
[23.4s] your nearest Adventist Book Shop thank
[27.0s] you very much once again uh I am joined
[29.7s] by my fellow panelist on the far right
[33.6s] we have brother opata next to me we have
[36.8s] brother niik and uh as we begin I would
[40.3s] just like to remind us um take us back
[43.4s] quickly what we discussed last week last
[45.8s] week we talked about is it's still a
[49.3s] fight and we highlighted why we need to
[52.6s] consider time factor in our walk with
[56.1s] Christ we were reminded that we need to
[58.2s] persevere in this walk of faith this
[60.2s] week we want to tackle
[62.3s] safeguarding new safeguarding the new
[65.4s] experiences pardon me this is chapter 9
[68.0s] as we get as we come to the close we
[70.6s] invite you to be with us I will pray and
[74.0s] then I will hand it over to brother Nik
[76.1s] who will be discussing chapter 9 for
[78.2s] today let us pray Our Father Who Art in
[81.9s] Heaven thank you so much once again for
[83.7s] your blessings for bringing us together
[85.9s] for uniting us Lord we pray that may
[88.6s] your Holy Spirit descend and be with us
[91.2s] even as we continue discussing and
[93.1s] reviewing this book that you've granted
[95.3s] unto us through your Prophet we want to
[97.6s] thank you and ask you that youd be with
[99.6s] us oh Lord from the beginning to the end
[102.4s] it is in Jesus name we pray amen amen
[105.6s] Amen brother Nik thank you see guing the
[110.4s] new
[112.3s] experience as you have become revived in
[115.4s] Christ it's important for you to
[117.5s] safeguard this experience that God has
[120.0s] has given you now there's one thing we
[122.6s] need to note you face the most attacks
[126.4s] from the devil after you have been
[128.9s] revived and we can see this even after
[131.3s] Jesus baptism the moment he gets
[133.8s] baptized he goes to the Wilderness and
[136.1s] the Bible says he went to be tempted of
[139.1s] the devil now A Narrative of the same
[142.8s] nature happened in a place called Battle
[145.3s] Creek where a Revival had taken place
[148.6s] and this chapter starts with this
[150.2s] statement after the outpouring of the
[152.8s] spirit of God in Battle Creek it was
[155.2s] proved in the college that a time of
[157.7s] great spiritual light is also a time of
[160.8s] corresponding spiritual Darkness Satan
[164.2s] and his Legions of satanic agencies are
[167.1s] on the ground pressing their powers upon
[169.6s] every soul to make of none effect the
[172.2s] showers of Grace that have come from
[174.4s] Heaven to revive and Quicken the dant
[177.5s] energies into decided action to impart
[181.0s] that which God has imparted the Great
[183.9s] Commission comes to us that go ye
[186.8s] therefore and teach All Nations
[188.9s] baptizing them in the name of the father
[191.1s] and of the son and of the Holy Ghost
[193.4s] teaching them to observe all things
[195.9s] whatsoever I have commanded you that's
[198.4s] what Matthew 28 verse 18 and 19 tells us
[202.9s] and the disciples were charged and they
[205.0s] were told when the spirit of God comes
[207.4s] on you with power from high you can take
[210.0s] this message to Jerusalem Judea and all
[213.1s] other parts of the world now the
[215.9s] disciples waited for the outpouring of
[218.2s] the Holy Spirit then they went out to
[220.9s] take the gospel and this is the
[223.4s] experience that they had where they were
[225.7s] revived and charged with the message to
[228.9s] take out to people now what happens is
[231.7s] when we have Revival meetings even in
[234.5s] church we normally get all this power
[238.0s] and suddenly you're excited about
[240.1s] spiritual activity and then suddenly
[242.6s] just dies down it's not something that
[246.0s] is strange because we're told here it's
[248.4s] the devil behind this world he tries to
[252.2s] ensure that this message doesn't go out
[255.0s] and those who keep up the Zeal are
[257.6s] claimed to be Fanatics and sometimes
[260.4s] even the work of the holy spirit is
[262.9s] confused to be fanaticism and this is a
[266.6s] work that the devil is doing so to walk
[270.2s] in the light is to keep moving onward in
[273.9s] the direction of light now if the one
[277.5s] blessed becomes negligent and
[279.6s] inattentive and does not watch un to
[282.2s] prayer if he does not lift the cross and
[284.6s] bear the Yoke of Christ if his love of
[287.6s] amusements and strivings for the Mastery
[290.3s] absorb his power or ability then God is
[293.4s] not made the first and best and last in
[297.2s] everything and Satan comes act his part
[300.8s] in playing the game of the life life of
[303.3s] his soul he can play much more honestly
[307.0s] than they can play and make deepl plots
[310.2s] for the ruin of the the devil has been a
[313.6s] master of this game that he's been
[315.2s] playing with our lives for years and he
[317.5s] studied almost every kind of character
[320.0s] in fact sometimes he sees us and he's
[321.6s] saying I have seen that before I just
[324.2s] know how this revival can be killed as
[327.0s] soon as it comes because he also knows
[329.5s] that he has no power to resist the
[331.4s] spirit of God so he normally comes to
[334.0s] take away this thing now sadly for
[337.0s] Battle Creek it was the love of games
[340.0s] amusements sports that was brought about
[343.1s] to take away the work of Revival so
[345.6s] there had been a great Revival at Battle
[347.4s] Creek at that time but now when people
[350.2s] started with the many sports that are
[352.5s] there even boxing came up I don't know
[355.0s] if it was the ball games that was there
[357.0s] at that time you find that they were
[359.2s] discussing ing which match is being
[360.9s] played maybe even on Sabbath I think
[363.3s] yeah and even during the week instead of
[365.7s] planning the Evangelistic efforts
[368.0s] they're talking about which team beat
[369.8s] which one and I can imagine this the
[372.2s] same thing that happened to the
[373.4s] disciples when they were talking about
[375.4s] who is the greatest greatest and that
[377.6s] time Christ is telling them in a few
[379.3s] days I'm going to be crucified and when
[382.2s] he came find that even the disciples
[385.2s] couldn't believe what happened then is
[387.8s] when they went to read what was written
[390.6s] in the prophecy so that's one of the
[393.0s] easiest way to lose the blessing so the
[395.8s] devil can bring various things and
[397.9s] sports I know is one of the things that
[399.6s] captivates people in the world today
[401.7s] even in the church we have sports that
[404.2s] take away the place and time when we
[406.4s] should have been studying and making
[408.7s] plans so the church illuminates the
[411.8s] world not by their profession of
[414.8s] godliness but by their manifestations of
[417.8s] the transforming and sting find power of
[421.2s] the truth of the life and
[424.1s] character the best way for us to be a
[426.9s] light to others is by them seeing the
[429.4s] light in us not by us going to preach
[432.4s] and minister to them the better sermone
[435.2s] that we can preach is by the way we live
[438.4s] our lives so we have this danger that
[442.5s] the light can actually become Darkness
[445.7s] if we don't cherish cherish so it's
[448.7s] important for us us to actually
[451.2s] understand some of these things now
[453.4s] another thing that is spoken of in this
[456.0s] chapter is to actually determine if we
[459.2s] cherish blessings from God when I think
[463.0s] about it I think God has blessed us
[465.8s] immensely with so many things but the
[468.6s] question is do we cherish these
[471.2s] blessings from God and maybe I may ask
[475.3s] what are some blessings which you think
[477.1s] you should cherish more than you
[480.1s] actually value I have a couple I'm
[483.2s] thinking of in my life right now but
[485.8s] maybe if I may ask Steve any of the top
[488.6s] of your heads that comes to you is there
[491.2s] something that God has given you which
[493.5s] you think you should cherish more than
[495.2s] you
[498.9s] actually I to me I think it's it's
[501.5s] everything God has given me because you
[503.8s] see when God is giving you you is those
[507.8s] blessings they come can I say in
[510.0s] isolation it's you God speaking to you
[512.9s] personally and you know the danger of
[517.6s] taking it for granted is very high
[519.7s] because maybe in your assumption you
[522.1s] think that everybody has these things
[524.5s] and it's normal for me to have these
[527.2s] things but you realize that uh when you
[530.9s] start moving around and interacting with
[533.2s] Brethren you realize that there are some
[535.3s] challenges that people are facing in
[537.0s] life and only then is when you realiz
[539.8s] like oh God uh please forgive me for I
[543.2s] have not
[544.2s] been uh I've not shown you gratitude for
[547.8s] the gifts that you have given me
[549.4s] especially just the gift of life that we
[551.6s] are here we are we are sitting here we
[553.5s] are reviewing this book there somebody
[556.2s] out there watching this uh this uh
[559.3s] podcast and he's just wishing that you
[561.7s] could have that energy just to sit and
[564.4s] discuss the word of God all his prayers
[567.6s] maybe it's just for God to visit him
[570.2s] because he's sick so God forgive us for
[574.3s] we have not been grateful for what the
[577.1s] blessing that you have distored upon us
[579.1s] yes amen amen amen I I I think you you
[584.6s] again we cannot overemphasize uh the
[586.9s] blessings of God in our
[588.8s] lives we we the the songwriter says
[592.4s] count your blessings one by one and you
[595.5s] know you cannot it it will actually
[598.4s] surprise you that will go on and on and
[601.0s] on and on our lives as Christians are
[603.9s] full of blessings amen yeah and just by
[606.4s] the mere fact that we are here you know
[608.3s] we could throw that away and say we
[610.1s] struggle to wake up in the morning but
[612.7s] even that struggling to wake up in the
[614.2s] morning as brother opata says there's
[615.8s] someone who was not able to wake up or
[617.8s] lift their head or hand or leg so I
[620.1s] think they immense blessings the
[621.9s] blessing of of of uh you know just the
[624.4s] gift of
[625.5s] Salvation you know the immens the the
[628.0s] blessing of having uh uh Witnesses
[631.3s] having um Elders having brothers who we
[634.1s] we can look um up to you know we we have
[638.4s] Moses we have Abraham so when we are we
[641.5s] are burdened with with troubles uh in
[644.2s] our walk of Faith then we have people
[646.5s] who we can look up to who walked this
[649.3s] life so I think there are several
[650.9s] blessings that we can we can get or we
[653.2s] can count from the Lord yes amen amen
[657.6s] Battle Creek had all the blessings that
[660.4s] God had actually bestowed on them but
[664.2s] they didn't make light and use of this
[667.1s] blessing unfortunately the institution
[670.1s] burn down I believe in the 1900s as a
[673.3s] result of the judgments of God in
[675.5s] relation to this so we actually find
[678.1s] that they did not cherish the blessings
[681.3s] that God had given them statement here
[684.4s] says the blessing was given you that it
[687.5s] might produce fruit in sound practices
[690.9s] and upright character so sometimes the
[694.4s] blessings that God has given us are
[697.4s] turned into cures and that's why
[700.6s] multiple times we're cautioned that be
[704.0s] careful when you revived be careful when
[707.3s] you receive light because it's possible
[710.6s] that this blessing might turn into a cur
[712.7s] into a c and I think about the blessings
[714.9s] we have even when you're given money you
[717.5s] might start now using it in a way that
[720.0s] you never used it before because God has
[722.7s] blessed you with this money if you have
[726.1s] children you might not be raising them
[728.9s] up in the right way God has said this is
[731.2s] what you need to do but you're doing the
[733.2s] other thing so that's how God would like
[736.8s] us to be careful about and of course
[739.1s] Christ also reminds us that if we do not
[741.5s] make use of our talents M um they will
[744.3s] be taken away so I mean that is very
[747.3s] right if your blessings could eily very
[750.3s] easily turn into a curse and it will be
[752.4s] your own doing yeah yeah
[755.5s] amen yeah the blessing turned into a
[758.4s] curse is one of the most dangerous
[760.6s] things yeah so we pray that God may help
[764.2s] us in this and lastly there's one more
[766.6s] thing which is the sin of rejecting
[770.6s] evidence when God has poured out his
[774.0s] Spirit Upon Us taught us all we need to
[777.4s] do about Revival sometimes I've met with
[781.1s] couple of people who say the Bible says
[784.2s] this and I know I need to do this but I
[788.8s] don't feel like I'm ready to do it or
[793.2s] I'll do it at a later time and in our
[796.4s] previous episode we talked about the
[798.2s] time we need to do something is now
[800.4s] actually the past episode right it's
[802.8s] still a fight that we need to keep on
[805.5s] fighting if you're given evidence then
[808.5s] we need to to obey and if we don't have
[811.4s] strength remember the works we do are
