FULL TRANSCRIPT:
uh today is a very special day for each one of us 
we have spoken and the Lord has heard we have H   A Very Special Sabbath again the Golden Angels 
out the Golden Age I want to invite you to the   scripture I try to read several scriptures in the 
Bible and I realize the Bible is so rich when he's   talking about the people who have reached the age 
of 65 I'm not far away from that age I am catching   up with them but as I reach that age they will be 
going to another level of the age I read several   verses but allow me to read two and then I will 
give a summary of my summary today because the   Lord has prepared our hearts to This Job chapter 
32 vers 5 through 7 the Bible is very clear now   that's verse 4 I will read from verse 4 5 and 6 
and then job 12:12 now because they were years   older than e Helu had waited to speak to job when 
elu saw there was no answer in the mouth of these   three men his wrath was aroused so hello the son 
of betel the bites answered and said I am young in   years and you are very old therefore therefore 
I was afraid and dared not declare my opinion   to you I said AG should speak age should speak 
and multitude of ears should teach wisdom job 12:   12 just to mention a few I have many of them and I 
know when you go back to your Bible as the lawyers   tell judges when you retire to make your judgment 
you can do this I want you when you retire   home you can read the Bible to get much of this 
information in the Bible job 12: 12 wisdom is with   aged men and with length of days understanding 
my title this morning is entitled the wisdom of   age reading those that's what I thought I could 
say I want to thank God Lord for this church to   consider the senior citizen if I have to speak it 
in another way the senior citizen and you can see   the banner here speaking louder I want to thank 
the pastors of the church to recognize that they   cannot do much work without having the men and 
women who are passed through this age as I was   reading through some statement from inp IR pen 
of inspiration I found this statement penned in   1890 which says thus if the testimonies were not 
written people will come and they will believe   in fallacies and theories thinking that is the 
truth I know majority of our members here may   not know the history of this church that's why we 
are talking about the Faith of Our Fathers the men   who laid the foundation of the church here if 
I ask you to raise your hands possibly might   be one or two but I don't want to embarrass anyone 
because they may not be there others have come and   found the church constructed as it is and they 
think that is the story they have the story of   this church the heritage of this church is so long 
and I want to thank the Lord for all those angels   who are here I want also to thank the Lord even 
the the young one who are here with us today with   their presence now combining together the old and 
the young working for the Lord together the name   of God is glorified Hallelujah now when you read 
about this text they reminds you that the age is   very important as We Worship the Lord this morning 
God himself embedment of his wisdom is found in   the scripture even when you read through the Bible 
I want to tell you that there are three types of   wisdom that we can get now in the entire scripture 
if we want to summarize the Bible in those three   ways of wisdom number one there is what we call 
human wisdom human wisdom is acquired through   reading books and going to school and all of us 
we have gone to school and we have gained human   wisdom and in the woman human wisdom then there 
is an experience and observation those who have   gone ahead of time and I want to love the lawyers 
how they express themselves I love looking at what   they say sometimes when the juniors are talking 
to the seniors they joke around with them and   they tell them before we went to school I knew 
I was practicing law and they call them the most   landed people and they addressed each us as the 
Learned friends they are the Learned friends as   far as the law is concerned but do you know that 
also in the Old Testament all the lawyers of the   time were great theologians so I'm calling upon 
the lawyers in the room you may con going back   to school and understand theology so that you can 
consider the two aspect of Theology and law and   I'm considering possibly when I retire maybe to 
do law on my own benefit the Bible is very clear   in the human wisdom and observation this is 
the first wisdom that we as human being get and   it's not BN in itself but this wisdom is called 
human wisdom if not properly utilized people find   themsel PR pring themselves in the knowledge and 
what they have acquired over many years because   they think they are smarter or they are smart in 
the way they do things and they believe they can   do without looking at the second one then the 
second wisdom is very dangerous and I want to   bring the second wisdom here is called demonic 
wisdom is also found in the scripture and this   demonic wisdom is where people have forgotten 
the dichotomy because the dichotomy of human   wisdom and godly wisdom when they miss these 
two aspect of human wisdom and godly wisdom   then the wisdom they have attained become demonic 
at this point is where science comes and questions   the existence of God and they want to ask whether 
God exists in this understanding is where people   comes and challenge the existence and how God 
created human being and designed human being to   be God designed human being to be man and woman 
period but now by this new new Angels they want   to challenge the existence of God they want to 
challenge what God and put in place the beginning   of creation of human being we are fighting with 
the principalities of Darkness we don't see them   but they are behind our roofs they are behind 
the places where we worship they are behind   our places where we stay and during this time is 
where spiritual wickedness takes over spiritually   spiritualism take over the spiritual aspect of 
what God want to do with his people and I want   to thank God because as a church this is where 
we are saying we want to emphasize on what we   call Godly wisdom because the men who have served 
the church in many years they have served in Godly   wisdom and the Lord has been with them and it 
is found also in the Bible particularly James 3:   16-1 17 first Corinthians chapter 2 through 
verse4 and this spirituality is where we have   the discernment of the human H knowledge and godly 
human Godly knowledge put them together and these   two wisdom put together now explain the reality of 
human existence wisdom must speak allow me now to   tell you how wisdom is speaking let's go back to 
Job chapter 32 when you come to Job chapter 32 my   dear friends you'll realize there are three men 
friends of job one of them is called elipas the   second one is called band and the third one is 
called sofal these two three men comes and accus   his job that he was righteous in his own eyes you 
know the generation today that we have they say   we don't understand old people in our own houses 
our children will tell come and tells you D you   don't understand then you wonder at what time they 
started understanding better than yourself they   come and tell you you old generation you are 
not embraced the technology before they were   born technology was there but now because they 
have the it ideas they think that now the old   generation have no idea of what technology is all 
about but I want to remind you that even in the   Old Testament before the genc and their allas and 
the rest were born technology was there it's only   that we don't read the Bible to appreciate but 
now they comes and he speaks and here a gentleman   comes he makes an observation he's not talking is 
called Helu and he want to hear how they are going   to challenge job and they have spoken and then he 
says listening to you you have nothing to offer   to job because you're not challenging his faith 
you're not challenging his faith therefore allow   me now to talk and now he comes in and this is 
what he is trying to do number one he contradict   the three friends of job and after contradicting 
themselves now he comes and brags around and say   yes I am younger than you in age and he says to 
job I am also younger than you and you are too   old my friend but may I tell you but may I remind 
you also job you have a problem now what was the   problem of job according to helb seven signs that 
we see with helb here in chapter 32 that reminds   us what was his problem as he challenged his 
job number one he he comes and he says in verse   6 this is what he says so hel the son of barel the 
buite answered and said I am young in ears and you   are a very H therefore I was afraid and dare not 
declare my opinion to you I said Ang should speak   and multitude of ears should teach wisdom I want 
to help you today elders and pastors if you could   given this room today that we could just have 
stories to hear about What the Lord Has Done by   the age of the men and women in the congregation 
I think we could be more blessed than listening   to one speaker like myself because they have Rich 
knowledge of What the Lord Has Done to them but   the problem with this man called helb he comes 
and number one he want to challenge job and he   says job you declare yourself as a blameless man 
before the Lord but I want to tell you that is   blasphemy that's what he is telling job that is 
blasphemy job for thinking you have God in your   life number two he tells job you have eared your 
integrity for many years and I want to remind you   that that is nothing because number one if I 
look at what you are you are because you don't   understand who God is but job reminds this man 
in chapter 275 and he tells I will we what you   are saying in the accurate of the weight and 
then I will maintain my Integrity you know the   men and women who have stayed in this church for 
many years they have maintained their integrity   they have seen their children they have seen their 
grandchildren they have seen many Pastors in this   church and by the way if I ask you this question 
how many of you knows the first pastor of this   Church majority of you will not know and I will 
not embarrass you to ask you raise up your hand   some of you if I ask you the current pastors 
of the church how many of them you say they   are three what are their names okay one is 
called okay the second one is okay I've seen   many people come to my office they want to get 
letters of recommendation and they say I'm a a   member of Central Church in good regular standing 
or another church in Nairobi and ask them who is   your first Elder M by the way I went to 
church last year this year I've not been   active going to the church all right no 
problem but who is your current Church Pastor it is Pastor KH okay okay pastor car okay 
okay okay that's nice I tell them that Pastor KH   left that church almost four years ago who is the 
current Pastor okay pastor I may not be aware but   you understand me okay yeah of course course I 
will understand you but do you think I will give   you my recommendation because even you don't know 
your pastor that tells me possibly you not been   going to that congregation to worship Helu again 
comes and tells job and he comes to job and he   proclaims that he is also a man of age and he 
want to tell job now speaking go a job I want   to hear and now allow me to take you to this part 
that um majority of us in the church today are 50   years below now I can ask you raise up your hand 
now those who are 50 years below raise up your   hand raise up your hand don't fear I know you are 
many but you don't I can see from your faces you   don't want to raise your hand but you are more 
than the Golden Angels now the Golden Angels if   you look at them here now there are very few and 
I want to tell you the young men and women who   God has called us here to use the knowledge that 
the old men and women have so that when we have   that knowledge in ourselves we are going to learn 
something the more you sit at the feet of the old   men you learn wisdom the more you sit and the feet 
of old women you learn wisdom and now I believe   when you choose this one it is more about serving 
the lord today but it is serving the lord the days   of your life until you go to the Grave therefore 
there is no age where you can stand and say I am   old enough now not to serve the Lord every age is 
for your opportunity to serve the Lord hallelujah   allow me to ask you now how many of you are 84 
years and above raise up your hand if you are here   I know if they are there they are less than five 
in this congregation if you are four years and   above raise up your hand please check around and 
help me if there is one I don't see any hand hope   they are not not fearing to raise up their hand H 
anyone there is one there what do you say members   now may I take you to the Bible and appreciate 
can you we in church I could have asked you to   clap for them but I don't want to be accused can 
you say a big amen for them want to appreciate   you now go to the Bible Luke Chapter 2 about the 
men and women who are of age what the Bible says   in joy in Luke 2: 36 through H vers is 38 when I 
was reading this story it encouraged me to know   that when we serve the Lord the Lord will be with 
us the Lord will bless us the Lord will bless our   ministry the Lord will bless our children the Lord 
will bless the church and the Lord will bless the   nation Hallelujah chapter 2 vers 36 in the Book 
of Luke Chapter 2 The Gospel of Luke chapter 2:   36 let's read together now there was one Anna a 
prophetes the daughter of penel of the tribe of   Asha the she was of great age I want you to 
get that she was of great age wow great age   and had Le with her husband 70 years from a 
virginity and this woman was a window and a   about 84 years who did not depart from the 
temple but served god with fasting and prayers   and preaching the gospel the word of God verse 
39 and coming in that instant she gave thanks to   the Lord and spoke of him who of of of him to all 
those who looked for the Redemption of Jerusalem   Hallelujah you see the people who have served 
the Church of AG the the Bible is testifying of   their goodness number one she was married and 
when she was married the husband died while   they had stayed in marriage for seven years 
I believe they are not being even completed   giving birth to their children and also begin 
new life and those who are married for S years   I know you have many challenges in your homes but 
that's not the the sermon for today but this lady   after the husband died did she go to look for 
another man the Bible tells he silent number   two did she stop serving the lord the answer is 
no did she remain faithful to the Lord the answer   is yes how do we know three things number one she 
fasted day and night as she walked number two she   was praying and the Lord blessed her and in that 
she was praying to see Jesus Christ and she said   now I have seen the Savior I can rest Hallelujah 
men of God and women praise be to God I am praying   for those who have reached that age keep serving 
the lord if the church gives an opportunity to   serve serve if you don't have the opportunity to 
serve give wisdom to the young people that's why   the Bible says let wisdom speak and the wisdom is 
here in this congregation hallelujah praise the   Lord now allow me to take you somewhere else in 
the Bible and appreciate the structure and how the   Bible is putting itself now Paul speaking in the 
New Testament let's go to Paul and hear what Paul   talks about the people who are in this age called 
the Golden Age and I'm calling them the senior   citizens please open your Bibles with with me in 
Titus please go to your Bibles and open and read   with me and hear what Paul is saying in Titus so 
that you can appreciate what the Lord has prepared   for each one of us before we come back to the Old 
Testament again and listen to what the Bible is   telling us before I take you to the the the other 
part of the Bible now go to Titus Chapter 2 Titus   chap 2 vers 1 and 2 but as for you speak the 
things which are proper for sound doctrine that   the older men oh man underline that that older 
men be sober reverent temperament H temperate   sound in faith in love in patience the only women 
likewise that they be reverent in Behavior not   slanderers not given to much wine teachers of good 
things shall they admonish the young women now get   this they should admonish the young women to love 
their husband I stop there before even I proceed   the young men the young women have forgotten 
to love their husband I'm not the one saying   now the old women are being told to teach the 
young women on how to do what to love their WIS   you know those who have married the other day 
they think marriage is to tell you I love you   eating with one spoon and one plate going to sleep 
the same time I want to tell you that is not what   marriage is all about marriage is more than that 
it is where you experience life where you differ   you Agree to Agree and if you don't differ to 
agree you'll always keep crying I want to tell   you to stop cry and grow the old women are told 
to do what to teach the young women on how to love   their what their husband because most of the time 
they will say you don't love me you want to follow   their phone who was calling you but the old women 
will not waste time scoss scrolling the number of   the husband to know how many women have called you 
on this day they will not Wonder because they have   grown over those things and they know what life 
is all about is about to develop ourself in the   path of Christianity as we walk the journey with 
Jesus Christ Hallelujah then the Bible says again   I continue then that the word of God may not be 
what blasphemed then verse six likewise exalt the   young men men they thought they are free exalt the 
young men to be sober minded allow me to digress   a minute and say that today many women today they 
don't want children but want they want the company   of a man when they want children they part ways 
and the men who are here today majority of them   they don't want to marry because they think 
marriage you become you you be you have the   responsibility to carry I want to tell you men 
you are here today if you fear to marry then   you have a problem you need to marry and 
ask someone to help you to use your money properly yeah to use your money properly because 
if you don't have someone you will keep on calling   you spend 100,000 calls and some of those calls 
doesn't make sense you just calling a friend oh   I thought of just calling you to tell you how 
are you and you keep calling and calling but   when you marry that money will go to other other 
issues of family Hallelujah I'm talking to young   people young people you need to be sober when 
your when your wife does not understand you   should understand H you guys are not listening 
to me now if they don't understand you should   do what understand that's why the Bible says that 
you should be what sober and who will do this the   Golden Angels they should bring us together have 
seminars in their church every time talk to us and   tell us come we teach you how we have grown over 
the years how we have been bringing up children   so that when children cough at night you don't 
start running to look for a doctor and calling the   doctor because of a cough we will tell you wait 
the morning will be there she will be fine just   give her something and she will be fine this night 
then tomorrow you can go to the doctor because   they have grown with these things they have seen 
children grow they have seen challenges in their   family so these are not a big things now the Bible 
says here now likewise that is verse six likewise   exalt the young men to be sober minded in all 
things showing yourself to be a pattern of Good   Works in Doctrine showing Integrity reverence 
and so forth my dear friends the Golden Angels   we are looking upon you to provide kindness to 
us as young people we are looking upon you in   leadership to help us on how to serve the Lord 
in the leadership you know I can be a pastor and   when I come I may not know some of the leadership 
concept and because you have been there enough you   will help me to grow in my leadership without 
challenging me and I want to thank the church   because you have really grown even the pastors 
who have passed through this place when they live   this place they are better than before they came 
to this church that's something we need to thank   God for men and women who are here may the Lord 
bless you may the Lord give you long days to live   and to see even the grand grand grandchildren of 
your grandchildren hallelujah praise the Lord now   this what the Bible says and because the Bible 
is very clear allow me again to take you back to   the Bible to for you to appreciate when the Bible 
says let the wisdom speaks the Bible is trying to   tell us when we ask the Bible to speak two things 
must happen the Bible defines hold Christians or   senior citizen or Golden Angels first to help 
and train the young people in all aspect of   life it is your responsibilities the old agel 
the golden angel to help us on how to begin our   families it is your responsibility to help us 
young people on how to stay with the opposite   sex who is in my house it is your responsibilities 
to help us on how to bring our children up because   we don't know and since you have that knowledge 
let wisdom now speak speak not only to the church   but also in our families at home Hallelujah 
number two the Bible tells us the other area   is you Golden Angels you you are the conduit of 
passing God's message to us to help us when we are   too fast you tell us Slow Down slow down my dear 
you know during the weddings I can hear the kissy   Community they say slow down my dear yeah don't 
run too fast I don't know whether you have had   it during weddings slow down my what my dear go 
enh us help us to slow down I can be a pastor but   I'm ahead of everyone slow me down and know that 
I need to work with everyone I need to work with   the old I need to work with the young and that is 
what job and this is what Jacob did when he went   to to to to meet his brother he said now let's 
walk slowly because we have we have children who   have been born we need to walk slowly with every 
one of us so because you have been there help us   to come slowly that we are not coming too fast and 
we may come too fast because we don't understand   and when we slow us we should also appreciate 
I my pastors who in this congregation will bear   with me I'm not very old but at least I've clocked 
here 50 years plus so I'm not too young also uh   I'm I'm in there I look young but not very the 
scripture acknowledges the value and importance   of teaching the young people the word of God that 
we need that encouragement we need to be equipped   for the Next Generation that is here thank you 
when you see the children trying to explain to us   this journey how the Lord can bless our children 
we need to support them as we have done before but   now we need to double our effort we need to double 
our effort because the young people are looking   towards the old men and the old women to give them 
direction of life and when you give them direction   of Life they will never part from that path yeah 
and you young people when the old people comes   and tells you the direction to live don't think 
they are against you you know sometimes if I ask   you today here when you are growing up some of us 
we never loved our mothers because they were good   disciplinarians but today you stand and say oh I 
thank my mother if it is not because of my mother   I should not be here today Pastor TR I pray that 
if today you prepared a cake that we could eat the   cake celebrating the old ages but I know there is 
no cake that one I know there is no cake we could   have eaten here in the church to celebrate the 
olden age Hallelujah but I believe next time we   will have one hallelujah praise the Lord now the 
Bible is very clear when he talks about this kind   of age it says the third thing that you need to 
do is that you help us to pattern our life because   God is faithful Psalm 71:8 says even when I am 
owned and G I will never forsake or you will never   forsake me oh God until I declare your power to 
the Next Generation that's the part I want you to   understand until I will declare your power to the 
Next Generation so the Golden Angels don't sleep   until you are passed over all the messages all 
the heritage of the church to the Young Generation   so that they will never make a mistake when they 
are making decisions to marry Hallelujah marriage   truth nobody tells you you need to tell them and 
allow me to tell you something about this one what   goes with age because even I am old enough I can 
tell them and this is what nobody will never tell   you assume today you are 40 years I said Psalm 
71:8 it says even when I am old and gray do not   forsake me this the Lord David is speaking oh God 
until I declare your power to the Next Generation   your Mighty to all who are to come now allow me 
to tell the young people in this room and don't   be offended assume you are 40 years old and you 
have never thought of marrying someone you are 40   years and you are still growing and by next year 
2025 is when you have identified your SP your fan   and with your fan you spend 3 years at that time 
you will be old 43 after 3 years is now when you   marry and you say after marrying I want to enjoy 
my marriage for 5 years I don't need a child   you'll be how old you guys talk to me you will 
be how old 48 and then you have your first child   and after your first child you take the first 
child to school after 3 years you'll be how old   51 and the Bible says when you reach 50 years you 
should retire so you retire before you take your   children to school but because we live in this 
world assume you have been given 70 years to work   assume you have been given 7 years that's okay 
those seven years you have been given now to serve   now when your child is in grade one grade two 
grade three grade four grade8 grade n you'll be   as only child now you reach the age of retirement 
because before even you begin settling down and   when you retire you don't know whether now to eat 
your pension to educate your children or to enjoy   your life anyway allow me to stop there because 
I can keep talking and talking and talking now to   summarize look at calb look at calb in the Bible 
you can read the Bible but calb was 85 years but   God Moses used him when he was 45 what he was 40 
years but at the age of 45 85 years is when he is   working like someone who is 4 years you know in 
this world they tell us when you reach the the   40th birthday life has begun for if you have 
reached 40 years I want you to calculate your   age from the 70 years down the lane because the 
Bible says if you live longer you will live for   70 years before you die now start calculating from 
70 going down this way so don't think you have   more time to waste and for those who are here 65 
years and above thank God but I want to tell you   again those who have reached 65 years and above 
there is back there is handic there is pressure   all sorts of problems but we want to pray for 
them that the Lord may give them strength that   as they serve the Lord they will serve the 
Lord happier as they used to serve when they   were young people praise the Lord that's 
why the Bible speaks in Leviticus 19:32   allow me to go to Leviticus 1932 and in the 
afternoon when we get time we can talk more   about this one now because the Lord is in the 
business of blessing his children Leviticus 19:   32 that's my last verse this morning that we 
may appreciate what the Lord has prepared for   that for us this day H 32 1932 says you shall ER 
you shall rise before the gay handed and honor   the presence of an old man and fear you are God I 
am the Lord you didn't hear this you didn't hear   this church have you heard maybe you can read 
together with me loud all of you read if you can now stop there at the old man you shall 
rise before the great endend and honor the   presence of a old man when a old man is around 
even today in our generation even when you are   sitting in the in in a bus and a whole person 
comes on born the Young Generation may not give   them space you see they came late even in the 
church if the pews are a fool you may not give   them a place to sit because you think that 
is your right but the Bible says the moment   the old person has come stand give them space Let 
Them Sit because it's their time and your time   will come they will also give you that opportunity 
when you are old enough you guys are not listening   to me respect the old generation Hallelujah this 
what the Bible says the old generation are not the   people because they can curse and the moment they 
says I will curse you you know their curse cannot   be reversed a young person can curse you but that 
can be reversed now then the Bible says after   you have given that then you should also fear the 
lord and when you fear the lord what will happen   the blessings of the old man will be will come to 
you when you grow old you'll also be given that   privilege that opportunity to serve the Lord at 
that moment don't compete with the old generation   but complement them in their services the old 
generation help the young people to serve the   Lord better and bring them closer as you have 
done in the church I am very proud of the church   because now even the young people have come to 
express who they are before the Lord and teing   us together the name of God is glorified praise 
the Lord there is nothing else we can do but to   respect the old men not only in the church even 
in the village you know if you don't do it right   now even for you you'll be forgotten Now do for 
them the good things today so that when they   grow hold as I conclude in my Village the young 
men went and slaugh and amb and they decided to   give the men the end and the hoops and they took 
the stick to themselves when they grow old they   realize they are getting the head and the hes 
they change they said let change the rule they   were told the rule was established by yourself 
now enjoy what we used to enjoy at that other   time ladies and Gentlemen let's remember the Lord 
is with us and may the Lord bless you let's pray   let's stand as we pray our father and our God 
in heaven what a privilege you have given us   to serve you in this church we want to pray for 
the own angels in our church that you may bless   them we want to pray for our young people that 
Lord you may bless them that when Jesus comes   none of us will be left but we will inherit 
the Kingdom of Heaven bless us Lord not only   today but the days of our life in Jesus 
name we pray amen may the Lord bless you 

==================================================

TIMESTAMPED TRANSCRIPT:
[0.2s] uh today is a very special day for each one of us 
we have spoken and the Lord has heard we have H  
[12.0s] A Very Special Sabbath again the Golden Angels 
out the Golden Age I want to invite you to the  
[21.6s] scripture I try to read several scriptures in the 
Bible and I realize the Bible is so rich when he's  
[29.6s] talking about the people who have reached the age 
of 65 I'm not far away from that age I am catching  
[36.8s] up with them but as I reach that age they will be 
going to another level of the age I read several  
[45.2s] verses but allow me to read two and then I will 
give a summary of my summary today because the  
[51.4s] Lord has prepared our hearts to This Job chapter 
32 vers 5 through 7 the Bible is very clear now  
[64.9s] that's verse 4 I will read from verse 4 5 and 6 
and then job 12:12 now because they were years  
[75.4s] older than e Helu had waited to speak to job when 
elu saw there was no answer in the mouth of these  
[90.1s] three men his wrath was aroused so hello the son 
of betel the bites answered and said I am young in  
[106.5s] years and you are very old therefore therefore 
I was afraid and dared not declare my opinion  
[120.3s] to you I said AG should speak age should speak 
and multitude of ears should teach wisdom job 12:  
[140.6s] 12 just to mention a few I have many of them and I 
know when you go back to your Bible as the lawyers  
[148.1s] tell judges when you retire to make your judgment 
you can do this I want you when you retire  
[152.7s] home you can read the Bible to get much of this 
information in the Bible job 12: 12 wisdom is with  
[162.5s] aged men and with length of days understanding 
my title this morning is entitled the wisdom of  
[174.1s] age reading those that's what I thought I could 
say I want to thank God Lord for this church to  
[182.1s] consider the senior citizen if I have to speak it 
in another way the senior citizen and you can see  
[190.6s] the banner here speaking louder I want to thank 
the pastors of the church to recognize that they  
[197.4s] cannot do much work without having the men and 
women who are passed through this age as I was  
[205.9s] reading through some statement from inp IR pen 
of inspiration I found this statement penned in  
[215.3s] 1890 which says thus if the testimonies were not 
written people will come and they will believe  
[224.5s] in fallacies and theories thinking that is the 
truth I know majority of our members here may  
[233.0s] not know the history of this church that's why we 
are talking about the Faith of Our Fathers the men  
[240.0s] who laid the foundation of the church here if 
I ask you to raise your hands possibly might  
[246.6s] be one or two but I don't want to embarrass anyone 
because they may not be there others have come and  
[254.6s] found the church constructed as it is and they 
think that is the story they have the story of  
[260.9s] this church the heritage of this church is so long 
and I want to thank the Lord for all those angels  
[267.0s] who are here I want also to thank the Lord even 
the the young one who are here with us today with  
[272.8s] their presence now combining together the old and 
the young working for the Lord together the name  
[280.4s] of God is glorified Hallelujah now when you read 
about this text they reminds you that the age is  
[288.3s] very important as We Worship the Lord this morning 
God himself embedment of his wisdom is found in  
[296.1s] the scripture even when you read through the Bible 
I want to tell you that there are three types of  
[301.8s] wisdom that we can get now in the entire scripture 
if we want to summarize the Bible in those three  
[307.5s] ways of wisdom number one there is what we call 
human wisdom human wisdom is acquired through  
[315.3s] reading books and going to school and all of us 
we have gone to school and we have gained human  
[322.8s] wisdom and in the woman human wisdom then there 
is an experience and observation those who have  
[331.7s] gone ahead of time and I want to love the lawyers 
how they express themselves I love looking at what  
[340.4s] they say sometimes when the juniors are talking 
to the seniors they joke around with them and  
[345.6s] they tell them before we went to school I knew 
I was practicing law and they call them the most  
[351.7s] landed people and they addressed each us as the 
Learned friends they are the Learned friends as  
[358.1s] far as the law is concerned but do you know that 
also in the Old Testament all the lawyers of the  
[366.0s] time were great theologians so I'm calling upon 
the lawyers in the room you may con going back  
[372.9s] to school and understand theology so that you can 
consider the two aspect of Theology and law and  
[380.7s] I'm considering possibly when I retire maybe to 
do law on my own benefit the Bible is very clear  
[389.9s] in the human wisdom and observation this is 
the first wisdom that we as human being get and  
[396.9s] it's not BN in itself but this wisdom is called 
human wisdom if not properly utilized people find  
[406.0s] themsel PR pring themselves in the knowledge and 
what they have acquired over many years because  
[413.6s] they think they are smarter or they are smart in 
the way they do things and they believe they can  
[418.7s] do without looking at the second one then the 
second wisdom is very dangerous and I want to  
[424.8s] bring the second wisdom here is called demonic 
wisdom is also found in the scripture and this  
[432.6s] demonic wisdom is where people have forgotten 
the dichotomy because the dichotomy of human  
[442.2s] wisdom and godly wisdom when they miss these 
two aspect of human wisdom and godly wisdom  
[450.0s] then the wisdom they have attained become demonic 
at this point is where science comes and questions  
[457.5s] the existence of God and they want to ask whether 
God exists in this understanding is where people  
[464.3s] comes and challenge the existence and how God 
created human being and designed human being to  
[470.3s] be God designed human being to be man and woman 
period but now by this new new Angels they want  
[481.6s] to challenge the existence of God they want to 
challenge what God and put in place the beginning  
[487.8s] of creation of human being we are fighting with 
the principalities of Darkness we don't see them  
[494.4s] but they are behind our roofs they are behind 
the places where we worship they are behind  
[501.3s] our places where we stay and during this time is 
where spiritual wickedness takes over spiritually  
[509.5s] spiritualism take over the spiritual aspect of 
what God want to do with his people and I want  
[515.4s] to thank God because as a church this is where 
we are saying we want to emphasize on what we  
[521.5s] call Godly wisdom because the men who have served 
the church in many years they have served in Godly  
[530.0s] wisdom and the Lord has been with them and it 
is found also in the Bible particularly James 3:  
[537.5s] 16-1 17 first Corinthians chapter 2 through 
verse4 and this spirituality is where we have  
[545.5s] the discernment of the human H knowledge and godly 
human Godly knowledge put them together and these  
[556.5s] two wisdom put together now explain the reality of 
human existence wisdom must speak allow me now to  
[566.9s] tell you how wisdom is speaking let's go back to 
Job chapter 32 when you come to Job chapter 32 my  
[574.5s] dear friends you'll realize there are three men 
friends of job one of them is called elipas the  
[584.0s] second one is called band and the third one is 
called sofal these two three men comes and accus  
[593.6s] his job that he was righteous in his own eyes you 
know the generation today that we have they say  
[604.3s] we don't understand old people in our own houses 
our children will tell come and tells you D you  
[612.9s] don't understand then you wonder at what time they 
started understanding better than yourself they  
[622.6s] come and tell you you old generation you are 
not embraced the technology before they were  
[629.8s] born technology was there but now because they 
have the it ideas they think that now the old  
[637.4s] generation have no idea of what technology is all 
about but I want to remind you that even in the  
[642.5s] Old Testament before the genc and their allas and 
the rest were born technology was there it's only  
[650.6s] that we don't read the Bible to appreciate but 
now they comes and he speaks and here a gentleman  
[657.6s] comes he makes an observation he's not talking is 
called Helu and he want to hear how they are going  
[665.0s] to challenge job and they have spoken and then he 
says listening to you you have nothing to offer  
[671.6s] to job because you're not challenging his faith 
you're not challenging his faith therefore allow  
[678.2s] me now to talk and now he comes in and this is 
what he is trying to do number one he contradict  
[684.7s] the three friends of job and after contradicting 
themselves now he comes and brags around and say  
[691.1s] yes I am younger than you in age and he says to 
job I am also younger than you and you are too  
[698.3s] old my friend but may I tell you but may I remind 
you also job you have a problem now what was the  
[706.0s] problem of job according to helb seven signs that 
we see with helb here in chapter 32 that reminds  
[714.4s] us what was his problem as he challenged his 
job number one he he comes and he says in verse  
[722.1s] 6 this is what he says so hel the son of barel the 
buite answered and said I am young in ears and you  
[735.7s] are a very H therefore I was afraid and dare not 
declare my opinion to you I said Ang should speak  
[747.1s] and multitude of ears should teach wisdom I want 
to help you today elders and pastors if you could  
[756.0s] given this room today that we could just have 
stories to hear about What the Lord Has Done by  
[763.1s] the age of the men and women in the congregation 
I think we could be more blessed than listening  
[768.0s] to one speaker like myself because they have Rich 
knowledge of What the Lord Has Done to them but  
[774.8s] the problem with this man called helb he comes 
and number one he want to challenge job and he  
[781.6s] says job you declare yourself as a blameless man 
before the Lord but I want to tell you that is  
[789.0s] blasphemy that's what he is telling job that is 
blasphemy job for thinking you have God in your  
[796.1s] life number two he tells job you have eared your 
integrity for many years and I want to remind you  
[802.8s] that that is nothing because number one if I 
look at what you are you are because you don't  
[809.4s] understand who God is but job reminds this man 
in chapter 275 and he tells I will we what you  
[815.6s] are saying in the accurate of the weight and 
then I will maintain my Integrity you know the  
[822.4s] men and women who have stayed in this church for 
many years they have maintained their integrity  
[827.0s] they have seen their children they have seen their 
grandchildren they have seen many Pastors in this  
[831.7s] church and by the way if I ask you this question 
how many of you knows the first pastor of this  
[839.2s] Church majority of you will not know and I will 
not embarrass you to ask you raise up your hand  
[847.5s] some of you if I ask you the current pastors 
of the church how many of them you say they  
[851.8s] are three what are their names okay one is 
called okay the second one is okay I've seen  
[858.4s] many people come to my office they want to get 
letters of recommendation and they say I'm a a  
[863.3s] member of Central Church in good regular standing 
or another church in Nairobi and ask them who is  
[869.2s] your first Elder M by the way I went to 
church last year this year I've not been  
[876.1s] active going to the church all right no 
problem but who is your current Church
[880.1s] Pastor it is Pastor KH okay okay pastor car okay 
okay okay that's nice I tell them that Pastor KH  
[889.3s] left that church almost four years ago who is the 
current Pastor okay pastor I may not be aware but  
[896.7s] you understand me okay yeah of course course I 
will understand you but do you think I will give  
[901.3s] you my recommendation because even you don't know 
your pastor that tells me possibly you not been  
[906.1s] going to that congregation to worship Helu again 
comes and tells job and he comes to job and he  
[913.6s] proclaims that he is also a man of age and he 
want to tell job now speaking go a job I want  
[920.6s] to hear and now allow me to take you to this part 
that um majority of us in the church today are 50  
[932.0s] years below now I can ask you raise up your hand 
now those who are 50 years below raise up your  
[937.3s] hand raise up your hand don't fear I know you are 
many but you don't I can see from your faces you  
[942.2s] don't want to raise your hand but you are more 
than the Golden Angels now the Golden Angels if  
[948.6s] you look at them here now there are very few and 
I want to tell you the young men and women who  
[955.2s] God has called us here to use the knowledge that 
the old men and women have so that when we have  
[962.0s] that knowledge in ourselves we are going to learn 
something the more you sit at the feet of the old  
[968.1s] men you learn wisdom the more you sit and the feet 
of old women you learn wisdom and now I believe  
[976.0s] when you choose this one it is more about serving 
the lord today but it is serving the lord the days  
[984.5s] of your life until you go to the Grave therefore 
there is no age where you can stand and say I am  
[991.6s] old enough now not to serve the Lord every age is 
for your opportunity to serve the Lord hallelujah  
[1000.2s] allow me to ask you now how many of you are 84 
years and above raise up your hand if you are here  
[1006.4s] I know if they are there they are less than five 
in this congregation if you are four years and  
[1010.8s] above raise up your hand please check around and 
help me if there is one I don't see any hand hope  
[1018.6s] they are not not fearing to raise up their hand H 
anyone there is one there what do you say members  
[1026.6s] now may I take you to the Bible and appreciate 
can you we in church I could have asked you to  
[1032.0s] clap for them but I don't want to be accused can 
you say a big amen for them want to appreciate  
[1036.8s] you now go to the Bible Luke Chapter 2 about the 
men and women who are of age what the Bible says  
[1042.7s] in joy in Luke 2: 36 through H vers is 38 when I 
was reading this story it encouraged me to know  
[1054.8s] that when we serve the Lord the Lord will be with 
us the Lord will bless us the Lord will bless our  
[1061.6s] ministry the Lord will bless our children the Lord 
will bless the church and the Lord will bless the  
[1067.7s] nation Hallelujah chapter 2 vers 36 in the Book 
of Luke Chapter 2 The Gospel of Luke chapter 2:  
[1077.2s] 36 let's read together now there was one Anna a 
prophetes the daughter of penel of the tribe of  
[1088.2s] Asha the she was of great age I want you to 
get that she was of great age wow great age  
[1099.8s] and had Le with her husband 70 years from a 
virginity and this woman was a window and a  
[1108.9s] about 84 years who did not depart from the 
temple but served god with fasting and prayers  
[1120.9s] and preaching the gospel the word of God verse 
39 and coming in that instant she gave thanks to  
[1130.1s] the Lord and spoke of him who of of of him to all 
those who looked for the Redemption of Jerusalem  
[1139.1s] Hallelujah you see the people who have served 
the Church of AG the the Bible is testifying of  
[1145.2s] their goodness number one she was married and 
when she was married the husband died while  
[1151.7s] they had stayed in marriage for seven years 
I believe they are not being even completed  
[1156.9s] giving birth to their children and also begin 
new life and those who are married for S years  
[1162.1s] I know you have many challenges in your homes but 
that's not the the sermon for today but this lady  
[1168.8s] after the husband died did she go to look for 
another man the Bible tells he silent number  
[1177.2s] two did she stop serving the lord the answer is 
no did she remain faithful to the Lord the answer  
[1185.4s] is yes how do we know three things number one she 
fasted day and night as she walked number two she  
[1194.4s] was praying and the Lord blessed her and in that 
she was praying to see Jesus Christ and she said  
[1202.4s] now I have seen the Savior I can rest Hallelujah 
men of God and women praise be to God I am praying  
[1212.3s] for those who have reached that age keep serving 
the lord if the church gives an opportunity to  
[1217.8s] serve serve if you don't have the opportunity to 
serve give wisdom to the young people that's why  
[1224.3s] the Bible says let wisdom speak and the wisdom is 
here in this congregation hallelujah praise the  
[1233.3s] Lord now allow me to take you somewhere else in 
the Bible and appreciate the structure and how the  
[1239.8s] Bible is putting itself now Paul speaking in the 
New Testament let's go to Paul and hear what Paul  
[1247.7s] talks about the people who are in this age called 
the Golden Age and I'm calling them the senior  
[1255.8s] citizens please open your Bibles with with me in 
Titus please go to your Bibles and open and read  
[1264.9s] with me and hear what Paul is saying in Titus so 
that you can appreciate what the Lord has prepared  
[1272.9s] for each one of us before we come back to the Old 
Testament again and listen to what the Bible is  
[1279.6s] telling us before I take you to the the the other 
part of the Bible now go to Titus Chapter 2 Titus  
[1288.8s] chap 2 vers 1 and 2 but as for you speak the 
things which are proper for sound doctrine that  
[1301.0s] the older men oh man underline that that older 
men be sober reverent temperament H temperate  
[1313.6s] sound in faith in love in patience the only women 
likewise that they be reverent in Behavior not  
[1325.1s] slanderers not given to much wine teachers of good 
things shall they admonish the young women now get  
[1334.6s] this they should admonish the young women to love 
their husband I stop there before even I proceed  
[1342.4s] the young men the young women have forgotten 
to love their husband I'm not the one saying  
[1349.2s] now the old women are being told to teach the 
young women on how to do what to love their WIS  
[1355.9s] you know those who have married the other day 
they think marriage is to tell you I love you  
[1361.0s] eating with one spoon and one plate going to sleep 
the same time I want to tell you that is not what  
[1369.1s] marriage is all about marriage is more than that 
it is where you experience life where you differ  
[1377.9s] you Agree to Agree and if you don't differ to 
agree you'll always keep crying I want to tell  
[1386.0s] you to stop cry and grow the old women are told 
to do what to teach the young women on how to love  
[1394.2s] their what their husband because most of the time 
they will say you don't love me you want to follow  
[1400.4s] their phone who was calling you but the old women 
will not waste time scoss scrolling the number of  
[1407.8s] the husband to know how many women have called you 
on this day they will not Wonder because they have  
[1413.8s] grown over those things and they know what life 
is all about is about to develop ourself in the  
[1420.2s] path of Christianity as we walk the journey with 
Jesus Christ Hallelujah then the Bible says again  
[1427.3s] I continue then that the word of God may not be 
what blasphemed then verse six likewise exalt the  
[1438.0s] young men men they thought they are free exalt the 
young men to be sober minded allow me to digress  
[1447.6s] a minute and say that today many women today they 
don't want children but want they want the company  
[1454.9s] of a man when they want children they part ways 
and the men who are here today majority of them  
[1462.9s] they don't want to marry because they think 
marriage you become you you be you have the  
[1468.6s] responsibility to carry I want to tell you men 
you are here today if you fear to marry then  
[1473.6s] you have a problem you need to marry and 
ask someone to help you to use your money
[1480.4s] properly yeah to use your money properly because 
if you don't have someone you will keep on calling  
[1488.0s] you spend 100,000 calls and some of those calls 
doesn't make sense you just calling a friend oh  
[1493.8s] I thought of just calling you to tell you how 
are you and you keep calling and calling but  
[1499.2s] when you marry that money will go to other other 
issues of family Hallelujah I'm talking to young  
[1505.5s] people young people you need to be sober when 
your when your wife does not understand you  
[1510.6s] should understand H you guys are not listening 
to me now if they don't understand you should  
[1516.6s] do what understand that's why the Bible says that 
you should be what sober and who will do this the  
[1522.8s] Golden Angels they should bring us together have 
seminars in their church every time talk to us and  
[1529.4s] tell us come we teach you how we have grown over 
the years how we have been bringing up children  
[1536.6s] so that when children cough at night you don't 
start running to look for a doctor and calling the  
[1542.1s] doctor because of a cough we will tell you wait 
the morning will be there she will be fine just  
[1550.7s] give her something and she will be fine this night 
then tomorrow you can go to the doctor because  
[1556.1s] they have grown with these things they have seen 
children grow they have seen challenges in their  
[1561.2s] family so these are not a big things now the Bible 
says here now likewise that is verse six likewise  
[1568.2s] exalt the young men to be sober minded in all 
things showing yourself to be a pattern of Good  
[1578.8s] Works in Doctrine showing Integrity reverence 
and so forth my dear friends the Golden Angels  
[1588.6s] we are looking upon you to provide kindness to 
us as young people we are looking upon you in  
[1596.8s] leadership to help us on how to serve the Lord 
in the leadership you know I can be a pastor and  
[1602.5s] when I come I may not know some of the leadership 
concept and because you have been there enough you  
[1609.3s] will help me to grow in my leadership without 
challenging me and I want to thank the church  
[1614.5s] because you have really grown even the pastors 
who have passed through this place when they live  
[1618.9s] this place they are better than before they came 
to this church that's something we need to thank  
[1623.2s] God for men and women who are here may the Lord 
bless you may the Lord give you long days to live  
[1629.5s] and to see even the grand grand grandchildren of 
your grandchildren hallelujah praise the Lord now  
[1639.3s] this what the Bible says and because the Bible 
is very clear allow me again to take you back to  
[1644.4s] the Bible to for you to appreciate when the Bible 
says let the wisdom speaks the Bible is trying to  
[1651.6s] tell us when we ask the Bible to speak two things 
must happen the Bible defines hold Christians or  
[1660.3s] senior citizen or Golden Angels first to help 
and train the young people in all aspect of  
[1668.6s] life it is your responsibilities the old agel 
the golden angel to help us on how to begin our  
[1678.2s] families it is your responsibility to help us 
young people on how to stay with the opposite  
[1685.0s] sex who is in my house it is your responsibilities 
to help us on how to bring our children up because  
[1692.6s] we don't know and since you have that knowledge 
let wisdom now speak speak not only to the church  
[1699.8s] but also in our families at home Hallelujah 
number two the Bible tells us the other area  
[1705.7s] is you Golden Angels you you are the conduit of 
passing God's message to us to help us when we are  
[1713.3s] too fast you tell us Slow Down slow down my dear 
you know during the weddings I can hear the kissy  
[1720.4s] Community they say slow down my dear yeah don't 
run too fast I don't know whether you have had  
[1726.6s] it during weddings slow down my what my dear go 
enh us help us to slow down I can be a pastor but  
[1734.4s] I'm ahead of everyone slow me down and know that 
I need to work with everyone I need to work with  
[1740.1s] the old I need to work with the young and that is 
what job and this is what Jacob did when he went  
[1746.5s] to to to to meet his brother he said now let's 
walk slowly because we have we have children who  
[1753.0s] have been born we need to walk slowly with every 
one of us so because you have been there help us  
[1758.9s] to come slowly that we are not coming too fast and 
we may come too fast because we don't understand  
[1765.4s] and when we slow us we should also appreciate 
I my pastors who in this congregation will bear  
[1770.6s] with me I'm not very old but at least I've clocked 
here 50 years plus so I'm not too young also uh  
[1778.2s] I'm I'm in there I look young but not very the 
scripture acknowledges the value and importance  
[1784.5s] of teaching the young people the word of God that 
we need that encouragement we need to be equipped  
[1792.3s] for the Next Generation that is here thank you 
when you see the children trying to explain to us  
[1798.4s] this journey how the Lord can bless our children 
we need to support them as we have done before but  
[1804.9s] now we need to double our effort we need to double 
our effort because the young people are looking  
[1811.1s] towards the old men and the old women to give them 
direction of life and when you give them direction  
[1817.7s] of Life they will never part from that path yeah 
and you young people when the old people comes  
[1824.7s] and tells you the direction to live don't think 
they are against you you know sometimes if I ask  
[1831.4s] you today here when you are growing up some of us 
we never loved our mothers because they were good  
[1837.9s] disciplinarians but today you stand and say oh I 
thank my mother if it is not because of my mother  
[1844.4s] I should not be here today Pastor TR I pray that 
if today you prepared a cake that we could eat the  
[1851.4s] cake celebrating the old ages but I know there is 
no cake that one I know there is no cake we could  
[1859.1s] have eaten here in the church to celebrate the 
olden age Hallelujah but I believe next time we  
[1865.6s] will have one hallelujah praise the Lord now the 
Bible is very clear when he talks about this kind  
[1873.8s] of age it says the third thing that you need to 
do is that you help us to pattern our life because  
[1881.3s] God is faithful Psalm 71:8 says even when I am 
owned and G I will never forsake or you will never  
[1891.6s] forsake me oh God until I declare your power to 
the Next Generation that's the part I want you to  
[1898.0s] understand until I will declare your power to the 
Next Generation so the Golden Angels don't sleep  
[1906.2s] until you are passed over all the messages all 
the heritage of the church to the Young Generation  
[1913.4s] so that they will never make a mistake when they 
are making decisions to marry Hallelujah marriage  
[1920.8s] truth nobody tells you you need to tell them and 
allow me to tell you something about this one what  
[1928.4s] goes with age because even I am old enough I can 
tell them and this is what nobody will never tell  
[1934.8s] you assume today you are 40 years I said Psalm 
71:8 it says even when I am old and gray do not  
[1945.8s] forsake me this the Lord David is speaking oh God 
until I declare your power to the Next Generation  
[1954.0s] your Mighty to all who are to come now allow me 
to tell the young people in this room and don't  
[1959.7s] be offended assume you are 40 years old and you 
have never thought of marrying someone you are 40  
[1969.0s] years and you are still growing and by next year 
2025 is when you have identified your SP your fan  
[1978.3s] and with your fan you spend 3 years at that time 
you will be old 43 after 3 years is now when you  
[1987.8s] marry and you say after marrying I want to enjoy 
my marriage for 5 years I don't need a child  
[1993.2s] you'll be how old you guys talk to me you will 
be how old 48 and then you have your first child  
[2002.1s] and after your first child you take the first 
child to school after 3 years you'll be how old  
[2009.1s] 51 and the Bible says when you reach 50 years you 
should retire so you retire before you take your  
[2015.9s] children to school but because we live in this 
world assume you have been given 70 years to work  
[2023.0s] assume you have been given 7 years that's okay 
those seven years you have been given now to serve  
[2029.0s] now when your child is in grade one grade two 
grade three grade four grade8 grade n you'll be  
[2039.0s] as only child now you reach the age of retirement 
because before even you begin settling down and  
[2048.4s] when you retire you don't know whether now to eat 
your pension to educate your children or to enjoy  
[2054.0s] your life anyway allow me to stop there because 
I can keep talking and talking and talking now to  
[2061.9s] summarize look at calb look at calb in the Bible 
you can read the Bible but calb was 85 years but  
[2071.9s] God Moses used him when he was 45 what he was 40 
years but at the age of 45 85 years is when he is  
[2082.2s] working like someone who is 4 years you know in 
this world they tell us when you reach the the  
[2087.2s] 40th birthday life has begun for if you have 
reached 40 years I want you to calculate your  
[2095.2s] age from the 70 years down the lane because the 
Bible says if you live longer you will live for  
[2101.3s] 70 years before you die now start calculating from 
70 going down this way so don't think you have  
[2109.0s] more time to waste and for those who are here 65 
years and above thank God but I want to tell you  
[2117.6s] again those who have reached 65 years and above 
there is back there is handic there is pressure  
[2128.5s] all sorts of problems but we want to pray for 
them that the Lord may give them strength that  
[2135.8s] as they serve the Lord they will serve the 
Lord happier as they used to serve when they  
[2140.4s] were young people praise the Lord that's 
why the Bible speaks in Leviticus 19:32  
[2147.4s] allow me to go to Leviticus 1932 and in the 
afternoon when we get time we can talk more  
[2152.7s] about this one now because the Lord is in the 
business of blessing his children Leviticus 19:  
[2160.7s] 32 that's my last verse this morning that we 
may appreciate what the Lord has prepared for  
[2167.3s] that for us this day H 32 1932 says you shall ER 
you shall rise before the gay handed and honor  
[2184.2s] the presence of an old man and fear you are God I 
am the Lord you didn't hear this you didn't hear  
[2195.4s] this church have you heard maybe you can read 
together with me loud all of you read if you
[2203.2s] can now stop there at the old man you shall 
rise before the great endend and honor the  
[2222.5s] presence of a old man when a old man is around 
even today in our generation even when you are  
[2229.8s] sitting in the in in a bus and a whole person 
comes on born the Young Generation may not give  
[2236.2s] them space you see they came late even in the 
church if the pews are a fool you may not give  
[2243.0s] them a place to sit because you think that 
is your right but the Bible says the moment  
[2247.7s] the old person has come stand give them space Let 
Them Sit because it's their time and your time  
[2253.8s] will come they will also give you that opportunity 
when you are old enough you guys are not listening  
[2259.2s] to me respect the old generation Hallelujah this 
what the Bible says the old generation are not the  
[2265.6s] people because they can curse and the moment they 
says I will curse you you know their curse cannot  
[2271.0s] be reversed a young person can curse you but that 
can be reversed now then the Bible says after  
[2277.6s] you have given that then you should also fear the 
lord and when you fear the lord what will happen  
[2284.5s] the blessings of the old man will be will come to 
you when you grow old you'll also be given that  
[2292.3s] privilege that opportunity to serve the Lord at 
that moment don't compete with the old generation  
[2300.4s] but complement them in their services the old 
generation help the young people to serve the  
[2307.6s] Lord better and bring them closer as you have 
done in the church I am very proud of the church  
[2313.7s] because now even the young people have come to 
express who they are before the Lord and teing  
[2319.6s] us together the name of God is glorified praise 
the Lord there is nothing else we can do but to  
[2328.0s] respect the old men not only in the church even 
in the village you know if you don't do it right  
[2335.8s] now even for you you'll be forgotten Now do for 
them the good things today so that when they  
[2343.3s] grow hold as I conclude in my Village the young 
men went and slaugh and amb and they decided to  
[2352.4s] give the men the end and the hoops and they took 
the stick to themselves when they grow old they  
[2363.7s] realize they are getting the head and the hes 
they change they said let change the rule they  
[2371.8s] were told the rule was established by yourself 
now enjoy what we used to enjoy at that other  
[2379.4s] time ladies and Gentlemen let's remember the Lord 
is with us and may the Lord bless you let's pray  
[2389.0s] let's stand as we pray our father and our God 
in heaven what a privilege you have given us  
[2397.4s] to serve you in this church we want to pray for 
the own angels in our church that you may bless  
[2403.7s] them we want to pray for our young people that 
Lord you may bless them that when Jesus comes  
[2409.8s] none of us will be left but we will inherit 
the Kingdom of Heaven bless us Lord not only  
[2415.5s] today but the days of our life in Jesus 
name we pray amen may the Lord bless you
