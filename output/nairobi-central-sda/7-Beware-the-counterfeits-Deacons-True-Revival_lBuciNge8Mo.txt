good evening and good afternoon or good morning to you where you're watching us from this is the panel that is doing a book review of the book true Revival and I'm here with two wonderful Gentlemen by the name brother opata hayanga and Steve muger and my name is brother Niko opio and throughout the weeks we've been going through a review of some of the chapters in this book and right now we're doing chapter 7 so in case you haven't watched the other episode you can quickly go to the playlist of true Revival and watch through what we have shared but more important is for you to actually read the book because this is just a summary of the wonderful truths written inside the book so before we begin I'd like us to Bow our heads for a word of prayer and Steve will pray for us and just give us a brief summar talk about some points in this chapter which is chapter 7 Beware of the content should be an interesting discussion brother Steve please pray and take it you thank you very much brother Niko welcome let us have pray a word of prayer our heavenly father we want to thank you for this opportunity that you've granted unto us to come before you to discuss and review this book true Revival as we discuss this week's lesson Lord it is our prayer that your Holy Spirit Lord will abide you shall guide us you shall fill us oh Lord everything we discuss may it bring glory and honor to your name as you reduce us and you increase it is in Jesus name we pray amen amen thank you very much and once again welcome uh this week we want to talk about um beware the counterfeits this is chapter 7 of the book true Revival again we continue pleading in Hest that get this book what we are doing uh in this session is just to give a highlight but for you to get an an indepth um coverage and Truth get the book physically or the link that will be shared we want to talk about uh Beware the counterfeits in chapter two couple of weeks ago we talked about conversions fake or real so in this book this week we will highlight what are these fake conversions okay what are the counterfeits what how how can we be on the lookout because it's it's a highlight to help us to be on the lookout on fake conversions or what we would call um Revival that is not truthful so to begin I would want us to read um uh allow me to read um this is the test that is the first part of Beware the counterfeit chapter 7 to the law and to the testimony if they speak not according to this word it is because there's no light in them this is from the book Isaiah 8 verse 20 so we've been given a sign or what you would call a um a way of knowing or understanding the counterfeit or someone who does not profess true Revival it goes further um the book goes further sister white goes further and says that the people of God are directed to the scriptures as their Safeguard against the influence of false teachers that our only hope our only tool to discover counterfeits is what is the scriptures I'll read I'll read that again the people of God are directed to the scriptures as their Safeguard against the influence of false teachers now how do you distinguish true and false false revivals um the book 2 Chronicles chapter 7 7:14 says that if my people who are called by my name will humble themselves and pray and seek my face and turn from their Wicked Ways then I will hear them from heaven and I will forgive their sin and will heal their land remember if my people God says who my people who are called by my name that's the first point of distinguish what a true Revival is because if we call unto God in truthfulness then what will he do he will answer us he will hear us from heaven and he will forgive us of our of our sins so we are reminded that another characteristics of true Revival is what kind of conversion do we profess is it superficial is it emotional is it Sensational do we come to church and and you know we are all emotional and and this reminds me of um what we watch on our TV sets on a daily basis and you know actually having the privilege of sometimes sitting behind the scenes you know as an editor a news editor when you're sending out um you know your your your journalist you task them to go and bring stories that can make it okay so they're not going to bring you know nice stories that are well captured they'll go and bring Sensational sto stories we're reminded that Sensational stories actually does what does sell because it speaks into the emotions but we are reminded that that is not true Revival now the counter fate aspect of it is what is transformational Revival is having that true experience and Encounter With Jesus Christ and actually if you've never had that encounter and we can know mhm if you're a Christian who professes um the Christian faith you will know that whether you've had a true encounter with who with Jesus Christ if you've never had a true Encounter With Jesus Christ consider that as a counterfeit Revival now what are the dangers of emot what emotions emotionalism or sensationalism May one of the dangers is that we which is which is ideally actually the the the the general aspect of it is that we will not experience true what true transformation because what we profess will be very temporary it is just it's sort of like an enthusiasm it's like a kid when you give a child candy you know that excitement is is just for a time because that once that Sugar Rush uh uh is is is depleted MH they will you'll actually be left in a worse space than before and that's what we told that counter fate Revival will just speak to your emotions and it will be very temporary you will not experience a lasting spiritual change that's that's one of the dangers of of emotional emotionalism or sensationalism that it will just St your feelings but there's no true obedience to God now how does work how does Satan come in because all all along in the great controversy from Genesis to Revelation mhm we see the out we see the playing of of of of um of of um the counterfeit okay because the controversy in itself is the battle between or right and wrong or true and false or what You' call true Count true um Revival and counterfeit Revival so the devil has um adopted a method of using counterfeit to appeal and appear genuine to Christians that's why you go to certain churches or you go to certain congregation and there's so much appeal to the emotions there's some particular sets of of of instruments this a way people um gate or dance the there's some way how there there there ways how people dress and because the devil has made this acceptable because they appealed to the emotions M this has become counterfeit cuz what is the message that you what all that you need is is your heart is is not your appearance that's counterfeit that's false there's no way that God's teaching remember we spoke about the Ten Commandments and what is beyond that thou shalt not these are the things that are beyond that thou shalt not and especially if you're empowered with what with the Holy Spirit now I wanted to quickly just throw this um discussion uh to my fellow panelist and I wanted to find out maybe from from Brother Nik MH now there's so much deception and this deception is what comes out as counterfeit M and we see this deception playing out in the modern world because of the acceptance or or or or the the face of acceptance that we are called to do by the modern world how should we remain Vigilant to this deception in our addressing now we carry ourselves in in the house of God how should we remain Vigilant maybe I start with my brother n yes yes yes it's important for us to be vigilant about the things that are in the church today because these counterfeits are actually becoming to be look like the genuine ones for example one of the things you wonder about in the book is to look out for healing sometimes if you relative is suffering from cancer and somebody comes and heals them you know the test will show that it's negative is it possible that it's the devil who's doing the healing because the devil can also heal you know it's important for us to acknowledge this then there are some people who feel that they haven't had a worship service if they don't feel emotionally aroused or drawn and if you didn't feel the power in the place you're in there is no religion there yes and another thing I've seen where somebody said you have to speak in tongues if you you have been truly revived if you haven't been revived if you if you don't speak in tongues you haven't been revived and I'm just thinking that speaking in tongues is okay but it's not gibberish it means it's some tongue that can be understood for example here in Kenya we have Lu English kikuu if somebody is claiming to speak in tongues and you can't understand any of those things are tied to a certain language that's not the real tongues So speaking in tongues for example is a gift where you suddenly speak in French when you had no prior knowledge of French you speak in Spanish or or kissy when you had no prior knowledge of kissy it doesn't mean you go and speak in an unintelligible language somewhere and say that now I am speaking so if there's nobody in the world who knows the language that you're speaking and you claim to be speaking in tongues then that is a deception so there are things like healing there are things like speaking in tongues even with the drums noise dancing that is going on in the churches some people think even I should strip my clothes off and be naked because I have been truly revived I believe that is a counterfeit because if that is what will draw us to Christ then it means that the moment we come to him in penitence and prayer it means it's boring and that's actually what's happening today some people come to our church and they feel that wow this is yeah the service is boring cuz you're wondering what's actually going on so we deceived what to any addition maybe yeah to a maybe if I may just help him to to lead with this question that as as brother nicoo has said people come looking for something that will appeal to their emotions and that is where the danger lies um in testimonies for the church we are reminding that that is not a safe guide okay that all we should do is acquaint ourselves with the evidences that we see in the Bible evidences of Faith right and the great study so how can study help us mhm uh I think study will will will keep you grounded into the word remember we have to question every spirit and how can you question these Spirits if you don't even have that knowledge yourself so by carefully studying the scriptures you realize that uh if anything that come you come across that it doesn't sound grounded to the scripture that spirit is a questionable spirit and a good example is the story of the thief on the cross he never saw any Miracle because even Jesus at that moment he never display his majesty and power so you see because he just saw the character of Christ that's that's our only thing that we should look for the character of Christ because not all of us were going to experience those Miracles there are people faithful in the Bible who never experience those Miracles but they Trust and Believe In Christ because he said that this man as we have been rightfully judged but this man has done nothing so because of that I believe him so this is I think this is what we should we should keep us grounded that Focus On Christ Focus On Christ and Christ alone when you talk about faith talks about Abraham he was promised but they died having not received that promise you see so when you when you when you when you when you when you narrow down to to to Miracles only you'll find that you live in M Heaven because you never saw it and sometimes even these Small Miracles we assume them we looking for bigger Miracles yeah so I think that will be am I like the about focusing on the character of Christ and it reminds me of a preacher who said that when the thief on the cross gets to Heaven if he's asked how are you here because there's no Doctrine whatsoever that he followed his only answer will be the man on the cross told me what to come that's why I'm here it's only the character of Christ am I would like to take his take it back to brother Nik to just close um with a quick summary amen amen be aware of the counterfeits MH the work of the devil as we told in John is to lie and since the beginning that was his job and even when we talk about true Revival the devil is trying to lie to us so your only safety is to the law and to the testimony if they speak not according to this word then they have no light in them and the Bible says even the very elect might be deceived so be sober be vigilant for your adversary the Devil he's seeking to deceive you absolutely if you are deceived there will be no difference between us and Adam and Eve first we the first ones who are deceived and they they were created directly in the image of God so we really need to be careful about the counter so we pray that the sharing has been a blessing to you and that's the close of chapter 7 next week will be discussing it's still a fight amen what is it that we fighting apparently is a good way to fight as a Christian that's what we learn about next week like brother to close for us with the word of prayer okay let's pray Our Father who are in heaven we thank you for the powerful words that you have you have spoken here words that only comes from your holy scriptures we thank you for you have used weak vessels such as we to father to reach out to the people out there who are dying for lack of knowledge how even as we proceed father to the coming week father we invite your holy presence to keep us throughout the week and give us your word that we may speak not ours but yours only all this of us trusting and believing in Jesus name we pray amen amen

[116.7s] we continue pleading in Hest that get
[119.3s] this book what we are doing uh in this
[121.8s] session is just to give a highlight but
[124.6s] for you to get an an indepth um coverage
[127.6s] and Truth get the book physically or the
[130.1s] link that will be shared we want to talk
[133.3s] about uh Beware the counterfeits in
[135.6s] chapter two couple of weeks ago we
[139.4s] talked about conversions fake or real so
[144.0s] in this book this week we will highlight
[147.8s] what are these fake conversions
[150.5s] okay what are the
[151.9s] counterfeits what how how can we be on
[154.3s] the lookout because it's it's a
[157.2s] highlight to help us to be on the
[159.2s] lookout on fake conversions or what we
[162.9s] would call um Revival that is not
[166.9s] truthful so to begin I would want us to
[170.4s] read um uh allow me to read um this is
[175.7s] the test that is the first part of
[177.7s] Beware the counterfeit chapter 7
[180.6s] to the law and to the testimony if they
[183.7s] speak not according to this word it is
[186.9s] because there's no light in them this is
[189.4s] from the book Isaiah 8 verse 20 so we've
[193.7s] been
[194.8s] given a sign or what you would call a um
[199.8s] a way of knowing or understanding the
[204.0s] counterfeit or someone who does not
[207.2s] profess true Revival it goes further um
[211.8s] the book goes further sister white goes
[213.3s] further and says that the people of God
[215.3s] are directed to the
[217.7s] scriptures as their Safeguard against
[220.3s] the influence of false teachers that our
[223.4s] only hope our only tool to discover
[228.0s] counterfeits is what is the scriptures
[231.6s] I'll read I'll read that again the
[233.5s] people of God are directed to the
[235.2s] scriptures as their Safeguard against
[237.6s] the influence of false teachers
[240.8s] now how do you distinguish true and
[243.2s] false false
[245.2s] revivals um the book 2 Chronicles
[247.9s] chapter 7 7:14 says that if my people
[252.8s] who are called by my name will humble
[255.2s] themselves and pray and seek my face and
[259.1s] turn from their Wicked Ways then I will
[261.4s] hear them from heaven and I will forgive
[263.6s] their sin and will heal their land
[267.0s] remember if my people God says who my
[271.0s] people who are called by my name that's
[274.4s] the first point of distinguish what a
[276.4s] true Revival is because if we call unto
[278.7s] God in truthfulness then what will he do
[282.5s] he will answer us he will hear us from
[285.0s] heaven and he will forgive us of our of
[286.9s] our sins so we are reminded that another
[290.2s] characteristics of true Revival is what
[293.7s] kind of conversion do we profess is it
[297.2s] superficial is it emotional is it
[300.4s] Sensational do we come to church and and
[303.4s] you know we are all emotional and and
[306.1s] this reminds me of um what we watch on
[308.8s] our TV sets on a daily basis and you
[312.0s] know actually having the privilege of
[314.3s] sometimes sitting behind the scenes you
[316.5s] know as an editor a news editor when
[319.3s] you're sending out um you know your your
[322.5s] your
[323.3s] journalist you task them to go and bring
[326.7s] stories that can make
[328.4s] it okay so they're not going to bring
[331.0s] you know nice stories that are well
[334.0s] captured they'll go and bring
[335.7s] Sensational sto stories we're reminded
[338.2s] that Sensational stories actually does
[340.2s] what does sell because it speaks into
[343.4s] the emotions but we are reminded that
[346.0s] that is not true Revival now the counter
[348.0s] fate aspect of it is what is
[350.1s] transformational Revival is having that
[353.0s] true experience and Encounter With Jesus
[356.4s] Christ and actually if you've never had
[359.0s] that encounter and we can know mhm if
[361.2s] you're a Christian who professes um the
[363.5s] Christian faith you will know that
[367.0s] whether you've had a true encounter with
[370.1s] who with Jesus Christ if you've never
[372.4s] had a true Encounter With Jesus Christ
[374.6s] consider that as a counterfeit Revival
[377.9s] now what are the dangers of emot what
[379.8s] emotions emotionalism or sensationalism
[383.5s] May one of the dangers is that we which
[387.8s] is which is ideally actually the the the
[390.1s] the general aspect of it is that we will
[392.2s] not experience true what true
[395.3s] transformation because what we profess
[398.8s] will be very temporary it is just it's
[401.3s] sort of like an enthusiasm it's like a
[403.1s] kid when you give a child candy you know
[407.1s] that excitement is is just for a time
[410.5s] because that once that Sugar Rush uh uh
[413.6s] is is is depleted MH they will you'll
[416.9s] actually be left in a worse space than
[419.7s] before and that's what we told that
[422.5s] counter fate Revival will just speak to
[425.4s] your emotions and it will be very
[427.2s] temporary you will not experience a
[429.8s] lasting spiritual change that's that's
[433.2s] one of the dangers of of emotional
[436.2s] emotionalism or sensationalism that it
[439.3s] will just St your feelings but there's
[442.0s] no true obedience to God now how does
[445.7s] work how does Satan come in because all
[449.5s] all along in the great controversy from
[451.8s] Genesis to Revelation mhm we see the out
[457.2s] we see the playing of of of of um of of
[461.6s] um the counterfeit okay because the
[464.9s] controversy in itself is the battle
[468.5s] between or right and wrong or true and
[471.4s] false or what You' call true Count true
[474.8s] um Revival and counterfeit Revival so
[477.6s] the devil has
[480.0s] um adopted a method of using counterfeit
[483.0s] to appeal and appear genuine to
[486.1s] Christians that's why you go to certain
[488.2s] churches or you go to certain
[489.6s] congregation and there's so much appeal
[491.9s] to the emotions there's some particular
[494.7s] sets of of of instruments this a way
[498.4s] people um gate or dance the there's some
[501.9s] way how there there there ways how
[503.8s] people dress and because the devil has
[507.0s] made this acceptable because they
[508.9s] appealed to the emotions M this has
[511.0s] become counterfeit cuz what is the
[513.2s] message that you what all that you need
[517.2s] is is your heart is is not your
[519.9s] appearance that's counterfeit that's
[522.2s] false there's no way that God's teaching
[524.6s] remember we spoke about the Ten
[526.2s] Commandments and what is beyond that
[529.4s] thou shalt not these are the things that
[531.0s] are beyond that thou shalt not and
[533.0s] especially if you're empowered with what
[535.1s] with the Holy Spirit now I wanted to
[538.3s] quickly just throw this um discussion uh
[541.8s] to my fellow panelist and I wanted to
[543.8s] find out maybe from from Brother Nik MH
[546.8s] now there's so much deception and this
[549.4s] deception is what comes out as
[551.1s] counterfeit M and we see this deception
[553.8s] playing out in the modern world because
[556.1s] of the acceptance or or or or the the
[558.9s] face of acceptance that we are called to
[561.2s] do by the modern world how should we
[565.0s] remain
[566.0s] Vigilant to this deception in our
[568.4s] addressing now we carry ourselves in in
[571.6s] the house of God how should we remain
[573.6s] Vigilant maybe I start with my brother n
[576.7s] yes yes yes it's important for us to be
[579.6s] vigilant about the things that are in
[581.3s] the church today because these
[583.5s] counterfeits are actually becoming to be
[586.0s] look like the genuine ones for example
[588.3s] one of the things you wonder about in
[590.0s] the book is to look out for healing
[592.7s] sometimes if you relative is suffering
[594.4s] from cancer and somebody comes and heals
[596.8s] them you know the test will show that
[598.8s] it's negative
[600.1s] is it possible that it's the devil who's
[602.4s] doing the healing because the devil can
[604.7s] also heal you know it's important for us
[607.0s] to acknowledge this then there are some
[609.4s] people who feel that they haven't had a
[611.6s] worship service if they don't feel
[615.3s] emotionally aroused or drawn and if you
[618.6s] didn't feel the power in the place
[620.2s] you're in there is no religion there yes
[624.0s] and another thing I've seen where
[625.9s] somebody said you have to speak in
[628.2s] tongues if you you have been truly
[630.1s] revived if you haven't been revived if
[633.2s] you if you don't speak in tongues you
[635.4s] haven't been revived and I'm just
[637.3s] thinking that speaking in tongues is
[639.6s] okay but it's not gibberish it means
[642.5s] it's some tongue that can be understood
[644.5s] for example here in Kenya we have Lu
[647.0s] English kikuu if somebody is claiming to
[650.5s] speak in tongues and you can't
[652.8s] understand any of those things are tied
[654.3s] to a certain language that's not the
[656.3s] real tongues So speaking in tongues for
[658.7s] example is a gift where you suddenly
[661.3s] speak in French when you had no prior
[663.8s] knowledge of French you speak in Spanish
[666.6s] or or kissy when you had no prior
[669.7s] knowledge of kissy it doesn't mean you
[671.8s] go and speak in an unintelligible
[673.9s] language somewhere and say that now I am
[676.4s] speaking so if there's nobody in the
[678.7s] world who knows the language that you're
[680.4s] speaking and you claim to be speaking in
[682.6s] tongues then that is a deception so
[684.9s] there are things like healing there are
[686.7s] things like speaking in tongues even
[689.7s] with the drums noise dancing that is
[692.0s] going on in the churches some people
[693.7s] think even I should strip my clothes off
[696.0s] and be naked because I have been truly
[698.3s] revived I believe that is a counterfeit
[701.3s] because if that is what will draw us to
[703.8s] Christ then it means that the moment we
[706.5s] come to him in penitence and prayer it
[708.7s] means it's boring and that's actually
[710.5s] what's happening today some people come
[712.5s] to our church and they feel that wow
[714.6s] this is yeah the service is boring cuz
[717.3s] you're wondering what's actually going
[718.9s] on so
[720.9s] we deceived
[723.8s] what
[726.3s] to any addition maybe yeah to a maybe if
[729.6s] I may just help him to to lead with this
[731.8s] question that as as brother nicoo has
[735.6s] said people come looking for something
[737.6s] that will appeal to their emotions and
[739.8s] that is where the danger lies um in
[742.6s] testimonies for the church we are
[744.0s] reminding that that is not a safe guide
[747.2s] okay that all we should do is acquaint
[749.5s] ourselves with the evidences that we see
[752.0s] in the Bible evidences of Faith right
[755.4s] and the great study so how can study
[757.8s] help us
[759.2s] mhm
[761.1s] uh I think study will will will keep you
[764.4s] grounded into the word remember we have
[767.0s] to question every spirit and how can you
[769.6s] question these Spirits if you don't even
[771.2s] have that knowledge yourself so by
[774.2s] carefully studying the scriptures you
[776.5s] realize that uh if anything that come
[779.6s] you come across that it doesn't
[782.6s] sound grounded to the scripture that
[785.6s] spirit is a questionable spirit and a
[788.4s] good example is the story of the thief
[791.5s] on the cross he never saw any Miracle
[794.4s] because even Jesus at that moment he
[796.5s] never display his majesty and power so
[800.1s] you see because he just saw the
[802.9s] character of Christ that's that's our
[804.9s] only thing that we should look for the
[806.8s] character of Christ because not all of
[808.6s] us were going to experience those
[809.9s] Miracles there are people faithful in
[813.4s] the Bible who never experience those
[815.0s] Miracles but they Trust and Believe In
[817.4s] Christ because he said that this man as
[820.2s] we have been
[821.6s] rightfully judged but this man has done
[824.2s] nothing so because of that I believe him
[827.9s] so this is I think this is what we
[829.6s] should we should keep us grounded that
[832.0s] Focus On Christ Focus On Christ and
[834.5s] Christ alone when you talk about faith
[836.6s] talks about Abraham he was promised but
[840.4s] they died having not received that
[842.2s] promise you see so when you when you
[845.8s] when you when you when you when you
[847.3s] narrow down to to to Miracles only
[850.5s] you'll find that you live in M Heaven
[852.4s] because you never saw it and sometimes
[854.4s] even these Small Miracles we assume them
[856.7s] we looking for bigger Miracles yeah so I
[859.4s] think that will be am I like the about
[862.8s] focusing on the character of Christ and
[865.6s] it reminds me of a preacher who said
[867.5s] that when the thief on the cross gets to
[869.6s] Heaven if he's asked how are you here
[872.4s] because there's no Doctrine whatsoever
[874.5s] that he followed his only answer will be
[877.2s] the man on the cross told me what to
[879.3s] come that's why I'm here it's only the
[882.0s] character of Christ
[884.7s] am I would like to take his take it back
[887.5s] to brother Nik to just close um with a
[891.4s] quick summary amen amen be aware of the
[895.7s] counterfeits MH the work of the devil as
[899.0s] we told in John is to lie and since the
[902.0s] beginning that was his job and even when
[905.1s] we talk about true Revival the devil is
[908.5s] trying to lie to us so your only safety
[912.7s] is to the law and to the testimony if
[915.9s] they speak not according to this word
[918.8s] then they have no light in them and the
[921.7s] Bible says even the very elect might be
[924.5s] deceived so be sober be vigilant for
[928.1s] your adversary the Devil he's seeking to
[930.7s] deceive you absolutely if you are
[932.4s] deceived there will be no difference
[934.8s] between us and Adam and Eve first we the
[937.5s] first ones who are deceived and they
[939.7s] they were created directly in the image
[941.5s] of God so we really need to be careful
[944.1s] about the counter so we pray that the
[946.7s] sharing has been a blessing to you and
[949.9s] that's the close of chapter 7 next week
[952.6s] will be discussing it's still a fight
[955.9s] amen what is it that we fighting
[958.4s] apparently is a good way to fight as a
[960.4s] Christian that's what we learn about
[962.9s] next week like brother to close for us
[965.8s] with the word of prayer okay let's pray
[968.7s] Our Father who are in heaven we thank
[970.5s] you for the powerful words that you have
[973.5s] you have spoken here words that only
[976.1s] comes from your holy scriptures we thank
[979.8s] you for you have used weak vessels such
[982.4s] as we to father to reach out to the
[985.6s] people out there who are dying for lack
[988.2s] of knowledge
[989.5s] how even as we proceed father to the
[992.5s] coming week father we invite your holy
[995.0s] presence to keep us throughout the week
[997.5s] and give us your word that we may speak
[1000.9s] not ours but yours only all this of us
[1003.8s] trusting and believing in Jesus name we
[1005.5s] pray amen amen
