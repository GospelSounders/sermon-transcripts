Nora and I serve in the publishing Ministries Department hello my name is Ruby and I serve in the Youth Department thank you so much ladies for joining us and we are so excited because uh the church allows the women to serve we have so many departments being headed by women in Nairobi Central SDA church and I'm sure it applies to your churches as well now the book Daughters of God like I said you can find it in your local bookstore the QR code please follow with us is designed to actually encourage women it is designed to inspire women it is designed to affirm women all around the world and Ellen White actually just assures us the church is supporting women and how do they do that um the church has given women leadership roles not just in your local church but even in general conference we have a period of time where she says between 185 2 and 1910 and gives some statistics she says that uh L Flora Plummer was actually the head of Sabbath school department for 23 years a woman okay and then we have between 1852 and 1899 out of the 19 people in leadership 11 were women okay then we have the treasurers women are also taking care of money in the church up to the general conference we have out of between 18 71 and 1883 out of the 11 treasurers we've had three have been women now in 1878 to 1910 31 women were licensed to preach so the church is the church knows how beautiful women are how beautiful daughters of God are are and just encouraging women to serve and lead in the church now the book Daughters of God we are told also very clearly is that Daughters of God is designed to to ensure that we are as we are called for service we must be very very zealous in this service as we go about our business every time now God created male and he created female but even in all this beauty of the world God knows women can come close to the hearts of those who men cannot reach yeah now tell me in which areas do you think that men cannot reach but women women can actually do this Elizabeth thank you um women um perform so many activities yes for example women would like to look nice yes and they go to the salon more often and they meet other women there um and they can be able to reach those women yes at the salon yes more than the men can amen so women are called everywhere you go this book Daughters of God is calling you you must serve everywhere you go thank you for that example yes Mar uh women are significant when it comes to interacting with the first human being this plays a key role in ensuring that if it's a child she or is brought to a a best level or a best way that pleases the Lord amen we actually encouraged even in church When You're Expecting when God has given you that blessing of a child in your womb to go to credit roll not when the child comes out okay and women interact with their children in a beautiful way that's I mean the men may do so but remember you're the one with the child in your belly so that's a gift God has given you and what about nurturing do you feel that as women we Nur more I think women do Nur more in that they're more nurturing and have the the patience to when it comes to children and all so they are a ble to interact more with that child just as ADBA has mentioned yes absolutely so there's no doubt even in the children Ministry I think it's packed with women but not to say that the men should not be there but the women are helping the church in a great way now Daughters of God um I like what she says here before we get into chapter one she says that all who work for God should have the Martha and the Mary attributes Blended now we know MAA who is Martha in the Bible Well Martha she is of course Mary's sister and she was the one who instead of sitting down at jesus' feet like Mary did she was just up and down making sure that everything is running fine and yeah nothing wrong with that but if it takes away from spending time with your maker then it becomes a problem that's it you know in the children Ministry we sing we say that MAA Matha was saying uh I am busily busily working while Mary is churing why can't Jesus see she should help me I am chopping and cutting and cooking while Mary is looking why can't Jesus see she should help me so Martha was busy but this book is telling us be a Mara but also be a Mary so who was Mary Ruby would like to speak again yes Ruby Mary was the mother of Jesus and as we've seen she's also the sister of Martha and she's the one who has been mentioned in the song to be chatting and just looking at Mary as looking at Martha while she's doing all the work yeah yes so we have a Mary who's the mother of Jesus but we also have a Mary in this case who's the sister of Martha and in this case you know Mary and Martha were Jesus's friends you know the sisters to to Lazarus and Mary was you know sitting nicely and listening to Jesus and just being so we have women like that in the church who just come and sit but this book is calling us let's do both okay so we want to look at chapter one it says the Lord calls women to service now we have to appreciate that there are two things either you're doing the work of the church or you're doing Church work and it's good to do both be a mother and be a Mary now the work of the church is to do what to win souls that's the main thing but Church work is when you're the Deaconess when you're in par when you know just doing the things within the church or you know but at the end of the day the greatest call for us is the call to Service as women we want to look at a few themes that um that Ellen White speaks about she says that we must have moral courage to decide in favor of the truth so when you see something going wrong in the church you must speak up anybody want wants to share testimony on speaking up on a moment that you saw something going off yeah even even as we see as we see people serving in in in uh different departments and we see something going wrong even in the children Ministry or we see something going on in women Ministry we must say there's a problem but as we do it we must do so in love so we are being called to speak the truth in love but you must speak the truth okay now John 3:18 what does it say and as you get it even the armor of God talks about in Ephesians 6:14 that we must stand firm with a belt of Truth around our waist so if you want to serve you must be ready to speak truth and not your truth God's truth maybe it's first John 3:18 because it says Dear children let us not love with word or speech but with action and in truth so we are being called to actually love in in truth another thing that we must have in service so we've talked about speaking in truth truth another thing is tact mhm which women in the Bible had tacted as they spoke as they served a good example is a Abigail Abigail yeah you know when the message reached them that uh David wanted to give some punishment to the husband yes she decided to do something so that they're not attacked or their family is not exactly so she was very tactful in the way she handled that and we'll be reading about Abigail in Chapter 2 of these Daughters of God another example of a woman who was tactful yes I think I can say Esther Esther was excellent because you know even though she you know her people were in danger she was in danger yes like God I believe that God gave her that idea of going to the king and instead of saying like oh please save us is to invite him to dinner first yes he can get into his good graces and then now present the problem exactly so we'll also learn about Esther in Chapter 2 because she was very tactful so you must be truthful you must be tactful you must have some perception it's not all bad you know sometimes women if something goes wrong we take too long as dumb cells in distress you know want to mourn oh things are bad things are bad yes but what can you do about it so just encouraging people that they'll be Joy the morning maybe we can read uh Romans 88:18 Romans 88:18 says for I consider that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed in US amen so as you're serving as you're moving about in church you must encourage be encouraged even you your own countenance yeah don't behave like your sufferings of the week is going to finish you when you meet people as a Deon when you meet people as the interest coordinator when you're serving wherever you're serving be energetic be happy The Joy will come in the morning morning now another thing you must have is love yeah where do we know in the Bible told How to Love In First Corinthians 13 and we told love is what patient love is patient love is kind kind love ISU longsuffering but you know we say love is longsuffering but are we willing to be longsuffering we don't want we not go suffer like we say okay so at the end of the day Christ's love is with Divine love that's what she says in the book amen and how do we know that in second Peter 1:3 the Bible says his divine power has given us everything we need for a Godly life so for you to live a Godly life his divine power has given us which includes love through a knowledge of him who has called us by his own glory and goodness so if you want to know how to serve in love turn to Jesus he will tell you how to do it God has called us this is our Commandment that we love one one another and it's easy to say but are we really loving one another now first if if you see page 17 of daughters of God there's a beautiful message she says right there she says that um when the love of God and his truth is abide is an abiding principle they will let nothing deter them from Duty or discourage them in their work what is detering you as women here to love because don't worry about people's talk talk talk we are being told if you have the love of God in you of course you get discouraged but you stay focused you stay very very focused we are also being called in the book to have no excuses which excuses as this we have as women can say seeking the book here says seeking after amusements yeah so sometimes we come to church to be entertained Netflix you know we want to sit back and say the pastor was really boring today we didn't enjoy the sermon we are not here for amusement your question is which souls are you winning the pastor is doing his part what are you doing another thing that which excuses do we have what about those of us in school Ruby uh one of them would be for as you have said school so because you're in school from Monday to Friday you feel that maybe on the Sabbath or even on Sunday you're not able to do extra because you're tired and that's your time to rest yet if you just put in that effort to win just one soul you're doing the mission that we have been to Ruby here is studying veterinary medicine and she's here doing Daughters of God so I guess there's no excuse there yes Grace think it's another thing that can keep us distracted from doing God's work is material possessions like eleno has highlighted it here okay I'm just going to read it quickly eating and drinking and dressing houses and lands will be secondary matters like okay currently as the youth we are doing messages to Young people and we are doing stewardship at the moment and the main message is whatever money that you have like if you for example if you do not need this piece of clothing like let's say you're going to considering that you're considering to buy it like you should ask yourself like do I really need it or should this money go to God's work yes so that's we we have no excuse another thing is domestic work I mean some of us stay atome moms or you you know you're a stay- atome mom by Sabbath you're like I need to rest yeah I cannot I cannot serve in the church or you're working in the week you feel is a Sabbath for rest how is it again for working so we have proper excuses now we are also told that we must aim another another thing for you to succeed in in in uh this call for service is you must aim to work methodically now the church has put in things to make sure we work in a proper way which things are this uh we have the department correct and this department have ages so you you find that if you are a child there is a place you actually belong if you are a golden Ager you have your Agate that resonate you have experiences together exactly yes exactly so there's no excuse you should get on with it the church has put a nice structure for us to follow so there's no D moment in church when the spirit of dness is upon you you have to rebuke it and say Where am I bored in the house of the Lord when you go to work do you look bored or you're very enthusiastic very Astic your boss is like okay Elizabeth you're doing amazing you say yes but in the house of the Lord you're like today I am not I'm not in the mood yeah so now we must be interested we must be zealous and we must not be caught up with the rubbish like like graay said of this world which other things are those rubbish of the world we get caught up in one would be gossiping gossip I'm telling you we we are notorious for talking about people and when you're not serving in the church you're Idol you're enough to say have you seen have you seen Nora's hair have you seen Elizabeth's shoes have you seen alen's glasses maybe she should change them come on we are serving and if you're busy serving you'll not be caught up in all that nonsense so God is looking for people who are going to be prayerful prayerful in service are you prayerful there's a whole Prayer Ministry Department in this church we are asking you are you plugging in you know we learned uh the other day from from the children Ministry credal about the S and we said that some seeds fall on the on the path and some seeds fall on the on the Rock on the rocks and some seeds fall on the on the thorns and they get choked as women have you reached the compound and said please can I pray with you my sister you you don't seem to be consistent in coming to church can we pray about this instead of saying have you seen so and so nowadays do you see Al with her husband anymore they don't come together they come in cars or alen you know Elizabeth walks and her husband uses the car or I mean come on get real you are called to service to actually be prayerful amen now we are being called as call laborers and as a call laborer we must have the fear of God how do we know you fear God if you do what you keep his keep his God says if you love me keep my commandment my commandments so as women the question is do you love God and and the first set of Commandments talks about love God and then the next set says love your neighbor your neighbor are you fruit bearing are you asking yourself here I am going to make sure that I will uh bring in Two Souls today it's your to-do list how many of us have to-do list I don't I need to do better to-do list to bring in souls and not a Saturday agenda but when you're in the salon anyone has been been to the salon and and has been able to encourage somebody in the salon yes oh wow yes Nora um I went to the salon recently to make my hair yes and I was the first customer there so um I told the lady let's pray and we prayed before we began our uh Beauty work yes and two weeks ago she called me and told me uh to go back she was asking nor when are you coming back yes because my daughter says that day we made more money imagine yeah so I want to believe that uh before they begin their business they've now discovered that they can begin with God so I told them even if I don't come just pray uh just pray as you start your business amen so wherever you are be zealous for winning Souls let someone testify that because of Elizabeth I will pray you know so we are also told uh in the book Daughters of God that what is the standard of Christianity the standard is not that your name is in the church register Church register the question is how the hymn says is your name written there uhuh and there is in heaven not here it's lovely to serve in women Ministry Deon publishing youth choir that's amazing but they keep the main thing the main thing don't just have your name in the register here let's move on what about Mission field I know Elizabeth is is quite good in Mission field how is it out there yeah I just want to say in Mission yes um you can do Mission anywhere anytime Yes actually I always carry a pamphlet a book every time I'm traveling so that um even if I've read it over and over again I just want my neighbor to see it amen and at the end of the trip they'll always ask me can I have one exactly I have the pleasure to share exactly um another mission that you can do is one that I did um uh a few years ago yes I got a group of young people Youth and we went to my Village yes a 50 of us we divided ourselves to different directions house to house door to door to pray with them identify their need and give them a book amen so we must ident identify people's needs in the mission field then now pray with them because you must give the food give the clothes then pray with them so thank you for sharing and as you go to the mission it's really it's humility that is called upon us because it's self-denial you leave the comfort of your bed you go to some areas where there are real mosquitoes not Nairobi ones you know but you have to work on bringing in the sheaves we are told ringing in the Sheep ringing in the she we shall come rejoicing bringing in the she so are we really bringing in the sheep or we just coming to sing on Sabbath how we are bringing in the shav so please let's be zealous let's be diligent let's not be Idol now we've talked about the things that hinder us we don't want to suffer we are too comfortable we are worried about what to wear we are worried about what people will say but we are being told forget all that yeah don't lack empathy when the church and sympathy when the church is calling for money for people to be given uh food in the streets don't say someone else will do you are the someone yes being called to to serve and do so diligently now what are the benefits of this service because the beauty is there a reward what is it yes El I can say that uh uh the best example we've been given in the Bible is that um seek ye first the kingdom of God and all these things shall be added unto you so we have Christ all these other things that you desire will come to you amen and that's not to preach the Prosperity Gospel but to say that the Lord rewards those who work for him yeah make no mistake and reward is not money it's wealth in even Health yeah your and mental health spiritual well-being your children are well some of us are surviving on the prayers of our grandparents or great grandparents so we have grandmothers in the Bible Lo are you trying to be a Lois or we are just going about our lives which other benefits do we have in service Peace of Mind Peace of Mind very important yeah some people like these lovely daughters of God here they just look peaceful they look so calm sometimes you see them you're like he the way the struggle is real how come you look so peaceful but because of serving they are busy in the week and they're busy on Sabbath serving serving and not just waiting to serve on sabath wherever you are we are being called to service what else which other benefit do we have when you serve what other thing do you gain it's also satisfying it is you feel satisfied that you've done something to someone amen you just feel happy yes Grace I can also say joy joy and you know Joy is not happiness happiness can be a mirage you'll never quite touch it but joy is deep it's from God nobody can take it away from you yes yes Grace also tell question in the chapter one I'll just paraphrase it yes like Ellen White says that we as you know God's C- laborers should not be looking for happiness or Amusement in the things out here but instead she says that actually doing God's work that is what will bring you true Joy amen thank you for reminding us and and just to we are almost closing so just to remind us in 2 Kings 20:3 to4 I think uh aen can read for us 2 Kings 20:3 it's says it reads remember now oh Lord I pray how I have walked before you in truth and with a loyal heart and have done what was good in your sight this is man uh Hezekiah Hezekiah is telling God remember me I have been faithful I have been true to you I have worked wholeheartedly devote devoted my time for you and then he says I have been good in your eyes if you serve you've been called to serve and you do all these things you can throw remember me oh God but if you've been coming here for Netflix entertainment can you say remember me so what what does he say in verse four he says and it happened before Isaiah had gone out into the middle court that the word of the Lord came to him saying came to Isaiah tell him go back uhuh return and tell Hezekiah the leader of my people thus says the Lord the god of David your father yes I have heard your prayer amen I have seen your tears am surely I will heal you Amen on the third day you shall go up to the house of the Lord let me tell you the guy was sick because he had shown off some visitors came and he had shown off God now says go back tells Isaiah had gone to tell him you're in trouble you're dying he says go back I have heard his prayer tell him he's going to live and you know he gave bir to a son after that he gave back to manasse MH yes and leave to another 12 years or is it 15 years so at the end of the day serve serve and tell God uhuh me as Elizabeth please remember my children and name your children serve and tell God please remember me at my workplace God please my school in medical school alen in law tell God this case I'm winning it because remember me Nora remember me Ruby let's have those cards we can tell God please remember me so please I encourage everybody our viewers join us this is chapter one chapter two is even more exciting as we go we're going to learn about the women in the Old Testament and the Nuggets we must pick from them please like we said pick up Daughters of God from your local uh store but also in the screen there's a QR code scan it pick it up let's read it together let's get excited and and just see how we can serve God diligently get your to-do list on board amen we'll ask you next week if you have it

[163.0s] the church is the church knows how
[165.6s] beautiful women are how beautiful
[167.6s] daughters of God are are and just
[169.9s] encouraging women to serve and lead in
[172.1s] the church now the book Daughters of God
[174.6s] we are told also very
[176.4s] clearly is that Daughters of God is
[178.8s] designed to to ensure that we are as we
[181.4s] are called for service we must be very
[183.5s] very zealous in this service as we go
[186.4s] about our business every time now God
[189.1s] created male and he created female but
[192.8s] even in all this beauty of the world God
[196.2s] knows women can come close to the hearts
[199.6s] of those who men cannot reach yeah now
[203.4s] tell me in which areas do you think that
[206.0s] men cannot reach but women women can
[208.6s] actually do this
[211.6s] Elizabeth thank you
[214.1s] um women um perform so many activities
[220.4s] yes for example women would like to look
[223.0s] nice yes and they go to the salon more
[226.1s] often and they meet other women
[229.2s] there um and they can be able to reach
[231.6s] those women yes at the salon yes more
[234.0s] than the men can amen so women are
[236.7s] called everywhere you go this book
[238.6s] Daughters of God is calling you you must
[241.0s] serve everywhere you go thank you for
[243.4s] that example yes Mar uh women are
[246.4s] significant when it comes to interacting
[249.4s] with the first human being this plays a
[252.2s] key role in ensuring that if it's a
[255.0s] child she or is brought to a a best
[258.6s] level or a best way that pleases the
[260.5s] Lord amen we actually encouraged even in
[263.8s] church When You're Expecting when God
[266.3s] has given you that blessing of a child
[268.6s] in your womb to go to credit roll not
[271.2s] when the child comes out okay and women
[273.8s] interact with their children in a
[275.3s] beautiful way that's I mean the men may
[277.8s] do so but remember you're the one with
[279.2s] the child in your belly so that's a gift
[281.4s] God has given you and what about
[283.6s] nurturing do you feel that as women we
[286.1s] Nur more I think women do Nur more in
[291.4s] that they're more nurturing and have the
[295.1s] the patience to when it comes to
[298.2s] children and all so they are a ble to
[300.2s] interact more with that child just as
[302.9s] ADBA has mentioned yes absolutely so
[306.0s] there's no doubt even in the children
[307.3s] Ministry I think it's packed with women
[309.7s] but not to say that the men should not
[311.2s] be there but the women are helping the
[313.7s] church in a great way now Daughters of
[316.4s] God um I like what she says here before
[319.3s] we get into chapter one she says that
[321.9s] all who work for God should have the
[324.8s] Martha and the Mary attributes Blended
[328.8s] now we know MAA who is Martha in the
[330.6s] Bible Well Martha she is of course
[333.6s] Mary's sister and she was the one who
[337.3s] instead of sitting down at jesus' feet
[339.3s] like Mary did she was just up and down
[341.6s] making sure that everything is running
[343.0s] fine and yeah nothing wrong with that
[344.8s] but if it takes away from spending time
[347.1s] with your maker then it becomes a
[348.7s] problem that's it you know in the
[350.1s] children Ministry we sing we say that
[352.6s] MAA Matha was
[354.0s] saying uh I am busily busily working
[357.9s] while Mary is churing why can't Jesus
[361.4s] see she should help me I am chopping and
[365.0s] cutting and cooking while Mary is
[367.6s] looking why can't Jesus see she should
[371.2s] help me so Martha was busy but this book
[374.3s] is telling us be a Mara but also be a
[377.2s] Mary so who was Mary Ruby would like to
[380.8s] speak again yes Ruby Mary was the mother
[383.2s] of Jesus and as we've seen she's also
[385.7s] the sister of Martha and she's the one
[388.0s] who has been mentioned in the song to be
[390.6s] chatting and just looking at Mary as
[393.3s] looking at Martha while she's doing all
[395.1s] the work yeah yes so we have a Mary
[396.7s] who's the mother of Jesus but we also
[398.8s] have a Mary in this case who's the
[400.2s] sister of Martha and in this case you
[403.0s] know Mary and Martha were Jesus's
[404.6s] friends you know the sisters to to
[407.1s] Lazarus and Mary was you know sitting
[410.3s] nicely and listening to Jesus and just
[413.0s] being so we have women like that in the
[415.2s] church who just come and sit but this
[417.1s] book is calling us let's do both okay so
[420.4s] we want to look at chapter one it says
[422.6s] the Lord calls women to service now we
[426.0s] have to appreciate that there are two
[427.8s] things either you're doing the work of
[430.0s] the church or you're doing Church work
[433.0s] and it's good to do both be a mother and
[435.0s] be a Mary now the work of the church is
[437.8s] to do what to win
[440.7s] souls that's the main thing but Church
[444.2s] work is when you're the Deaconess when
[446.1s] you're in par when you know just doing
[448.3s] the things within the church or you know
[450.6s] but at the end of the day the greatest
[452.6s] call for us is the call to Service as
[455.1s] women we want to look at a few themes
[457.1s] that um that Ellen White speaks about
[459.8s] she says that we must have moral courage
[463.3s] to decide in favor of the truth so when
[466.5s] you see something going wrong in the
[468.0s] church you must speak up anybody want
[470.9s] wants to share testimony on speaking up
[472.8s] on a moment that you saw something going
[475.2s] off yeah even even as we see as we see
[478.4s] people serving in in in uh different
[480.6s] departments and we see something going
[482.8s] wrong even in the children Ministry or
[484.4s] we see something going on in women
[485.8s] Ministry we must say there's a problem
[489.1s] but as we do it we must do so in love so
[492.9s] we are being called to speak the truth
[495.8s] in love but you must speak the truth
[499.6s] okay now John 3:18 what does it say and
[503.3s] as you get it even the armor of God
[505.4s] talks about in Ephesians 6:14 that we
[508.1s] must stand firm with a belt of Truth
[510.9s] around our waist so if you want to serve
[514.8s] you must be ready to speak truth and not
[518.0s] your
[518.9s] truth God's truth maybe it's first John
[522.5s] 3:18 because it says Dear children let
[525.0s] us not love with word or speech but with
[528.7s] action and in truth so we are being
[532.4s] called to actually love in in truth
[535.3s] another thing that we must have in
[537.1s] service so we've talked about speaking
[539.0s] in truth truth another thing is tact mhm
[542.4s] which women in the Bible had tacted as
[544.4s] they spoke as they served a good example
[547.0s] is a Abigail Abigail yeah you know when
[549.8s] the message reached them that uh David
[553.5s] wanted to give some punishment to the
[556.4s] husband yes she decided to do something
[559.2s] so that they're not attacked or their
[561.5s] family is not exactly so she was very
[563.8s] tactful in the way she handled that and
[565.6s] we'll be reading about Abigail in
[567.0s] Chapter 2 of these Daughters of God
[569.0s] another example of a woman who was
[570.7s] tactful yes I think I can say Esther
[573.3s] Esther was excellent because you know
[575.6s] even though she you know her people were
[578.1s] in danger she was in danger yes like God
[581.4s] I believe that God gave her that idea of
[583.0s] going to the king and instead of saying
[584.9s] like oh please save us is to invite him
[586.8s] to dinner first yes he can get into his
[588.9s] good graces and then now present the
[590.9s] problem exactly so we'll also learn
[592.6s] about Esther in Chapter 2 because she
[595.0s] was very tactful so you must be truthful
[597.4s] you must be tactful you must have some
[600.0s] perception it's not all bad you know
[603.2s] sometimes women if something goes wrong
[606.5s] we take too long as dumb cells in
[608.6s] distress you know want to mourn oh
[611.1s] things are bad things are bad yes but
[613.6s] what can you do about it so just
[615.8s] encouraging people that they'll be Joy
[617.4s] the morning maybe we can read uh Romans
[620.0s] 88:18 Romans 88:18 says for I consider
[625.0s] that the sufferings of this present time
[627.7s] are not worthy to be compared with the
[630.8s] glory which shall be revealed in US amen
[634.2s] so as you're serving as you're moving
[636.3s] about in church you must encourage be
[638.7s] encouraged even you your own countenance
[641.0s] yeah don't behave like your sufferings
[642.7s] of the week is going to finish you when
[644.4s] you meet people as a Deon when you meet
[646.3s] people as the interest coordinator when
[647.9s] you're serving wherever you're serving
[650.0s] be energetic be happy The Joy will come
[653.4s] in the morning morning now another thing
[656.0s] you must have is love yeah where do we
[658.4s] know in the Bible told How to Love In
[660.7s] First Corinthians 13 and we told love is
[663.8s] what patient love is patient love is
[666.4s] kind kind love ISU longsuffering but you
[670.8s] know we say love is longsuffering but
[672.2s] are we willing to be longsuffering we
[674.0s] don't want we not go suffer like we say
[676.6s] okay so at the end of the day Christ's
[679.6s] love is with Divine love that's what she
[682.6s] says in the book amen and how do we know
[685.2s] that in second Peter 1:3 the Bible says
[688.8s] his divine power has given us everything
[691.8s] we need for a Godly life so for you to
[696.6s] live a Godly life his divine power has
[699.8s] given us which includes love through a
[702.9s] knowledge of him who has called us by
[705.4s] his own glory and goodness so if you
[707.9s] want to know how to serve in love turn
[711.5s] to Jesus he will tell you how to do it
[714.5s] God has called us this is our
[715.9s] Commandment that we love one one another
[718.7s] and it's easy to say but are we really
[720.6s] loving one another now first if if you
[722.9s] see page 17 of daughters of God there's
[726.6s] a beautiful message she says right there
[728.8s] she says that um when the love of God
[733.0s] and his truth is abide is an abiding
[735.5s] principle they will let nothing deter
[738.3s] them from Duty or discourage them in
[741.1s] their work what is detering you as women
[744.2s] here to love because don't worry about
[747.5s] people's talk talk talk we are being
[749.5s] told if you have the love of God in you
[752.1s] of course you get discouraged but you
[753.9s] stay focused you stay very very focused
[757.6s] we are also being called in the book to
[759.0s] have no excuses which excuses as this we
[761.3s] have as women can say
[763.6s] seeking the book here says seeking after
[768.3s] amusements yeah so sometimes we come to
[770.6s] church to be entertained Netflix you
[773.5s] know we want to sit back and say the
[775.6s] pastor was really boring today we didn't
[777.8s] enjoy the sermon we are not here for
[780.3s] amusement your question is which souls
[782.9s] are you winning the pastor is doing his
[784.7s] part what are you doing another thing
[786.9s] that which excuses do we have what about
[788.6s] those of us in school Ruby uh one of
[791.9s] them would be for as you have said
[794.2s] school so because you're in school from
[796.6s] Monday to Friday you feel that maybe on
[798.9s] the Sabbath or even on Sunday you're not
[800.9s] able to do extra because you're tired
[804.0s] and that's your time to rest yet if you
[806.2s] just put in that effort to win just one
[808.4s] soul you're doing the mission that we
[810.8s] have been to Ruby here is studying
[813.8s] veterinary medicine and she's here doing
[816.2s] Daughters of God so I guess there's no
[818.1s] excuse there yes Grace think it's
[821.0s] another thing that can keep us
[822.8s] distracted from doing God's work is
[825.2s] material possessions like eleno has
[827.6s] highlighted it here okay I'm just going
[830.2s] to read it quickly eating and drinking
[832.1s] and dressing houses and lands will be
[834.4s] secondary
[835.8s] matters like okay currently as the youth
[837.9s] we are doing messages to Young people
[839.6s] and we are doing stewardship at the
[841.0s] moment and the main message is whatever
[843.7s] money that you have like if you for
[846.8s] example if you do not need this piece of
[849.5s] clothing like let's say you're going to
[850.7s] considering that you're considering to
[852.6s] buy it like you should ask yourself like
[855.2s] do I really need it or should this money
[857.0s] go to God's work yes so that's we we
[859.8s] have no excuse another thing is domestic
[861.6s] work I mean some of us stay atome moms
[864.9s] or you you know you're a stay- atome mom
[867.3s] by Sabbath you're like I need to rest
[869.2s] yeah I cannot I cannot serve in the
[871.0s] church or you're working in the week you
[873.4s] feel is a Sabbath for rest how is it
[875.7s] again for working so we have proper
[877.6s] excuses now we are also told that we
[879.8s] must aim another another thing for you
[882.2s] to succeed in in in uh this call for
[885.1s] service is you must aim to work
[887.8s] methodically now the church has put in
[890.5s] things to make sure we work in a proper
[893.5s] way which things are this uh we have the
[896.9s] department correct and this department
[899.1s] have ages so you you find that if you
[901.3s] are a child there is a place you
[902.8s] actually belong if you are a golden Ager
[905.6s] you have your Agate that resonate you
[907.8s] have experiences together exactly yes
[910.2s] exactly so there's no excuse you should
[913.2s] get on with it the church has put a nice
[915.1s] structure for us to follow so there's no
[917.7s] D moment in church when the spirit of
[920.0s] dness is upon you you have to rebuke it
[922.4s] and say Where am I bored in the house of
[923.9s] the Lord when you go to work do you look
[926.0s] bored or you're very enthusiastic very
[929.2s] Astic your boss is like okay Elizabeth
[931.1s] you're doing amazing you say yes but in
[932.9s] the house of the Lord you're like today
[934.7s] I am not I'm not in the mood yeah so now
[938.0s] we must be interested we must be zealous
[941.0s] and we must not be caught up with the
[942.5s] rubbish like like graay said of this
[944.9s] world which other things are those
[946.4s] rubbish of the world we get caught up in
[948.2s] one would be gossiping gossip I'm
[951.4s] telling you we we are notorious for
[955.1s] talking about people and when you're not
[957.0s] serving in the church you're Idol you're
[959.2s] enough to say have you seen have you
[961.1s] seen Nora's hair have you seen
[963.3s] Elizabeth's shoes have you seen alen's
[965.6s] glasses maybe she should change them
[968.2s] come on we are serving and if you're
[970.0s] busy serving you'll not be caught up in
[972.0s] all that nonsense so God is looking for
[975.1s] people who are going to be prayerful
[977.8s] prayerful in service are you prayerful
[981.3s] there's a whole Prayer Ministry
[982.5s] Department in this church we are asking
[984.8s] you are you plugging in you know we
[987.6s] learned uh the other day from from the
[989.4s] children Ministry credal about the S and
[992.2s] we said that some seeds fall on the on
[994.7s] the path and some seeds fall on the on
[997.5s] the Rock on the rocks and some seeds
[999.5s] fall on the on the thorns and they get
[1001.8s] choked as women have you reached the
[1004.1s] compound and said please can I pray with
[1006.2s] you my sister you you don't seem to be
[1008.6s] consistent in coming to church can we
[1010.8s] pray about this instead of saying have
[1013.3s] you seen so and so nowadays do you see
[1015.2s] Al with her husband anymore they don't
[1017.4s] come together they come in cars or alen
[1020.7s] you know Elizabeth walks and her husband
[1022.7s] uses the car or I mean come on get real
[1026.5s] you are called to service to actually be
[1029.2s] prayerful amen now we are being called
[1031.9s] as call laborers and as a call laborer
[1034.6s] we must have the fear of God how do we
[1037.2s] know you fear God if you do what you
[1039.6s] keep his keep his God says if you love
[1041.9s] me keep my commandment my commandments
[1044.2s] so as women the question
[1047.2s] is do you love God and and the first set
[1050.1s] of Commandments talks about love God and
[1052.8s] then the next set says love your
[1055.2s] neighbor your neighbor are you fruit
[1057.5s] bearing are you asking yourself here I
[1060.8s] am going to make
[1062.4s] sure that I will uh bring in Two Souls
[1066.6s] today it's your to-do list how many of
[1069.1s] us have to-do list I don't I need to do
[1071.0s] better to-do list to bring in souls and
[1074.2s] not a Saturday agenda but when you're in
[1076.6s] the salon anyone has been been to the
[1079.2s] salon and and has been able to encourage
[1081.4s] somebody in the salon yes oh wow yes
[1084.2s] Nora um I went to the salon recently to
[1087.9s] make my hair yes and I was the first
[1091.2s] customer there so um I told the lady
[1095.2s] let's pray and we prayed before we began
[1098.6s] our uh Beauty work yes and two weeks ago
[1102.8s] she called me and told me uh to go back
[1105.6s] she was asking nor when are you coming
[1107.6s] back yes because my daughter says that
[1110.5s] day we made more money imagine yeah so I
[1114.0s] want to believe that uh before they
[1116.2s] begin their business they've now
[1118.8s] discovered that they can begin with God
[1120.8s] so I told them even if I don't come just
[1123.8s] pray uh just pray as you start your
[1126.0s] business amen so wherever you are be
[1129.5s] zealous for winning Souls let someone
[1131.9s] testify that because of Elizabeth I will
[1134.6s] pray you know so we are also told uh in
[1137.9s] the book Daughters of God that what is
[1139.8s] the standard of Christianity the
[1141.4s] standard is not that your name is in the
[1143.5s] church register Church register the
[1146.5s] question is how the hymn says is your
[1149.5s] name written there uhuh and there is in
[1155.0s] heaven not here it's lovely to serve in
[1157.4s] women Ministry Deon publishing youth
[1160.2s] choir that's amazing but they keep the
[1162.6s] main thing the main thing don't just
[1164.6s] have your name in the register here
[1166.2s] let's move on what about Mission field
[1169.7s] I know Elizabeth is is quite good in
[1171.6s] Mission field how is it out there yeah I
[1175.0s] just want to say in Mission yes um you
[1178.2s] can do Mission anywhere anytime Yes
[1181.4s] actually I always carry a pamphlet a
[1185.1s] book every time I'm traveling so that um
[1189.7s] even if I've read it over and over again
[1192.1s] I just want my neighbor to see it amen
[1194.7s] and at the end of the trip they'll
[1196.3s] always ask me can I have one exactly I
[1198.9s] have the pleasure to share exactly um
[1201.6s] another mission that you can do is one
[1203.7s] that I did um uh a few years ago yes I
[1208.8s] got a group of young people Youth and we
[1212.6s] went to my Village yes a 50 of us we
[1215.8s] divided ourselves to different
[1218.1s] directions house to house door to door
[1221.4s] to pray with them identify their need
[1224.8s] and give them a book amen so we must
[1228.3s] ident identify people's needs in the
[1229.9s] mission field then now pray with them
[1232.5s] because you must give the food give the
[1234.4s] clothes then pray with them so thank you
[1236.4s] for sharing and as you go to the mission
[1238.4s] it's really it's humility that is called
[1241.8s] upon us because it's self-denial you
[1244.3s] leave the comfort of your bed you go to
[1246.8s] some areas where there are real
[1247.8s] mosquitoes not Nairobi ones you know but
[1250.6s] you have to work on bringing in the
[1252.5s] sheaves we are told ringing in the Sheep
[1256.4s] ringing in the she we shall come
[1260.4s] rejoicing bringing in the
[1263.3s] she so are we really bringing in the
[1265.4s] sheep or we just coming to sing on
[1267.2s] Sabbath how we are bringing in the shav
[1269.4s] so please let's be zealous let's be
[1272.3s] diligent let's not be Idol now we've
[1275.6s] talked about the things that hinder us
[1277.8s] we don't want to suffer we are too
[1280.2s] comfortable we are worried about what to
[1282.6s] wear we are worried about what people
[1285.2s] will say but we are being told forget
[1287.0s] all that yeah don't lack empathy when
[1289.7s] the church and sympathy when the church
[1291.4s] is calling for money for people to be
[1293.0s] given uh food in the streets don't say
[1295.0s] someone else will do you are the someone
[1297.1s] yes being called to to serve and do so
[1300.3s] diligently now what are the benefits of
[1303.2s] this service because the beauty is there
[1305.1s] a reward what is
[1307.6s] it yes El I can say that uh uh the best
[1311.5s] example we've been given in the Bible is
[1313.4s] that um seek ye first the kingdom of God
[1316.2s] and all these things shall be added unto
[1318.0s] you so we have Christ all these other
[1320.6s] things that you desire will come to you
[1322.8s] amen and that's not to preach the
[1324.4s] Prosperity Gospel but to say that the
[1326.8s] Lord rewards those who work for him
[1329.1s] yeah make no mistake and reward is not
[1332.3s] money it's wealth in even Health yeah
[1336.7s] your and mental health spiritual
[1339.6s] well-being your children are well some
[1342.2s] of us are surviving on the prayers of
[1343.7s] our grandparents or great grandparents
[1346.9s] so we have grandmothers in the Bible Lo
[1350.2s] are you trying to be a Lois or we are
[1352.4s] just going about our lives which other
[1354.7s] benefits do we have in service Peace of
[1357.1s] Mind Peace of Mind very important yeah
[1359.9s] some people like these lovely daughters
[1361.5s] of God here they just look peaceful they
[1364.0s] look so calm sometimes you see them
[1365.7s] you're like he the way the struggle is
[1367.6s] real how come you look so peaceful but
[1370.2s] because of serving they are busy in the
[1372.7s] week and they're busy on Sabbath serving
[1375.9s] serving and not just waiting to serve on
[1378.2s] sabath wherever you are we are being
[1380.4s] called to service what else which other
[1382.5s] benefit do we have when you serve what
[1384.4s] other thing do you gain it's also
[1386.8s] satisfying it is you feel satisfied that
[1389.6s] you've done something to someone amen
[1392.0s] you just feel happy yes Grace I can also
[1394.7s] say joy joy and you know Joy is not
[1397.8s] happiness happiness can be a mirage
[1399.5s] you'll never quite touch it but joy is
[1403.6s] deep it's from God nobody can take it
[1406.0s] away from you yes yes Grace also tell
[1408.3s] question in the chapter one I'll just
[1409.8s] paraphrase it yes like Ellen White says
[1412.3s] that we as you know God's C- laborers
[1415.8s] should not be looking for happiness or
[1418.2s] Amusement in the things out here but
[1420.4s] instead she says that actually doing
[1422.2s] God's work that is what will bring you
[1423.8s] true Joy amen thank you for reminding us
[1427.0s] and and just to we are almost closing so
[1429.5s] just to remind us in 2 Kings 20:3 to4 I
[1433.7s] think uh aen can read for us 2 Kings
[1437.3s] 20:3 it's says it reads remember now oh
[1440.8s] Lord I pray how I have walked before you
[1443.7s] in truth and with a loyal heart and have
[1446.5s] done what was good in your sight this is
[1449.2s] man uh Hezekiah Hezekiah is telling God
[1453.9s] remember me I have been faithful I have
[1457.5s] been true to you I have worked
[1460.2s] wholeheartedly devote devoted my time
[1463.0s] for you and then he says I have been
[1465.6s] good in your eyes if you serve you've
[1469.0s] been called to serve and you do all
[1471.5s] these things you can throw remember me
[1474.2s] oh God but if you've been coming here
[1476.6s] for Netflix entertainment can you say
