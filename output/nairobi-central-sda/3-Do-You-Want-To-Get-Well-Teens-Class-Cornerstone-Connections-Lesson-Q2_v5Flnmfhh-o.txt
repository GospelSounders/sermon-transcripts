FULL TRANSCRIPT:
welcome to this week's uh session for the lesson discussion for Cornerstone this is lesson three and together with me here isi from my left extreme left that is barara and Amy myself I'm chumba and before we can start let's pray father thank you for this day as we about to go through your reward we ask that you guide us help us learn something that will uh eternally help us as we prepare for a second coming I pray pray all this asking and believing in Jesus name amen all right so this week's lesson is titled do you want to get well let us start by reading the key text our key text comes from John chapter 5: 6 to 8 and it reads when Jesus saw him lying there and learned that he had been in this condition for a long time he asked him do you want to get well then Jesus said to him get up pick up your mat and walk thank you thank you I think you guys are familiar with this story right uh this is a lesson that is focused on uh a really important uh aspect that you can learn from this story from the Bible when Jesus found this lame man lying next to the pool pool where they used to believe or they knew that each time the pool was St you would just dip yourself into it and You' be healed and the interesting beit is we're finding out that in as much as Jesus found these guys cuz you know he wasn't the only one there there are several guys surrounding that pool and and as much as he saw this guys in their situation he still asked that question do you want to get well so let's read the flashlight the flashlight um says the sick man was lying on his mat and occasionally lifting his head to gaze at the pool when a tender compassionate face bends over him and the words wil thou be made whole arrested his attention hope came to his heart Jesus does not ask this sufferer to exercise faith in him he simply says rise up rise take up thy bed and walk but the man's Faith takes hold upon that word every nerve and muscle Thrills with new life and healthful action comes to his crippled limbs these are of Ages Pages 202 and 203 thank you so the the point or what we um aiming to learn from this is that uh one that there's real power in God's healing uh to uh you know God is readily available to help us at our points of need and the third thing I think that we should pay attention to his the cost of sin versus healing and freedom what does it all you know entail uh just before we go into the story I want us to try and think out loud in the what you think such so for what do you think am yeah Amy you can read for us so what do you think list three of the best decisions you have ever made so I'd like to start with om off the top of my head I would say that an important decision that I've made that it still sticks with me is was a time like immediately after covid was ending we had come to church and my parents don't work weren working in Nairobi at that time so it was just me and my sister here and we decided to let's see let's just stay for afternoon to see what happens and I think that really that really helped me and that was an important decision that I made wow so you you you you gained more after you stayed in church for afternoon session okay that's that's quite interesting marbra um I think the best decision that I have ever made is um not just recently when I actually decided to join choir I really like singing and I think that joining choir has really helped me grow a lot mostly in church and around serving God yeah amen amen your share or you can you can move on I can share you want to share okay yeah personally for me I think getting baptized was one of the best decisions I've ever made um I felt very fresh like I felt new when I left the waters so yeah and it has really helped me strengthen my walk with Christ yeah all right I think and I think and it's I think it's for all of us that that decision you know tops all other decisions that we probably have made in our lives accepting Christ in our lives thank you so uh there is there's a bit here that I want us to read that has some information that will teach us about something that is related to you know the story that we learn so am you still mind reading for us sorry barara read for us the Dido section um so the did you know comes from John 5 verse1 uh conveys the reason that Jesus was in Jerusalem was in Jerusalem was for a feast of the Jews there were the um there were three feasts that required all Jewish males to come to Jerusalem the Feast of Passover and unle bread the Feast of wigs also called Pentecost and the Feast of Tabernacles Jesus was attending one of these Feasts when he came to Jerusalem and healed the lame man by the pool thank you Barbara so that that bit will uh we'll come back to that because it's quite important uh the information that you've just read of uh why first of all why Jesus was uh there that time and the relation of the lesson to this bit so let's dive into the story um so I'll just try to summarize the story for us today uh the story talks about Jesus when he went to Jerusalem for a feast yes and he came to the pool which is called beider and there were many sick people there around that pool and Jesus just decided to approach one man who had stayed next to that pool for 38 years and he asked this man if he wanted to get well and this man though he he I guess he was kind of perplexed when asked this question because even if someone comes to me right now and I'm sick and they like do you want to get well I'll be like can you make me well and things like that and uh this man just took that leap of faith and decided to to um take Jesus on his word and got up and picked his mat and walked and on his way he met the Jewish leaders who uh asked him why he was carrying his M because according to Jewish Traditions no one was supposed to be doing anything or carrying whatever anything of their belongings it was just the Sabbath and obeying it and everything to do with that and so uh this man just answered them that the man who healed me told me to pick up my mat and walk and that is exactly what he did and so uh we come we come to learn that Jesus actually came to um see to our needs and heal us yes that's it all right thank you so much Barra uh the the full text that leads to that story I believe we mentioned which is John 5 uh from verse one to verse 23 but you know the story when Jesus answers answers is from verse 19 where he says that Jesus answered and said to them most surely I say to you the son can do nothing of himself but what he sees the father do for whatever he does the son also does in like manner um in relation to what we read earlier in Theo section uh we find that uh for him to be to have been at that pool Jesus was attending uh the feasts the three feasts that were mentioned and I'm sure for us who going to and those who will go through the lesson later on you will find out that uh it was to a Hebrew Jewish custom for the males to attend these three um feasts as they had been doing and since Jesus was raised uh in that time he knew about that culture or custom and uh We've also read that uh after he had done that Miracle they were you know teachers teachers of the law or we call them par who noticed what Jesus had done and according to them we also learned that uh their laws that they had added to the laws of Moses did not permit people to do such things if I can call it perform Miracles and do Deeds on the Sabbath but Jesus goes on and does it anyway and the lesson here I believe um is that the Deeds that we do on a Sabbath Deeds of Good Will and mercy is what he was trying to teach not only his disciples but those who received the you know the Miracles or they were blessed by The Miracles that they received and let's have a look at out of the out of the story section so that we can um further understand what that passage of John 51 to9 says okay in the out of the story section there are some questions that i' would like to go through the first is why did Jesus not assume this man desired healing so in order for us to understand this I'd like us to look at an illustration so there's a story Kurt shared one morning at his church um last week I was driving north on Pike Street in downtown seaso when I passed a homeless man sleeping in an alley he didn't have a blanket and it was below freezing even though the night was still young I couldn't shake that image in my mind Kurt posed to like Kurt paused to collect his emotion I worried he might freeze to death so I did a uten and went back to the alley I introduced myself and learned that his name was Ray I told him to come home and live with me until he could get back on his feet again or at least until the weather got back warmer Kurt went on to tell how Ray enjoyed a hot shower a big meal a warm bed and a key to the house with an invitation to stay However long he wanted to the irony of this story is that Ry only stayed at that house for two days and then he left and he scribbled a note on the paper which read something along the lines of thanks but I prefer to live on the streets so what I have picked from this is that not everybody essentially wants to be saved or wants to receive help of any kind and this brings me back to the question of Jesus asking do you want to get well not everybody wants healing just because they're there at the pool does not necessarily mean that they want to be picked up and helped so yeah all right thank you and the other question is what does this story teach us about Sabbath observance all right if I can comment on that um I believe we have read you know the laws uh or the Ten Commandments in Exodus 20 and specifically the one for the Sabbath uh if we can read it Exodus 20:8 which says remember the Sabbath day to keep it holy six days you shall labor and do all your work but the seventh day is the Sabbath of the Lord your God in it you shall do not work you nor your son nor your daughter nor your male servant nor your female servant nor your cattle nor your stranger who is with in your gates for in 6 days the Lord made the heavens and the earth and the Sea and all that is in them and rested the seventh day therefore the Lord blessed the Sabbath day and hallowed it yeah so that was Exodus 20 verse 8 to 11 sorry uh I believe um the interpretation of this law according to the Pharisees um involved doing nothing at all I don't know what exactly you were thinking about when this first says that you shall not do any work but I don't think doing good deeds is categorized as work per se because you know we understand work as something that we do to help ourselves uh cuz most of us or even if you're in school you work to get grades guys who are working in the corporate world work to get you know salary and stuff like that but what Jesus did to this uh lame man was I would say uh you know teaching the truth in love cuz to him he needed the help and the only way the lay man knew how to get that help was to dip himself into that water but when Jesus comes he asks this man if he needed help which he really knew by the way I think Christ already knew that this guy needed help and he goes on to help him and the lesson that comes after was that um do we believe that Christ is you know ready to actually give us that help are we are our hearts ready to accept that fact that in as much as we don't have you know the you know the tangible thing that you can see that this is actually help that we're seeing coming Christ says that this man believed he he didn't know at the time he didn't know cuz later we told that Christ met him and saw that he was doing okay and told him not to sin anymore but uh um at that point when Christ met him at where he needed help he believed and coming back to the question of uh what this was interpreted as I think it was just um you know more or less a misinterpretation of what Sabbath really entailed and I think we can learn that the Sabbath is not only a holy day and that was blessed and hallowed by God himself but it's a day that we should you know come back and look at what Christ did he's he's he's you know the ultimate teacher doing good deeds and uh you know offering that kind of help I don't think classifies as work but you know it's just the main lesson that I think we can learn from it yeah okay to add on that I think this story also shows or helps you understand Sabbath as being selfless when you're doing good deeds um because Jesus did not gain anything from helping this person he helped them and told them yeah pick up your back and go and I think that's how we should also view it um but we're doing good deeds for people especially on Sabbath because it does say or you not don't work nor your cattle nor your housemade and all of that um because you don't want to do something to gain profit for yourself you want to do something for someone because when you're selfless about it and you actually mean well for this person yeah all right thanks you to add a verse about this okay from it's Isaiah Chapter 58 verse 13 and 14 okay mainly 13 if you keep your feet from breaking the Sabbath and from doing as you please on my holy day if you call the Sabbath a delight and the Lord's holy day honorable and if you honor it by not going your own way and not doing as you please or speaking Idol words then you'll find joy in the Lord and I will cause you to ride in Triumph on the height of the land so over here it's talking about you know the Sabbath whatever you're doing on it just make sure you're not doing it for your own Delight like as she said Jesus wasn't benefiting by helping this man he was just doing it for him right thank you thank you so much uh that verse actually affirms what you both say and actually what Christ did um let's look at um the punchline uh let me read Hebrews 4:9 to11 there remains then a Sabbath rest for the people of God for everyone who enters God's rest also rests from their works just as God did from his let us therefore make every effort to enter the rest so that no one will perish by following the example of Disobedience I'll also read mark 2: 27 and 28 then he said to them the Sabbath was made for man not man for the Sabbath so the son of man is Lord even of the Sabbath amen so Omi let's look at the father inside speit okay uh the first is God has given new Commandments which cannot be obeyed by all his laws sanction no and reasonable or selfish or selfish restrictions this from The Desire of Ages page 204 and so I just wanted to highlight that this just shows you know the grace of God that even though he gave us Fair laws that we could follow and we chose not to follow them he then again sent his son to die for us that just shows you know how loving he is and the second is God's holy rest day was made for man and acts of Mercy are in perfect harmony with its intent this also from The Desire of Ages page 207 uh for the act of Mery you know just Mery said you're helping someone with help the they don't deserve for example here when Jesus helped this man at no gain to himself or yeah just on sabath just helping people yeah without G to yourself thank you very on on the first uh commentary that you read from the desire Ages page 204 just to add a comment on it um it's it's it's quite eminent of of how God as first of all showed us mercy and Grace and we need also to Remember by the way that God was selfless you know from the beginning cuz he had already made a plan to give up his son to save us and in turn all that is required from us is to believe that the works that Christ did on the cross is sufficient to save us uh and to redeem us for eternity yeah so anyone has a comment on that okay so as we close I would like us to you know probably just give one or two things that we learn or want to comment on that we can look at as we uh keep on uh learning from God's word in any in any order okay I could go first so I picked two very key lessons in this lesson one is how to observe the Sabbath and how whatever Deeds we do on Sabbath should be selfless and then the second thing that I have picked from here is you can only do so much for somebody you do your best to try and get help for them you do your best to try and help them but ultimately it is their own personal decision to choose to walk with Christ so yeah all right thank you um I think what I picked from this lesson was that the Sabbath is a delight and that um whenever we feel that we have fallen short of God's glory we should always go back to him and he is always merciful to answer yeah thank you bar uh what I've learned from this lesson is about how important the Sabbath can be to people who even if they're not you know following it you can go and you know use that time to give someone hope as give as Jesus give this man the L man hope so I think you keeping the Sabbath is benefiting I mean it's good for you of course in you're resting and participating in activities pertaining to God but it's also it's very good for the people that you you help during that day right thank you so much um we hope you enjoyed uh learning uh you know major major lesson from God's word and as we close I just like to remind us that Christ is always available and ready to help us all we need to uh do is accept his help believe that he has helped you and the blessing of you know of that goes a long way so um I think that's a wrap what I can just ask is that we can pray and probably um invite our viewers to keep watching this lessons because they you know they're really insightful and can help you as you uh keep on living your life and looking forward to Jesus so let me request Bara to pray for us as you close um let's go our heads for of prayer um merciful and ever living God we come before you this moment thanking you for allowing us to come before your presence and discuss this lesson together I hope that whoever is going to be watching this lesson uh will also benefit from it as much as we have oh dear lord and that we will both all walk in your presence when the day comes for you for your second coming in Jesus name I pray amen amen

TIMESTAMPED TRANSCRIPT:
[0.4s] welcome to this week's uh session for
[4.8s] the lesson discussion for Cornerstone
[8.3s] this is lesson three and together with
[11.2s] me here
[12.6s] isi from my left extreme left that is
[16.6s] barara and Amy myself I'm chumba and
[21.0s] before we can start let's
[23.2s] pray father thank you for this day as we
[26.1s] about to go through your reward we ask
[27.7s] that you guide us help us learn
[29.1s] something that will uh eternally help us
[32.5s] as we prepare for a second coming I pray
[35.1s] pray all this asking and believing in
[36.4s] Jesus name
[38.3s] amen all right so this week's lesson is
[43.0s] titled do you want to get well let us
[47.0s] start by reading the key
[50.2s] text our key text comes from John
[53.5s] chapter 5: 6 to 8 and it reads when
[58.7s] Jesus saw him lying there and learned
[60.7s] that he had been in this condition for a
[62.6s] long time he asked him do you want to
[65.4s] get well then Jesus said to him get up
[69.3s] pick up your mat and
[71.6s] walk thank you thank you I think you
[74.2s] guys are familiar with this story right
[77.0s] uh this is a lesson that is focused on
[80.2s] uh a really important uh aspect that you
[83.3s] can learn from this story from the Bible
[85.8s] when Jesus found this lame man lying
[89.2s] next to the pool pool
[92.1s] where they used to believe or they knew
[95.6s] that each time the pool was St you would
[98.5s] just dip yourself into it and You' be
[100.8s] healed and the interesting beit is we're
[104.0s] finding out that in as much as Jesus
[107.0s] found these guys cuz you know he wasn't
[109.4s] the only one there there are several
[111.0s] guys surrounding that pool and and as
[115.2s] much as he saw this guys in their
[118.1s] situation he still asked that question
[120.6s] do you want to get well so let's read
[123.3s] the flashlight the flashlight um says
[127.0s] the sick man was lying on his mat and
[129.0s] occasionally lifting his head to gaze at
[131.1s] the pool when a tender compassionate
[133.5s] face bends over him and the words wil
[136.5s] thou be made whole arrested his
[139.0s] attention hope came to his heart Jesus
[142.1s] does not ask this sufferer to exercise
[144.6s] faith in him he simply says rise up rise
[148.7s] take up thy bed and walk but the man's
[151.7s] Faith takes hold upon that word every
[154.4s] nerve and muscle Thrills with new life
[157.0s] and healthful action comes to his
[159.0s] crippled limbs these are of Ages Pages
[161.6s] 202 and 203 thank you so the the point
[167.7s] or what we um aiming to learn from this
[171.2s] is that uh one that there's real power
[176.5s] in God's healing uh to
[180.8s] uh you know God is readily available to
[183.1s] help us at our points of need and the
[185.5s] third thing I think that we should pay
[187.8s] attention to his the cost of sin versus
[190.9s] healing and freedom what does it all you
[193.8s] know
[195.4s] entail uh just before we go into the
[199.0s] story I want us to try and think out
[202.0s] loud in the what you think
[205.6s] such so for what do you think
[210.8s] am yeah Amy you can read for us so what
[213.4s] do you think list three of the best
[217.1s] decisions you have ever made so I'd like
[219.6s] to start with
[221.2s] om off the top of my head I would say
[225.3s] that an important decision that I've
[228.0s] made that it still sticks with me
[232.4s] is was a time like immediately after
[237.0s] covid was
[238.4s] ending we had come to church and my
[242.4s] parents don't work weren working in
[244.0s] Nairobi at that time so it was just me
[246.2s] and my sister
[247.6s] here and we decided to let's see let's
[251.7s] just stay for afternoon to see what
[254.5s] happens and I think that really that
[257.9s] really helped me and that was an
[259.8s] important decision that I made wow so
[263.2s] you you you you gained more after you
[265.9s] stayed in church for afternoon session
[269.5s] okay that's that's quite interesting
[272.3s] marbra um I think the best decision that
[275.7s] I have ever made is
[280.2s] um not just recently when I actually
[283.8s] decided to join choir I really like
[286.8s] singing and I think that joining choir
[290.9s] has really helped me grow a lot mostly
[294.1s] in church and around serving God yeah
[297.6s] amen amen your share or you can you can
[301.2s] move on I can share you want to share
[303.9s] okay yeah personally for me I think
[306.2s] getting baptized was one of the best
[309.0s] decisions I've ever made um I felt very
[312.4s] fresh like I felt new when I left the
[315.8s] waters so yeah and it has really helped
[319.1s] me strengthen my walk with Christ yeah
[321.9s] all right I think and I think and it's I
[324.4s] think it's for all of us that that
[326.3s] decision you know tops all other
[328.7s] decisions that we probably have made in
[330.8s] our lives accepting Christ in our lives
[333.9s] thank you so uh there is there's a bit
[336.3s] here that I want us to read that has
[339.0s] some information that will teach us
[341.2s] about something that is related to you
[343.7s] know the story that we learn
[346.1s] so am you still mind reading for us
[349.6s] sorry barara read for us the Dido
[352.6s] section um so the did you know comes
[355.3s] from John 5
[357.1s] verse1 uh conveys the reason that Jesus
[360.5s] was in
[361.7s] Jerusalem was in Jerusalem was for a
[364.4s] feast of the Jews there were
[368.6s] the um there were three feasts that
[371.8s] required all Jewish males to come to
[374.6s] Jerusalem the Feast of Passover and unle
[378.8s] bread the Feast of wigs also called
[383.0s] Pentecost and the Feast of Tabernacles
[386.7s] Jesus was attending one of these Feasts
[389.8s] when he came to Jerusalem and healed the
[392.0s] lame man by the
[394.2s] pool thank you Barbara so that that bit
[397.8s] will uh we'll come back to that because
[400.1s] it's quite important uh the information
[402.7s] that you've just read of uh why first of
[407.5s] all why Jesus was
[409.9s] uh there that
[412.0s] time and the relation of the lesson to
[416.6s] this bit so let's dive into the story um
[420.0s] so I'll just try to summarize the story
[423.3s] for us today uh the story talks about
[427.0s] Jesus when he went to Jerusalem for a
[430.0s] feast yes and he came to the pool which
[435.2s] is called
[436.5s] beider and there were many sick people
[440.8s] there around that pool and Jesus just
[444.1s] decided to approach one man who had
[446.8s] stayed next to that pool for 38 years
[451.0s] and he asked this man if he wanted to
[454.7s] get well and this man though he he I
[459.9s] guess he was kind of perplexed when
[462.1s] asked this question because even if
[464.8s] someone comes to me right now and I'm
[466.4s] sick and they like do you want to get
[468.5s] well I'll be like can you make me well
[471.4s] and things like that and uh this man
[476.2s] just took that leap of faith and decided
[479.2s] to to um take Jesus on his word and got
[484.3s] up and picked his mat and walked and on
[488.4s] his way he met the Jewish leaders
[492.3s] who uh asked him why he was carrying his
[495.6s] M because according to Jewish Traditions
[498.6s] no one was supposed to be doing anything
[500.9s] or carrying whatever anything of their
[504.6s] belongings it was just the Sabbath and
[506.6s] obeying it and everything to do with
[509.0s] that and so uh this man just answered
[513.4s] them that the man who healed me told me
[516.4s] to pick up my mat and walk and that is
[519.7s] exactly what he did and so uh we come we
[524.1s] come to learn that Jesus actually came
[527.3s] to
[528.9s] um see to our needs and heal us yes
[533.9s] that's it all right thank you so much
[536.3s] Barra uh the the full text that leads to
[540.2s] that story I believe we mentioned which
[542.3s] is John 5 uh from verse one to verse 23
[548.2s] but you know the story when Jesus
[550.0s] answers answers is from verse 19 where
[554.4s] he says that Jesus answered and said to
[556.6s] them most surely I say to you the son
[559.6s] can do nothing of himself but what he
[562.8s] sees the father do for whatever he does
[565.3s] the son also does in like manner
[570.7s] um in relation to what we read earlier
[574.0s] in Theo section uh we find
[578.1s] that uh for him to be to have been at
[582.4s] that pool Jesus was attending uh the
[585.6s] feasts the three feasts that were
[587.8s] mentioned
[590.0s] and I'm sure for us who going to and
[592.7s] those who will go through the lesson
[594.3s] later on you will find out that uh it
[597.4s] was to a Hebrew Jewish custom for the
[602.5s] males to attend these three um feasts as
[607.4s] they had been doing and since Jesus was
[610.4s] raised uh in that time he knew about
[613.7s] that culture or
[615.6s] custom and
[618.2s] uh We've also read that uh after he had
[623.2s] done that Miracle they were you know
[627.1s] teachers teachers of the law or we call
[628.9s] them par
[630.3s] who noticed what Jesus had done and
[633.6s] according to them we also learned that
[638.2s] uh their laws that they had added to the
[641.3s] laws of Moses did not permit people to
[644.1s] do such things if I can call it perform
[647.0s] Miracles and do Deeds on the Sabbath but
[651.7s] Jesus goes on and does it anyway and the
[654.0s] lesson here I believe um is that
[660.0s] the Deeds that we do on a
[662.3s] Sabbath Deeds of Good Will and mercy is
[666.6s] what he was trying to teach not only his
[668.7s] disciples but those who received the you
[671.8s] know the Miracles or they were blessed
[675.0s] by The Miracles that they
[676.8s] received
[678.7s] and let's have a look at out of the out
[681.5s] of the story section so that we can um
[685.3s] further understand what that passage of
[688.0s] John 51 to9
[689.8s] says
[691.4s] okay in the out of the story section
[694.3s] there are some questions that i' would
[696.7s] like to go
[698.0s] through the first is why did Jesus not
[702.4s] assume this man desired healing so in
[705.0s] order for us to understand this I'd like
[708.7s] us to look at an illustration so there's
[711.4s] a story Kurt shared one morning at his
[714.6s] church um last week I was driving north
[717.6s] on Pike Street in downtown seaso when I
[721.4s] passed a homeless man sleeping in an
[723.3s] alley he didn't have a blanket and it
[725.6s] was below freezing even though the night
[728.2s] was still young I couldn't shake that
[730.7s] image in my mind Kurt posed to like Kurt
[734.7s] paused to collect his emotion I worried
[737.7s] he might freeze to death so I did a uten
[739.9s] and went back to the alley I introduced
[742.2s] myself and learned that his name was Ray
[744.8s] I told him to come home and live with me
[747.0s] until he could get back on his feet
[748.7s] again or at least until the weather got
[751.3s] back warmer Kurt went on to
[755.0s] tell how Ray enjoyed a hot shower a big
[758.5s] meal a warm bed and a key to the house
[762.3s] with an invitation to stay However long
[764.1s] he wanted to the irony of this story is
[767.2s] that Ry only stayed at that house for
[770.2s] two days and then he left and he
[773.9s] scribbled a note on the paper which read
[776.0s] something along the lines of thanks but
[778.1s] I prefer to live on the streets
[782.0s] so what I have picked from this is that
[784.7s] not everybody essentially wants to be
[787.1s] saved or wants to receive help of any
[790.7s] kind and this brings me back to the
[792.9s] question of Jesus asking do you want to
[796.3s] get well not everybody wants healing
[799.5s] just because they're there at the pool
[801.4s] does not necessarily mean that they want
[802.8s] to be picked up and helped so
[806.3s] yeah all right thank you
[810.7s] and the other question
[812.9s] is what does this story teach us about
[816.3s] Sabbath
[820.0s] observance all right if I can comment on
[822.4s] that
[823.8s] um I
[826.0s] believe we have
[828.8s] read you know the laws uh or the Ten
[832.1s] Commandments in Exodus 20 and
[835.2s] specifically the one for the Sabbath uh
[837.7s] if we can read it Exodus
[845.9s] 20:8 which
[848.0s] says remember the Sabbath day to keep it
[850.5s] holy six days you shall labor and do all
[852.9s] your work but the seventh day is the
[854.9s] Sabbath of the Lord your God in it you
[857.6s] shall do not work you nor your son nor
[861.9s] your daughter nor your male servant nor
[864.2s] your female servant nor your cattle nor
[867.4s] your stranger who is with in your gates
[870.0s] for in 6 days the Lord made the heavens
[872.5s] and the earth and the Sea and all that
[876.0s] is in them and rested the seventh day
[879.2s] therefore the Lord blessed the Sabbath
[880.8s] day and hallowed it yeah so that was
[884.3s] Exodus 20 verse 8 to 11 sorry
[890.1s] uh I believe
[894.8s] um the interpretation of this law
[899.5s] according
[900.5s] to the
[902.7s] Pharisees
[904.4s] um involved doing nothing at all I don't
[908.5s] know what exactly you were thinking
[910.4s] about when this first says that you
[913.8s] shall not do any work but I don't think
[918.3s] doing good deeds is categorized as work
[921.4s] per se because you know we understand
[925.0s] work as something that we do
[927.4s] to help ourselves
[930.4s] uh cuz most of us or even if you're in
[934.2s] school you work to get grades guys who
[937.8s] are working in the corporate world work
[939.4s] to get you know salary and stuff like
[941.6s] that
[943.3s] but what Jesus did to this uh lame man
[949.0s] was I would say uh you know teaching the
[954.6s] truth in love
[957.4s] cuz to him
[960.1s] he needed the help and the only way the
[962.7s] lay man knew how to get that help was to
[965.6s] dip himself into that water but when
[967.6s] Jesus comes he asks this man if he
[970.5s] needed help which he really knew by the
[972.6s] way I think Christ already knew that
[974.7s] this guy needed help and he goes on to
[977.8s] help him and the lesson that comes after
[980.6s] was that um do we believe
[986.6s] that Christ is you know ready to
[990.4s] actually give us that help are we are
[993.4s] our hearts ready to accept that fact
[995.7s] that in as much as we don't have you
[1000.3s] know the you know the tangible thing
[1002.8s] that you can see that this is actually
[1005.0s] help that we're seeing coming Christ
[1006.7s] says that this man
[1008.5s] believed he he didn't know at the time
[1010.9s] he didn't know cuz later we told that
[1013.4s] Christ met him and saw that he was doing
[1015.6s] okay and told him not to sin anymore but
[1018.7s] uh
[1019.4s] um at that point when Christ met him at
[1023.1s] where he needed help he believed and
[1025.6s] coming back to the question of
[1029.1s] uh what this was interpreted as I think
[1033.2s] it was just
[1035.2s] um you know more or less a
[1038.0s] misinterpretation of what Sabbath really
[1041.0s] entailed and I think we can learn that
[1043.2s] the Sabbath is not only a holy day and
[1046.6s] that was blessed and hallowed by God
[1048.5s] himself
[1049.4s] but it's a day that we should you know
[1052.2s] come back and look at what Christ
[1054.8s] did he's he's he's you know the ultimate
[1059.7s] teacher doing good deeds and uh you know
[1064.5s] offering that kind of help I don't think
[1068.1s] classifies as work but you know it's
[1071.8s] just the main lesson that I think we can
[1073.4s] learn from it yeah okay to add on that I
[1077.0s] think this story also
[1079.7s] shows or helps you understand Sabbath
[1083.0s] as being selfless when you're doing good
[1086.7s] deeds um because Jesus did not gain
[1090.8s] anything
[1092.7s] from helping this person he helped them
[1097.3s] and told them yeah pick up your back and
[1099.6s] go and I think that's how we should also
[1102.6s] view it um but we're doing good deeds
[1105.8s] for people especially on Sabbath because
[1107.6s] it does say or you not don't work nor
[1111.1s] your cattle nor your housemade and all
[1113.2s] of
[1114.6s] that um because you don't want to do
[1118.8s] something to gain profit for yourself
[1121.5s] you want to do something for someone
[1123.4s] because when you're selfless about it
[1125.9s] and you actually mean well for this
[1127.8s] person yeah all right
[1131.2s] thanks you to add a verse about this
[1135.2s] okay from it's Isaiah Chapter 58 verse
[1139.2s] 13 and
[1140.8s] 14 okay mainly 13 if you keep your feet
[1144.2s] from breaking the Sabbath and from doing
[1147.0s] as you please on my holy day if you call
[1149.9s] the Sabbath a delight and the Lord's
[1153.6s] holy day honorable and if you honor it
[1156.1s] by not going your own way and not doing
[1159.2s] as you please or speaking Idol words
[1161.9s] then you'll find joy in the Lord and I
[1164.6s] will cause you to ride in Triumph on the
[1167.4s] height of the land
[1170.1s] so over here it's talking about you know
[1173.0s] the
[1173.8s] Sabbath whatever you're doing on it just
[1176.8s] make sure you're not doing it for your
[1179.0s] own Delight like as she said Jesus
[1183.2s] wasn't benefiting by helping this man he
[1185.6s] was just doing it for
[1187.3s] him right thank you thank you so much uh
[1190.6s] that verse actually affirms what you
[1192.8s] both say and actually what Christ
[1195.8s] did
[1197.6s] um let's look at um the
[1202.2s] punchline
[1205.8s] uh let me read Hebrews 4:9
[1210.6s] to11 there remains then a Sabbath rest
[1213.8s] for the people of God for everyone who
[1217.4s] enters God's rest also rests from their
[1220.6s] works just as God did from his let us
[1224.4s] therefore make every effort to enter the
[1226.8s] rest so that no one will perish by
[1229.8s] following the example of Disobedience
[1232.8s] I'll also read mark 2: 27 and 28 then he
[1237.6s] said to them the Sabbath was made for
[1239.8s] man not man for the Sabbath so the son
[1243.4s] of man is Lord even of the Sabbath
[1247.2s] amen so Omi let's look at the father
[1251.2s] inside speit
[1254.2s] okay uh the first is God has given new
[1258.0s] Commandments which cannot be obeyed by
[1261.5s] all his laws sanction no and reasonable
[1265.3s] or selfish or selfish restrictions this
[1269.5s] from The Desire of Ages page
[1274.1s] 204 and so I just wanted to highlight
[1276.8s] that this just shows you know the grace
[1279.4s] of God that even though he gave us Fair
[1282.3s] laws that we could follow and we chose
[1285.5s] not to follow them he then again sent
[1288.0s] his son to die for us that just shows
[1291.2s] you know how loving he
[1293.4s] is and the second is God's holy rest day
[1297.3s] was made for man and acts of Mercy are
[1301.6s] in perfect harmony with its intent this
[1306.2s] also from The Desire of Ages page
[1310.5s] 207 uh for the act of Mery you know
[1314.5s] just Mery said you're helping someone
[1318.0s] with help the they don't
[1320.1s] deserve for example here when Jesus
[1323.1s] helped this man at no gain to
[1325.6s] himself or yeah just on sabath just
[1328.7s] helping
[1330.1s] people yeah without G to yourself thank
[1333.5s] you very on on the
[1336.3s] first uh commentary that you read from
[1339.1s] the desire Ages page 204 just to add a
[1341.7s] comment on it um it's it's it's quite
[1345.4s] eminent of of how God
[1349.3s] as first of all showed us mercy and
[1352.3s] Grace
[1354.5s] and we need also to Remember by the way
[1357.7s] that God was
[1360.2s] selfless you know from the beginning cuz
[1362.5s] he had already made a plan to give up
[1364.5s] his son to save us and in turn all that
[1369.0s] is required from us is to
[1371.2s] believe that the works that Christ did
[1374.3s] on the cross is sufficient to save us
[1378.7s] uh and to redeem us for eternity yeah so
[1382.9s] anyone has a comment on
[1385.3s] that okay so as we close I would like us
[1389.7s] to you
[1390.8s] know probably just give one or two
[1393.4s] things that we learn or want to comment
[1396.6s] on that we
[1399.1s] can look at as we
[1402.4s] uh keep on uh learning from God's word
[1409.1s] in any in any order okay I could go
[1411.7s] first so I picked two very key lessons
[1415.6s] in this lesson one
[1418.7s] is how to observe the Sabbath
[1423.2s] and how whatever Deeds we do on Sabbath
[1427.5s] should be selfless and then the second
[1430.1s] thing that I have picked from here is
[1432.7s] you can only do so much for somebody you
[1435.8s] do your best to try and get help for
[1439.2s] them you do your best to try and help
[1441.1s] them but ultimately it is their own
[1443.8s] personal decision to choose to walk with
[1445.8s] Christ so yeah all right thank you um I
[1450.4s] think what I picked from this lesson was
[1453.1s] that the Sabbath is a delight and that
[1457.0s] um whenever we feel that we have fallen
[1460.1s] short of God's glory we should always go
[1462.8s] back to him and he is always merciful to
[1466.2s] answer yeah thank you bar
[1470.2s] uh what I've learned from this lesson is
[1473.6s] about how
[1475.4s] important the
[1477.2s] Sabbath can be to people who even if
[1480.3s] they're not you know following it you
[1482.8s] can go and you know use that time to
[1485.8s] give someone hope as give as Jesus give
[1488.6s] this man the L man hope so I think you
[1492.8s] keeping the Sabbath is benefiting I mean
[1495.9s] it's good for you of course in you're
[1497.6s] resting and participating in activities
[1500.4s] pertaining to God but it's also it's
[1502.8s] very good for the people that you you
[1504.8s] help during that
[1506.9s] day right thank you so much um we hope
[1511.8s] you enjoyed uh
[1514.4s] learning uh you know major major lesson
[1517.7s] from God's word and as we close I just
[1521.5s] like to remind us that Christ is always
[1526.8s] available and ready to help us
[1529.0s] all we need to uh do is accept his help
[1532.5s] believe that he has helped you
[1536.0s] and the blessing of you know of that
[1539.2s] goes a long way so
[1543.7s] um I think that's a wrap what I can just
[1547.1s] ask is
[1548.2s] that we can pray and probably
[1554.6s] um invite our viewers to keep watching
[1558.0s] this lessons because they you know
[1560.2s] they're really insightful and can help
[1562.9s] you as you uh keep on living your life
[1566.5s] and looking forward to Jesus so let me
[1570.6s] request Bara to pray for us as you close
[1573.6s] um let's go our heads for of prayer um
[1576.4s] merciful and ever living God we come
[1578.5s] before you this moment thanking you for
[1581.8s] allowing us to come before your presence
[1584.4s] and discuss this lesson together I hope
[1587.8s] that whoever is going to be watching
[1590.1s] this lesson uh will also benefit from it
[1593.6s] as much as we have oh dear lord and that
[1596.4s] we will both all walk in your presence
[1600.0s] when the day comes for you for your
[1602.2s] second coming in Jesus name I pray amen
[1605.0s] amen
