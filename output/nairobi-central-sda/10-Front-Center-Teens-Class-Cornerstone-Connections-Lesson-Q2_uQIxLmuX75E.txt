FULL TRANSCRIPT:
Hi, welcome to today's Cornerstone Connections lesson. My name is Natasha and I'll be doing the mission reading which comes from Thailand titled Rich Kids. Renato moved far far away from his home in Brazil to become a missionary in Thailand. He teaches a 100 children in the fourth grade at a seventh day school in Bangkok. While Ranata was still at home in Brazil, he prayed and prayed about becoming a missionary. When he received an invitation to become a missionary teacher in Thailand, he thought that God had answered his prayers. But when he arrived in Thailand, he wasn't sure. He had always thought that missionaries were supposed to teach poor people about Jesus. But the children at his new school weren't poor. They were rich kids. All of them came from wealthy families. Their daddies and mommies were ambassadors, models, and soccer players. Renato was confused. Why had God allowed him to come to Thailand? He prayed to serve. He prayed, "God, did you want me to travel 10,000 miles to serve rich people? Many there were there are many people in Brazil who need my help. Why did you bring me here?" Then came Ranato's first day as a teacher at the school. He felt a little scared. He felt a little nervous all over. But somehow he managed to get through the day. The next day he decided to eat with the children in the school cafeteria. He wanted to hear what the children were talking about. He wanted to make new friends. Ranato was went through the line and received a bowl of noodles. Then he sat down at a table with a group of fourth graders from his class. Usually Ranato also always folded his hands to pray. But on this day, he stretched out his hands with the palms facing up. He wasn't sure why he prayed that way. He just did. Dear God, he prayed silently. Thank you for this food. Please bless it. When he opened his eyes, he saw that one of his new students, a 9-year-old girl, was staring at him intently. When he when he saw that he was when she saw that he was looking at him, she spoke up. "What were you doing?" she asked. "I was praying," he said. The girl looked puzzled. "But you can't pray like that," she said. "You need to fold your hands." The girl, like many of the 1,500 children at the school, came from a non-Christian home. No one prayed to God of he to the God of heaven at her home. Everything that she knew about praying to God had been taught at the school. Her previous teacher had taught her to close her h her eyes and fold her hands when she prayed. And now she couldn't understand why Ranato had closed his eyes but hadn't folded his hands. Does God listen to this kind of prayer? She said, "For sure," Ranato said with a big smile. He listens to everyone. I have prayed driving a car with open eyes. Shock and amazement flashed across the girl's face. Can you pray with open eyes? She said. Renato's smile grew bigger. I've prayed while cooking, he said. I've prayed while working out. The girl's shock and amazement grew even bigger. Renato decided to have some fun. He said that he had even prayed to God in the bathroom. What? The girl exclaimed. Can God hear you there? God can hear you everywhere, Renato said. He's just waiting for you to talk to him. Sometimes he talks to you even though you don't talk to him. Sometimes he talk to you even if you don't talk to him. But you can pray to him everywhere, even with eyes, open eyes and open hands. The girl didn't say anything. She was so shocked and amazed that she didn't even blink. After a long moment of silence, she got up and left the table. She had a lot to think about. At that moment, Ranato realized why God had sent him to Thailand. Rich kids also needed to know about God. Being a missionary wasn't only about sharing the God God's love with the poor people. Being a missionary was about sharing God's love with everyone everywhere. Pray for Adventist missionaries like Renato at Echamay International School in Thailand as they share God's love with everyone around the world. Thank you for your 13th Sabbath offering this quarter that will help more kids know about the God who hears prayers everywhere. We will sing song number 382. Oh day of rest and gladness, oh day of rest and gladness, oh day of joy and light, oh bal of care and sadness, most beautiful, most bright. on thee thigh and lowly who bend before the throne. Sing holy, holy, holy to the eternal one. Thou art a port, protected from storms that round us rise. A garden intercepted with streams of paradise. Thou art a cooling fountain in life dry sand. From thee like pisa's mountain we view a promised land. A day of sweet reflection. Thou art a day of love, a day to raise affection from earth to things above. New graces ever gaining from this a day of rest. We seek the rest remaining in mansions of the blessed. Welcome to lesson number 10, front and center. And um before we begin, I'd like uh my fellow panelists to introduce themselves from my left. Hi, my name is Sid. Hi, my name is Natasha Buya. Hi, my name is Javan. Um, thank you very much. Um, I'd like Joan to pray with us as we begin. Okay, let's have a word of prayer. Eternal and everlasting master, we become come before this afternoon with us good in our hearts. Oh Lord, as this lesson, oh Lord, please be with us. Help us to get something that you can gain to help us in our day-to-day lives. We sinners, forgive us all our sins and trespasses, make us all before thee, oh Lord, just may praise trusting and believing. Amen. Amen. Um, thank you very much. Now it is said that um you can know what someone is about by the amount of time they spend um doing something and you can also know someone by what makes them easily angered. Okay. Now um in this in this lesson um of course we see um a scenario where people get angry um people expect people to be doing certain things on certain days and uh we want to see um what should be front and center um basically with with regards to to what is going on um in this particular except now um Sid I just want us to go directly into the what do you think section ction. Um, and I want you to to analyze with us um, what is likely to to make you more angry or less angry or what amount of anger do you project to some of these instances that we've been given here. [Music] Um, so the the numbers there therefore either you act slowly or immediately out of impulse I'd say. Mhm. Um uh the children being mistreated Mhm. would be like four. Mhm. Cuz it's wrong. Yeah. It's gotten my attention, but then also I feel like if I act out of impulse, then I'll end up doing something that will get me in trouble. But what would what would anger me most would be the children being mistreated. children being mistreated. Mhm. Because I feel like they don't deserve what what what they're receiving. Like they're not meant to be mistreated. Even if they they, you know, they they do something, they like break plates or something, they don't deserve to be mistreated because they don't fully understand what they're doing. So, I'd say that that would anger me most. Anger you most. Okay. What about individuals lying to protect their interests? Um that that wouldn't really bother me cuz I feel like it's you know it's up to them. It's a personal decision. So if you if you're in trouble with the in the law, you lie to to get yourself out of trouble. that's not really up to me to to to get I wouldn't really get annoyed cuz it's not doesn't really affect me. Okay. Um what about probably maybe the underprivileged being um neglected is closely tied to children maybe. Um in your estimation um do you think that will be as important? Would you be angered if you see underprivileged being neglected? [Music] Um, it all you know it depends on the person on the underprivileged person because you know there are homeless people that tend to use like if you give a homeless person money they'll they may end up using it for drugs or something. M. So it it really it depends on the the the underprivileged person. So I' I'd put that maybe at like three or four like somewhere in between. Cuz it would catch my attention. I may get angry or I may not get angry. Okay. Now to basically just loop it um with what is happening um in the context of this story um do you think the leaders in the church had uh had um maybe an option of being angry at what Christ did? Did they were they were they out of place to to get angry or were they interfering? I wouldn't say they were out of place because they like they didn't know that this truly was the son of God. So I wouldn't say that they were out of place to get angry, but they also pushed it a bit too much. Too much. Okay. Yeah. Thank you. Thank you very much um Sid for that. Now we are eager to get to know what is actually happening um in this context. We need to just find out what is at the front and and the center. So Javan if you can just briefly um explain to us what is happening in this particular context. Okay. uh in this story we get that Jesus was asking a question to the people if it's lawful to heal on the Sabbath or do good or but to do good on the Sabbath or do evil in the Sabbath and he added another question that if your sheep fell into a well on a Sabbath will you help it or not and obviously the people will say that they will help it. So Jesus asked them, "So why isn't it why isn't it good to help some a person on the Sabbath? Because the person is more important on on the Sabbath." And Jesus went on to heal the the the person. So the Pharisees to another in another instance, the Pharisees tried were looking at him, waiting for him to do a wrong thing so that they could persecute him. Because in the the Jews had this custom of not doing anything in the Sabbath, just pure worshiing. So they were waiting for him to do something bad on the Sabbath. Then Jesus posed the question, is it good to do good or evil in the Sabbath? So in my view, uh if you can help somebody in the Sabbath, Mhm. then go ahead, you can help. If you if it's if it's out of your power then well and okay we can consider that but if it's in your power that you can help somebody during the Sabbath then you can go ahead help somebody in the in the Sabbath so that if anything suppose anything happens to that person in the future you won't blame yourself or be judged accordingly to whatever you did. So I think it's okay to help to do good. My choice will be it's it's okay to do good in the Sabbath and not do evil. So throughout I think throughout this week's lesson we can see there's um tension between thinking about what we should do and and and what we should not do. And um and this is it brews tension between Christ um and the Pharisees who are maybe regarded as the as the keepers of the law. Um well there are many who pretty much brand Christianity as um what not to do. Yi it's a list of things uh not to do. And I think there's um an illustration in the lesson here whereby um there's there's a young man who's furious and he's saying I mean about this other thing why don't you just tell me what not to do and and I will be good. Okay. So but Christ says I mean it's not it's not really about the what um you're not supposed to do but what is actually the Sabbath is about when you learn what the Sabbath is about. um whereby we told here that uh the gracious creator after the six days of creation rested on the Sabbath day and instituted the Sabbath for all people as a memorial of of creation. So the Pharisees did not view the Sabbath as Christ viewed it. They just viewed it as a day of catching people not doing what they were they were actually supposed to do. And then and this brings in um a lot of tension. So uh Sid I think you can read for us the key text so that um we analyze um the context further. Uh the key text is from Mark 3 and 4. It says Jesus said to the man with a shriveled handstand up in front of everyone. Then Jesus asked them which is lawful on the Sabbath to do good or to do evil to save life or to kill? But they remained silent. M so you guys when you read that text um given what Javan has already explained to us what is happening what did you deduce from this part if I may just read it again Jesus said to them uh sorry to the man with a shivered uh the shriveled hand stand up in front of everyone. Then Jesus asked them, "Which is lawful on the Sabbath? To do good or to do evil, to save life or to kill?" But they remained silent. Why? Why do you think they remained silent? Why? What? What was happening here? What What is the context that Mark is trying to is trying to give us here? Said, "What do you think?" Um, I'd say they remained silent because at that moment they they saw what Jesus was trying to illustrate to them. Mhm. Um, they they saw that it's better to to do good. Mhm. Uh than to do evil on the Sabbath. M and that the they it's like their ego had been humbled and they had nothing to say about it. Yeah. Mhm. Natasha, you want to try? Um what I can say from the verse, they remained silent because they were thinking of what they had been doing in the Sabbath. If they really were well doing good or doing evil, were they really saving lives or killing? Thank you very much, Javan. What do you think? Okay. Uh in this I think that uh they were their minds were opened because when reading lesson five, uh I had I read that the truth hurts. The truth hurts. So they thought that they were doing doing good in the Sabbath, but in the real sense they not doing good. as you've just said that what the the Sabbath to the to them was like a day of trying to get people doing the wrong thing. Um they finally saw that whatever they were doing was not supposed to be done in the Sabbath. So as you have just said the the ego was humbled and in this context that the truth hurts the truth hurts them. Uh when you know when you know that you're not doing the right thing and you thought it's the right thing. M yeah it hurts. Yeah. And I think the truth that hurt the most in this particular excerpt was verse four. The the very last part um where Christ asked them which is lawful on the Sabbath to do good or to do evil? To save life or to kill. Essentially Christ had just healed someone. Okay. He had done good. But when you read in the context these guys actually wanted to kill Christ almost immediately. So in fact it was just basically ask them asking them rather that I as Christ has done good by healing this guy but you guys want to do evil by actually plotting to to kill me and therefore he actually exposed them and that's how they ended up remaining u remaining silent basically. So they were they were embarrassed because Christ had read the purposes of of their hearts. Um they had taken the Sabbath to be a list of things not to do and and and that obliterated what the Sabbath was actually meant for. The Sabbath was meant to be a commemoration of the creation and it was a day to pretty much do good as much as as you can and and that's why at the beginning of the excerpt Christ actually drew a parallel um in between a business and a human being. I mean if you if you saving your business on a Sabbath or or a donkey on a Sabbath um how much more then will you be zealous to actually save human life? So these guys were pretty much concentrated on on the what not to do as compared to actually doing good um on the Sabbath. Now um I want us to um pretty much go into um what the spirit of prophecy is um trying to say um about this particular excerpt and I'll invite you Natasha to just um give us an overview of what the flashlight is telling us in this um concept context. Well, the flashlight from the desire of ages, paragraph 287, it says, "In the healing of the withered hand, Jesus condemned the custom of the Jews and left the fourth and left the fourth commandment standing as God had given it. It is lawful to do well on the Sabbath days. He declared, "By sweeping away the senseless the senseless restrictions of the Jews, Christ honored the Sabbath while those who complained of him were dishonoring God's holy day." So, so therefore, we see that um there's a way you can dishonor God's day while you think that you are actually honoring it. Um and and and then it borrows back to the to the context whereby we were told do we actually know what the what the essence of of the Sabbath is. Uh the Sabbath was basically for commemorating um creation and um communion with with God. And of course when you commune with God you will always be thinking um good and and and technically not not evil. And therefore we are seeing here that these guys um Christ when Christ actually healed the the guy who had the withered hand he he condemned the customs of the Jews. Um in fact there was one that was saying you know there's a certain length you're not supposed to like walk on on a Sabbath day. And uh on another instance, they actually accused the disciples of Christ of even uh eating on on a Sabbath. They went into someone's shamba and they were they were getting something to eat. So these guys had extremes. um they had a list of what not to do and uh even in life when we have a list of what not to do we end up forgetting the essence of of of the day and that and that pretty much um swallows up um what what the Sabbath was was meant to do. Um there's another quote um I think the desire of ages page 285 um whereby it says that the object of God's work in this world is the redemption of men. Therefore that which is necessary to be done on the Sabbath in the accomplishment of his work is in accordance to to the Sabbath law. So these guys did not technically understand um what the Sabbath law was was actually about. Um and back to you Javan. I think um given this um this context, how will you describe the the reaction of the Jewish leaders to what Christ does in the in the synagogue? Um being that they focused more on the ex more on what not to do. Mhm. Um and Jesus was doing was was doing contrary to the list that they made. Um basic they they were annoyed because in their I think in their history I don't think they ever saw anybody like Jesus doing the thing that he's doing on the Sabbath. Um and being that they they wanted to kill him means that they were annoyed. And each time that Jesus was being the good um they their lo to Jesus even grew more. So I think that the the priests were annoyed with Jesus because they were angry. They were furious. Yeah. They were furious. M then um when when you when you read this uh particular excerpt when Christ said if any of you has a sheep and it falls into a pit on the Sabbath, will you not take a hold of it and lift it out? So how much more valuable is a man more than sheep? What is the central point um in this particular exchange with um with these guys? Natasha, what do you think? What what what is the central point when Christ compared uh these two instances? Okay. When Christ compared saving a sheep to saving man cuz as we know man is more valuable than than the sheep. So what the central part of it was that okay the sheep can be used for business as they as they it was used for business and also for wealth back in those days. So it was the central part was that saving a life is more important than saving a business or just saving your wealth. M in other words, we are ought we ought to do good to one another especially um on on the Sabbath day. Um now the other the other question was um what would you say is the primary purpose of the Sabbath according to this story? Sid, what do you think is the primary purpose of the Sabbath according to this story? Um, I'd say according to this story, the primary purpose of the Sabbath is um, you know, keeping keeping God's word and then um, doing good and not evil cuz you can you can serve God by helping others. M I don't remember there was a verse there's a verse in the Bible that talks about um how was it Jesus Jesus said you I was sick and you you came to visit me I was hungry and you fed me I was naked and you clothed me so helping doing good to um people would be considered um like I would say is a good. Um, it's one of the purposes of the Sabbath. Amen. Amen. Thank you very much for that. Now, Javan, I just want you to maybe briefly just take us through the punchlines and how they relate with um what you see um in this particular story um with regards to to the Sabbath day. Okay, I'll read the first paragraph, then Natasha will read the second. Then if you don't mind read the third, then CD read the fourth. Mhm. So the first one comes from Exodus 20:8 to 11. Mhm. Remember the Sabbath day to keep it holy. Six days you shall labor and do all your work. But the seventh day is the Sabbath of the Lord your God. In it you may work and you shall not do any work. you you and your you or your son or your daughter, your male or your female servant or your cattle, who who stays with you for six days. The Lord made the the heavens and the earth, the sea, and all that is in them, and rested on the seventh day. Therefore, the Lord blessed the Sabbath day and made it holy. Amen. I should read the next one. The next punch line comes from the book of Isaiah 56:E2. It says, "Blessed is the man who does this and the son of man who holds it fast, who keeps the Sabbath, not profounding it and keeps his hand from doing any evil." Amen. Um the other one is Mark 2:27 and 28 and it reads, "Then Jesus said to them, the Sabbath was made to meet the needs of the people and not the people to meet the requirements of the Sabbath." So the son of man is Lord even over the Sabbath. And uh the fourth one is keep my Sabbath as holy rest signpost between me and you signaling that I am God your God. That's Ezekiel 20:20. Um, so uh what what has caught my attention is the one that you have read Mark 27 and 28. And I'll take this part and the Sabbath was made to meet the requirements of the need of the needs of the people and not to meet the requirements of the Sabbath. So um in this context I get that uh you're supposed to the Sabbath is all about helping others and not and not trying to do what the what the priests the priests were doing because they were trying to meet to meet the requirements of the Sabbath and not to meet the needs of the people and we can see that Jesus was trying to do that he wouldn't see a sick person and pass him like that. He will try and get out of his way and help him. And so in our daily lives, we need to try as much as possible in anything that we can do, we help others, no matter what the circumstance, no matter even the day it is, we must try our best and do good to others. uh if anybody has another addition they can add. Okay. Oh, thank you very much uh for that. A question I'd like to ask is um now that we've seen and maybe we've had a scope of understanding on um what can go on on a Sabbath. So besides you know when we come maybe to church on Sabbath um of course there's like some discussion then there's like normal worship. So the question I'll pose to the fellow panelist is um what other activities um can we do on the Sabbath to to fulfill this particular um command and accept? What do you guys think? What other activities can we do on a Sabbath so that um it at least qualifies to what Christ was trying to do as opposed to what the Pharisees were trying to do? it. Um, I'd say going out [Music] to to spread the word to the people on the streets. You could go give them um maybe a Bible, pray with them like that would that would compensate sort of for the Sabbath. Okay. Natasha, what what activities do you think? Um, first I would say like when we look back at the story of Christ, his life when he was on earth, he didn't just on the Sabbath, he didn't just come sit in church or just sit in the pullpit. He also went out spreading the word and helping people. So the activities I would I would do suggestively to myself would be like go out to something like a children's home or on the streets when you see the beggars at least have something to give them on the Sabbath. Yes. Amen. That's that's wonderful. Javan, what would you do on the Sabbath other than just congregating for worship and study? I mean uh since birth um the children ministry of this church has done countless outreach. So they're basically trying to give out a good example by and that's where my answer is leading that try as much as possible to reach out to people go out some couple of years back our theme was I will go so you go to the highways and byways try as much as possible uh out of your go out of your way and help others. Yeah. Okay. Um now in the seventh day Adventist fundamental beliefs uh number 20 um uh the belief says that the gracious creator after the six days of creation rested on the seventh day and instituted the Sabbath for all the people as a memorial of creation. Now the fourth commandment of God's unchangeable law requires the observance of this seventh day as the day of rest, worship and ministry in harmony with the teaching and practice of uh Jesus the Lord of the Sabbath. So pretty much we've said we rest. Okay, then we worship. Then now these are the things that we've listed. we can do them in harmony with um with what um God inscribed um him being as as the Lord um of the Sabbath. Um now the I I believe we've covered um the main except of um or rather the context of of the Sabbath. Um, of course, in contradiction with what these teachers of of the law back then had and and we also saw that um they tried to actually kill Christ who was doing good on on the Sabbath and therefore this for us extends that we should also do good on the Sabbath and we should not see the Sabbath day as a day of um don't you know don't do this, don't do that but it's a day whereby aside from the worship that we do and the study that we do, we also go out and and and do good. Um now Natasha, we've um on the Thursday part um it clearly indicates that um this particular excerpt was not just about the Sabbath. What other element do you think is captured in this particular excerpt? Um what I see is being captured in the exact not only keeping the Sabbath but also like okay doing good to others cuz okay the Sabbath was meant for as Javan had said it was meant it was meant for our ful fulfilling our requirements not fulfilling the requires ments of the Sabbath. Thus, on the Sabbath is the day that we're supposed to help people out there and and as I can see, as I will say from the story, doing good to others. The Sabbath is about the importance of people, the misguided thinking like that of the Pharisees and and the and human nature as we would as we will say in the part of human nature. Um it's our nature that we tend to to go by the rules on what we're not supposed to do instead of looking at what we should do. And that's what led to the Pharisees, their misguided thinking that what was best was to find fault in Jesus so that they could kill them and they could continue following the rules that they knew was right for the Sabbath. Amen. Amen. Yeah. Thank you. Thank you very much for for pretty much um summarizing uh what we've learned in this um particular excerpt. Uh at this juncture, I'd like to invite each and every one of you to at least giving um give us um your final remarks and your take home from this particular excerpt. I'll start from my left. Um my what I'd say is um that we should not take the Sabbath as a day for only just don't do this, don't do this, and don't do this. Instead, we should we should look at the Sabbath as a day of doing what is right and keeping um the keeping God's commandments. Amen. Thank you very much, Sid, for that. Natasha, my take-home is that the Sabbath is not just a day for for just resting or just doing nothing, not just going to church, but from your heart, going out there and helping other people. In the laws of God, it's written that on the six six days you shall labor, but on the Sabbath day you shall not work. No, no, no one in your house should work. Instead of just focusing on what you should not do, now look at what you should do on the Sabbath. Amen. Amen. Javan. Um, I think that the Sabbath should be a day of more reaching out to people. Reaching out to people, trying to do whatever is whatever is right and trying to help people. Get out of your way. Do good to people and Yeah. M and focus more on helping other people and not meeting the requirements of the of the Sabbath. Amen. Yeah. I think God God wants us to to practice goodness and participate in the cause of saving lives for eternity now because that is our ultimate purpose as created beings. And uh we also ought to become like our creator. Um now we'll never experience this if we forget who God is and we remember by this if we forget sorry we remember by this by entering into his work especially on the Sabbath day. So when you enter into the Sabbath with the mind of God to save and minister to people that and only that can actually help us and assist us into into actually keeping keeping the Sabbath. Um so thank you very much for your contributions. I'd like Natasha to pray for us as we as we conclude. Let's pray. Our dear heavenly father, we come before you this day thanking you for your goodness and your mercies you endure forever. Thank you for your lesson, your word that we have just shared. And I pray that you may help us be able to keep the Sabbath and not only look at what we should not do, but also what we should do in honor of your name. In Jesus name I pray, trusting and believing. Amen. Amen. 

==================================================

TIMESTAMPED TRANSCRIPT:
[0.2s] Hi, welcome to today's Cornerstone
[2.2s] Connections lesson. My name is Natasha
[4.3s] and I'll be doing the mission reading
[5.7s] which comes from Thailand titled Rich
[7.8s] Kids. Renato moved far far away from his
[10.7s] home in Brazil to become a missionary in
[13.1s] Thailand. He teaches a 100 children in
[15.8s] the fourth grade at a seventh day school
[17.5s] in Bangkok. While Ranata was still at
[20.3s] home in Brazil, he prayed and prayed
[22.7s] about becoming a missionary. When he
[25.1s] received an invitation to become a
[26.6s] missionary teacher in Thailand, he
[28.6s] thought that God had answered his
[30.1s] prayers. But when he arrived in
[32.0s] Thailand, he wasn't sure. He had always
[34.8s] thought that missionaries were supposed
[36.1s] to teach poor people about
[38.1s] Jesus. But the children at his new
[40.5s] school weren't poor. They were rich
[42.0s] kids. All of them came from wealthy
[44.3s] families. Their daddies and mommies were
[46.2s] ambassadors, models, and soccer players.
[49.3s] Renato was confused. Why had God allowed
[51.7s] him to come to Thailand? He prayed to
[54.6s] serve. He prayed, "God, did you want me
[56.9s] to travel 10,000 miles to serve rich
[60.0s] people? Many there were there are many
[62.9s] people in Brazil who need my help. Why
[65.3s] did you bring me here?" Then came
[67.0s] Ranato's first day as a teacher at the
[68.9s] school. He felt a little scared. He felt
[71.6s] a little nervous all over. But somehow
[74.2s] he managed to get through the day. The
[76.2s] next day he decided to eat with the
[78.0s] children in the school cafeteria. He
[80.0s] wanted to hear what the children were
[81.4s] talking about. He wanted to make new
[83.2s] friends. Ranato was went through the
[85.8s] line and received a bowl of noodles.
[88.0s] Then he sat down at a table with a group
[89.9s] of fourth graders from his class.
[92.0s] Usually Ranato also always folded his
[95.0s] hands to pray. But on this day, he
[97.3s] stretched out his hands with the palms
[99.6s] facing up. He wasn't sure why he prayed
[101.8s] that way. He just did. Dear God, he
[104.4s] prayed silently. Thank you for this
[106.7s] food. Please bless it. When he opened
[109.8s] his eyes, he saw that one of his new
[111.5s] students, a 9-year-old girl, was staring
[113.6s] at him intently. When he when he saw
[116.5s] that he was when she saw that he was
[118.1s] looking at him, she spoke up. "What were
[120.5s] you doing?" she asked. "I was praying,"
[122.8s] he said. The girl looked puzzled. "But
[125.6s] you can't pray like that," she said.
[127.1s] "You need to fold your hands." The girl,
[130.1s] like many of the 1,500 children at the
[132.9s] school, came from a non-Christian home.
[135.2s] No one prayed to God of he to the God of
[137.0s] heaven at her home. Everything that she
[139.5s] knew about praying to God had been
[141.2s] taught at the school. Her previous
[143.1s] teacher had taught her to close her h
[145.3s] her eyes and fold her hands when she
[147.4s] prayed. And now she couldn't understand
[149.8s] why Ranato had closed his eyes but
[152.1s] hadn't folded his hands. Does God listen
[154.5s] to this kind of prayer? She said, "For
[156.7s] sure," Ranato said with a big smile. He
[159.4s] listens to everyone. I have prayed
[161.6s] driving a car with open eyes. Shock and
[164.2s] amazement flashed across the girl's
[165.9s] face. Can you pray with open eyes? She
[168.4s] said. Renato's smile grew bigger. I've
[171.6s] prayed while cooking, he said. I've
[173.1s] prayed while working out. The girl's
[175.7s] shock and amazement grew even bigger.
[178.0s] Renato decided to have some fun. He said
[180.4s] that he had even prayed to God in the
[182.1s] bathroom. What? The girl exclaimed. Can
[185.2s] God hear you there? God can hear you
[187.6s] everywhere, Renato said. He's just
[189.8s] waiting for you to talk to him.
[191.3s] Sometimes he talks to you even though
[193.7s] you don't talk to him. Sometimes he talk
[195.6s] to you even if you don't talk to him.
[197.7s] But you can pray to him everywhere, even
[199.6s] with eyes, open eyes and open hands. The
[202.6s] girl didn't say anything. She was so
[205.1s] shocked and amazed that she didn't even
[207.2s] blink. After a long moment of silence,
[209.8s] she got up and left the table. She had a
[212.1s] lot to think about. At that moment,
[214.2s] Ranato realized why God had sent him to
[216.3s] Thailand. Rich kids also needed to know
[218.8s] about God.
[220.5s] Being a missionary wasn't only about
[222.1s] sharing the God God's love with the poor
[224.7s] people. Being a missionary was about
[226.6s] sharing God's love with everyone
[228.4s] everywhere. Pray for Adventist
[230.4s] missionaries like Renato at Echamay
[232.6s] International School in Thailand as they
[235.1s] share God's love with everyone around
[236.6s] the world. Thank you for your 13th
[238.6s] Sabbath offering this quarter that will
[240.5s] help more kids know about the God who
[242.2s] hears prayers everywhere. We will sing
[245.3s] song number 382. Oh day of rest and
[249.7s] gladness, oh day of rest and
[254.5s] gladness, oh day of joy and
[259.2s] light, oh bal of care and
[263.7s] sadness, most
[266.0s] beautiful, most bright.
[269.5s] on thee thigh and
[273.4s] lowly who bend before the
[277.7s] throne. Sing holy, holy,
[282.7s] holy to the eternal
[287.4s] one. Thou art a port,
[292.1s] protected from storms that round us
[296.2s] rise.
[298.0s] A garden
[301.6s] intercepted with streams of
[306.4s] paradise. Thou art a cooling
[311.3s] fountain in life
[314.2s] dry
[316.0s] sand. From thee like pisa's
[320.8s] mountain we view a promised land.
[326.6s] A day of sweet
[330.2s] reflection. Thou art a day of
[335.1s] love, a day to raise
[339.6s] affection from earth to things
[344.4s] above. New graces ever
[349.2s] gaining from this a day of rest.
[355.0s] We seek the rest
[358.9s] remaining in mansions of the blessed.
[365.0s] Welcome to lesson number 10, front and
[368.2s] center. And um before we begin, I'd like
[371.0s] uh my fellow panelists to introduce
[373.0s] themselves from my left.
[375.6s] Hi, my name is Sid.
[378.6s] Hi, my name is Natasha Buya. Hi, my name
[382.2s] is Javan. Um, thank you very much. Um,
[385.4s] I'd like Joan to pray with us as we
[387.7s] begin. Okay, let's have a word of
[390.8s] prayer. Eternal and everlasting master,
[393.2s] we become come before this afternoon
[394.7s] with us good in our hearts. Oh Lord, as
[397.0s] this lesson, oh Lord, please be with us.
[398.5s] Help us to get something that you can
[400.6s] gain to help us in our day-to-day lives.
[402.7s] We sinners, forgive us all our sins and
[404.3s] trespasses, make us all before thee, oh
[406.4s] Lord, just may praise trusting and
[408.1s] believing. Amen.
[410.0s] Amen. Um, thank you very much. Now it is
[413.3s] said that um you can know what someone
[417.0s] is about by the amount of time they
[420.6s] spend um doing something and you can
[424.3s] also know someone by what makes them
[428.6s] easily angered. Okay. Now um in this in
[432.2s] this lesson um of course we see um a
[435.3s] scenario where people get angry um
[438.4s] people expect people to be doing certain
[441.0s] things on certain days and uh we want to
[444.1s] see um what should be front and center
[448.0s] um basically with with regards to to
[451.4s] what is going on um in this particular
[453.4s] except now
[455.0s] um Sid I just want us to go directly
[458.7s] into the what do you think section
[460.6s] ction. Um, and I want you to to analyze
[464.1s] with us um, what is likely to to make
[467.6s] you more angry or less angry or what
[470.2s] amount of anger do you project to some
[472.4s] of these instances that we've been given
[474.1s] here.
[476.4s] [Music]
[479.8s] Um, so the the numbers there therefore
[483.6s] either you act slowly or immediately out
[487.4s] of impulse I'd say. Mhm.
[490.2s] Um
[492.8s] uh the children being mistreated Mhm.
[495.8s] would be like four. Mhm. Cuz it's wrong.
[499.4s] Yeah. It's gotten my attention, but then
[502.3s] also I feel like if I act out of
[504.8s] impulse, then I'll end up doing
[507.8s] something that will get me in trouble.
[512.4s] But what
[513.6s] would what would anger me most would be
[517.2s] the children being mistreated. children
[519.5s] being mistreated. Mhm. Because I feel
[523.5s] like they don't deserve what what what
[528.3s] they're receiving. Like they're not
[530.3s] meant to be mistreated. Even if they
[533.7s] they, you know, they they do something,
[535.9s] they like break plates or something,
[538.2s] they don't deserve to be mistreated
[540.2s] because they don't fully understand what
[544.2s] they're doing. So, I'd
[546.0s] say that that would
[549.0s] anger me most. Anger you most. Okay.
[551.8s] What about individuals lying to protect
[554.6s] their interests?
[557.8s] Um that that wouldn't really bother me
[559.6s] cuz I feel like it's you know it's up to
[561.5s] them. It's a personal decision. So if
[564.5s] you if you're in trouble with the in the
[567.3s] law, you lie to to get yourself out of
[570.8s] trouble. that's not really up to me
[574.7s] to to to get I wouldn't really get
[578.2s] annoyed cuz it's not doesn't really
[580.9s] affect me. Okay. Um what about probably
[583.6s] maybe the underprivileged being um
[585.7s] neglected is closely tied to children
[589.0s] maybe. Um in your estimation um do you
[592.2s] think that will be as important? Would
[594.3s] you be angered if you see
[595.6s] underprivileged being neglected?
[601.1s] [Music]
[602.4s] Um, it all you know it depends
[606.8s] on the
[608.6s] person on the underprivileged person
[611.0s] because you know there are homeless
[614.0s] people that tend to use like if you give
[617.8s] a homeless person money they'll they may
[620.6s] end up using it for drugs or something.
[623.2s] M. So it it really it depends on
[628.6s] the the the underprivileged person. So
[631.8s] I' I'd put that maybe at like
[634.8s] three or four like somewhere in between.
[638.8s] Cuz it would catch my attention. I may
[642.4s] get angry or I may not get angry.
[645.9s] Okay. Now to basically just loop it um
[649.4s] with what is happening um in the context
[651.5s] of this story um do you think the
[654.8s] leaders in the church had uh had um
[658.2s] maybe an option of being angry at what
[661.0s] Christ did? Did they were they were they
[664.9s] out of place to to get angry or were
[667.0s] they interfering?
[669.9s] I wouldn't say they were out of place
[672.4s] because
[673.9s] they like they didn't know that this
[677.8s] truly was the son of God.
[681.6s] So I wouldn't say that they were out of
[683.5s] place to get angry,
[687.0s] but they also pushed it a bit too much.
[690.6s] Too much. Okay. Yeah. Thank you. Thank
[693.2s] you very much um Sid for that. Now we
[696.0s] are eager to get to know what is
[698.4s] actually happening um in this context.
[700.6s] We need to just find out what is at the
[702.9s] front and and the center. So Javan if
[705.7s] you can just briefly um explain to us
[708.5s] what is happening in this particular
[710.2s] context.
[712.4s] Okay. uh in this story we get that Jesus
[717.8s] was asking a question to the people if
[721.6s] it's lawful to heal on the Sabbath or do
[723.8s] good or but to do good on the Sabbath or
[727.2s] do evil in the Sabbath and he added
[730.3s] another question that if your sheep fell
[733.4s] into a well on a Sabbath will you help
[737.0s] it or not and obviously the people will
[740.2s] say that they will help it. So Jesus
[742.6s] asked them, "So why isn't it why isn't
[746.4s] it good to help some a person on the
[749.8s] Sabbath? Because the person is more
[752.6s] important on on the Sabbath." And Jesus
[754.9s] went on to heal the the the person. So
[760.5s] the Pharisees
[762.4s] to another in another instance, the
[765.4s] Pharisees tried were looking at him,
[767.7s] waiting for him to do a wrong thing so
[769.2s] that they could persecute him. Because
[771.0s] in the the Jews had this custom of not
[774.9s] doing anything in the Sabbath, just pure
[777.1s] worshiing. So they were waiting for him
[779.5s] to do something bad on the Sabbath. Then
[781.7s] Jesus posed the question, is it good to
[784.2s] do good or evil in the Sabbath? So in my
[789.1s] view, uh if you can help somebody in the
[792.6s] Sabbath, Mhm. then go ahead, you can
[795.0s] help. If you if it's if it's out of your
[797.8s] power then well and okay we can consider
[800.9s] that but if it's in your power that you
[802.6s] can help somebody during the Sabbath
[804.7s] then you can go ahead help somebody in
[806.6s] the in the Sabbath so that if anything
[808.9s] suppose anything happens to that person
[811.5s] in the future you won't blame yourself
[813.4s] or be judged accordingly to whatever you
[816.0s] did. So I think it's okay to help to do
[818.7s] good. My choice will be it's it's okay
[821.8s] to do good in the Sabbath and not do
[823.9s] evil.
[826.3s] So throughout I think throughout this
[828.0s] week's lesson we can see there's um
[830.0s] tension between thinking about what we
[832.9s] should do and and and what we should not
[835.4s] do. And um and this is it brews tension
[839.9s] between Christ um and the Pharisees who
[842.9s] are maybe regarded as the as the keepers
[845.9s] of the law. Um well there are many who
[849.3s] pretty much brand Christianity as um
[852.7s] what not to do. Yi it's a list of things
[857.0s] uh not to do. And I think there's um an
[859.5s] illustration in the lesson here whereby
[861.4s] um there's there's a young man who's
[863.5s] furious and he's saying I mean about
[866.9s] this other thing why don't you just tell
[869.0s] me what not to do and and I will be
[872.1s] good. Okay. So but Christ says I mean
[875.9s] it's not it's not really about the what
[878.8s] um you're not supposed to do but what is
[881.9s] actually the Sabbath is about when you
[883.8s] learn what the Sabbath is about. um
[886.7s] whereby we told here that uh the
[888.4s] gracious creator after the six days of
[890.1s] creation rested on the Sabbath day and
[893.1s] instituted the Sabbath for all people as
[895.4s] a memorial of of creation. So the
[900.0s] Pharisees did not view the Sabbath as
[902.0s] Christ viewed it. They just viewed it as
[905.3s] a day of catching people not doing what
[908.2s] they were they were actually supposed to
[909.8s] do. And then and this brings in um a lot
[912.7s] of tension. So uh Sid I think you can
[914.9s] read for us the key text so that um we
[917.8s] analyze um the context further.
[921.4s] Uh the key text is from
[923.6s] Mark 3 and 4. It says Jesus said to the
[928.6s] man with a shriveled handstand up in
[931.1s] front of everyone. Then Jesus asked them
[934.4s] which is lawful on the Sabbath to do
[937.0s] good or to do evil to save life or to
[940.4s] kill? But they remained silent.
[943.5s] M so you guys when you read that text um
[947.1s] given what Javan has already explained
[948.9s] to us what is happening what did you
[950.9s] deduce from this part if I may just read
[952.8s] it again Jesus said to them uh sorry to
[956.2s] the man with a shivered uh the shriveled
[959.3s] hand stand up in front of everyone. Then
[962.4s] Jesus asked them, "Which is lawful on
[965.9s] the Sabbath? To do good or to do evil,
[970.2s] to save life or to kill?" But they
[974.0s] remained silent. Why? Why do you think
[976.8s] they remained silent? Why? What? What
[979.4s] was happening here? What What is the
[980.8s] context that Mark is trying to is trying
[982.8s] to give us here? Said, "What do you
[985.1s] think?"
[987.8s] Um, I'd say they remained silent because
[991.8s] at that moment they they saw what Jesus
[996.2s] was trying to illustrate to them. Mhm.
[999.8s] Um, they they saw that it's better to to
[1003.8s] do good. Mhm. Uh than to do evil on the
[1008.0s] Sabbath. M and that the they it's like
[1012.7s] their ego had been humbled
[1015.4s] and they had nothing to say about it.
[1017.8s] Yeah. Mhm. Natasha, you want to try?
[1021.8s] Um what I can say from the verse, they
[1024.6s] remained silent because they were
[1028.3s] thinking of what they had been doing in
[1031.3s] the Sabbath. If they really were well
[1034.4s] doing good or doing evil, were they
[1037.1s] really saving lives or killing?
[1040.6s] Thank you very much, Javan. What do you
[1042.2s] think? Okay. Uh in this I think that uh
[1046.0s] they were their minds were opened
[1048.9s] because when reading lesson five, uh I
[1051.8s] had I read that the truth hurts. The
[1054.5s] truth hurts. So they thought that they
[1056.6s] were doing
[1058.3s] doing good in the Sabbath, but in the
[1060.0s] real sense they not doing good. as
[1061.4s] you've just said that what the the
[1063.5s] Sabbath to the to them was like a day of
[1066.2s] trying to get people doing the wrong
[1068.6s] thing. Um they finally saw that whatever
[1072.6s] they were doing was not supposed to be
[1075.6s] done in the Sabbath. So as you have just
[1078.2s] said the the ego was humbled and in this
[1082.0s] context that the truth hurts the truth
[1084.2s] hurts them. Uh when you know when you
[1086.7s] know that you're not doing the right
[1088.3s] thing and you thought it's the right
[1089.8s] thing. M yeah it hurts. Yeah. And I
[1092.9s] think the truth that hurt the most in
[1094.6s] this particular excerpt was verse four.
[1097.1s] The the very last part um where Christ
[1100.3s] asked them which is lawful on the
[1102.0s] Sabbath to do good or to do evil? To
[1105.9s] save life or to kill. Essentially Christ
[1110.6s] had just healed someone. Okay. He had
[1114.0s] done good.
[1116.2s] But when you read in the context these
[1118.9s] guys actually wanted to kill Christ
[1120.8s] almost immediately. So in fact it was
[1123.5s] just basically ask them asking them
[1125.8s] rather
[1126.7s] that I as Christ has done good by
[1130.5s] healing this guy but you guys want to do
[1133.8s] evil by actually plotting to to kill me
[1137.2s] and therefore he actually exposed them
[1140.0s] and that's how they ended up remaining u
[1143.2s] remaining silent basically. So they were
[1145.7s] they were embarrassed because Christ had
[1148.2s] read the purposes of of their hearts. Um
[1152.2s] they had taken the Sabbath to be a list
[1156.2s] of things not to do and and and that
[1160.2s] obliterated what the Sabbath was
[1162.2s] actually meant for. The Sabbath was
[1164.0s] meant to be a commemoration of the
[1167.4s] creation and it was a day to pretty much
[1172.0s] do good as much as as you can and and
[1176.5s] that's why at the beginning of the
[1178.1s] excerpt Christ actually drew a parallel
[1181.1s] um in between a business and a human
[1183.0s] being. I mean if you if you saving your
[1185.8s] business on a Sabbath or or a donkey on
[1187.9s] a Sabbath um how much more then will you
[1191.0s] be zealous to actually save human life?
[1194.3s] So these guys were pretty much
[1196.7s] concentrated on on the what not to do as
[1200.3s] compared to actually doing good um on
[1203.7s] the Sabbath. Now um I want us to um
[1207.6s] pretty much go into um what the spirit
[1210.1s] of prophecy is um trying to say um about
[1213.4s] this particular excerpt and I'll invite
[1215.5s] you Natasha to just um give us an
[1218.2s] overview of what the flashlight is
[1219.8s] telling us in this um concept
[1222.4s] context. Well, the flashlight from the
[1225.8s] desire of ages, paragraph
[1229.1s] 287, it says, "In the healing of the
[1232.0s] withered hand, Jesus condemned the
[1233.8s] custom of the Jews and left the fourth
[1236.1s] and left the fourth commandment standing
[1237.9s] as God had given it. It is lawful to do
[1240.7s] well on the Sabbath days. He declared,
[1243.5s] "By sweeping away the senseless the
[1247.1s] senseless restrictions of the Jews,
[1249.1s] Christ honored the Sabbath while those
[1251.2s] who complained of him were dishonoring
[1254.2s] God's holy day."
[1257.1s] So, so therefore, we see that um there's
[1260.4s] a way you can dishonor God's day while
[1263.8s] you think that you are actually honoring
[1266.2s] it. Um and and and then it borrows back
[1269.4s] to the to the context whereby we were
[1271.3s] told do we actually know what the what
[1275.0s] the essence of of the Sabbath is. Uh the
[1277.9s] Sabbath was basically for commemorating
[1281.0s] um creation and um communion with with
[1285.0s] God. And of course when you commune with
[1287.0s] God you will always be thinking um good
[1290.6s] and and and technically not not evil.
[1293.4s] And therefore we are seeing here that
[1295.3s] these guys
[1297.6s] um Christ when Christ actually healed
[1300.6s] the the guy who had the withered hand he
[1303.5s] he condemned the customs of the Jews. Um
[1307.1s] in fact there was one that was saying
[1309.6s] you know there's a certain length you're
[1311.8s] not supposed to like walk on on a
[1314.6s] Sabbath day. And uh on another instance,
[1317.4s] they actually accused the disciples of
[1319.0s] Christ of even uh eating on on a
[1323.2s] Sabbath. They went into someone's shamba
[1325.0s] and they were they were getting
[1326.4s] something to eat. So these guys had
[1328.6s] extremes. um they had a list of what not
[1332.6s] to do and uh even in life when we have a
[1336.2s] list of what not to do we end up
[1339.7s] forgetting the essence of of of the day
[1342.7s] and that and that pretty much um
[1345.0s] swallows up um what what the Sabbath was
[1348.3s] was meant to do. Um there's another
[1351.0s] quote um I think the desire of ages page
[1354.5s] 285
[1357.2s] um whereby it says that the object of
[1359.2s] God's work in this world is the
[1361.7s] redemption of men. Therefore that which
[1364.8s] is necessary to be done on the Sabbath
[1367.3s] in the accomplishment of his work is in
[1370.2s] accordance to to the Sabbath law.
[1373.1s] So these guys did not technically
[1375.9s] understand um what the Sabbath law was
[1379.0s] was actually about. Um and back to you
[1381.4s] Javan. I think
[1383.4s] um given this um this context, how will
[1387.8s] you describe the the reaction of the
[1389.9s] Jewish leaders to what Christ does in
[1392.8s] the in the synagogue?
[1396.0s] Um being that they focused more on the
[1399.7s] ex more on what not to do. Mhm. Um and
[1403.6s] Jesus was
[1405.2s] doing was was doing contrary to the list
[1409.6s] that they made. Um basic they they were
[1413.4s] annoyed because in their I think in
[1416.4s] their history I don't think they ever
[1417.8s] saw anybody like Jesus doing the thing
[1420.5s] that he's doing on the Sabbath. Um and
[1425.4s] being that they they wanted to kill him
[1427.9s] means that they were annoyed. And each
[1430.1s] time that Jesus was being the good
[1433.0s] um they their lo to Jesus even grew
[1437.1s] more. So I think that the the priests
[1441.7s] were annoyed with Jesus because they
[1444.9s] were angry. They were furious. Yeah.
[1446.2s] They were furious. M then um when when
[1449.9s] you when you read this uh particular
[1452.4s] excerpt when Christ said if any of you
[1455.9s] has a sheep and it falls into a pit on
[1459.1s] the Sabbath, will you not take a hold of
[1461.6s] it and lift it out? So how much more
[1464.0s] valuable is a man more than sheep? What
[1466.9s] is the central point um in this
[1469.2s] particular exchange with um with these
[1471.8s] guys? Natasha, what do you think? What
[1474.2s] what what is the central point when
[1476.1s] Christ compared uh these two instances?
[1481.4s] Okay. When Christ compared saving a
[1485.3s] sheep to saving man cuz as we know man
[1490.6s] is more valuable than than the sheep. So
[1495.4s] what the central part of it was that
[1499.0s] okay the sheep can be used for business
[1501.4s] as they as they it was used for business
[1504.4s] and also for wealth back in those days.
[1507.4s] So it was the central part was that
[1511.6s] saving a life is more important than
[1515.4s] saving a business or just saving your
[1517.5s] wealth. M in other words, we are ought
[1520.3s] we ought to do good to one another
[1523.4s] especially um on on the Sabbath day. Um
[1527.5s] now the other the other question was um
[1530.6s] what would you say is the primary
[1532.0s] purpose of the Sabbath according to this
[1535.0s] story? Sid, what do you think is the
[1536.5s] primary purpose of the Sabbath according
[1538.6s] to this story?
[1540.5s] Um, I'd say according to this story, the
[1544.2s] primary purpose of the Sabbath is
[1548.5s] um, you know, keeping keeping God's word
[1553.4s] and then
[1555.6s] um, doing good and not evil cuz you can
[1561.0s] you can serve God by helping others. M I
[1566.9s] don't remember there was a verse there's
[1568.7s] a verse in the Bible that talks about
[1571.8s] um
[1572.8s] how was it Jesus Jesus said you I was
[1576.5s] sick and you you came to visit me I was
[1579.8s] hungry and you fed me I was naked and
[1581.4s] you clothed me so helping doing good to
[1587.9s] um people would be considered
[1591.8s] um like I would say is a good. Um, it's
[1597.4s] one of the purposes of the Sabbath.
[1600.6s] Amen. Amen. Thank you very much for
[1602.5s] that. Now, Javan, I just want you to
[1604.7s] maybe briefly just take us through the
[1606.9s] punchlines and how they relate with um
[1610.6s] what you see um in this particular story
[1614.5s] um with regards to to the Sabbath day.
[1619.8s] Okay, I'll read the first paragraph,
[1622.3s] then Natasha will read the second. Then
[1624.7s] if you don't
[1625.8s] mind read the third, then CD read the
[1628.6s] fourth. Mhm. So the first one comes from
[1631.3s] Exodus 20:8 to 11. Mhm. Remember the
[1635.0s] Sabbath day to keep it holy. Six days
[1637.2s] you shall labor and do all your work.
[1639.4s] But the seventh day is the Sabbath of
[1640.9s] the Lord your God. In it you may work
[1643.5s] and you shall not do any work. you you
[1646.4s] and your you or your son or your
[1647.8s] daughter, your male or your female
[1649.6s] servant or your
[1651.3s] cattle, who who stays with you for six
[1655.2s] days. The Lord made the the heavens and
[1657.3s] the earth, the sea, and all that is in
[1659.4s] them, and rested on the seventh day.
[1661.8s] Therefore, the Lord blessed the Sabbath
[1664.1s] day and made it holy.
[1668.0s] Amen. I should read the next one. The
[1671.9s] next punch line comes from the book of
[1674.0s] Isaiah
[1675.8s] 56:E2. It says, "Blessed is the man who
[1679.0s] does this and the son of man who holds
[1682.0s] it fast, who keeps the Sabbath, not
[1685.1s] profounding it and keeps his hand from
[1687.8s] doing any evil."
[1690.1s] Amen. Um the other one is Mark 2:27 and
[1694.5s] 28 and it reads, "Then Jesus said to
[1697.3s] them, the Sabbath was made to meet the
[1700.1s] needs of the people and not the people
[1702.2s] to meet the requirements of the
[1703.9s] Sabbath." So the son of man is Lord even
[1707.2s] over the Sabbath.
[1709.7s] And uh the fourth one is keep my Sabbath
[1712.6s] as holy rest signpost between me and you
[1716.7s] signaling that I am God your God. That's
[1719.7s] Ezekiel 20:20.
[1723.0s] Um, so uh what what has caught my
[1726.5s] attention is the one that you have read
[1729.8s] Mark 27 and 28. And I'll take this part
[1734.0s] and the Sabbath was made to meet the
[1736.2s] requirements of the need of the needs of
[1738.8s] the people and not to meet the
[1740.6s] requirements of the Sabbath. So
[1744.0s] um in this context I get that
[1748.2s] uh you're supposed to the Sabbath is all
[1751.7s] about helping others and not and not
[1756.7s] trying to do what the what the priests
[1761.9s] the priests were doing because they were
[1764.5s] trying to meet to meet the requirements
[1765.9s] of the Sabbath and not to meet the needs
[1768.6s] of the people and we can see that Jesus
[1770.9s] was trying to do that he wouldn't
[1774.0s] see a sick person and pass him like
[1776.9s] that. He will try and get out of his way
[1779.1s] and help him. And so in our daily lives,
[1782.4s] we need to try as much as possible in
[1784.5s] anything that we can do, we help others,
[1788.2s] no matter what the circumstance, no
[1790.5s] matter even the day it is, we must try
[1793.4s] our best and do good to others.
[1797.4s] uh if anybody has another addition they
[1800.4s] can add. Okay. Oh, thank you very much
[1803.7s] uh for that. A question I'd like to ask
[1806.1s] is um now that we've seen and maybe
[1809.4s] we've had a scope of understanding on um
[1812.2s] what can go on on a Sabbath. So besides
[1815.6s] you know when we come maybe to church on
[1817.8s] Sabbath um of course there's like some
[1820.6s] discussion then there's like normal
[1822.2s] worship. So the question I'll pose to
[1824.3s] the fellow panelist is um what other
[1826.8s] activities
[1828.4s] um can we do on the Sabbath to to
[1831.9s] fulfill this particular um command and
[1834.7s] accept? What do you guys think? What
[1836.7s] other activities can we do on a Sabbath
[1839.0s] so that um it at least qualifies to what
[1841.5s] Christ was trying to do as opposed to
[1843.7s] what the Pharisees were trying to do?
[1845.7s] it. Um, I'd say going out
[1850.7s] [Music]
[1852.1s] to to spread the word to the people on
[1856.8s] the streets. You could go give them um
[1859.5s] maybe a Bible, pray with them like that
[1863.0s] would that would compensate sort of for
[1867.4s] the Sabbath. Okay. Natasha, what what
[1870.5s] activities do you think?
[1873.2s] Um, first I would say like when we look
[1876.5s] back at the story of Christ, his life
[1879.3s] when he was on earth, he didn't just on
[1882.4s] the Sabbath, he didn't just come sit in
[1885.2s] church or just sit in the pullpit. He
[1887.8s] also went out spreading the word and
[1890.2s] helping people. So the activities I
[1893.6s] would I would do suggestively to myself
[1897.5s] would be like go out to something like a
[1901.0s] children's home or on the streets when
[1904.0s] you see the beggars at least have
[1906.1s] something to give them on the Sabbath.
[1909.4s] Yes. Amen. That's that's wonderful.
[1911.0s] Javan, what would you do on the Sabbath
[1913.8s] other than just congregating for worship
[1915.5s] and study?
[1917.1s] I mean uh since birth
[1920.8s] um the children ministry of this church
[1923.3s] has done countless outreach. So they're
[1927.8s] basically trying to give out a good
[1929.7s] example by and that's where my answer is
[1932.7s] leading
[1933.9s] that try as much as possible to reach
[1936.9s] out to people go out some couple of
[1940.1s] years back our theme was I will go so
[1942.6s] you go to the highways and byways try as
[1945.4s] much as possible uh out of your go out
[1949.2s] of your way and help others. Yeah. Okay.
[1954.1s] Um now in the seventh day Adventist
[1956.2s] fundamental beliefs uh number 20 um uh
[1959.8s] the belief says that the gracious
[1961.4s] creator after the six days of creation
[1963.3s] rested on the seventh day and instituted
[1965.8s] the Sabbath for all the people as a
[1967.6s] memorial of creation. Now the fourth
[1969.8s] commandment of God's unchangeable law
[1972.0s] requires the observance of this seventh
[1974.4s] day as the day of rest, worship and
[1978.2s] ministry in harmony with the teaching
[1980.6s] and practice of uh Jesus the Lord of the
[1983.5s] Sabbath. So pretty much we've said we
[1986.2s] rest. Okay, then we worship. Then now
[1989.4s] these are the things that we've listed.
[1991.0s] we can do them in harmony with um with
[1994.6s] what um God inscribed um him being as as
[1999.1s] the Lord um of the Sabbath.
[2002.4s] Um now the I I believe we've covered um
[2006.7s] the main except of um or rather the
[2009.1s] context of of the Sabbath. Um, of
[2012.7s] course, in contradiction with what these
[2015.3s] teachers of of the law back then had and
[2018.4s] and we also saw that um they tried to
[2021.4s] actually kill Christ who was doing good
[2024.2s] on on the Sabbath and therefore this for
[2026.8s] us extends that we should also do good
[2030.1s] on the Sabbath and we should not see the
[2032.2s] Sabbath day as a day of um don't you
[2036.2s] know don't do this, don't do that but
[2038.3s] it's a day whereby aside from the
[2040.7s] worship that we do and the study that we
[2043.1s] do, we also go out and and and do good.
[2046.6s] Um now Natasha, we've um on the Thursday
[2050.4s] part um it clearly indicates that um
[2053.8s] this particular excerpt was not just
[2056.8s] about the
[2058.4s] Sabbath. What other element do you think
[2061.6s] is captured in this particular excerpt?
[2066.2s] Um what I see is being captured in the
[2069.1s] exact not only keeping the Sabbath but
[2074.4s] also like okay doing good to others
[2079.5s] cuz okay the Sabbath was meant for as
[2084.3s] Javan had said it was meant it was meant
[2087.5s] for
[2088.6s] our ful fulfilling our
[2092.1s] requirements not fulfilling the requires
[2094.7s] ments of the Sabbath. Thus, on the
[2097.1s] Sabbath is the day that we're supposed
[2099.0s] to help people out
[2101.7s] there and and as I can see, as I will
[2105.8s] say from the story, doing good to
[2109.3s] others. The Sabbath is about the
[2111.8s] importance of people, the misguided
[2115.0s] thinking like that of the Pharisees
[2117.9s] and and the and human nature as we would
[2123.3s] as we will say in the part of human
[2125.4s] nature. Um it's our nature that we tend
[2130.4s] to to go by the rules on what we're not
[2133.5s] supposed to do instead of looking at
[2135.9s] what we should do.
[2139.0s] And that's what led to the Pharisees,
[2143.2s] their misguided thinking that what was
[2146.2s] best was to find fault in Jesus so that
[2149.2s] they could kill them and they could
[2151.4s] continue following the rules that they
[2153.9s] knew was right for the Sabbath. Amen.
[2156.6s] Amen. Yeah. Thank you. Thank you very
[2159.0s] much for for pretty much um summarizing
[2162.8s] uh what we've learned in this um
[2165.1s] particular excerpt. Uh at this juncture,
[2167.3s] I'd like to invite each and every one of
[2169.0s] you to at least giving um give us um
[2171.6s] your final remarks and your take home
[2174.0s] from this particular excerpt. I'll start
[2176.5s] from my left.
[2179.6s] Um my what I'd say is um that we
[2185.8s] should not take the Sabbath as a day
[2191.6s] for
[2193.3s] only just don't do this, don't do this,
[2196.3s] and don't do this.
[2198.3s] Instead, we should we
[2200.4s] should look at the Sabbath as a day of
[2203.6s] doing what is
[2205.3s] right and keeping
[2209.2s] um the keeping God's commandments.
[2213.1s] Amen. Thank you very much, Sid, for
[2214.9s] that. Natasha,
[2217.0s] my take-home is that the Sabbath is not
[2220.6s] just a day for for just resting or just
[2225.4s] doing nothing, not just going to church,
[2228.4s] but from your heart, going out there and
[2231.8s] helping other people. In the laws of
[2234.2s] God, it's written that on the six six
[2237.4s] days you shall labor, but on the Sabbath
[2239.8s] day you shall not work. No, no, no one
[2244.0s] in your house should work. Instead of
[2246.5s] just focusing on what you should not do,
[2249.8s] now look at what you should do on the
[2252.2s] Sabbath. Amen. Amen. Javan.
[2256.4s] Um, I think that the Sabbath should be a
[2260.8s] day of more reaching out to people.
[2265.0s] Reaching out to people, trying to do
[2267.4s] whatever is whatever is right and trying
[2271.9s] to help people. Get out of your way. Do
[2275.4s] good to people
[2277.1s] and Yeah. M and focus more on helping
[2281.9s] other people and not meeting the
[2283.6s] requirements of the of the Sabbath.
[2285.8s] Amen. Yeah. I think God God wants us to
[2289.0s] to practice goodness and participate in
[2291.8s] the cause of saving lives for eternity
[2294.7s] now because that is our ultimate purpose
[2296.8s] as created beings. And uh we also ought
[2300.6s] to become like our creator. Um now we'll
[2303.4s] never experience this if we forget who
[2305.8s] God is and we remember by this if we
[2310.4s] forget sorry we remember by this by
[2312.9s] entering into his work especially on the
[2315.2s] Sabbath day. So when you enter into the
[2317.4s] Sabbath with the mind of God to save and
[2320.2s] minister to people that and only that
[2323.3s] can actually help us and assist us into
[2325.7s] into actually keeping keeping the
[2327.4s] Sabbath. Um so thank you very much for
[2329.9s] your contributions. I'd like Natasha to
[2332.9s] pray for us as we as we conclude.
[2336.1s] Let's pray. Our dear heavenly father, we
[2339.1s] come before you this day thanking you
[2340.7s] for your goodness and your mercies you
[2342.2s] endure forever. Thank you for your
[2344.4s] lesson, your word that we have just
[2346.1s] shared. And I pray that you may help us
[2348.7s] be able to keep the Sabbath and not only
[2351.0s] look at what we should not do, but also
[2353.4s] what we should do in honor of your name.
[2355.7s] In Jesus name I pray, trusting and
[2357.6s] believing. Amen. Amen.
