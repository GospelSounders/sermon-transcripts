training programs are a stop are a staple of Adventist life in South Korea this week's story is about a group of 19 Korean teens who joined one such program called Academy missionary movement a fierce thunderstorm broke out on the first night that 19 South Korean teenage missionaries spent on a Philippine Island the teens age ages 14 to 17 had not signed up for the thunderstorm when they joined a one-year Mission training program called Academy missionary movement part of the program required them to participate in an international mission trip and they had come to the remote island to assist with Evangelistic meetings under the guidance of a South Korean Pastor who would preach but the storm that greeted them on their first night threatened to spoil their plans 11 boys were sleeping in tents set up on the concrete floor of a particularly constructed church building located on a Sandy Beach eight girls were sleeping in a touched House nearby the night was Peach black except for a Sharp flashes of lightning rain poured down and the wind howled the church building had no doors or Windows and the tense Sheltering the boys trembled violently then South Korean Pastor began to wake up the boys the situation is getting serious he told the two he told two boys in One tent we need to get up and pray he asked the boys to Rouse the boys in the next tent and tell them to pass on the word until Aon had assembled to pray in the touched house meanwhile the mission program director woke up the girls in the touched house with similar instructions before long the teens had gathered in the touched house the building's walls shook against the blast of the storms none of the teens or adult had seen such a bad rainstorm it was 4:00 a.m. everyone knelt down and prayed for God to stop the storm for two hours the missionaries prayed as the wind howled the lightning flashed and the rain fell the pastor asked God to forgive the sins of everyone in the group the teens sang worship songs each person took time for personal prayer the pastor also gave a short sermon about God being our refuge in the storm by 6:00 a.m. the storm started to die down the pastor told the teens to go to bed seeing that it was their first night on the island he didn't want them to be too exhausted on their first full day the Sun was shining brightly in the blue sky when everyone woke up 2 hours later the storm set the scene for the rest of the week the mission trip became a season of prayer whenever it rained everyone knelt down and prayed whenever a team faced a challenge like inviting people to attend the evening meetings everyone knelt down fighting for the Salvation of souls sometimes they knelt in prayer in Pays and prayed for someone whom they had just met in a nearby Village the mission trip offered some surprises for the teens who are accustomed to conveniences like running water and heated toilet seats back home in South Korea on the island they used shovels to dig their own toilets and took Outdoors out outdoor baths with buckets or in the ocean no one complained every evening the teens gathered near The Unfinished church building to read the Bible discuss the day and thank God for Life food and good weather and at the end of the trip seven people were baptized in the ocean they had taken Bible studies with local church members and made the decision to get baptized during the Evangelistic meetings the teens rejoiced that seven people had given their hearts to Jesus they returned to South Korea expressing an eagerness to be lifelong missionaries for Jesus part of this 13 part of this quarter's 13th Sabbath offering will train students to become missionaries at hancook samok Academy in SE South Korea your offering will help open a Missionary Training Center and gym at the Academy thank you for planning a gener and generous offering on March 29th good morning good afternoon good evening from wherever it is you're joining us from today our lesson will be on experiencing forgiveness and we are told in Matthew chapter 6 verse 14 to 15 for if you forgive others their trespasses your heavenly father will also forgive you but if you do not forgive others their trespasses neither will your father forgive your trespasses I am Sandra gunga the moderator for today my name is Paul your Emily magana Elijah is my name kindly let's believe and pray our kind and Heavenly Father we come before you this moment ready to discuss your word in learn from you this day may you open our mind may you open our hearts be able to experience or learn from what you'll have for the message you have for us this day thank you for enabling us to conven and also for viewers wherever they may viewing from May you bless them and may help them to concentrate as they go on uh in this discussion thank you for know that you have heard us we pray believing and touch in Jesus name amen amen amen we will sing the song marvelous green marous Grace ofing God grace that exceeds our sin and our guil on C is M outp there where the blood of the Lamb was filled gra God gra gra that will paron and cleans within Grace Grace God's Grace Grace that is greater than all our sin so Emily what is forgiveness um forgiveness to me is all about letting go and not holding a grudge towards someone it's about letting go of their feelings whatever it is when someone has done wrong to you yes that's forgiveness to me thank you for that and what does what does forgiveness mean to you as well um I think I'd like to agree with what Emily has said um it is forgetting the wrong that has been done to you and um letting go of the G not holding on to any malth or anything and just being as if the wrong that was done to you had never been done the first place as we diverge into what forgiveness is we all understand there's a power that forgiveness carries behind everything that happens and just us forgetting that the wrong our friends or our brothers or an unknown person did to us us there's a certain power that comes behind it a story is told of a man who was suffering from fibromyalgia and high blood pressure this man decides to go for a counseling session during the counseling session they have an open heart-to- heart conversation with the counselor and there he lays his burden and exper and and informs the counselor that he is in a quar with a brother mind you the patient on this hand has medication for fibromyalgia and high blood pressure I'm trying to imagine in in in itself this this person might be going through troubles and tribulations having to take this medication at this point in time this other medication at this point in time this person was suffering inside of he had a battle that he had to conquer in his mind the counselor decides to advising and be getting it from medical point of view we understand that the adrenal glands usually release adrenal adrenaline and cortisol into your body and these two important hormones May contribute to fibromyalgia and high blood pressure the doctor or the counselor in this case doesn't tell him stop taking the medication he offers a simple advice kindly forgive your brother this person as he walks out of the doctor's office this words ringing in his ears and ringing in his mind pushes conscience to take the next bold step to ask for reconciliation 4 months down the line this person is improving from the high blood pressure pressure is becoming normal the fibromyalgia has been able to control and is is is is is almost nonexistent and and by the grace of forgiveness and by the power of forgiveness all medications are soon been cleared from his desk this is a power of forgiveness wow that is such a powerful lesson um we see how much Haring bitterness can literally cause us medical issues and we see that this is what Satan is using to have a hold of Our Lives um you being imprisoned by your past but there's hope um our lesson for today is telling us to look up to Christ so that we can learn how to forgive and our major text for our lesson today is from Matthew chapter 18 from vers 21 and 22 and I'll request Emily to read it for us it says then Peter came to Jesus and asked Lord how many times shall I forgive my brother or sister who sins against me up to seven times Jesus answered I tell you not seven times but 77 times thank you so much for that we can see through this verse that Jesus is not even limiting the Forgiveness to 490 times but Peter was shocked Peter was shocked that I cannot just forgive my brother seven times and let it stop there um we do see how much these people were living under the law it was actually they misinterpreted God's word they had read through Amos 1 verse 1 to3 where Christ where God um forgave the Israelites enemies three times and on the fourth time he he executed judgment and we see that this was still the idea that these people had on forgiveness they did not know that as a Christian you cannot measure how much you forgive your brother forgiveness is given freely and we also have a continuation of this chapter on the unforgiving servant and yawi will um tell us more about that fantastic so I'll pick it off from where Emily um started so Peter asks Christ how many times should I forgive and aside from uh giving a straight answer Christ gives it in a parable and he talks about a king who had a servant who owed him money and the amount actually was 10,000 um talents um a quick Google search tells me well I cannot verify that 10,000 talents with a region of $600 million onwards right and the servant falls on his knees and begs the king for forgiveness the king wants to take his wife and children into you know captivity to try and repay the debt and but upon seeking forgiveness the king forgiv the servant moving on the servant finds his fellow a fellow servant who owes him money the Bible says he owes him 100 dinari and again a quick Google search told me that 100 Nar in the region of 8 to 11,000 us doar and the fellow servant begs the first servant who has been forgiven by the king for forgiveness and the fellow sanes as Christians who know how to read the Bible say Roth with his brother takes his brother and throws him into into prison and the King hears the word gets back to the king as it often does um of this and the king is wro right is angry with the servant and and and that says I'll just read you Wicked I'm reading from verse 32 you Wicked servant I forgive you all the debt because you begged me should you not also have had compassion on your fellow servant just as as I had pity on you and the King goes on to to deliver this servant to the torturers and Christ ends with a very sobering um message he says so my heavenly father also will do to you will also do to you if each of you from his heart does not forgive his brother his trespasses so very moving story there it really is moving um it just shows us how God has extended us so much grace and sometimes we are not we are not willing to extend that same Grace to our to our fellow human beings um and I'd like um Emily to answer this question for us how is God's standard of forgiveness different from ours um God's um forgiveness is abundant it is UN conditional it's unending when we compare to us humans we tend to make reservations we forgive with um limited we're limited to our forgiveness in terms of we we are based on WE base our forgiveness on emotions grades um sense of justice because we have to we we always tend to what is it called Revenge yes that's how it is different from God God does not Revenge God never revenges but as we are very different but there's there's hope for us right we um sorry okay if I can just interject I think when when God as informs Peter that he should forgive 70 * 7 do for 90 times I'm trying to imagine as as as as as human being placed in country X or country y will you clearly count this I forgive this person day one this number one I forgive this person number two it's it's practically impossible and even if you have the people who are good at record keeping you say I'm forgiving people for nine times per day and and and trying to imagine how we've been looking at the state of the mind and also how the worlding itself an anger pandemic you're like so I forgive the economy for being har on me give some things it's not personal so as even if we looking things from emotion emotional perspective we of ourselves need to also give it freely it was given to us freely let's return it freely yeah um sorry I wanted to just answer your question and and Emily has put it so well um but in Psalms 103 verse 11 right says for the for as the heavens are high above the Earth so great is his Mercy towards those who fear Him as far as the East is from the West so far has he removed our transgressions from us and mikah 7:19 says he has cast our sins to the depths of the sea amen he will again have compassion on us and will subdue our iniquities amen that is forgiveness God style amen and I think and also in an interesting um thing about God is even before he created us he knew that man would fall he knew that no he didn't know he set a plan in place in case man fell and this plan was to reconcile us back to him it just shows how much God loves us that even before we were created he already had a plan to reconcile us back to him and he gave us his son Jesus Christ and through that we have and the Bible says um Christ was the lamb slain from the foundation of the world that means that be before when God was setting up the foundations of the world Christ was already offered up as a as as a sacrifice for the sin that we had not even committed yet before there was sin there was a a savior savior God is amazing amen um Elijah um how should God's forgiveness towards us change how we forgive others I think I'll approach that from The Lord's Prayer there's a part that says may you forgive us our trespasses as we forgive us who trespass against us we in ourselves cannot do it because let's take a I'm sorry to use because in the country keny let's take a typical Kenyan wakes up understands this tax to be paid goes and is maybe a pass a car passes by and throws some water on them because it's raining this person by the time they get to the office anger is just piling upon them but then how then do they come down and say okay I forgive you someone in case someone just I sent you to bring me document a bring me document B how then you get do they get to the point that they say I forgive you because most case if that happens that is your morning when you get and someone does that to you you'll be like okay this the person I but we need to the fact that as as as as Paul said we in ourselves cannot do it before before we were there as was for us so let's not look at the now let's not forgive based forgiveness on emotions let's just also pick it from their point of view yes understand where they're coming from maybe they also had a hectic morning and they're now confused in office so we need to also forgive because it was given to us yeah thank you I'm forgiveness should be abundant and overflowing in us um how is refusing to forgive others a rejection of God's forgiveness right I like what you said sorry that's why seem a bit distracted but I'll pick it up from what you said the Lord's Prayer it says um and forgive us our debts as we forgive our Deb debtors so what I'm proclaiming when I say the Lord's Prayer is the measure with which I forgive is the measure with which I want you God to forgive me so if I forgive completely then Lord forgive me completely complely if I forgive partially then God forgive meally if I do not forgive at all then God do not forgive me at all so and that's why this lesson is is is very powerful to me because it means that it's one of the few things I don't know if there are any other things but it's one of the few things that God ties his response to us with our own actions how I forgive others is how I should be forgiven yeah thank you so much and sometimes when you actually refuse to forgive you've cut off that channel of forgiveness if you don't forgive God will actually not forgive you and it all stems from love it means that you really need to love your neighbor and you need to love love comes from and love your enemies as well as you love who as you love yourself yes and we see that it's not a strange thing for us to be hurt but for forgiveness is something you must choose daily um you must choose to forgive this person daily and you must choose not to haror that heart and bitterness in you and sometimes we see that that is very challenging um so Emily what are some challenging Parts about forgiveness and how do you think we can overcome that um some challenging Parts the hardest part about forgiveness is basically letting go it's hard for us to let go of UK when you remember someone hurt you it's hard for you to just let go of that person yeah and another challenge is when the other person that's had you does not feel any remorse at all of his actions it hurts you that that person is not even acknowledging the fact that he hurt you that's how hard forgiveness is yes at times yeah if if if I can just pick it from where she she has left it other challenge that we have when it comes forgiveness is trust yeah I'll just throw a question to the audience and also anyone can feel free to answer it it is rhetorical more rhetorical how many times do you question yourself after you forgiven something very many times let's take it how Christ views us most of the times you're like he as we say there's no big SC there's no small sin sin sin but then you're like the sin I've committed today is humongous and you're like will really God forgive me is the same thing that we have with us when we forgiving one another do we trust the other part will also forgive us do we trust that yes in in personally I forgiven them but will they forgive me or they'll continue Hing this until as we say in please translate in in in in in in English until you found each other on a wrong corner will they forgive us will they now wait for us until that point in time the same thing when David forgives Saul David no matter how many how many times Saul came unto him he was like I forgiven you but you see Saul kept coming this this plan a fails Plan B Plan B fails plan C plan C fails plan do have such people who when we forgive We Like H I forgive them once but I don't trust them I can forgive them a second time thank you sorry and and in in in in in relation to the question you asked with regards to you know what are the difficulties and I'll look back to the definition so I'll give a very mundane example just to drive the point home so you're standing here right yeah and so the first time I passed by there you punch me in the face um I forgive you yes then tomorrow I pass by there you punch me in the face I forgive you again so um what um the the next day come when pass there um you will punch me in the face judging the way you're looking at me you will punch me in the face um but is if if if is forgiveness when you say forgive and forget yes do I forget what is that what is forgetting is it literally forgetting like literally forgetting to the point where I still put myself in H's way yeah right I hope you understand what I'm saying in you know in in the you'll know what is happening but but I'm still going there or can I forgive and this actually a gen can I forgive you but avoid you avoid you oh yes right so because you know um some people have horrible things have been done to people and you know some people say some of the worst things are done by people we trust we know so by forgiving yes I forgiven you but does forgiving and forgetting mean I still put myself put myself make myself vulnerable to that person or to that that situation um that's the idea deal unfortunately for most of us and this is where God's grace comes in it will not happen like that but God has given us the opportunity to forgive and forgive forgiveness is something you give you give it freely but the trust is something you will earn back if I keep on I'm punching NWI as he passes on that path God forbid for God forbid um NWI should find a way to not cut me off but literally protect his space and I think calls for wisdom doesn't it it calls for a lot of wisdom and that is why we are going to learn how to we just need to pray for strength and Clarity from God to give you that clear view of how to face it to give the wisdom yes it's it is difficult to rebuild the trust with that person again yes and is something you're forced to do but God tells you to you can try but if it's too difficult for you you can just get yourself out of that situation I I I think right now and that's why they say come now let's reason together when you look at the word forgive give is there and for f o r yes and when you when when you take those two things a part four is you're doing it to another person give is removing from you giving to another person yes but then as as as we're looking at this forgiveness also relieves a burden on us so we are giving something when both words things are going from us we are letting it go but then it is also relieving a burden for us so what I'm getting from that is we have to it is not ours in our we give it by Word of Mouth give it by word of mind give by of yes but it is essentially for the other person but now it has a duplicity in it it will be for the other person and also for me myself I love I love the question asked and I think you can answer for us this question um how does holding that resentment literally Happ your physical and mental health are you should ask that question anyway no I love the question you asked buches pulling up you you when when I think as as as and I pick up from where elah um dropped it um he said that forgiveness yes it's for the other person but it's also for for us and why is it for me because um as you said holding on you holding on to a grudge you're holding on to you know to to mly something that ties you down anger resentment and you may not know but it it it knows at you it eats at you and they say that whoever makes you angry has power over you because uh I'm somewhere in my room snoring and um Sandra is is is no not the the one the one who thinking about because I make you angry yes so me I'm sleeping but her she's angry because of me she can't sleep she doesn't have have peace so it it it it messes with you because it eats at you and it is only when you let go say you let go and you let God right yes it's only when you let go that you the the power that this person has over you is is released right and that is why for forgiveness yes as you have said very rightly it is for the other person and you're giving the other person but also for my own self for my own mental health which is has been a running thing in our study these past few studies yes um thank you so much and we've literally from this discussion we've seen that learning to forgive is very difficult but there's a nice acronym that we have here that will teach us how to take these baby steps um into forgiv giving someone and the acronym is preach so the P stands for pray um and I think this is one thing we should never don'tplay prayer is a very important part in our lives and we should pray for God to soften our hearts to help us see this other person situation and in that p as well that he may create a new heart within us and new a right Spate within us it's very difficult to forgive but by prayer we can be able to get that strength to forgive this person oh so the next one is um remember right remember the wrongdoing do not push anything aside especially if it makes you feel angry or upset name your emotion write it down and note What specifically makes you feel that emotion take that emotion and relinquish the heart to him as far as Peter 5:7 says cast all your cares upon Him for he cares about you then ask God how as a Christian should handle these emotions amen amen uh the next letter is e empathize empathize sorry empathize understanding what the other person has experienced in no way excuses the wrong but it does not add perspective as God to ask God to help you begin seeing the person through his I amen after empathizing you need to assess you need to take a stock of the flaws and the shortcomings and these are not for the other person but your own flaws and shortcomings you need to see this are my weak points this are where I'm strong at then as as as you sing just reflect on the when you yourself are forgiven how did it make you feel you need because you can't extend forgiveness if you don't know the joy that forgiveness carries so you need to assess after assessing you need to commit um commit yourself to forgive um you can do this by telling a friend you can journ it down you can write a letter that you will not send to this person but you will read it over and over again and you will imagine the freedom that comes from forgiving this person and you'll ask God to take this burden away from you amen last but not least is to hold on to God and hold on to the Forgiveness when the pain of the wrongdoing comes back take it back to God In Prayer leave it with with him and hold on to him to the Forgiveness that he has enabled you to forgive with preach reach um thank you so much and from this we see that forgiveness is not easy forgiving and forgetting is not easy but when we hold on to Jesus he will help us and he will guide us through this if if if I can just interject from the definition and also from what you're learning is there's an aspect of forgetting I think is it's more of a video I came across that says does now forgetting mean I have amnesia because forgetting in itself is like not easy at the back of your mind you may say you forgiven the person but 10 years down the like by the way you did X I have not forgotten you didn't do me well so we have to acknowledge even as as as our viewers wherever you may be watching forgiveness does not mean you for like forget does not mean you'll have amnes raes you'll sleep and you back to factory ftic means [Music] you left it away like you're going through a river you've crossed that bridge and it is there you leave it there The Bridge Water will come and wash it away in form of Christ and Christ let it carry that burden from you because if you not forget and if if if you just continue having it at the back of your mind it will be problems in Matthew chter 8 18:35 and it says so my heavenly father also will do to you so my heavenly father also will do to you if each of you from his heart does not forgive his brother his trespasses it's very simple yet profound if you do not forgive then please do not expect to be forgiven for sure for sure and remember that Jesus wants to set you free um and he will help you forgive everyone who's wronged you thank you so much for joining us and I'll ask Emily to pray with us as we finish our lesson let us bow on our heads for a word of prayer heavly father I come before you this hour thanking you for the gift of life we thank you for allowing us to read this lesson uh soften our hearts even as we're about to continue uh with our daily lives soften our hearts so that we can be able to forgive others let us be able to um always ask you Lord to be with us wherever even in making our decisions in Jesus name I pray these trusting and believing amen amen

[431.2s] Grace God's Grace Grace that is greater
[436.8s] than all our
[440.6s] sin so Emily what is
[444.6s] forgiveness um forgiveness to me is all
[449.6s] about letting go and not holding a
[452.9s] grudge towards someone it's about
[455.9s] letting go of their feelings whatever it
[458.2s] is when someone has done wrong to you
[460.8s] yes that's forgiveness to me thank you
[463.6s] for that and what does what does
[466.4s] forgiveness mean to you as well um I
[468.3s] think I'd like to agree with what Emily
[470.6s] has said um it is forgetting the wrong
[475.3s] that has been done to you and um letting
[479.0s] go of the G not holding on to any malth
[483.2s] or anything and
[486.2s] just being as if the wrong that was done
[489.5s] to you had never been done the first
[493.4s] place as we diverge into what
[495.6s] forgiveness is we all understand there's
[498.6s] a power that forgiveness
[501.4s] carries behind everything that happens
[503.9s] and just us forgetting that the wrong
[505.9s] our friends or our brothers or an
[508.4s] unknown person did to us us there's a
[511.0s] certain power that comes behind
[513.4s] it a story is told of a man who was
[516.5s] suffering from fibromyalgia and high
[518.9s] blood
[519.9s] pressure this man decides to go for a
[523.0s] counseling
[524.5s] session during the counseling session
[527.2s] they have an open heart-to- heart
[528.8s] conversation with the
[530.0s] counselor and there he lays his burden
[532.5s] and exper and and informs the counselor
[535.0s] that he is in a quar with a brother
[541.2s] mind
[542.6s] you the patient on this hand has
[545.7s] medication for fibromyalgia and high
[548.4s] blood pressure I'm trying to imagine in
[551.4s] in in itself this this person might be
[554.0s] going through troubles and tribulations
[556.2s] having to take this medication at this
[558.0s] point in time this other medication at
[559.4s] this point in time this person was
[561.5s] suffering inside of he had a battle that
[564.4s] he had to conquer in his
[566.9s] mind the counselor decides to
[570.0s] advising and be getting it from medical
[572.8s] point of view we understand that the
[575.8s] adrenal glands usually release adrenal
[579.5s] adrenaline and cortisol into your body
[582.2s] and these two important hormones May
[586.0s] contribute to fibromyalgia and high
[588.5s] blood
[589.7s] pressure the doctor or the counselor in
[592.4s] this case doesn't tell him stop taking
[594.3s] the medication he offers a simple advice
[599.4s] kindly forgive your
[603.0s] brother this person as he walks out of
[605.2s] the doctor's office this words ringing
[607.7s] in his ears and ringing in his mind
[610.1s] pushes conscience to take the next bold
[612.7s] step to ask for
[615.7s] reconciliation 4 months down the
[618.3s] line this person is improving from the
[620.8s] high blood pressure pressure is becoming
[622.6s] normal the fibromyalgia has been able to
[625.2s] control and is is is is is almost
[628.2s] nonexistent and and by the grace of
[630.3s] forgiveness and by the power of
[632.2s] forgiveness all medications are soon
[635.7s] been cleared from his
[638.2s] desk this is a power of
[641.8s] forgiveness wow that is such a powerful
[645.6s] lesson um we see how much Haring
[648.9s] bitterness can literally cause us
[651.3s] medical issues and we see that this is
[654.9s] what Satan is using to have a hold of
[657.5s] Our Lives um you
[659.9s] being imprisoned by your past but
[662.1s] there's hope um our lesson for today is
[665.1s] telling us to look up to Christ so that
[667.3s] we can learn how to forgive and our
[669.8s] major text for our lesson today is from
[672.8s] Matthew chapter 18 from vers 21 and 22
[677.1s] and I'll request Emily to read it for
[679.4s] us it says then Peter came to Jesus and
[683.5s] asked Lord how many times shall I
[685.7s] forgive my brother or sister who sins
[688.2s] against me up to seven times Jesus
[691.4s] answered I tell you not seven times but
[695.0s] 77
[696.9s] times thank you so much for that we can
[699.2s] see through this verse that Jesus is not
[701.1s] even limiting the Forgiveness to 490
[703.6s] times but Peter was shocked Peter was
[706.2s] shocked that I cannot just forgive my
[708.3s] brother seven times and let it stop
[710.2s] there um we do see how much these people
[714.6s] were living under the law it was
[717.0s] actually they misinterpreted God's word
[719.6s] they had read through Amos 1 verse 1 to3
[724.6s] where Christ where God um forgave the
[727.8s] Israelites enemies three times and on
[730.5s] the fourth time he he executed judgment
[734.0s] and we see that this was still the idea
[737.8s] that these people had on forgiveness
[739.9s] they did not know that as a Christian
[741.8s] you cannot measure how much you forgive
[744.0s] your brother forgiveness is given freely
[747.6s] and we also have a continuation of this
[751.2s] chapter on the unforgiving servant and
[754.8s] yawi will um tell us more about
[758.2s] that fantastic so I'll pick it off from
[761.0s] where Emily um started so Peter asks
[765.2s] Christ how many times should I forgive
[768.8s] and aside from uh
[772.4s] giving a straight answer Christ gives it
[775.7s] in a parable and he talks about
[779.7s] a king who had a servant who owed him
[784.0s] money and the amount actually was
[786.5s] 10,000 um talents um a quick Google
[790.5s] search tells me well I cannot verify
[794.2s] that 10,000 talents with a region of
[796.0s] $600 million
[798.7s] onwards right and the servant falls on
[801.6s] his knees and begs the king for
[803.4s] forgiveness the king wants to take his
[805.7s] wife and children into you know
[807.3s] captivity to try and repay the debt
[811.0s] and but upon seeking forgiveness the
[814.3s] king forgiv the
[815.8s] servant moving on the servant finds his
[819.0s] fellow a fellow servant who owes him
[821.0s] money the Bible says he owes him 100
[824.0s] dinari and again a quick Google search
[826.9s] told me that 100 Nar in the region of 8
[829.2s] to
[831.5s] 11,000 us
[834.7s] doar and the fellow servant begs the
[838.5s] first servant who has been forgiven by
[841.1s] the king for forgiveness and the fellow
[845.3s] sanes as Christians who know how to read
[848.5s] the Bible say Roth with his brother
[852.0s] takes his brother and throws him
[854.9s] into into prison and the King hears the
[859.0s] word gets back to the king as it often
[861.4s] does um of this and the king is wro
[865.3s] right is angry with the servant and and
[868.4s] and that says I'll just read you Wicked
[871.8s] I'm reading from verse 32 you Wicked
[873.4s] servant I forgive you all the debt
[875.3s] because you begged me should you not
[877.7s] also have had compassion on your fellow
[879.5s] servant just as as I had pity on you and
[883.0s] the King goes on
[884.4s] to to deliver this servant to the
[889.7s] torturers and Christ ends with a very
[893.4s] sobering um message he says so my
[895.8s] heavenly father also will do to you
[899.8s] will also do to you if each of you from
[902.1s] his heart does not forgive his brother
[905.7s] his trespasses so very moving story
[909.8s] there it really is moving um it just
[913.6s] shows us how God has extended us so much
[916.0s] grace and sometimes we are not we are
[918.9s] not willing to extend that same Grace to
[921.5s] our to our fellow human
[924.1s] beings um and I'd like um Emily to
[927.5s] answer this question for us how is God's
[929.8s] standard of forgiveness different from
[932.3s] ours
[933.8s] um God's um forgiveness is abundant it
[938.8s] is UN conditional it's unending when we
[942.2s] compare to us humans we tend to make
[945.2s] reservations we forgive with um limited
[949.8s] we're limited to our forgiveness in
[951.8s] terms of we we are based on WE base our
[954.3s] forgiveness on emotions grades um sense
[958.0s] of justice
[959.6s] because we have to we we always tend to
[963.4s] what is it called Revenge yes that's how
[966.7s] it is different from God God does not
[969.6s] Revenge God never revenges but as we are
[972.6s] very different but there's there's hope
[974.2s] for us right we um sorry okay if I can
[980.5s] just interject I think when when God as
[983.6s] informs Peter that he should forgive 70
[985.5s] * 7 do for 90 times I'm trying to
[988.2s] imagine as as as as
[990.0s] as human being placed in country X or
[993.9s] country y will you clearly count this I
[997.3s] forgive this person day one this number
[999.1s] one I forgive this person number two
[1001.0s] it's it's practically impossible and
[1004.4s] even if you have the people who are good
[1005.8s] at record keeping you say I'm forgiving
[1008.1s] people for nine times per day and and
[1010.0s] and trying to imagine how we've been
[1011.4s] looking at the state of the mind and
[1012.6s] also how the worlding itself an anger
[1014.9s] pandemic you're like so I forgive the
[1017.1s] economy for being har on me give some
[1021.0s] things it's not personal so as even if
[1024.1s] we looking things from emotion emotional
[1026.2s] perspective we of ourselves need to also
[1029.2s] give it freely it was given to us freely
[1032.0s] let's return it
[1033.7s] freely yeah um sorry I wanted to just
[1036.4s] answer your question and and Emily has
[1038.7s] put it so well um but in Psalms 103
[1042.6s] verse 11 right says for the for as the
[1046.2s] heavens are high above the Earth so
[1048.5s] great is his Mercy towards those who
[1050.2s] fear Him as far as the East is from the
[1053.4s] West so far has he removed our
[1056.1s] transgressions from us and mikah 7:19
[1058.7s] says he has cast our sins to the depths
[1063.2s] of the sea amen he will again have
[1066.0s] compassion on us and will subdue our
[1069.6s] iniquities amen that is forgiveness God
[1073.5s] style
[1075.0s] amen and I think and
[1077.6s] also in an interesting um thing about
[1080.6s] God is even before he created us he knew
[1083.7s] that man would fall he knew that no he
[1086.9s] didn't know he set a plan in place in
[1090.8s] case man fell and this plan was to
[1095.7s] reconcile us back to him it just shows
[1098.0s] how much God loves us that even before
[1101.8s] we were created he already had a plan to
[1105.6s] reconcile us back to him and he gave us
[1107.1s] his son Jesus Christ
[1109.3s] and through that we have and the Bible
[1112.5s] says
[1114.1s] um Christ was the lamb slain from the
[1116.4s] foundation of the world that means that
[1120.7s] be before when God was setting up the
[1123.4s] foundations of the world Christ was
[1126.3s] already offered up as a as as a
[1130.2s] sacrifice for the sin that we had not
[1133.9s] even committed yet before there was sin
[1137.5s] there was a a savior savior God is
[1141.2s] amazing amen um
[1143.7s] Elijah um how should God's forgiveness
[1147.0s] towards us change how we forgive
[1151.2s] others I think I'll approach that from
[1153.8s] The Lord's Prayer there's a part that
[1156.5s] says may you forgive us our trespasses
[1159.9s] as we forgive us who trespass against us
[1162.5s] we in ourselves cannot do it because
[1166.0s] let's take a I'm sorry to use because in
[1169.2s] the country keny let's take a typical
[1171.1s] Kenyan wakes up understands this tax to
[1174.0s] be paid goes and is maybe a pass a car
[1178.0s] passes by and throws some water on them
[1180.0s] because it's
[1181.3s] raining this person by the time they get
[1183.5s] to the office anger is just piling upon
[1186.5s] them but then how then do they come down
[1190.0s] and say okay I forgive you someone in
[1192.6s] case someone just I sent you to bring me
[1194.5s] document a bring me document B how then
[1197.0s] you get do they get to the point that
[1198.4s] they say
[1199.8s] I forgive you because most case if that
[1202.9s] happens that is your morning when you
[1204.5s] get and someone does that to you you'll
[1206.0s] be like okay this the person
[1210.6s] I but we need to the fact that as as as
[1215.2s] as Paul
[1217.1s] said we in ourselves cannot do it before
[1221.3s] before we were there as was for us so
[1225.2s] let's not look at the now let's not
[1227.7s] forgive based forgiveness on emotions
[1230.6s] let's just also pick it from their point
[1232.6s] of view yes understand where they're
[1234.4s] coming from maybe they also had a hectic
[1236.2s] morning and they're now confused in
[1237.8s] office so we need to also forgive
[1241.0s] because it was given to us yeah thank
[1244.1s] you I'm forgiveness should be abundant
[1246.5s] and overflowing in
[1250.0s] us um how is refusing to forgive others
[1254.2s] a rejection of God's
[1257.3s] forgiveness right
[1259.1s] I like what you said sorry that's why
[1261.8s] seem a bit
[1263.5s] distracted but I'll pick it up from what
[1265.5s] you said the Lord's Prayer it says
[1268.4s] um and forgive us our debts as we
[1271.7s] forgive our Deb debtors so what I'm
[1276.0s] proclaiming when I say the Lord's Prayer
[1278.7s] is the measure with which I forgive is
[1282.2s] the measure with which I want you God to
[1284.7s] forgive me so if I forgive completely
[1288.2s] then Lord forgive me completely complely
[1291.0s] if I forgive partially then God forgive
[1293.3s] meally if I do not forgive at all then
[1296.7s] God do not forgive me at all
[1300.8s] so and that's why this lesson is is is
[1303.4s] very powerful to me because it means
[1307.6s] that it's one of the few things I don't
[1309.8s] know if there are any other things but
[1311.0s] it's one of the few things that God ties
[1314.1s] his response to us with our own actions
[1317.5s] how I forgive others is how I should be
[1319.9s] forgiven yeah thank you so much
[1322.8s] and sometimes when you actually refuse
[1325.4s] to forgive you've cut off that channel
[1327.3s] of forgiveness if you don't forgive God
[1329.5s] will actually not forgive you and it all
[1332.4s] stems from love it means that you really
[1334.3s] need to love your neighbor and you need
[1335.9s] to love love comes from and love your
[1337.9s] enemies as well as you love who as you
[1340.2s] love yourself yes and we see that it's
[1344.0s] not a strange thing for us to be
[1346.8s] hurt but for forgiveness is something
[1350.4s] you must choose daily um you must choose
[1353.5s] to forgive this person daily and you
[1355.1s] must choose not to haror that heart and
[1358.8s] bitterness in you and sometimes we see
[1361.6s] that that is very
[1362.8s] challenging um so Emily what are some
[1366.1s] challenging Parts about forgiveness and
[1367.6s] how do you think we can overcome
[1370.1s] that um some challenging Parts the
[1374.2s] hardest part about forgiveness is
[1376.4s] basically letting go it's hard for us to
[1379.5s] let go of UK when you remember someone
[1384.0s] hurt you it's hard for you to just let
[1387.2s] go of that person yeah and another
[1390.0s] challenge is when the other person
[1393.3s] that's had you does not feel any remorse
[1397.0s] at all of his actions it hurts you that
[1400.9s] that person is not even acknowledging
[1402.7s] the fact that he hurt you that's how
[1405.5s] hard forgiveness is yes at times
[1409.6s] yeah if if if I can just pick it from
[1412.4s] where she she has left it other
[1415.0s] challenge that we have when it comes
[1416.6s] forgiveness is trust
[1419.0s] yeah I'll just throw a question to the
[1421.0s] audience and also anyone can feel free
[1423.4s] to answer it it is rhetorical more
[1425.6s] rhetorical how many times do you
[1428.1s] question yourself after you forgiven
[1429.6s] something very many times let's take it
[1432.6s] how Christ views us most of the times
[1434.9s] you're like he as we say there's no big
[1437.6s] SC there's no small sin sin sin but then
[1441.0s] you're like the sin I've committed today
[1442.7s] is
[1444.0s] humongous and you're like will really
[1446.1s] God forgive me is the same thing that we
[1448.3s] have with us when we forgiving one
[1451.0s] another do we trust the other part will
[1453.2s] also forgive us do we trust that yes in
[1456.6s] in personally I forgiven them but will
[1459.6s] they forgive me or they'll continue Hing
[1462.1s] this until as we say
[1466.0s] in please translate
[1470.2s] in in in in in in English until you
[1472.6s] found each other on a wrong
[1475.5s] corner will they forgive
[1477.8s] us will they now wait for us until that
[1480.2s] point in time the same thing when David
[1482.6s] forgives Saul David no matter how many
[1486.3s] how many times Saul came unto him he was
[1488.4s] like I forgiven you but you see Saul
[1491.4s] kept coming this this plan a fails Plan
[1495.0s] B Plan B fails plan C plan C fails plan
[1498.1s] do have such people who when we forgive
[1501.4s] We Like
[1502.5s] H I forgive them once but I don't trust
[1505.1s] them I can forgive them a second
[1507.3s] time thank you sorry and and in in in in
[1510.5s] in relation to the question you asked
[1512.7s] with regards to you know what are the
[1514.8s] difficulties and I'll look back to the
[1517.1s] definition so I'll give a very mundane
[1519.6s] example just to drive the point home so
[1522.6s] you're standing here right yeah and so
[1525.6s] the first time I passed by there you
[1527.2s] punch me in the face
[1529.4s] um I forgive you
[1531.6s] yes then tomorrow I pass by there you
[1533.8s] punch me in the face I forgive you
[1537.0s] again so um what um the the next day
[1542.9s] come when pass there um you will punch
[1546.0s] me in the face judging the way you're
[1547.8s] looking at me you will punch me in the
[1549.2s] face
[1551.1s] um but is if if if is forgiveness when
[1556.4s] you say forgive and forget yes do I
[1560.2s] forget what is that what is forgetting
[1563.2s] is it literally forgetting like
[1565.7s] literally forgetting to the point where
[1569.0s] I still put myself in H's way yeah right
[1573.4s] I hope you understand what I'm saying in
[1575.1s] you know in in the you'll know what is
[1577.6s] happening but but I'm still going there
[1580.4s] or can I forgive and this actually a gen
[1583.3s] can I forgive you but avoid you avoid
[1587.3s] you oh yes right so because you know um
[1591.6s] some people have horrible things have
[1593.5s] been done to people and you know some
[1595.8s] people say some of the worst things are
[1597.4s] done by people we trust we know
[1600.7s] so by forgiving yes I forgiven you but
[1605.8s] does forgiving and forgetting mean I
[1607.3s] still put
[1609.2s] myself put myself make myself vulnerable
[1612.5s] to that person or to that that
[1616.3s] situation um that's the idea
[1618.8s] deal unfortunately for most of us and
[1622.7s] this is where God's grace comes in it
[1625.7s] will not happen like that but God has
[1630.0s] given us the opportunity to forgive and
[1633.6s] forgive forgiveness is something you
[1635.0s] give you give it
[1636.3s] freely but the trust is something you
[1639.1s] will earn back if I keep on I'm punching
[1642.8s] NWI as he passes on that path God forbid
[1645.6s] for God forbid um NWI should find a way
[1648.9s] to not cut me off but literally protect
[1653.6s] his space and I think calls for wisdom
[1655.2s] doesn't it it calls for a lot of wisdom
[1658.3s] and that is
[1660.4s] why we are going to learn how to we just
[1665.2s] need to pray for strength and Clarity
[1667.6s] from God to give you that clear view of
[1671.1s] how to face it to give the wisdom yes
[1675.6s] it's it is difficult to rebuild the
[1679.3s] trust with that person again yes and is
[1682.8s] something you're forced to do but God
[1684.5s] tells you to you can
[1687.2s] try but if it's too difficult for you
[1690.5s] you can just get yourself out of that
[1694.3s] situation I I I think right now and
[1697.9s] that's why they say come now let's
[1698.9s] reason together when you look at the
[1700.4s] word forgive give is there and for f o r
[1705.2s] yes and when you when when you take
[1707.0s] those two things a part four is you're
[1709.7s] doing it to another person give is
[1713.0s] removing from you giving to another
[1714.4s] person yes but then as as as we're
[1717.0s] looking at this forgiveness also
[1718.6s] relieves a burden on us so we are giving
[1722.0s] something when both words things are
[1724.7s] going from us we are letting it go but
[1729.0s] then it is
[1731.3s] also relieving a burden for us so what
[1733.5s] I'm getting from that is we have to it
[1735.8s] is not ours in our
[1741.6s] we give it by Word of Mouth give it by
[1743.7s] word of mind give by of yes but it is
[1748.4s] essentially for the other
[1750.7s] person but now it has a duplicity in it
[1754.5s] it will be for the other person and also
[1757.2s] for me
[1758.9s] myself I love I love the question asked
[1763.4s] and I think you can answer for us this
[1765.1s] question um how does holding that
[1766.6s] resentment literally Happ your physical
[1768.9s] and mental
[1771.1s] health are you should ask that question
[1773.2s] anyway no I love the question you asked
[1776.1s] buches pulling up you you when when I
[1780.3s] think as as as and I pick up from
[1783.6s] where elah um dropped it um he said that
[1788.4s] forgiveness yes it's for the other
[1790.3s] person but it's also for for us and why
[1793.3s] is it for me because um as you said
[1798.0s] holding on you holding on to a grudge
[1799.9s] you're holding on to you know to to mly
[1802.6s] something that ties you down anger
[1805.9s] resentment and you may not know but it
[1810.1s] it it knows at you it eats at you and
[1813.5s] they say that whoever makes you angry
[1815.4s] has power over you because uh I'm
[1818.2s] somewhere in my room
[1819.9s] snoring and um Sandra
[1823.8s] is is is no not the the one the one who
[1827.4s] thinking about because I make you angry
[1829.8s] yes so me I'm sleeping but her she's
[1832.8s] angry because of me she can't sleep she
[1834.4s] doesn't have have peace so it it it it
[1838.0s] messes with you because it eats at you
[1840.6s] and it is only when you let
[1844.4s] go say you let go and you let God right
[1847.2s] yes it's only when you let go
[1849.8s] that you the the power that this person
[1853.2s] has over you is is released right and
[1857.1s] that is why for forgiveness yes as you
[1858.8s] have said very rightly it is for the
[1861.0s] other person and you're giving the other
[1862.6s] person but also for my own self for my
[1865.7s] own mental health which is has been a
[1868.8s] running thing in our study these past
[1871.4s] few studies yes um thank you so much and
[1874.8s] we've literally from this discussion
[1876.7s] we've seen that learning to forgive is
[1878.3s] very difficult but there's a nice
[1881.3s] acronym that we have here that will
[1883.9s] teach us how to take these baby steps um
[1887.4s] into forgiv giving someone and the
[1889.9s] acronym is preach so the P stands for
[1893.4s] pray um and I think this is one thing we
[1896.3s] should never don'tplay prayer is a very
[1898.0s] important part in our lives and we
[1900.8s] should pray for God to soften our hearts
[1904.0s] to help us see this other person
[1907.4s] situation and in that p as well that he
[1910.5s] may create a new heart within us and new
[1913.9s] a right Spate within us it's very
[1915.8s] difficult to forgive but by prayer we
[1918.3s] can be able to get that strength to
[1920.4s] forgive this person oh so the next one
[1922.9s] is um remember right remember the
[1927.3s] wrongdoing do not push anything aside
[1932.0s] especially if it makes you feel angry or
[1935.4s] upset name your emotion write it down
[1938.5s] and note What specifically makes you
[1940.7s] feel that emotion take that emotion and
[1944.8s] relinquish the heart to him as far as
[1948.0s] Peter 5:7 says cast all your cares upon
[1951.2s] Him for he cares about you then ask God
[1956.2s] how as a Christian should handle these
[1959.0s] emotions amen amen uh the next letter is
[1963.2s] e empathize empathize sorry
[1967.2s] empathize understanding what the other
[1969.2s] person has experienced in no way excuses
[1972.4s] the wrong but it does not add
[1975.0s] perspective as God to ask God to help
[1978.5s] you begin seeing the person through his
[1982.4s] I
[1984.0s] amen after empathizing you need to
[1987.4s] assess you need to take
[1990.4s] a stock of the flaws and the
[1994.5s] shortcomings and these are not for the
[1996.3s] other person but your own flaws and
[1998.1s] shortcomings you need to see this are my
[2000.6s] weak points this are where I'm strong at
[2003.7s] then as as as you sing just reflect on
[2007.4s] the when you yourself are forgiven how
[2011.0s] did it make you
[2013.5s] feel you need because you can't extend
[2017.4s] forgiveness if you don't know the joy
[2019.6s] that forgiveness carries so you need to
[2023.6s] assess after assessing you need to
[2026.3s] commit um commit yourself to
[2028.8s] forgive um you can do this by telling a
[2031.0s] friend you can journ it down you can
[2034.5s] write a letter that you will not send to
[2036.4s] this person but you will read it over
[2038.7s] and over again and you will imagine the
[2041.8s] freedom that comes from forgiving this
[2043.9s] person
[2046.0s] and you'll ask God to take this burden
[2051.1s] away from you amen last but not least is
[2055.0s] to hold on to God and hold on to the
[2059.6s] Forgiveness when the
[2061.6s] pain of the wrongdoing comes back take
[2065.2s] it back to God In Prayer leave it with
[2067.7s] with him and hold on to him to the
[2070.9s] Forgiveness that he has enabled you to
[2072.9s] forgive with preach reach um thank you
[2077.9s] so much and from this we see that
[2080.6s] forgiveness is not easy forgiving and
[2082.3s] forgetting is not easy but when we hold
[2084.6s] on to Jesus he will help us and he will
[2088.1s] guide us through this if if if I can
[2090.9s] just
[2092.6s] interject from the definition and also
[2095.2s] from what you're learning is there's an
[2096.8s] aspect of forgetting
[2098.6s] I think is it's more of a video I came
[2101.0s] across that says does now forgetting
[2103.2s] mean I have amnesia because forgetting
[2106.3s] in itself is like not easy at the back
[2109.2s] of your mind you may say you forgiven
[2110.8s] the
[2111.6s] person but 10 years down the like by the
[2115.1s] way you did X I have not forgotten you
[2119.4s] didn't do me well so we have to
[2121.9s] acknowledge even as as as our viewers
[2123.7s] wherever you may be watching forgiveness
[2125.8s] does not mean you for like forget does
[2128.0s] not mean you'll have amnes raes you'll
[2130.6s] sleep and you back to
[2133.1s] factory ftic means
[2135.2s] [Music]
[2136.4s] you left it away like you're going
[2139.8s] through a river you've crossed that
[2141.0s] bridge and it is there you leave it
[2142.9s] there The Bridge Water will come and
[2144.8s] wash it away in form of Christ and
[2147.2s] Christ let it carry that burden from you
[2149.6s] because if you not forget and if if if
[2152.5s] you just continue having it at the back
[2153.9s] of your mind it will be problems in
[2156.9s] Matthew chter 8
[2158.7s] 18:35 and it says so my heavenly father
[2163.5s] also will do to you so my heavenly
[2166.1s] father also will do to you if each of
[2169.1s] you from his heart does not forgive his
[2173.8s] brother his
[2176.1s] trespasses it's very simple yet profound
[2179.5s] if you do not forgive then please do not
[2182.7s] expect to be
[2184.1s] forgiven for sure for sure and remember
[2187.2s] that Jesus wants to set you free um and
[2190.3s] he will help you forgive everyone who's
[2192.6s] wronged you thank you so much for
[2193.8s] joining us and I'll ask Emily to pray
[2196.3s] with us as we finish our lesson let us
[2199.3s] bow on our heads for a word of prayer
[2201.8s] heavly father I come before you this
[2203.6s] hour thanking you for the gift of life
[2205.6s] we thank you for allowing us to read
[2207.8s] this lesson uh soften our hearts even as
[2210.7s] we're about to continue uh with our
[2213.9s] daily lives soften our hearts so that we
[2215.6s] can be able to forgive others let us be
[2218.2s] able to um always ask you Lord to be
[2222.8s] with us wherever even in making our
[2225.0s] decisions in Jesus name I pray these
[2227.2s] trusting and believing amen amen
