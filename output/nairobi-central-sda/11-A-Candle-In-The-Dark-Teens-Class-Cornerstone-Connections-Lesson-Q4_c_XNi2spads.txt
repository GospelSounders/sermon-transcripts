teacher jonan we're going to have a melodious singing from the Acappella group for him and our amazing sign language interpreter Joyce the mission story comes all the way from United States of America from a state called Alaska and the title is a changed heart Vacation Bible School was an exciting time for children in bethl Alaska Alaska Vacation Bible School meant hearing wonderful stories from the Bible it meant singing joyful songs it meant enjoying yummy snacks it also meant having new friends with people who flew from far away just to bring Vacation Bible School to the town no roads go to bethl people have to fly in an airplane or ride in a boat to reach it about 35 kids from all grounds gathered for vacation bible school at the 7th Day Adventist Church along this among these children was a little boy named Nelson Nelson wasn't too sure about vacation bible school he had different ideas about how things should be done he didn't quite understand why the grown-ups were so excited about God and he wanted to change the the way they did activities however he had a big reason to come to Vacation Bible School his friends were there and he didn't want to miss out on the fun Nelson who was just 9 years old acted mischievously at the vacation bible school he stole someone's heart poked the other children and treated the grown-ups disrespectfully now helping out at Vacation Bible School was a friendly teenager named Isaac Isaac was 16 years old and had flown to bethl to help the grown-ups teach the kids about God he kindly told Nelson that his behavior wasn't appropriate you can join vacation bible school and have fun but you need to behave yourself he said otherwise we'll have to send you away Nelson didn't like what he had but he agreed fine I'll behave he said but he kept misbehaving finally another grownup named Logan took him aside Nelson what you're doing is not appropriate he said but we will give you one more chance because we want you to be a part of our vacation bible school but you must promise to behave yourself this time Nelson wouldn't agree I I don't want to be here he said angrily I'm leaving he stormed out of the church and furiously pedal his bike away everyone thought that Nelson wouldn't be back but he returned the next day just as Isaac and Logan were handing out snacks why are you here here Nelson Isaac asked being at home was boring Nelson said I want to be with my friends can I come back will you promise to behave and be nice to everyone Logan asked Nelson thought for a moment okay but that's boring he said can I do something else you can go home if you want Logan replied Nelson didn't want to go home no I'll stay he said Isaac gave him a snack of crackers but instead of eating the crackers himself Nelson shared them with a girl who didn't have any Isaac was surprised why did you have why did you do that he said I want to show you that I would I want to be here Nelson replied from that moment Nelson be began to change he stopped poking the other children and he treated the grown-ups respectfully at the end of vocation Bible School Isaac said goodbye to the kids by giving them high fives but Nelson wanted something more he asked he asked Isaac for a big hug when Isaac left Nelson rode his bike to the bethl airport and waved goodbye as he boarded the airplane God gave Nelson a new heart and Isaac hopes that

and good evening to you wherever you're joining us from welcome to lesson 11 of the fourth quarter and uh as Ariana rightfully said our title is a CLE in the dark but before we begin well let me just introduce our panelist starting from the far right okay my name is H and I'm happy to be here um my name is Cynthia and I'm happy to be here hi everyone my name is Emily hi everyone my name is Salas and I am teacher jonan I'll be guiding you throughout this discussion so I ask I like to ask Emily to uh pray before we begin okay let's bow our heads for a word of prayer Our dearly father we come before you this day thanking you for the gift of life we thank you for allowing us to gather here together in your name even as we about to study your word let us give us your uh give us the spirit of understanding let us be able to understand whatever we'll read from your word and be able to apply it in our lives in Jesus name I pray amen amen thank you so our theme for this quarter has been Deliverance which is basically talking about the Israelites time in captivity and today's lesson is about Isaiah one of the prophets and funny thing is Isaiah lived about 200 years before the Israelites went to captivity in Babylon but what is written in his book was just prophesying basically what was going to happen to the Israelites if they fell out of favor with God which they eventually did and Isaiah is one of the prophets who spoke a lot about the coming of Jesus Christ and the Jews had lived over the years with a certain hope that something better is coming and this all started in the Garden of Eden after Adam and Eve ate the fruit and fell into sin one of the things God said after he had given the punishments was the serpent will bite the hill but you will crush its head right an offspring will come out of Eve and crush the head of the serpent that was the thing that the Israelites were always looking forward for and that is a coming Messiah but before we get to our lesson we have an one of the Adventist beliefs that ties up to a lesson that is the holy scriptures that is belief number one and that is what we base all that believe in as Adventist from so we like just to move to the what do you think section to start us off with our lesson for today I'd like to ask H Felix to take us through that H okay um in the what do you think action um there a question here they're asking when things are really going bad for me I usually so we do have the choices that one is talk to someone one is pray and there other choices but what I chose was that first of all most what I usually do is I try to avoid um dealing with the situation because like if something is car if something is frustrating you try to tend to run away from it to avoid confronting it all right so um I can ask any other person who has an answer to the question to chip in yeah I can get a Cynthia's view when things are really going bad for you what do you usually do I cry um I cry and then I talk to someone and then I'll pray after but the first step I I'll cry for real yeah like tears it's actually a normal human reaction know when things are bad you you'll just result back to the the normal you you cry or you some people get angry you know silus what do you do when you things are going really bad for you I work out you walk out yes you just like forget all the pain so basically just a distraction not really it's enjoy the pain yeah because uh when you work out it releases the happy hormon so yes when you it's also called the Feelgood hormone but I prefer to say the happy hormone yeah so when I work out yeah and then I forget about it or I deal with it after I've worked out so yeah at that time I'll be maybe if someone had wronged me I just deal with them happily yeah like they didn't wrong me which might get them upset but it'll do me good because I wouldn't uh be as angry as yes all right so probably how you can read for us there there's a verse on the punch lines uh you can just open your Bibles Galatians 4:4 and 5 and just read that verse okay Galatians 4:4 and5 but when the set time had fully come God sent his son born of a woman born under the law to redeem those under the law that we might receive adoption to sunship thank you for that so basically what this says is um God had ordained the time you know and uh our fundamental belief number one I can just read what it says get that fundamental belief number one that is the holy Scriptures it says that in his word God has committed to Human the knowledge necessary for salvation the holy scriptures are the Supreme authoritative and the infallible revelation of his will they are the standard of character the test of experience the definitive revealer of doctrines and the trustworthy record of God's acts in history so when things are dark in our lives what the Bible basically is trying to say is that God has planned your future right Jeremiah 29:11 for I know the plans I have for you plans for good not for for evil so what we can learn from this what this Quest is trying to prompt from us is that even when times are really dark in our lives sh you should just trust that God has the best plans for us in Future No matter how dark it seems as our title says a candle in the dark and God is the candle through the word amen okay so we'll now go to our story that's into the story if you have the lesson you can just turn your lessons into the story section and uh for those who don't have it our story comes from Isaiah 11: 1-9 and Isaiah 40: 28-31 I'd like to ask Emily to take us through that okay thank you for the summary for the brief synopsis um so I'll just give a summary of what's Happening into the story and the passage that is there it just Isaiah paints a very powerful picture of Hope and restoration Even in our darkest times darkest of times because as it has been told um the Israelites were at their time of Exile in Babylon and he was just giving them an encouragement that God is there no matter what they should always um have hope and trust in him that he will restore them and he will be able to free them from their Exile um Isaiah speaks to the people people of Judah during their time of Despair just giving them um a vision of our future where God's justice and peace Reigns um we also see that even us during our we also face our Exiles not like the the Israelites but we also have our Exiles in life and uh the passage basically gives us encouragement that even when we feeling very unbearable the promise in Isa Isaiah encourages us to imagine a time when peace and righteousness will prevail um oh can all right thank you for that um so there's a brief illustration I'd like to give thank you em for the summary before we just answer a few questions from out of the story section um there was there was a very big go that happened while back probably when most of your grandparents were still teenagers right that's the Vietnam War and uh there was a general an American General who was captured in by the Vietnamese and his name was Robie rner now this guy was held as a prisoner and a very terrible conditions for 7 years right so for 7 years he was in a Cell alone and the only thing that he saw there was a small hole in the ground on his cell now the Vietnamese cells they usually they were elevated so there were a bit of some poles just poking out and now the cell was on top so there bit there was a bit of air flow underneath cuz it's a very hot area so on his cell flow there was a hole so one time he just decided to just dig through the wood and get underneath see what is inside there you know just what's underneath so he can escape but he was disappointed because underneath the wood and flow boards was a concrete floow now the concrete floor I think this was just made to break him the concrete flooor had a single hole now through that single hole the only thing you could see outside was a blade of grass just some grass underneath his cell so for 7 years every single day he'd wake up and just look through the floorboards and that's what gave him hope that I am not alone there is still some something outside there's there's hope that one day leave this place all right and it is the same thing with us when we are in tough times when when we in really dark moments we hold on to something good A Memory of times when when times were good when you fail your exams you're like I have failed but there were days I used to get 100% there were days I used to get a it's a human nature to look for the smallest sliver of hope that we can get for the Christian Life that is a Bible verse an encouragement a friend just comes and tells you Silas it's going to be okay that single thing and our lesson today now points us that Christ can be that blade of grass like that prison I was saying Christ is that single light shining through a darkest Mo all right so we can answer a few questions from the out of the story section em okay um I'll start with this question uh question number four what kind of Messiah or deliverer is Promised in this passages and what will he do for God's people um Felix uh I'd like to hear your points or your view yeah okay so um what Isa is talking about here is the coming of Jesus Christ um for the first time in the Book of Matthew when Jesus was born of a virgin and he came basically to relieve us from the the problem of sin so the kind of Messiah that is been talked about is Jesus Christ who came to Deliver Us from the sin problem yeah okay um cythia um I really don't want to add so much cuz as the story I know theop time will reach but um in the sop it says that the the title is the coming of the deliverer so Jesus is coming to Deliver Us from bondage from so many problems of this world so he came and he conquered so that we have hope yeah um I'll also add one last Point um he comes as a Shepherd um because he cares for the people as said in Isaiah 40 verse Isaiah 40:1 um on to the next question how are these prophecies relevant to us today what hope do they offer for people in 2024 um Ronan okay uh the Bible the Bible is as much as it was written over 2,000 years ago every single word that it says is relevant to us today and uh Paul says in 2 Timothy 3:16 all scripture is profitable for teaching for reproof for correction and for guiding into righteousness so the words of the scriptures of these prophecies um let me call it a a double onra like a double edged sword right Isaiah was talking about the coming of Christ the first time when he came to Earth to Deliver us from sin all right so he died for the on the cross for us but Christ also coming the second time to still Deliver Us from this world of sin again so it gives us hope we are in a time where things are changing so fast right sometimes you can even just keep up with what's happening and there is so much um immorality and erosion of morals and many people forgetting about God so Isaiah's Isaiah's prophecies actually just tell us that hope is coming there is still hope there there's that light in the dark for us even the coming year which is just a few weeks away also it gives us Eternal hope knowing that it will rain with God forever um and there'll be Eternal peace and just this after all this all right thank you for that so uh we would like to read our key text that is from Isaiah 40:31 I'd like to ask Silas to read that for us that's Isaiah 40:31 can open your Bibles okay Isaiah 40:31 says but those who wait on the Lord shall renew their strength they shall Mount up there with wings like eagles they shall run and not be weary they shall walk and not faint mhm thank you for that that's it's a very popular verse especially for guys doing exams you know always read through Isaiah 4031 says you know but it's really important to us um the idea of hope uh what our lesson says the idea of Hope is closely connected to the idea of waiting cuz if we always got what we wanted right away like what what uses it for us to wait we'd never know what hope is if every time you'd order food and it's there within like a minute or so we'd never know what hope is right so God cultivates in us hope by making us wait okay hope is what we do when things aren't going our way when our prayers aren't answered right away hope is what carries us through the dark hours while we wait for an answer to prayer all right so I'd like just to ask this just a question just think about and our viewers as well what are you waiting for what are your hope what are you hoping for what is that thing you have been praying for so long but you still have hope God going to do it for you so just take heart in knowing that God promises that um if you wait upon him as ver says you'll Mount up um like strength like eagles you know and he promises you what you want if you wait upon him in his time okay so I like us to read uh the flashlight like Cynthia to take us through that and just give us what Insight uh Ellen White says on that the flashlight okay so the flashlight is from prophets and Kings page 700 and it says Century after Century passed away finally the voices of the prophets seized the hand of of the oppressor was Heavy upon Israel as the Jews departed from God faith grew dim and hope well night ceased to illuminate the future the words of the prophets were uncomprehended by many but in Heavens canel the power of the coming of Christ had been determined and when the fullness of the time was come God sent forth his son Galatians 44 so to the SOP this so many so much to highlight but I'll just uh highlight a few so there's a part that says fa Faith grew deep and hope well night ceased to illuminate the future uh at some point cuz the Isaiah had prophesized that Christ was going to come 2,000 years before so it was during this time just imagine you're like the Jews cuz we all know that till dat some Jews have not accepted that Christ has come so they had waited for 2,000 years and so many years for the coming of Christ and then Christ comes and they start questioning him and asking questions eh are you Christ and then you know Christ used to refer back to scripture and he used the pist he referred back to Zechariah he referred back to so many scriptures to say that I am the Messiah who has come and uh the point I want to bring out Bring Out is the part that says faith grew deep and hope welln night cease to illuminate the future now to our lives right now we since the since 1844 after the great disappointment we have started hearing about the second coming of Christ we are in the year 2024 yeah I forgot for a minute we in the year 2024 and he has not yet come yeah and in this waiting time you can get tired and you can feel is he really coming back happening but we have prophecies we have so many prophecies Daniel has wrote Revelation John wrote in Revelation so many prophecies that are pointing out to the of Christ so in this waiting time that is when there will be that shaing seeve Waits and the tears yeah wait and the tears yeah it is during this waiting time that we will know who is truly waiting for real and who is kidding to say so uh I I have a question actually mhm so it's in the Tuesday part the question says do you think today we are living in the time when faith has grown de and hope no longer seems to illuminate the future if so what can this passage say to us and maybe yeah um yeah Felix looks like he has something to say okay so um from Sy question um what the encouragement we get from what we are reading um in this story is that there is a reason God is still coming we may face challenges through life cuz it can't be just a straight path God tells us that throughout the time we're waiting for his coming there going to be challenges they going to be problems but what we should learn to do is to learn to persevere to learn to understand that for Jesus to come this challenges are part of it true it's it's like before before it it's like it has to happen before Christ finally comes yeah true and actually um Christ said that in John 14 John 16:3 vers 33 33 yes thank you for that it says uh in this world you'll have trouble but he adds but take heart forever overcome the world Amen um this there's something also that was mentioned in one of U the book recordings we do on the book uh when God said remember something about pressing on towards the mark and in this life being a Christian is is not easy let's be honest you know you're missing out on so many things like you know right now you could be missing out on your friends hanging out somewhere but you here helping other people understand the word of God and Christ did not promise an easy Journey if Christianity was easy then everyone will be a Christian you know but it's not and the trials make us better Christians think of Christianity and the troubles that we Face through as a refining process you're being um it's like when a carpenter is trying to make wood smooth what does he use just sandpaper something that's really rough so he rubs across it to make it smooth to make it fine that is what God does with our lives and it is a dark time you know but we just have that hope Christ Christ is on our side we need not worry about anything yeah and just to sum up um Mrs White says that it was during that time when the faith had grewed de that is when God's divine plan fell into place so just when you're almost losing hope that is when that is when Christ is coming that is when you see the clouds when you when you're saying I don't think I want to be a Christian anymore and that's when the clouds start unfolding you see not don't take it literally but the fact that when it seems like the world is becoming terrible we are moving closer to the second coming of Christ amen true thank you for that it's always is darkest before Dawn yeah that's what people say all right so I'd like us to read um one of the verses it should be on our punch lines that's uh Isaiah 9:6 Isaiah 9:6 I'd like to ask Emily to read that verse 6 and 7 the second punch line for to us a child is born to us a son is given and to the government will be on his shoulders and he will be called wonderful counselor Mighty God Everlasting father Prince of Peace of the greatness of his government and peace there will be no end he will reign on David's throne and over his kingdom establishing and upholding it with Justice and righteousness from that time on and forever the Zeal of the Lord Almighty will accomplish this amen thank you for that um this it's actually a very appropriate verse around this time is when many people tend to think about the birth of Jesus so it's it's really erroneous to think about Jesus coming every single day um but this verse is the hope that Jews have been holding on to and now Christians are holding on to as well Christ coming on this Earth there has never been a better gift to the the world and it is funny as cindia has said this are the people the Jews were waiting for Jesus for over 2,000 years and when he's right in their midst they cannot recognize him so do you think at times in our lives when we we pray for things when we ask for things and they actually come and it's an answer from God do you think there are times we fail to see that this is the this is the thing I've been praying for yeah it's very possible so what you guys think we do about it what do you think we can um do as waiting for our prayers to be answered um what we can do so that wait let me see if I've gotten what you're saying right that what can we do so that we can not so that we don't forget lose hope forget as we waiting you see when you've prayed for something when you're hoping right as the Israelites did uhhuh um as you're hoping what can you do as you prepare for God's answer to your prayers okay yeah got it right as you're waiting you have to read the scriptures you have to literally keep on you have dig deep you really have to dig deep into the scriptures cuz it is through scriptures that is when you know the promises of God and also so says that Christ came to simplify scriptures you remember back um if you read the book of Exodus Leviticus we see that the Israelites had to go through a long process for them to get yeah the sins forgiven yeah their sins to be forgiven the cleansing it was so long but when Christ came the Sal salvation has been really simplified so you have to the key thing is dig scriptures and understand and also just pray pray that you will be there cuz they only say there will be how many disappointments oh there so many there will be so many disappointments in heaven the ones who you thought were not going to be there and they there the ones you thought are there are not there so you really have to keep on praying that God truly sees you worthy to be in his kingdom true thank you for that come Felix um also another thing to keep you going more of you keep introspecting you keep um meditating on God's word claiming God's promises because um without that promise without something to cling on it becomes very very difficult losing hope becomes something that can happen but once we are reading the scripture claiming God's promises day by day um think we can make it and we will make it true um think of Christianity again this is an analogy that Paul gave uh when he was speaking about pressing on towards the Finish Line This Is Something like an athlete what pushes an athlete to to keep running faster than the other people behind them the Finish L PR the Finish Line the prize yes so there's that focus and when your focus is when the end goal is blood when the end goal is covered by something a cloud or some other distractions in life when you lose sight of what you're fighting for what you're hoping in it gets really tough so we need to keep our focus on Jesus who is the final prize for us and and um as cythia said again the Israelites the the sanctuary and all those rituals they did know the Bible says thy way oh Lord is in the sanctuary that's from David in the Book of Psalms and Christ says he is the way to God and the way we get to God is through what is done in the sanctuary in the church in our time our bodies as well we are told we are temples the Holy Spirit and Christ simplified all that you know into just love for God love for man and giving up what we have carrying the cross and following him day by day by focusing on the scripture that is how we keep hope know when you're praying for something you're waiting also pray ask God to help open your eyes so that you can see what is's right in front of you the blessings an example when Prophet elishah when he was in Samaria and he had had his um his servant and one time the armies of I think the Assyrians they had surrounded the whole place okay so the servant gets out in the morning and he sees the armies but the prophet tells him do not worry the armies on our side are more than the armies that are here and he prays to God Open the Eyes of my servant so that he can see it's the same thing to us now this guy I mean um the prophet Prophet Elisha's servant he was praying for deliverance but he did not see the answer right outside so at times we no we always not at times we always need to pray to God that when he answers our prayers he can help us see his answer so as we finish up i' like us to read from the book of 1 John 5:14 i' like Silas to open that first John 5:14 and as he's getting that i' like to read a quote from the father sight it says from the days of Enoch the promises repeated through Patricks and Prophets had kept alive the hope of his appearing the Israelites would have lost hope 2,000 years is a long time man I don't think anyone has lived that long the oldest person on this Earth we know of record is 969 years right so no one has ever got to 2,000 years so it is the hope that is passed on from parents to their children to the children's children that keeps this hope alive so this calls to us as well to pass on this hope to our friends to our family members to our relatives okay Silas 1 John 5:14 1 John 5:4 it says now this is the confidence that we have in him that if we ask anything according to his will he hears us amen that is such an affirming statement that if we ask for anything according to his will in faith he will grant it to us God God is a good father he he gives us what we deserve all right what we ask for God will give to us if it's for our own good as well so I like us to close with that and then I'll ask for just any final comments any questions from us can start with how anything you'd like to say as we finish up okay um just to as we wrap up I want to say that um it is important that as we have mentioned a few times it is important that um we keep meditating on scripture because in this world that we're living in um things do get stuff things do get difficult sometimes we lose hope that happens but daily in introspection of the scripture daily reading daily studying um is what keeps us rooted Keeps Us grounded and so that we can not lose hope on the coming of Christ amen thank you H cythia um I just want to read from the SOP page 699 and it says the many prophecies concerning the savior's Advent led the Hebrews to live in an attitude of constant expectancy many died in the faith not having received the promises but having seen them a far off they believed and confessed that they were strangers and pilgrims on the earth just uh right as we living right now not all of us will see the second coming of Christ some of us will die that's the truth but we need to have the promises and keep them the promises won't be fulfilled right now but having the hope that the promises will be fulfilled later is much better amen thank you for that Emily um I'd like to just say um we should be like the five wise virgins we should always keep our lights burning we should always be prepared we should always pray uh every day read the Bible read the scriptures every day we should also um keep our eyes on the prize and that is the second coming of Christ and yeah we'll have eternal peace and restoration amen thanks for that I'd just like to say that the darkest hour is Before Dawn it seems very dark but if you hold on a little longer it's going to get better amen thank you for that um I'd like to finish off by saying uh that's from uh prophet in Kings that's Chapter 58 it talks about how when the devil um LED Adam and Eve into falling and God created a whole Plan of Salvation through the prophets that plan was revealed to the people the devil actually studied the scriptures to understand who this adversary is coming who how he going to be and he trembled at the thought but the devil did not give up he still tried to make the people forget that there is hope and he's doing that till now and we cannot fight the devil on our own and we wrestle not against flesh and blood but rulers and principalities and powers of darkness and what I'd like to urge us to do is keep our eyes on the prize you know keep our hope in God and focus as our lesson it says on the candle in the dark and the candle in this time is the word of God Psalm 19105 Thy word is a light to my feet and a lamp into my path a lamp un my feet and a light into my path and it is only through holding on to God that we be able to sail through any single moment in our lives so we like to close it at that and thank you so much for sticking with us toward the end of this lesson thank you my pelist as well for um helping us dive into this lesson so as we close I like to ask Felix to pray with us okay let us pray our dear kind and loving father we come before you thanking you for the gift of Life thanking you for helping us to understand what your word is telling us please may you help us to keep reading your word to keep studing your word so that we may always understand that the plans you have are what are best so that you may help us understand that your second coming is near and that we need to maintain our hope and keep our faith alive God please take care of us and guide us for this I Pray believing and trusting amen amen amen amen amen amen

[80.7s] different ideas about how things should
[82.7s] be done he didn't quite understand why
[85.6s] the grown-ups were so excited about God
[88.4s] and he wanted to change the the way they
[90.9s] did activities however he had a big
[93.6s] reason to come to Vacation Bible School
[96.2s] his friends were there and he didn't
[98.1s] want to miss out on the fun Nelson who
[102.0s] was just 9 years old acted mischievously
[104.7s] at the vacation bible school he stole
[107.4s] someone's heart poked the other children
[110.2s] and treated the grown-ups
[112.0s] disrespectfully now helping out at
[114.5s] Vacation Bible School was a friendly
[116.2s] teenager named Isaac Isaac was 16 years
[119.2s] old and had flown to bethl to help the
[122.2s] grown-ups teach the kids about God he
[124.9s] kindly told Nelson that his behavior
[127.0s] wasn't appropriate you can join vacation
[129.6s] bible school and have fun but you need
[131.5s] to behave yourself he said otherwise
[134.1s] we'll have to send you away Nelson
[136.6s] didn't like what he had but he agreed
[139.4s] fine I'll behave he said but he kept
[142.3s] misbehaving finally another grownup
[144.6s] named Logan took him aside Nelson what
[148.0s] you're doing is not appropriate he said
[150.6s] but we will give you one more chance
[152.5s] because we want you to be a part of our
[154.7s] vacation bible school but you must
[157.0s] promise to behave yourself this time
[159.6s] Nelson wouldn't
[161.1s] agree I I don't want to be here he said
[164.8s] angrily I'm leaving he stormed out of
[167.6s] the church and furiously pedal his bike
[170.8s] away everyone thought that Nelson
[173.2s] wouldn't be back but he returned the
[175.2s] next day just as Isaac and Logan were
[177.6s] handing out snacks why are you here here
[180.1s] Nelson Isaac asked being at home was
[183.5s] boring Nelson said I want to be with my
[186.5s] friends can I come back will you promise
[189.6s] to behave and be nice to everyone Logan
[192.2s] asked Nelson thought for a moment okay
[195.9s] but that's boring he said can I do
[198.1s] something else you can go home if you
[200.6s] want Logan replied Nelson didn't want to
[203.6s] go home no I'll stay he said Isaac gave
[207.4s] him a snack of crackers but instead of
[209.4s] eating the crackers himself Nelson
[211.5s] shared them with a girl who didn't have
[213.6s] any Isaac was surprised why did you have
[217.2s] why did you do that he said I want to
[219.9s] show you that I would I want to be here
[222.9s] Nelson replied from that moment Nelson
[225.9s] be began to change he stopped poking the
[229.5s] other children and he treated the
[231.2s] grown-ups respectfully at the end of
[233.6s] vocation Bible School Isaac said goodbye
[236.3s] to the kids by giving them high fives
[238.5s] but Nelson wanted something more he
[240.8s] asked he asked Isaac for a big hug when
[244.6s] Isaac left Nelson rode his bike to the
[247.2s] bethl airport and waved goodbye as he
[249.3s] boarded the
[250.9s] airplane God gave Nelson a new heart and
[253.9s] Isaac hopes that Nelson Always remembers

[551.8s] rightfully said our title is a CLE in
[555.1s] the dark but before we begin well let me
[558.2s] just introduce our panelist starting
[559.8s] from the far right okay my name is H and
[563.1s] I'm happy to be here um my name is
[566.2s] Cynthia and I'm happy to be here hi
[568.9s] everyone my name is
[571.0s] Emily hi everyone my name is Salas and I
[574.9s] am teacher jonan I'll be guiding you
[576.7s] throughout this discussion so I ask I
[579.9s] like to ask Emily to uh pray before we
[582.2s] begin okay let's bow our heads for a
[584.5s] word of prayer Our dearly father we come
[586.7s] before you this day thanking you for the
[588.4s] gift of life we thank you for allowing
[590.5s] us to gather here together in your name
[593.0s] even as we about to study your word let
[595.4s] us give us your uh give us the spirit of
[599.1s] understanding let us be able to
[600.9s] understand whatever we'll read from your
[602.3s] word and be able to apply it in our
[604.4s] lives in Jesus name I pray amen amen
[607.6s] thank you so our theme for this quarter
[611.5s] has been Deliverance which is basically
[614.4s] talking about the Israelites time in
[616.7s] captivity and today's lesson is about
[620.4s] Isaiah one of the prophets and funny
[623.4s] thing is Isaiah lived about 200 years
[627.8s] before the Israelites went to captivity
[629.1s] in Babylon but what is written in his
[632.2s] book was just prophesying basically what
[635.2s] was going to happen to the Israelites if
[637.4s] they fell out of favor with God which
[639.4s] they eventually did and Isaiah is one of
[642.4s] the prophets who spoke a lot about the
[644.6s] coming of Jesus Christ and the Jews had
[647.2s] lived over the years with a certain hope
[650.6s] that something better is coming and this
[653.0s] all started in the Garden of Eden after
[656.0s] Adam and Eve ate the fruit and fell into
[658.1s] sin one of the things God said after he
[660.9s] had given the punishments was the
[663.1s] serpent will bite the hill but you will
[665.8s] crush its head right an offspring will
[668.2s] come out of Eve and crush the head of
[669.8s] the serpent that was the thing that the
[671.7s] Israelites were always looking forward
[673.3s] for and that is a coming Messiah but
[675.8s] before we get to our
[677.4s] lesson we have an one of the Adventist
[681.4s] beliefs that ties up to a lesson that is
[683.9s] the holy scriptures that is belief
[685.6s] number one and that is what we base all
[688.4s] that believe
[689.8s] in as Adventist from so we like just to
[692.6s] move to the what do you think section to
[694.9s] start us off with our lesson for today
[697.6s] I'd like to ask H Felix to take us
[699.2s] through that H okay um in the what do
[702.2s] you think action um there a question
[705.5s] here they're asking when things are
[707.2s] really going bad for me I usually so we
[711.2s] do have the choices that one is talk to
[714.9s] someone one is pray and there other
[716.4s] choices but what I chose was that
[719.9s] first of all most what I usually do is I
[722.5s] try to avoid um dealing with the
[725.4s] situation because like if something is
[727.6s] car if something is frustrating you try
[730.4s] to tend to run away from it to avoid
[733.1s] confronting it all right so um I can ask
[736.1s] any other person who has an answer to
[737.8s] the question to chip in yeah I can get a
[741.6s] Cynthia's view when things are really
[743.8s] going bad for you what do you usually
[745.8s] do I cry
[749.7s] um I cry and then I talk to someone and
[754.2s] then I'll pray after but the first step
[757.4s] I I'll cry for real yeah like
[760.5s] tears it's actually a normal human
[762.6s] reaction know when things are bad you
[764.8s] you'll just result back to the the
[767.5s] normal you you cry or you some people
[770.4s] get angry you know silus what do you do
[773.6s] when you things are going really bad for
[775.2s] you I work out you walk out yes you just
[778.3s] like forget all the pain so basically
[779.9s] just a
[780.8s] distraction not really it's enjoy the
[783.4s] pain yeah because uh when you work out
[786.4s] it releases the happy hormon so yes when
[790.1s] you it's also called the Feelgood
[792.5s] hormone but I prefer to say the happy
[794.6s] hormone yeah so when I work out yeah and
[798.4s] then I forget
[800.5s] about it or I deal with it after I've
[804.0s] worked out so yeah at that time I'll be
[806.8s] maybe if someone had wronged me I just
[809.6s] deal with
[810.7s] them happily yeah like they didn't wrong
[814.2s] me which might get them upset but it'll
[817.2s] do me good because I wouldn't uh be as
[819.6s] angry as yes all right so probably how
[822.1s] you can read for us there there's a
[823.7s] verse on the punch lines uh you can just
[826.0s] open your Bibles Galatians 4:4 and 5 and
[829.3s] just read that verse okay Galatians 4:4
[833.5s] and5 but when the set time had fully
[836.2s] come God sent his son born of a woman
[839.1s] born under the law to redeem those under
[841.6s] the law that we might receive adoption
[843.8s] to sunship thank you for that so
[846.6s] basically what this says is um God had
[850.3s] ordained the time you know and uh our
[853.6s] fundamental belief number one I can just
[855.8s] read what it
[858.4s] says get that fundamental belief number
[861.5s] one that is the holy Scriptures it says
[865.6s] that in his word God has committed to
[868.7s] Human the knowledge necessary for
[871.1s] salvation the holy scriptures are the
[873.2s] Supreme authoritative and the infallible
[875.7s] revelation of his will they are the
[877.9s] standard of character the test of
[880.0s] experience the definitive revealer of
[882.7s] doctrines and the trustworthy record of
[885.5s] God's acts in history so when things are
[888.9s] dark in our lives what the Bible
[890.5s] basically is trying to say is that God
[892.8s] has planned your future right Jeremiah
[895.3s] 29:11 for I know the plans I have for
[897.6s] you plans for good not for for evil so
[900.1s] what we can learn from this what this
[901.7s] Quest is trying to prompt from us is
[903.8s] that even when times are really dark in
[905.7s] our lives sh you should just trust that
[907.9s] God has the best plans for us in Future
[910.7s] No matter how dark it seems as our title
[913.0s] says a candle in the dark and God is the
[916.1s] candle through the word amen okay so
[918.9s] we'll now go to our story that's into
[921.4s] the story if you have the lesson you can
[922.8s] just turn your lessons into the story
[925.9s] section and uh for those who don't have
[928.1s] it our story comes from Isaiah 11: 1-9
[932.8s] and Isaiah 40:
[936.0s] 28-31 I'd like to ask Emily to take us
[938.4s] through
[939.4s] that okay thank you for the summary for
[942.1s] the brief
[943.2s] synopsis um so I'll just give a summary
[947.6s] of what's Happening into the story and
[950.8s] the passage that is there it just Isaiah
[955.4s] paints a very powerful picture of Hope
[958.7s] and restoration Even in our darkest
[961.6s] times darkest of times because as it has
[965.1s] been told um the Israelites were at
[967.8s] their time of Exile in Babylon and he
[971.3s] was just giving them an encouragement
[974.3s] that God is there no matter what they
[976.9s] should always um have hope and trust in
[980.9s] him that he will restore them and he
[984.0s] will be able to free them from their
[986.4s] Exile um Isaiah speaks to the people
[989.0s] people of Judah during their time of
[991.4s] Despair just giving them
[994.1s] um a vision of our future where God's
[998.6s] justice and peace
[1001.8s] Reigns um we also see
[1005.5s] that even us during our we also face our
[1010.2s] Exiles not like the the Israelites but
[1014.0s] we also have our Exiles in life and uh
[1019.3s] the passage basically gives us
[1021.5s] encouragement that even when we feeling
[1024.0s] very
[1025.3s] unbearable the promise in Isa Isaiah
[1028.9s] encourages us to imagine a time when
[1031.7s] peace and righteousness will
[1035.0s] prevail um oh can all right thank you
[1038.5s] for that um so there's a brief
[1040.3s] illustration I'd like to give thank you
[1041.5s] em for the summary before we just answer
[1043.3s] a few questions from out of the story
[1045.0s] section um there was there was a very
[1047.2s] big go that happened while back probably
[1050.0s] when most of your grandparents were
[1051.2s] still teenagers right that's the Vietnam
[1053.9s] War and uh there was a general an
[1056.5s] American General who was captured in by
[1058.8s] the Vietnamese and his name was Robie
[1061.2s] rner now this guy was held as a prisoner
[1064.2s] and a very terrible conditions for 7
[1067.0s] years right so for 7 years he was in a
[1069.4s] Cell alone and the only thing that he
[1072.5s] saw there was a small hole in the ground
[1075.4s] on his cell now the Vietnamese cells
[1078.0s] they usually they were elevated so there
[1080.0s] were a bit of some poles just poking out
[1081.9s] and now the cell was on top so there bit
[1084.0s] there was a bit of air flow underneath
[1085.6s] cuz it's a very hot area so on his cell
[1089.4s] flow there was a hole so one time he
[1091.7s] just decided to just dig through the
[1093.6s] wood and get underneath see what is
[1096.1s] inside there you know just what's
[1097.3s] underneath so he can escape but he was
[1100.6s] disappointed because underneath the wood
[1102.4s] and flow boards was a concrete
[1105.3s] floow now the concrete floor I think
[1107.9s] this was just made to break him the
[1110.3s] concrete flooor had a single hole now
[1113.3s] through that single hole the only thing
[1114.4s] you could see outside was a blade of
[1115.9s] grass just some grass underneath his
[1117.7s] cell so for 7 years every single day
[1120.9s] he'd wake up and just look through the
[1123.0s] floorboards and that's what gave him
[1124.5s] hope that I am not alone there is still
[1127.2s] some something outside there's there's
[1129.8s] hope that one day leave this place all
[1132.1s] right and it is the same thing with us
[1135.3s] when we are in tough times when when we
[1138.5s] in really dark moments we hold on to
[1140.9s] something good A Memory of times when
[1144.1s] when times were good when you fail your
[1145.8s] exams you're like I have failed but
[1147.7s] there were days I used to get 100% there
[1149.4s] were days I used to get a it's a human
[1151.7s] nature to look for the smallest sliver
[1154.0s] of hope that we can get for the
[1155.9s] Christian Life that is a Bible verse an
[1160.0s] encouragement a friend just comes and
[1162.2s] tells you Silas it's going to be okay
[1166.5s] that single thing and our lesson today
[1169.6s] now points us that Christ can be that
[1173.0s] blade of grass like that prison I was
[1174.9s] saying Christ is that single light
[1178.0s] shining through a darkest Mo all right
[1180.2s] so we can answer a few questions from
[1181.5s] the out of the story section em okay um
[1185.2s] I'll start with this question uh
[1187.3s] question number four what kind of
[1189.8s] Messiah or deliverer is Promised in this
[1193.4s] passages and what will he do for God's
[1197.4s] people
[1199.6s] um Felix uh I'd like to hear your points
[1204.8s] or your view yeah okay so um what Isa is
[1209.1s] talking about here is the coming of
[1211.3s] Jesus Christ um for the first time in
[1215.0s] the Book of Matthew when Jesus was born
[1218.0s] of a virgin and he came basically to
[1221.0s] relieve us from the the problem of sin
[1223.6s] so the kind of Messiah that is been
[1226.0s] talked about is Jesus Christ who came to
[1229.3s] Deliver Us from the sin problem
[1232.2s] yeah okay
[1234.4s] um
[1237.1s] cythia um I really don't want to add so
[1240.4s] much cuz as the
[1243.1s] story I know theop time will reach
[1247.4s] but um in the sop it says that the the
[1252.4s] title is the coming of the deliverer so
[1256.0s] Jesus is coming to Deliver Us from
[1257.9s] bondage from so many problems of this
[1261.3s] world so he came and he conquered so
[1264.4s] that we have hope yeah um I'll also add
[1269.4s] one last Point um he comes as a Shepherd
[1273.1s] um because he cares for the people as
[1276.6s] said in Isaiah 40 verse Isaiah
[1281.6s] 40:1 um on to the next question how are
[1285.2s] these prophecies relevant to us today
[1288.0s] what hope do they offer for people in
[1292.5s] 2024 um Ronan okay
[1296.1s] uh the Bible the Bible is as much as it
[1299.6s] was written over 2,000 years ago every
[1302.7s] single word that it says is relevant to
[1304.5s] us today and uh Paul says in 2 Timothy
[1308.5s] 3:16 all scripture is profitable for
[1311.2s] teaching for reproof for correction and
[1313.4s] for guiding into righteousness so the
[1315.9s] words of the scriptures of these
[1317.8s] prophecies
[1319.8s] um let me call it a a double onra like a
[1322.9s] double edged sword right Isaiah was
[1325.2s] talking about the coming of Christ the
[1327.1s] first time when he came to Earth to
[1328.9s] Deliver us from sin all right so he died
[1331.0s] for the on the cross for us but Christ
[1333.3s] also coming the second time to still
[1335.6s] Deliver Us from this world of sin again
[1338.1s] so it gives us hope we are in a time
[1342.2s] where things are changing so fast right
[1346.4s] sometimes you can even just keep up with
[1347.6s] what's happening and there is so much um
[1350.8s] immorality and erosion of morals and
[1353.8s] many people forgetting about God so
[1356.8s] Isaiah's Isaiah's prophecies actually
[1359.0s] just tell us that hope is coming there
[1361.3s] is still hope there there's that light
[1363.4s] in the dark for us even the coming year
[1365.3s] which is just a few weeks
[1367.5s] away also it gives us Eternal hope
[1370.9s] knowing that it will rain with God
[1373.6s] forever um and there'll be Eternal peace
[1378.0s] and just this after all this all right
[1382.1s] thank you for that so uh we would like
[1384.7s] to read our key text that is from Isaiah
[1388.2s] 40:31 I'd like to ask Silas to read that
[1392.0s] for us that's Isaiah 40:31 can open your
[1395.1s] Bibles okay Isaiah 40:31 says but those
[1398.9s] who wait on the Lord shall renew their
[1401.4s] strength they shall Mount up there with
[1403.8s] wings like eagles they shall run and not
[1406.7s] be weary they shall walk and not faint
[1409.7s] mhm thank you for that that's it's a
[1412.2s] very popular verse especially for guys
[1414.4s] doing exams you know always read through
[1416.7s] Isaiah 4031 says you know but it's
[1420.6s] really important to us um the idea of
[1423.5s] hope uh what our lesson says the idea of
[1426.1s] Hope is closely connected to the idea of
[1429.4s] waiting cuz if we always got what we
[1431.8s] wanted right away like what what uses it
[1434.8s] for us to wait we'd never know what hope
[1437.6s] is if every time you'd order food and
[1440.0s] it's there within like a minute or so
[1442.6s] we'd never know what hope is right so
[1445.6s] God cultivates in us hope by making us
[1448.9s] wait okay hope is what we do when things
[1452.4s] aren't going our way when our prayers
[1454.9s] aren't answered right away hope is what
[1457.7s] carries us through the dark hours while
[1460.2s] we wait for an answer to prayer all
[1462.8s] right so I'd like just to ask this just
[1464.6s] a question just think about and our
[1466.4s] viewers as well what are you waiting
[1469.8s] for what are your hope what are you
[1472.0s] hoping for what is that thing you have
[1474.2s] been praying for so long but you still
[1477.1s] have hope God going to do it for you so
[1479.6s] just take heart in knowing that God
[1483.0s] promises that um if you wait upon him as
[1487.8s] ver says you'll Mount up um like
[1491.5s] strength like eagles you know and he
[1493.9s] promises you what you want if you wait
[1497.4s] upon him in his time okay so I like us
[1501.2s] to read uh the flashlight like Cynthia
[1505.1s] to take us through that and just give us
[1507.3s] what Insight uh Ellen White says on that
[1510.5s] the
[1511.9s] flashlight okay so the flashlight is
[1516.2s] from prophets and Kings page 700 and it
[1521.4s] says Century after Century passed away
[1524.8s] finally the voices of the prophets
[1526.8s] seized the hand of of the oppressor was
[1529.4s] Heavy upon Israel as the Jews departed
[1532.2s] from God faith grew dim and hope well
[1535.5s] night ceased to illuminate the future
[1538.1s] the words of the prophets were
[1539.6s] uncomprehended by many but in Heavens
[1542.5s] canel the power of the coming of Christ
[1545.4s] had been determined and when the
[1547.2s] fullness of the time was come God sent
[1550.2s] forth his son Galatians
[1553.6s] 44 so to the
[1556.8s] SOP this so many so much to
[1560.2s] highlight but I'll just uh highlight a
[1565.0s] few so there's a part that says fa Faith
[1569.1s] grew deep and hope well night ceased to
[1572.3s] illuminate the future uh at some
[1575.6s] point cuz
[1577.8s] the Isaiah had prophesized that Christ
[1580.9s] was going to come 2,000 years before so
[1584.5s] it was during this time just imagine
[1587.0s] you're like the Jews cuz we all know
[1589.2s] that till dat some Jews have not
[1591.2s] accepted that Christ has come so they
[1594.2s] had waited for 2,000 years and so many
[1596.6s] years for the coming of Christ and then
[1599.3s] Christ comes and they start questioning
[1603.1s] him and asking questions eh are you
[1605.8s] Christ and then you know Christ used to
[1609.5s] refer back to scripture and he used the
[1612.4s] pist he referred back to Zechariah he
[1615.9s] referred back to so many scriptures to
[1617.5s] say that I am the Messiah who has come
[1621.6s] and uh the point I want to bring out
[1624.3s] Bring Out is the part that says faith
[1626.7s] grew deep and hope welln night cease to
[1629.6s] illuminate the
[1631.9s] future now to our lives right now
[1635.9s] we since
[1638.2s] the since
[1640.4s] 1844 after the great disappointment we
[1644.3s] have started hearing about the second
[1646.7s] coming of Christ we are in the
[1651.0s] year
[1653.0s] 2024 yeah I forgot for a minute we in
[1656.0s] the year 2024 and he has not yet come
[1659.8s] yeah and in this waiting time you can
[1663.8s] get tired and you can feel is he really
[1667.1s] coming back happening but we have
[1669.3s] prophecies we have so many prophecies
[1671.8s] Daniel has wrote Revelation John wrote
[1674.4s] in Revelation so many prophecies that
[1676.6s] are pointing out to the of Christ so in
[1680.7s] this waiting time that is when there
[1682.7s] will be that
[1684.1s] shaing
[1685.7s] seeve Waits and the tears yeah wait and
[1688.4s] the tears yeah it is during this waiting
[1690.3s] time that we will know who is truly
[1692.4s] waiting for real and who is kidding to
[1697.1s] say so uh I I have a question actually
[1702.4s] mhm so it's in the Tuesday part
[1709.5s] the question
[1710.9s] says do you think today we are living in
[1714.0s] the time when faith has grown de and
[1717.0s] hope no longer seems to illuminate the
[1719.4s] future if so what can this passage say
[1722.4s] to
[1723.8s] us and
[1726.7s] maybe yeah um yeah Felix looks like he
[1729.6s] has something to say okay so um from Sy
[1732.9s] question um what the encouragement we
[1735.5s] get from what we are reading um in this
[1738.1s] story is that there is a reason God is
[1741.3s] still coming we may face challenges
[1743.9s] through life cuz it can't be just a
[1746.4s] straight path God tells us that
[1748.6s] throughout the time we're waiting for
[1750.5s] his coming there going to be challenges
[1752.4s] they going to be problems but what we
[1754.6s] should learn to do is to learn to
[1756.1s] persevere to learn to understand that
[1758.4s] for Jesus to come this challenges are
[1760.4s] part of it true it's it's like before
[1763.2s] before it it's like it has to happen
[1767.0s] before Christ finally comes yeah true
[1769.6s] and actually um Christ said that in John
[1771.9s] 14 John 16:3 vers 33 33 yes thank you
[1776.4s] for that it says uh in this world you'll
[1778.3s] have trouble but he adds but take heart
[1781.9s] forever overcome the world Amen um this
[1785.6s] there's something also that was
[1786.9s] mentioned in one of U the book
[1788.6s] recordings we do on the book uh when God
[1790.6s] said remember something about pressing
[1793.0s] on towards the
[1794.4s] mark and in this life being a Christian
[1798.2s] is is not easy let's be honest you know
[1801.4s] you're missing out on so many things
[1803.2s] like you know right now you could be
[1805.0s] missing out on your friends hanging out
[1806.5s] somewhere but you here helping other
[1808.6s] people understand the word of God and
[1810.6s] Christ did not promise an easy Journey
[1812.9s] if Christianity was easy then everyone
[1814.4s] will be a Christian you know but it's
[1817.8s] not and the trials make us better
[1821.3s] Christians think of Christianity and the
[1824.2s] troubles that we Face through as a
[1826.4s] refining process you're being um it's
[1829.6s] like when a carpenter is trying to make
[1831.6s] wood smooth what does he use just
[1833.8s] sandpaper something that's really rough
[1836.0s] so he rubs across it to make it smooth
[1837.9s] to make it fine that is what God does
[1840.1s] with our lives and it is a dark time you
[1843.8s] know but we just have that hope Christ
[1846.7s] Christ is on our side we need not worry
[1848.6s] about anything yeah and just to sum
[1852.7s] up
[1855.1s] um Mrs White says that it was during
[1858.4s] that time when the faith had grewed de
[1861.8s] that is when God's divine plan fell into
[1864.5s] place so just when you're almost losing
[1867.9s] hope that is
[1871.6s] when that is when Christ is coming that
[1873.7s] is when you see the clouds when you when
[1876.2s] you're saying I don't think I want to be
[1878.4s] a Christian anymore and that's when the
[1880.9s] clouds start unfolding you see not don't
[1884.8s] take it literally but the fact that when
[1888.7s] it seems like the world is becoming
[1891.5s] terrible we are moving closer to the
[1894.2s] second coming of Christ amen true thank
[1896.5s] you for that it's always is darkest
[1898.7s] before Dawn yeah that's what people say
[1901.4s] all right so I'd like us to read um one
[1904.0s] of the verses it should be on our punch
[1907.5s] lines that's uh Isaiah 9:6 Isaiah 9:6
[1911.9s] I'd like to ask Emily to read
[1914.5s] that verse 6 and 7 the second punch line
[1919.4s] for to us a child is born to us a son is
[1923.1s] given and to the government will be on
[1926.3s] his shoulders and he will be called
[1928.4s] wonderful counselor Mighty God
[1930.6s] Everlasting father Prince of Peace of
[1933.5s] the greatness of his government and
[1936.4s] peace there will be no end he will reign
[1939.2s] on David's throne and over his kingdom
[1942.2s] establishing and upholding it with
[1944.3s] Justice and righteousness from that time
[1947.2s] on and forever the Zeal of the Lord
[1950.0s] Almighty will accomplish this amen thank
[1953.7s] you for that um this it's actually a
[1956.2s] very appropriate verse around this time
[1958.4s] is when many people tend to think about
[1960.2s] the birth of Jesus so it's it's really
[1962.1s] erroneous to think about Jesus coming
[1964.4s] every single day um but this verse is
[1968.6s] the hope that Jews have been holding on
[1971.1s] to and now Christians are holding on to
[1973.1s] as well Christ coming on this Earth
[1975.8s] there has never been a better gift to
[1977.7s] the the world and it is funny as cindia
[1981.3s] has
[1982.3s] said this are the people the Jews were
[1984.6s] waiting for Jesus for over 2,000 years
[1988.0s] and when he's right in their midst they
[1989.6s] cannot recognize him so do you think at
[1993.4s] times in our lives when we we pray for
[1995.7s] things when we ask for things and they
[1997.4s] actually come and it's an answer from
[1999.4s] God do you think there are times we fail
[2001.6s] to see that this is the this is the
[2003.5s] thing I've been praying
[2005.6s] for yeah it's very possible so what you
[2008.7s] guys think we do about it what do you
[2010.7s] think we can um do as waiting for our
[2014.4s] prayers to be
[2018.2s] answered um what we can do so that wait
[2022.2s] let me see if I've gotten what you're
[2023.4s] saying right that what can we do so that
[2026.7s] we can not so that we don't forget lose
[2030.4s] hope forget as we waiting you see when
[2032.4s] you've prayed for something when you're
[2033.7s] hoping right as the Israelites did uhhuh
[2036.3s] um as you're hoping what can you do as
[2038.5s] you prepare for God's answer to your
[2040.7s] prayers okay yeah got it right as you're
[2043.8s] waiting you have to read the scriptures
[2047.3s] you have to literally keep
[2053.1s] on you have dig deep you really have to
[2057.3s] dig deep into the scriptures cuz it is
[2059.2s] through scriptures that is when you know
[2061.4s] the promises of God and also so says
[2065.1s] that Christ came to simplify scriptures
[2068.0s] you remember back um if you read the
[2071.4s] book of Exodus Leviticus we see that the
[2074.0s] Israelites had to go through a long
[2076.3s] process for them to get yeah the sins
[2079.6s] forgiven yeah their sins to be forgiven
[2081.5s] the cleansing it was so long but when
[2083.5s] Christ
[2084.8s] came the Sal salvation has been really
[2087.8s] simplified so you have to the key thing
[2091.0s] is dig scriptures and understand and
[2094.2s] also just pray pray that you will be
[2097.0s] there cuz they only say there will be
[2099.7s] how many disappointments oh there so
[2101.6s] many there will be so many
[2102.7s] disappointments in heaven the ones who
[2105.4s] you thought were not going to be there
[2107.1s] and they there the ones you thought are
[2109.6s] there are not there so you really have
[2111.6s] to keep on praying that God truly sees
[2114.5s] you worthy to be in his kingdom true
[2118.4s] thank you for that come Felix um also
[2121.0s] another thing to keep you going more of
[2125.0s] you keep introspecting you keep um
[2127.9s] meditating on God's word claiming God's
[2130.0s] promises because um without that promise
[2133.7s] without something to cling on it becomes
[2136.0s] very very difficult losing hope becomes
[2139.2s] something that can happen but once we
[2140.9s] are reading the scripture claiming God's
[2142.8s] promises day by day um think we can make
[2145.8s] it and we will make it true um think of
[2149.7s] Christianity again this is an analogy
[2151.4s] that Paul gave uh when he was speaking
[2153.5s] about pressing on towards the Finish
[2155.3s] Line This Is Something like an athlete
[2159.4s] what pushes an athlete to to keep
[2161.5s] running faster than the other people
[2163.0s] behind them the Finish L PR the Finish
[2164.8s] Line the prize yes so there's that focus
[2167.8s] and when your focus is when the end goal
[2171.0s] is blood when the end goal is covered by
[2173.2s] something a cloud or some other
[2175.3s] distractions in life when you lose sight
[2178.2s] of what you're fighting for what you're
[2180.0s] hoping in it gets really tough so we
[2183.0s] need to keep our focus on Jesus who is
[2185.6s] the final prize for us and and um as
[2189.2s] cythia said again the Israelites the the
[2193.5s] sanctuary and all those rituals they did
[2195.8s] know the Bible says thy way oh Lord is
[2198.1s] in the sanctuary that's from David in
[2200.2s] the Book of Psalms and Christ says he is
[2204.3s] the way to God and the way we get to God
[2207.8s] is through what is done in the sanctuary
[2210.2s] in the church in our time our bodies as
[2212.5s] well we are told we are temples the Holy
[2215.9s] Spirit and Christ simplified all that
[2219.8s] you know into just love for God love for
[2222.2s] man and giving up what we have carrying
[2225.6s] the cross and following him day by day
[2227.9s] by focusing on the scripture that is how
[2230.2s] we keep hope know when you're praying
[2232.8s] for something you're
[2234.1s] waiting also pray ask God to help open
[2238.1s] your eyes so that you can see what is's
[2240.0s] right in front of you the blessings an
[2242.8s] example when Prophet elishah when he was
[2245.8s] in Samaria and he had had his um his
[2248.7s] servant and one time the armies of I
[2252.2s] think the Assyrians they had surrounded
[2254.6s] the whole place okay so the servant gets
[2257.4s] out in the morning and he sees the
[2260.1s] armies but the prophet tells him do not
[2263.6s] worry the armies on our side are more
[2265.3s] than the armies that are here and he
[2267.6s] prays to God Open the Eyes of my servant
[2269.9s] so that he can see it's the same thing
[2271.8s] to us now this guy I mean um the prophet
[2276.0s] Prophet Elisha's servant
[2278.3s] he was praying for deliverance but he
[2280.7s] did not see the answer right outside so
[2283.4s] at times we no we always not at times we
[2286.1s] always need to pray to God that when he
[2288.2s] answers our prayers he can help us see
[2291.5s] his answer so as we finish up i' like us
[2295.2s] to read from the book of 1 John 5:14 i'
[2298.4s] like Silas to open that first John
[2303.6s] 5:14 and as he's getting that i' like to
[2306.4s] read a quote from the father sight it
[2309.1s] says from the days of Enoch the promises
[2312.1s] repeated through Patricks and Prophets
[2314.4s] had kept alive the hope of his appearing
[2318.0s] the Israelites would have lost hope
[2320.2s] 2,000 years is a long time man I don't
[2322.5s] think anyone has lived that long the
[2324.2s] oldest person on this Earth we know of
[2325.9s] record is 969 years right so no one has
[2328.6s] ever got to 2,000 years so it is the
[2331.2s] hope that is passed on from parents to
[2334.2s] their children to the children's
[2335.5s] children that keeps this hope alive
[2338.2s] so this calls to us as well to pass on
[2341.8s] this hope to our friends to our family
[2343.9s] members to our
[2345.6s] relatives okay Silas 1 John
[2350.8s] 5:14 1 John 5:4 it says now this is the
[2355.6s] confidence that we have in him that if
[2358.2s] we ask anything according to his will he
[2361.8s] hears us
[2364.0s] amen that is such an affirming statement
[2368.6s] that if we ask for anything according to
[2371.1s] his will in faith he will grant it to us
[2375.1s] God God is a good father he he gives us
[2379.3s] what we deserve all right what we ask
[2382.1s] for God will give to us if it's for our
[2384.4s] own good as well so I like us to close
[2387.0s] with that and then I'll ask for just any
[2389.4s] final comments any questions from us can
[2392.0s] start with how anything you'd like to
[2393.4s] say as we finish up okay um just to as
[2396.9s] we wrap up I want to say that um it is
[2401.6s] important that as we have mentioned a
[2404.6s] few times it is important that um we
[2407.8s] keep meditating on scripture because in
[2410.7s] this world that we're living in um
[2412.6s] things do get stuff things do get
[2415.1s] difficult sometimes we lose hope that
[2417.8s] happens but daily in introspection of
[2421.0s] the scripture daily reading daily
[2423.3s] studying um is what keeps us rooted
[2425.8s] Keeps Us grounded and so that we can not
[2429.0s] lose hope on the coming of Christ amen
[2431.9s] thank you H
[2433.4s] cythia um I just want to read from the
[2437.0s] SOP page
[2439.7s] 699 and it says the many prophecies
[2443.1s] concerning the savior's Advent led the
[2446.0s] Hebrews to live in an attitude of
[2448.6s] constant expectancy many died in the
[2452.1s] faith not having received the promises
[2455.0s] but having seen them a far off they
[2457.4s] believed and confessed that they were
[2459.6s] strangers and pilgrims on the earth just
[2463.0s] uh right as we living right now not all
[2465.7s] of us will see the second coming of
[2468.0s] Christ some of us will die that's the
[2470.8s] truth but we need to have the promises
[2473.9s] and keep them the promises won't be
[2476.6s] fulfilled right now but having the hope
[2479.6s] that the promises will be fulfilled
[2481.6s] later is much better amen thank you for
[2485.3s] that Emily um
[2488.0s] I'd like to just say um we should be
[2490.6s] like the five wise virgins we should
[2493.8s] always keep our lights burning we should
[2496.9s] always be prepared we should always pray
[2500.5s] uh every day read the Bible read the
[2503.7s] scriptures every day we should also um
[2507.2s] keep our eyes on the prize and that is
[2509.6s] the second coming of Christ and yeah
[2513.0s] we'll have eternal peace and restoration
[2516.0s] amen thanks for that
[2518.6s] I'd just like to say that the darkest
[2520.8s] hour is Before Dawn it seems very dark
[2524.7s] but if you hold on a little longer it's
[2527.3s] going to get better amen thank you for
[2529.6s] that um I'd like to finish off by saying
[2532.1s] uh that's from uh prophet in Kings
[2534.7s] that's Chapter 58 it talks about how
[2537.9s] when the devil um LED Adam and Eve into
[2541.5s] falling and God created a whole Plan of
[2544.0s] Salvation through the prophets that plan
[2546.7s] was revealed to the people the devil
[2549.2s] actually studied the scriptures to
[2551.7s] understand who this adversary is coming
[2553.5s] who how he going to be and he trembled
[2555.7s] at the thought but the devil did not
[2558.1s] give up he still tried to make the
[2561.6s] people forget that there is hope and
[2564.2s] he's doing that till now and we cannot
[2567.6s] fight the devil on our own and we
[2569.2s] wrestle not against flesh and blood but
[2571.5s] rulers and principalities and powers of
[2573.6s] darkness and what I'd like to urge us to
[2576.2s] do is
[2578.0s] keep our eyes on the prize you know keep
[2580.6s] our hope in God and focus as our lesson
[2584.3s] it says on the candle in the dark and
[2586.9s] the candle in this time is the word of
[2589.6s] God Psalm 19105 Thy word is a light to
