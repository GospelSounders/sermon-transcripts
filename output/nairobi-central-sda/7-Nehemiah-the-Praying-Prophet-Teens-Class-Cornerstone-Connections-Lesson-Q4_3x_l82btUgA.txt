is Kingston going to summer camp was a big adventure for Kingston Kingston is an Alaskan native boy who lives in the Alaskan Village of toak when he went to Camp Polaris he first climbed into an airplane and flew about 30 minutes to the city of Dillingham then he sat in a car and rode another 30 minutes to Lake Al aleknagik there he boarded a motorboat and traveled 15 more minutes to the summer camp located at the base of jack knife Mountain it wasn't lovely tring to Camp Polaris about 10 kids from toak went to camp at the same time Kingston and the other children didn't really know much about God they went because they were invited by a friendly Seventh Day Adventist woman Kingston had a lot about God at the camp every morning the boys and girls had free time before breakfast to read the Bible and pray the children took turns thanking God for the food at at breakfast lunch and supper every morning and evening the children heard stories about God at worship ship in the Camp's main Lodge then before bed the camp counselors spoke about God at another Worship in the camp cabins Kingston listened to what the grown-ups said about God he listened to what the other children said about God he didn't say much he just took it all in each day at Camp the children divided into groups and took part in fun activities one day Kingston was with a group of kids learning about Wilderness survival Alaska is a huge place with a lot of wilderness so it was important to know how to survive Kingston listened to a staff member Mr Sam who showed how to build an outdoor fire the children watched and helped but Kingston was a little bored he had learned how to build an outdoor fire a long time ago when he was 6 years old Mr Sam didn't cook any food on the on his fire but as the fire crackled and burned Kingston remembered that his family roasted hamburgers hot dogs and wild meat over the fire at the moment he saw a brown ground squirrel ground squirrels look like other squirrels except they live in holes underground rather than in trees now Kingston spotted a ground squirrel running from the one hole to another someone else saw the squirrel and exclaimed oh look how cute kingstone looked surprised slowly he shook his head no not cute he said very seriously delicious but no one was going to eat ground squirrel for lunch at Camp if que if King was disappointed he didn't show it he joined the other children in hly eating baked potatoes brown beans macaroni and cheese and garlic bread afterward he quickly did his chores and then had a few minutes to relax on the Shore picking up a flat stone he skipped it across the water 1 2 3 4 five bounces then plankk the stone disappeared into the water other kids saw kingstone skipping stones and came over to try as well 1 two plunk no one could get more skips than Kingston Kingston managed to throw a few more Stones before the children were called to the next Camp activity it was time to swim yay some of the children cheered Kingston didn't say anything he just took it all in Camp Polaris only lasted a week and all so soon Kingston went home he had a lot to think about maybe he would give his heart to God pray for all the children who go to Camp Polaris that they may decide to give their hearts to God part of the a previous 13th Sabbath offering helped improve campis you can help children in Alaska by giving to this quarter's 13th Sabbath offering on December 28th can I even I be [Music] sa when I look back at my records and I think of all my sin can I even I be saved oh Lord my sins are always before my

back at my record and I think of all my S how can I be Saed we are here to look at Cornerstone connection study lesson uh which is lesson number seven which is titled nemiah the praying prophet with me here is on my right Brenda Maya on my left Winston ay and on my extreme left thank you uh the praying Prophet so what do you guys uh expect to learn from from this from this lesson what do you think it's going to be about just look at the title nemiah The praying prophet I think it um what we learn from this lesson specifically is I think something to do with prayer CU it emphasizes a lot on nemiah being a Praying Prophet so most likely prayer yeah exactly exactly so uh let's dive in into the key key text um which is from nemiah 1:1 so the key text says the god of Heaven himself will prosper us therefore we his servants will arise and build all right thanks thanks um let's move on to the what do you think section uh this is a is an either or uh type of question so the experience of praying is more meaningful to me when I pray individually or with others what do you think are the kinds of things we ought to pray for individually in contrast to the things we should pray for uh oper what do you guys think okay beginning with me from what I think um the question says that what do you think are the key kinds of things we ought to pray for individually in contrast to the things we should pray for cooperatively so so from my understanding I think you know there's some things or some issues that are usually private that sometimes we ought not to share in the public and I feel like um first of all what i' like to say is that I think this is an advantage of prayer cuz you know in prayer we get to tell God some things that are troubling us the things that we cannot share with other people but through prayer we can get to tell God anything that is in our hearts and so um answering on the question the kinds of things that we can can we ought to pray for individually in contrast to what we we should pray for cooperatively so what we can pray for um in when we individually I think one of them is the things that are maybe troubling us that are private something like that private yeah okay uh well I do agree with you there are things that uh trouble us inividual on an individual level and uh well it's not you might have one or two people who are close to you uh who you might add on to the group that you want to uh start for that specific uh issue for prayer but I do agree that there are some things that you need to um you know go on your knees on your own and and you know sort it out with Jesus yeah so anyone has anything else to add on that before we move on um regarding what Fon was telling us earlier about uh private things that should be you know kept private uh I wanted to put emphasis on it and um talk about how we have silent prayers like in a group of people you're doing prayer together and you'd be like I have a silent prayer request such things are not what I think um we can consider Things To Pray by ourselves but just because we're praying by ourselves doesn't mean we can't ask other people to pray pray with us like for support on whatever it is we're praying for so some of those things it could be let's say um private family issues that you don't want to disclose or um personal issues within you let's say if you're having a problem with a certain uh Temptation some things you you are too shamed to say out loud I think that's what we can consider um individual for this and for praying corporately or just with other people together I think for guidance like if in a setting of um a church we can be praying for God to guide us as a church or to bring more people to the church that's something you'd pray in a large group for yeah okay yeah that's uh I think that's straightforward and I I think that's for majority of us I think um especially when it comes to corporate kind of prayer or congregational kind of prayer those are things that you know cuts across problems that probably cuts across or probably it's something you're praying for as a congregation and it really helps actually to to involve our whole congregation to pray about it and I think we learn also look at how uh nemiah prayed about the situation he was going through so I think we can dive into the story um so I'll be I'll be doing a summary for basically what our story was from for if you're interested to go read it on your own this the story is from nemiah chapter 1 1 to1 and basically uh it starts with uh talking about the time of the year in which this takes place in which is the month of KV in the 20th year and nemiah was was situated in Citadel of Susan and one of his one of his brothers came from Judah with some other men and he he inquired on how uh Judah was and the Exiles that went back the ones that survived and they told him that uh those who had survived were in great trouble and the walls of Jerusalem were broken down and the its Gates were burned with fire some of the things that were going on in Jerusalem at the time and this really put nemiah in a state of distress because even though he was prospering if you read in the prophets and Kings uh chapter 52 if I'm not wrong you can it tells you how he was living Pros in in a prosperous place right he was a cup Bearer to the King which means he had access to royalty to money and to comfortability but when he heard of what was happening in Jerusalem and how his brothers and sisters his Kinsmen were suffering even though they had gone back home his heart was put in in distress and he was very worried and it tells us it it continues saying how he didn't sleep how he was not eating and his face was it was easy to tell he was sad like his face was in such a state and um it doesn't go deep into what happens later on in the story but here now into the story talks about how he prayed the first thing nemiah did when he was going through all this was prayer even though he was distressed he went to his knees and he prayed and in in prophets and Kings I'll just read a small a small part of a passage nemiah had often poured out his soul in on behalf of his people but now as he prayed a a holy purpose formed in his mind he resolved that if he could obtain the consent of the king and the necessary Aid in procuring implements and material he himself would undertake the task of rebuilding the walls of Jerusalem and restoring Israel's nation's strength and he asked the Lord to Grant him favor in the sight of the king that this plan might be carried out so in the flashlight uh to go further on what this passage is talking about and how the first thing he did was praying and he wasn't praying for he wasn't generally praying like in the what you think section he wasn't been doing it generally like Lord I pray for the whole of Israel bless them amen no he had a holy purpose formed in his mind this time when he went down on his knees and it tells us on how he was a very he he would pray con he was a consistent prayer uh prayer Warrior as I like to call them and this is just a small detail you get into this and uh to pray as nemiah prayed in his hour of need is a Source at the command of the Christian under circumstance when other forms of prayer may be impossible toilers in the busy walks of life crowded and almost overwhelmed with perplexity can send up petition to God for divine guidance that's from prophets in Kings page 631 basically what all this is talking about from the flashlight from prophets and kings and even from the story itself it shows how nemiah did the first thing that God asks us to do in Jeremiah 29: uh 12 I believe it says then you will call on me and come and pray to me and I will listen to you nemiah knew this and that's exactly what he did in this time of distress he went on his knees with a holy purpose in mind not something general and he asked of it and in in this distress God answered him through the King by giving him favor yeah wow thank you so much Brenda for that summary and and I think you mentioned something that we almost skipped nemiah like David was a royal had Royal favor he served the king and as a servant let me call them uh civil servants of that time I'm very sure that those guys had serious problems in their government and what was going on and I don't want to relate it to to what we're going through now but I think you get what I'm saying when I'm talking about the problems this guys faced this is before he came back to Jerusalem and we are told that even as he as he served the first thing that always came into his mind was turning to God going on his knees to pray for guidance and God's wisdom and now when he comes back to Jerusalem he looks at how Jerusalem was so uh beit down the walls were destroyed the gates had also destroyed and you know it's it's easy for someone to to be so discouraged especially at the level nemiah was um cuz he was looking at now where do we start how are we going to handle this but we see that nemiah turned to God rather than dealing with all the you know cuz you know the the the Israelites at that time also had um apart from Jerusalem being run out their faith where it was at the time was also not that good and him as a leader is also responsible for you know nurturing the Israelites spiritually and before he decided to do anything we see that nemiah goes down on his knees and ask uh God for wisdom that's that's quite powerful um do you guys have something to to mention um for me I also think I I got a lot from this story of Nehemiah and I'd like to begin with the the nature of the prayer of Nehemiah MH we see um um actually I'd say the the property of I would say the the nature of his confession it was true confession and I remember from the book steps to Christ um where L advice us on the true nature of confession it will be driven from a remorseful heart and that's what we actually see from nehemiah's confession and the kind of prayer he prayed to God and I also see the how sometimes you know difficulties in life can lead us back to prayer cuz we see after nemiah asks um about the the condition of the Jewish and he's told that um the the remnants from that from the Exile I think this is what d drove him into into prayer and we see that sometimes in life you know we can go through a lot of challenges which takes us back to prayer you know and I feel like we get another nature of God being one that answers our prayer whenever we need we need him yeah thank you for that uh let's now head into the out of the story section and Link it link it to um the further insights uh sorry the punch lines out of the section and Link it to the punch lines which is also part of further insights okay so before before I read the the punch lines I'd like to read um some Psalms Psalms 91:15 and it says he will call on me and I will answer him I will be with him in trouble I will deliver him and honor him and from the Wednesday section it's it asks as a question here and it is it says from the punch lines actually um which P which passage if acted on will transform your spiritual life the most while choose one of the verse in the punch Lins and talk to God about how you might live out the message today so I'd like to ask my fellow panelists beginning with Jabari um from the punch lines which one actually stands to you stands out to you well okay um Matthew 77 to8 which says ask and it will be given to you seek and you'll find knock and the door will be open to you for everyone who asks receives the one who seeks finds and the one who knocks the door will be opened well I chose this one because directly it can seem a bit it's a bit strange cuz it's basically saying you pretty much get get everything you want but I feel like it's not supposed to be understood that way cuz sometimes you'll ask for something but maybe not get it or you'll end up not getting it and getting it much better at some time later so I think it just means that even if we'll always end up happy even if it's not by the things you wanted yeah yeah I think um just to add on what Jabari said um it really needs to come to our consideration that we should be mindful of the kind of prayer we pray to God the fact that um whenever we need God in any condition or in any way he'll be there for us doesn't mean that we can just literally ask for anything cuz you know sometimes we might ask for things that are not are not really necessary in our lives and I think God is also always considerate because sometimes you feel like you may pray and your prayer is not being answered and maybe you know God knows that when I give you this it will it will have a negative effect in your life that's why maybe he's hesitating to give it to you yeah so going to Brenda which puning stand outs to you there um I'd have to go with the last one Romans 8:31 What then shall we say in response to these things if God is for us who can be against us um I picked this one because uh if you go further down in the further insights uh there's a quote that El white says God's children are not to pray in faith but to walk with diligent and wise care and I feel like something we overlooked about nehemiah's story in this section is The Bravery cuz not only did he pray and ask for God to favor him through the king but he also went ahead and when he was asked what is bothering you he came out and said it he wanted to do it himself like he had the determination the diligence to want to fix the problem that was causing his distress and for him to have that to do to be able to do that he need he needed bravery and I feel like this verse really backs up that whole Christians should have the the the bravery and the strength and the trust in God to do or go ahead and do what they need to do so if God is for us who can be against us I think that really bucks it up well yeah thank you so much Brenda and just to close on the punchline section I think you already mentioned Brenda already talked about Jeremiah 2912 when he was when she was reading the the story for me I think I'll I'll go with James 5:116 which says therefore confess your sins to each other and pray for each other so that you may be healed the prayer of a righteous person is powerful and effective yeah I think from this we get that um we should not only pray for ourselves but pray for other people you know sometimes it's not only us who are undergoing these hles and troubles but our neighbors also go through this same challenges so I feel like um praying for others is also something that we should work on yeah all right thank you for that um so I think you remember that I asked or I mentioned that we'll see how uh nemiah dealt with this uh his issues and how he chose to pray first uh one of the I think the key lessons that we can pick from this is that um or actually we can ask ask from God cuz we just read from from Matthew 7:7 uh if we ask God will do his bit but the the the point here is that uh the first step to dealing with any challenge as a Christian especially is you know seeking God first you might try and solve it on your own but I think you will come to realize quickly that that you'll end up having more challenges trying to deal with the challenge you're trying to pray for so one of the things we need to know is or ask from God is the discernment to know uh or to decide actually every time to take it to the Lord in prayer the other thing I think um we can pick from this lesson is that when we were talking about praying in congregation and in person I think uh also knowing uh you know cuz we all we're all living in in a community as a church but also where we are different in know different spaces or uh uh you know influences spaces of influence there are things that other people go through that you might probably not know by you know asking but you can you can actually see someone is struggling and knowing when someone is struggling and offering to pray for them or pray with them can can actually be a really good trait because you see that nemiah one of his greatest trait was you know deciding to actually surrender everything to God and helping someone do that I think is actually a good trait relating it to what nay did and the other thing um is uh choose to work hard for God's cause in the world like nemiah we've seen that apart from him being uh or working for the King when he came back to Jerusalem after praying he decided to work on rebuilding the wall now that that can can also go a long way in saying that spiritually when you're not on a on a a good uh let me call it on a good place personally cuz I'm I'm very sure each of us has a relationship with Christ and you will know when you probably are not doing one or two things that you should probably doing but this lesson is reminding us that having that urge or the will to work on yourself for God will go a long way as we prepare for his second coming so as uh you want to add something um no no no no no I think what I wanted to say is actually in the out of the story okay go ahead yeah it's it's a question and it says um what do you think is the Covenant of Love so I'd like to ask you to Brenda um that's I'm not going to lie that's a tricky question cuz Covenant of Love I feel like there could be there could be a lot of things that can be considered um the Covenant of Love I'm just going to reference where it says uh referred to in verse five yeah yeah yeah um let me just read it real quick so if um if you're faithful Unfaithful I will scut you among the Nations but if you return to me and obey my command months then even if you're ex exiled people are at the farthest Horizons I will gather them from there and bring them to the place I have chosen as a dwelling for my name and I want to reference this to just the the children of Israel right cuz this was something that I'm sure was told to them a lot because of uh them sinning against God being taken up as as captives then being let go again and I think that's the best example to use on how every time they sinned they would be C they would be taken as captives sold and they would be scattered right but every time they turned their hearts back to God God gathered them from wherever they were whatever place they had been sold to uh for um slaves or captives God would always gather them up and bring them back to the promised land in which he gave them and it's it's the same thing for us regarding this Covenant of Love Of Love if we ever turn away from God yes he will give us the consequences to our actions he does not refuse that he won't because every action has a consequence but at the end of the day when we turn back to God he he will not turn away from us just like when one of the punch lines I think it's the third one if I'm not wrong the third or fourth one mhm uh I think it's yeah the second one then you will call on me and come and pray to me and I will listen to you God will never turn away from you and I think that's the the biggest the biggest promise of love the biggest Covenant of Love because even if we turn away the away from him completely you know move continents or something he will always listen yeah um for me regarding the Covenant of Love I think this is basically God's commands cuz first thing when you see from nem's story after all this that he go through he he goes through and and he basically remembers God's covenant of love which is basically his commands I mean look at the Ten Commandments um the first part tells us on love for God and the other part the ending part tells us on love for our neighbors so this is what I think basically is the Covenant of Love and I think this is something that we really need to reflect on sometimes when we get into prayer we need to remember that just as I say that God can never leave our side and he's always there whenever anything happens yeah all right thank thanks for that so as you close um I think you can read the F Insight section I read it you already read it okay but I'll just add something on to what Winston said about the Commandments it's just a small verse I like to remind myself about how the Covenant of Love is about is about us loving God and how he loves us and in John 14:1 15 it says if you love me keep my commandments so I think that's just a a big reminder on what Winston was saying yeah okay uh so let me just read uh that forur inside section there's something quite profound there nemiah did not regard his duty done when he had wept and prayed before the Lord he United his petitions with holy Endeavor putting forth Hest prayerful efforts for the success of the Enterprise um in which he was engaged I think uh we just uh mentioned it part of showing that we love God or in connection with the Covenant of Love is that we need to obey what God tells us to do and in this point nemiah sought God's wisdom and after he didn't finish there he went on and worked on doing what needed to be done that is with wisdom from what God had told him and I think that that actually just puts it puts the best way you know uh seek God first and anything that you do like nemiah and also I think we can also relate it to what Daniel did U seek What the Lord Has for you and what you're currently doing and in any challenge that you face you know he's he's he's a Creator he's he's been here since eternity passed and he'll be here for eternity to come yeah so as we close uh we can just say the closing remarks and I'll ask to pray for us after we're done from my right brend we can go towards my left um I think what the biggest lesson I got here uh what I thought of as we were going through the lesson is that worldly wisdom teaches that prayer is not essential and the The Compassion of our savior proves that he's willing to listen through the prayer of faith and all we need to do is have that faith and pray even though the world is so against it cuz in the world we be told oh prayer is not the way to go like it doesn't always work God only answers when he wants to but what it takes is Faith even the Fai the smallest faith and determination to act on our prayer yeah um for me first I'll say that um pray is powerful but the fact that pray is powerful doesn't mean that it's just enough you know sometimes let's say in school you might pray for good grades but you're not putting that effort and you're basically just putting yourself into more trouble and we see even from the further insides where nemiah did not did not only regard his duty done after he had wept and prayed but there's also an extra effort he put here where we see that he United his petitions with holy Endeavor and he put prayerful efforts for the success of the Enterprise which he was engaged so I feel like it's not just about prayer but it's also the effort that we put Yeah well yeah I think I'd add on what Winston has said about prayer not being enough in fact I think that's probably one of Africa's biggest problems cuz out of our religion it's we we' become too dependent on prayer for certain things even though we can actually do them ourselves to a great extent of course I mean without God nothing's worth it but I feel like we sometimes use prayer to hi up we to hide behind inability or laziness cuz you find uh politicians maybe doing huge prayer meetings and all these things but on the ground there's nothing they're doing I feel like that's why other countries which aren too religion oriented especially like in the west are quite are quite far because I mean I'm not saying that them not having religion is a good thing I'm just saying it forces them to actually work cuz they know no other way to get what they want yeah okay yeah so we can learn to not only pray cuz prayer is powerful but also act on whatever we praying on yeah exactly right you can close for us with a prayer let's pray heavenly father thank you for enabling us to conclude this uh session now as we're about to finish may you help us to be pray with faithfulness but also do as much as we can on our own this is my prayer in Jesus name amen amen

[453.9s] record and I think of all my
[459.4s] S how can
[461.4s] I be
[467.6s] Saed we are here to look at
[470.6s] Cornerstone connection study lesson uh
[474.0s] which is lesson number seven which is
[476.4s] titled nemiah the praying prophet with
[480.0s] me here is on my right Brenda Maya on my
[484.3s] left Winston ay and on my extreme
[489.4s] left thank you
[493.0s] uh the praying Prophet
[495.6s] so what do you guys uh expect to learn
[498.8s] from from this from this
[502.1s] lesson what do you think it's going to
[504.0s] be about just look at the title nemiah
[506.8s] The praying prophet
[510.7s] I think it um what we learn from this
[515.0s] lesson specifically is I think something
[517.8s] to do with prayer CU it emphasizes a lot
[520.5s] on nemiah being a Praying Prophet so
[523.1s] most likely prayer yeah exactly exactly
[526.0s] so uh let's dive in into the key key
[528.6s] text um which is from nemiah
[534.7s] 1:1 so the key text says the god of
[538.7s] Heaven himself
[540.4s] will prosper us therefore we his
[543.0s] servants will arise and
[546.7s] build all right thanks thanks
[551.5s] um let's move on to the what do you
[553.8s] think
[554.7s] section uh this is a is an either or uh
[559.2s] type of question so the experience of
[561.6s] praying is more meaningful to me when I
[564.6s] pray individually or with others what do
[567.6s] you think are the kinds of things we
[570.7s] ought to pray for individually in
[573.9s] contrast to the things we should pray
[576.6s] for uh
[579.1s] oper what do you guys think okay
[582.3s] beginning with me from what I think um
[586.1s] the question says that what do you think
[588.5s] are the key kinds of things we ought to
[591.5s] pray for individually in contrast to the
[594.9s] things we should pray for
[598.0s] cooperatively so so from my
[600.9s] understanding I think you know there's
[602.7s] some things or some issues that are
[605.4s] usually private that sometimes we ought
[608.9s] not to share in the public and I feel
[612.8s] like um first of all what i' like to say
[615.8s] is that I think this is an advantage of
[618.2s] prayer cuz you know in prayer we get to
[621.5s] tell God some things that are troubling
[624.2s] us the things that we cannot share with
[627.0s] other people but through prayer
[629.8s] we can get to tell God anything that is
[632.7s] in our hearts and
[635.0s] so
[636.5s] um answering on the question the kinds
[639.0s] of things that we can can we ought to
[641.8s] pray for individually in contrast
[644.6s] to what we we should pray for
[647.2s] cooperatively so what we can pray for um
[651.3s] in when we individually I think one of
[654.1s] them is the things that are maybe
[657.2s] troubling us that are private something
[658.9s] like that private yeah okay uh well I do
[663.5s] agree with you there are things that uh
[665.9s] trouble us inividual on an individual
[668.6s] level and uh well it's not you might
[672.5s] have one or two people who are close to
[674.3s] you uh who you might add on to the group
[677.5s] that you want to uh start for that
[679.8s] specific uh issue for prayer but I do
[683.7s] agree that there are some things that
[685.0s] you need to um you know go on your knees
[688.8s] on your own
[690.1s] and and you know sort it out with
[692.6s] Jesus yeah so anyone has anything else
[696.5s] to add on that before we move
[699.6s] on um regarding what Fon was telling us
[703.2s] earlier about uh private things that
[706.4s] should be you know kept private uh I
[710.2s] wanted to put emphasis on it and um talk
[714.2s] about how we have silent prayers like in
[716.5s] a group of people you're doing prayer
[718.8s] together and you'd be like I have a
[720.8s] silent prayer
[722.2s] request such things are not what I think
[725.2s] um we can consider Things To Pray by
[727.9s] ourselves but just because we're praying
[729.9s] by ourselves doesn't mean we can't ask
[732.1s] other people to pray pray with us like
[734.3s] for support on whatever it is we're
[736.3s] praying for so some of those things it
[739.4s] could be let's say
[741.1s] um private family issues that you don't
[743.9s] want to disclose or um personal issues
[746.9s] within you let's say if you're having a
[748.3s] problem with a certain
[750.0s] uh Temptation some things you you are
[752.1s] too shamed to say out loud I think
[754.6s] that's what we can consider um
[756.3s] individual for this and for praying
[759.5s] corporately or just with other people
[761.7s] together I think for guidance like if in
[764.5s] a setting of um a church we can be
[767.4s] praying for God to guide us as a church
[769.9s] or to bring more people to the church
[771.5s] that's something you'd pray in a large
[773.0s] group for yeah okay yeah that's uh I
[776.5s] think that's straightforward and I I
[778.4s] think that's
[780.6s] for majority of us I think
[783.7s] um especially when it comes to corporate
[786.3s] kind of prayer or congregational kind of
[788.3s] prayer those are things that you know
[791.2s] cuts across problems that probably cuts
[793.0s] across or probably it's something you're
[794.8s] praying for as a congregation and it
[797.9s] really helps actually to to involve our
[800.1s] whole congregation to pray about it and
[803.0s] I think we learn also look at how uh
[805.8s] nemiah prayed about the situation he was
[809.2s] going through so I think we can dive
[812.0s] into the story um so I'll be I'll be
[818.2s] doing a summary for basically what our
[821.3s] story was from for if you're interested
[823.9s] to go read it on your own this the story
[826.2s] is from nemiah chapter 1 1 to1 and
[830.6s] basically uh it starts
[832.9s] with uh talking about the time of the
[835.7s] year in which this takes place in which
[838.2s] is the month of
[839.6s] KV in the 20th year and nemiah was was
[844.4s] situated in Citadel of Susan and one of
[848.3s] his one of his brothers came from Judah
[850.9s] with some other men and he he inquired
[853.6s] on how uh Judah was and the Exiles that
[857.4s] went back the ones that survived and
[859.8s] they told him that uh those who had
[862.1s] survived were in great trouble and the
[864.7s] walls of Jerusalem were broken down and
[867.6s] the its Gates were burned with fire
[869.6s] some of the things that were going on in
[871.5s] Jerusalem at the time and this really
[874.1s] put nemiah in a state of distress
[877.3s] because even though he was prospering if
[879.9s] you read in the prophets and Kings uh
[882.7s] chapter 52 if I'm not wrong you can it
[886.2s] tells you how he was living Pros in in a
[889.8s] prosperous place right he was a cup
[892.2s] Bearer to the King which means he had
[894.8s] access to royalty to money and to
[898.0s] comfortability but when he heard of what
[900.2s] was happening in Jerusalem and how his
[901.9s] brothers and sisters his Kinsmen were
[904.6s] suffering even though they had gone back
[906.7s] home his heart was put in in distress
[909.1s] and he was very worried and it tells us
[912.9s] it it continues saying how he didn't
[914.6s] sleep how he was not eating and his face
[918.1s] was it was easy to tell he was sad like
[920.9s] his face was in such a state and um it
[924.2s] doesn't go deep into what happens later
[927.1s] on in the story but here now into the
[930.1s] story talks about how he prayed the
[933.1s] first thing nemiah did when he was going
[935.4s] through all this was prayer even though
[937.2s] he was distressed he went to his knees
[940.1s] and he prayed and in in prophets and
[943.2s] Kings I'll just read a small a small
[945.1s] part of a passage nemiah had often
[947.8s] poured out his soul in on behalf of his
[950.3s] people but now as he prayed a a holy
[953.5s] purpose formed in his mind he resolved
[956.0s] that if he could obtain the consent of
[958.2s] the king and the necessary Aid in
[961.4s] procuring implements and material he
[963.8s] himself would undertake the task of
[965.9s] rebuilding the walls of Jerusalem and
[967.8s] restoring Israel's nation's strength and
[970.4s] he asked the Lord to Grant him favor in
[972.2s] the sight of the king that this plan
[974.5s] might be carried out so in the
[977.6s] flashlight uh to go further on what this
[980.8s] passage is talking about and how the
[983.0s] first thing he did was praying and he
[984.7s] wasn't praying for he wasn't generally
[986.9s] praying like in the what you think
[988.1s] section he wasn't been doing it
[990.3s] generally like Lord I pray for the whole
[993.4s] of Israel bless them amen no he had a
[997.0s] holy purpose formed in his mind this
[999.8s] time when he went down on his knees and
[1002.2s] it tells us on how he was a very he he
[1005.0s] would pray con he was a consistent
[1006.9s] prayer uh prayer Warrior as I like to
[1009.7s] call them and this is just a small
[1012.7s] detail you get into this and uh to pray
[1015.8s] as nemiah prayed in his hour of need is
[1018.4s] a Source at the command of the Christian
[1021.2s] under circumstance when other forms of
[1023.6s] prayer may be impossible toilers in the
[1026.5s] busy walks of life crowded and almost
[1029.0s] overwhelmed with perplexity can send up
[1031.8s] petition to God for divine guidance
[1033.7s] that's from prophets in Kings page
[1036.3s] 631 basically what all this is talking
[1039.0s] about from the flashlight from prophets
[1041.0s] and kings and even from the story itself
[1043.7s] it shows how nemiah did the first thing
[1047.4s] that God asks us to do in Jeremiah 29:
[1051.1s] uh 12 I believe it says then you will
[1053.1s] call on me and come and pray to me and I
[1055.5s] will listen to you nemiah knew this and
[1058.3s] that's exactly what he did in this time
[1060.4s] of distress he went on his knees with a
[1063.0s] holy purpose in mind not something
[1064.7s] general and he asked of it and in in
[1068.9s] this distress God answered him through
[1070.9s] the King by giving him favor yeah wow
[1074.3s] thank you so much Brenda for that
[1075.7s] summary and and I think you mentioned
[1079.1s] something that we almost skipped nemiah
[1083.1s] like David was a royal had Royal favor
[1087.0s] he served the king and as a servant let
[1091.2s] me call them uh civil servants of that
[1094.7s] time I'm very sure that those guys had
[1097.9s] serious problems in their government and
[1100.6s] what was going on and I don't want to
[1103.8s] relate it to to what we're going through
[1105.5s] now but I think you get what I'm saying
[1107.4s] when I'm talking about the problems this
[1109.9s] guys faced this is before he came back
[1113.8s] to Jerusalem and we are told that even
[1117.7s] as he as he served the first thing that
[1121.2s] always came into his mind was turning to
[1123.6s] God going on his knees to pray for
[1126.1s] guidance and God's wisdom and now when
[1128.6s] he comes back
[1130.9s] to
[1132.5s] Jerusalem he looks at how Jerusalem was
[1135.6s] so uh beit down the walls were destroyed
[1139.5s] the gates had also destroyed and you
[1143.3s] know it's it's easy for someone to to be
[1145.6s] so
[1146.4s] discouraged especially at the level
[1148.9s] nemiah
[1150.0s] was um cuz he was looking at now where
[1153.3s] do we
[1154.6s] start how are we going to handle this
[1157.3s] but we see that nemiah turned to
[1162.1s] God rather than dealing with all the you
[1165.0s] know cuz you know the the the Israelites
[1167.7s] at that time also had um apart from
[1171.3s] Jerusalem being run out their
[1174.1s] faith where it was at the time was also
[1176.7s] not that good and him as a leader is
[1178.9s] also responsible for you know nurturing
[1182.0s] the Israelites
[1183.2s] spiritually and before he decided to do
[1186.3s] anything we see that nemiah goes down on
[1189.6s] his knees and ask uh God for wisdom
[1193.4s] that's that's quite powerful um do you
[1196.6s] guys have something to to mention
[1199.5s] um for me I also think I I got a lot
[1202.0s] from this story of
[1203.4s] Nehemiah and I'd like to begin with the
[1207.9s] the nature of the prayer of Nehemiah MH
[1210.5s] we see um um actually I'd say the the
[1215.2s] property of I would say
[1218.2s] the the nature of his confession it was
[1221.5s] true confession and I remember from the
[1224.3s] book steps to Christ um where L advice
[1228.9s] us on the true nature of confession it
[1231.9s] will be driven from a remorseful heart
[1235.7s] and that's what we actually see from
[1238.4s] nehemiah's confession and the kind of
[1241.0s] prayer he prayed to God and I also see
[1246.5s] the how sometimes you know difficulties
[1250.0s] in life can lead us back to prayer cuz
[1254.0s] we see after nemiah asks
[1257.6s] um about the the condition of the
[1260.7s] Jewish and he's told that um the the
[1265.4s] remnants from that from the Exile I
[1268.2s] think this is what d drove him into into
[1272.4s] prayer and we see that sometimes in life
[1276.4s] you know we can go through a lot of
[1278.5s] challenges which takes us back to prayer
[1280.9s] you know and I feel like we get another
[1284.4s] nature of God being one that answers our
[1289.1s] prayer whenever we need we need him yeah
[1294.0s] thank you for that uh let's now head
[1297.7s] into the out of the story section and
[1300.2s] Link it link it to um the further
[1304.6s] insights uh sorry the punch lines out of
[1307.2s] the section and Link it to the punch
[1308.7s] lines which is also part of further
[1311.4s] insights okay so before before I read
[1314.6s] the the punch lines I'd like to read um
[1318.3s] some
[1319.2s] Psalms Psalms
[1321.5s] 91:15 and it says he will call on me and
[1325.4s] I will answer him I will be with him in
[1328.2s] trouble I will deliver him and honor him
[1332.0s] and from the Wednesday section it's it
[1335.0s] asks as a question here and it is it
[1339.2s] says from the punch lines actually um
[1342.6s] which P which passage if acted on will
[1345.4s] transform your spiritual life the most
[1348.3s] while
[1349.1s] choose one of the verse in the punch
[1351.0s] Lins and talk to God about how you might
[1354.3s] live out the message today so I'd like
[1357.8s] to ask my fellow panelists beginning
[1360.8s] with Jabari um from the punch lines
[1364.5s] which one actually stands to you stands
[1366.9s] out to
[1368.9s] you well
[1371.2s] okay
[1374.8s] um Matthew 77 to8 which says ask and it
[1380.9s] will be given to you seek and you'll
[1383.6s] find knock and the door will be open to
[1386.3s] you for everyone who asks receives the
[1389.5s] one who seeks finds and the one who
[1391.8s] knocks the door will be
[1394.1s] opened well I chose this one
[1397.7s] because directly it can seem a
[1401.1s] bit it's a bit strange cuz it's
[1404.7s] basically saying you pretty much get get
[1408.8s] everything you want
[1411.5s] but I feel like it's not supposed to be
[1415.0s] understood that way cuz
[1417.8s] sometimes you'll ask for something but
[1421.4s] maybe not get it or you'll end up not
[1424.4s] getting it and getting it much better at
[1428.1s] some time later so I think it just means
[1432.2s] that even
[1434.2s] if we'll always end up happy even if
[1438.5s] it's not by the things you wanted yeah
[1442.8s] yeah I think um just to add on what
[1445.5s] Jabari said um it really needs to come
[1449.1s] to our consideration that we should be
[1451.4s] mindful of the kind of prayer we pray to
[1453.6s] God the fact that um whenever we need
[1456.6s] God in any condition or in any way he'll
[1460.1s] be there for us doesn't mean that we can
[1462.8s] just literally ask for anything cuz you
[1465.1s] know sometimes we might ask for things
[1467.6s] that are not are not really necessary in
[1470.2s] our lives and I think God is also always
[1474.3s] considerate because sometimes you feel
[1476.2s] like you may pray and your prayer is not
[1478.5s] being answered and maybe you know God
[1481.7s] knows that when I give you this it will
[1484.6s] it will have a negative effect in your
[1486.2s] life that's why maybe he's hesitating to
[1488.9s] give it to you yeah so going to Brenda
[1491.9s] which puning stand outs to you
[1496.2s] there um I'd have to go with the last
[1499.4s] one Romans
[1501.5s] 8:31 What then shall we say in response
[1504.5s] to these things if God is for us who can
[1507.4s] be against
[1508.9s] us um I picked this one because uh if
[1511.8s] you go further down in the further
[1513.7s] insights uh there's a quote that El
[1516.8s] white says God's children are not to
[1519.2s] pray in faith but to walk with diligent
[1522.0s] and wise care and I feel like something
[1524.8s] we overlooked about nehemiah's story in
[1527.9s] this section is The Bravery cuz not only
[1530.7s] did he pray and ask for God to favor him
[1533.6s] through the king but he also went ahead
[1537.8s] and when he was asked what is bothering
[1539.3s] you he came out and said it he wanted to
[1542.0s] do it himself like he had the
[1544.3s] determination the diligence to want to
[1547.0s] fix the problem that was causing his
[1549.1s] distress and for him to have that to do
[1552.0s] to be able to do that he need he needed
[1553.8s] bravery and I feel like this verse
[1555.6s] really backs up that whole Christians
[1558.6s] should have the the the bravery and the
[1561.1s] strength and the trust in God to do or
[1564.1s] go ahead and do what they need to do so
[1566.3s] if God is for us who can be against us I
[1568.6s] think that really bucks it up well yeah
[1571.4s] thank you so much Brenda and just to
[1574.1s] close on the punchline section I think
[1576.7s] you already mentioned Brenda already
[1578.5s] talked about Jeremiah 2912 when he was
[1581.6s] when she was reading the the story for
[1584.7s] me I think I'll I'll go with James 5:116
[1588.9s] which says therefore confess your sins
[1592.0s] to each other and pray for each other so
[1594.7s] that you may be healed the prayer of a
[1597.5s] righteous person is powerful and
[1600.0s] effective yeah I think from this we get
[1602.7s] that um we should not only pray for
[1605.3s] ourselves but pray for other people you
[1609.0s] know sometimes it's not only us who are
[1612.0s] undergoing these hles and troubles but
[1615.9s] our neighbors also go through this same
[1618.6s] challenges so I feel like um praying for
[1622.7s] others is also something that we should
[1625.2s] work on yeah all right thank you for
[1628.7s] that um so I think you remember that I
[1631.8s] asked or I mentioned that we'll see how
[1635.7s] uh nemiah dealt with this uh his issues
[1641.0s] and how he chose to pray first uh one of
[1645.3s] the I think the key lessons that we can
[1647.9s] pick from this is that um or actually we
[1651.6s] can ask ask from God cuz we just read
[1655.2s] from from Matthew 7:7 uh if we
[1661.1s] ask God will do his bit but the the the
[1666.9s] point here is that uh the first step to
[1671.1s] dealing with any
[1672.4s] challenge as a Christian especially is
[1676.1s] you know seeking God first you might try
[1679.2s] and solve it on your own but I think you
[1683.4s] will come to realize quickly that that
[1686.2s] you'll end up having more challenges
[1688.1s] trying to deal with the challenge you're
[1689.5s] trying to pray for so one of the things
[1692.6s] we need to know is or ask from God is
[1695.2s] the discernment to know uh or to decide
[1698.2s] actually every time to take it to the
[1700.8s] Lord in prayer the other thing I think
[1704.2s] um we can pick from this lesson is that
[1709.7s] when we were talking about praying in
[1711.8s] congregation and in person I think uh
[1715.5s] also
[1716.8s] knowing uh you know cuz we all we're all
[1719.8s] living in in a community as a church but
[1723.0s] also where we are different in know
[1725.3s] different spaces or uh uh you know
[1729.8s] influences spaces of influence there are
[1732.2s] things that other people go through that
[1734.5s] you
[1735.2s] might probably not know by you know
[1738.4s] asking but you can you can actually see
[1740.8s] someone is struggling and knowing when
[1743.6s] someone is struggling and offering to
[1745.3s] pray for them or pray with them can can
[1748.7s] actually be a really good trait because
[1750.3s] you see that
[1751.6s] nemiah one of his greatest trait was you
[1755.2s] know deciding to actually surrender
[1758.0s] everything to God and helping someone do
[1760.7s] that I think is actually a good trait
[1763.6s] relating it to what nay did and the
[1765.6s] other thing um is
[1769.2s] uh choose to work hard for God's cause
[1772.9s] in the
[1774.4s] world like nemiah we've seen that apart
[1777.6s] from him being uh or working for the
[1780.4s] King when he came back to
[1784.7s] Jerusalem after praying he decided to
[1787.8s] work on rebuilding the wall now that
[1791.3s] that can can also go a long way in
[1793.6s] saying that spiritually when you're not
[1797.4s] on a on a a good uh let me call it on a
[1800.8s] good place personally cuz I'm I'm very
[1803.2s] sure each of us has a relationship with
[1805.6s] Christ and you will know when you
[1808.1s] probably are not doing one or two things
[1809.6s] that you should probably doing
[1811.8s] but this lesson is reminding us that
[1815.9s] having that urge or the will to work on
[1820.3s] yourself for God will go a long way as
[1824.2s] we prepare for his second coming so as
[1828.6s] uh you want to add something um no no no
[1831.7s] no no I think what I wanted to say is
[1834.0s] actually in the out of the story okay go
[1836.8s] ahead yeah it's it's a question and it
[1841.6s] says um what do you think is the
[1844.2s] Covenant of Love so I'd like to ask you
[1849.1s] to
[1852.1s] Brenda
[1854.0s] um that's I'm not going to lie that's a
[1858.2s] tricky question cuz Covenant of Love I
[1861.0s] feel
[1862.5s] like there could
[1865.2s] be there could be a lot of things that
[1867.5s] can be considered um the Covenant of
[1870.0s] Love I'm just going to reference where
[1871.4s] it says uh referred to in verse five
[1874.8s] yeah yeah yeah
[1877.9s] um let me just read it real quick so if
[1881.8s] um if you're faithful Unfaithful I will
[1884.0s] scut you among the Nations but if you
[1886.2s] return to me and obey my command months
[1888.6s] then even if you're ex exiled people are
[1891.7s] at the farthest Horizons I will gather
[1894.5s] them from there and bring them to the
[1896.9s] place I have chosen as a dwelling for my
[1899.0s] name and I want to reference this to
[1901.2s] just the the children of Israel right
[1904.2s] cuz this was something that I'm sure was
[1906.7s] told to them a lot because of uh them
[1910.0s] sinning against God being taken up as as
[1913.2s] captives then being let go again and I
[1915.6s] think that's the best example to use on
[1918.5s] how every time they sinned they would be
[1921.7s] C they would be taken as captives sold
[1924.2s] and they would be scattered right but
[1926.5s] every time they turned their hearts back
[1928.1s] to God God gathered them from wherever
[1930.1s] they were whatever place they had been
[1932.0s] sold to uh for um slaves or captives God
[1936.2s] would always gather them up and bring
[1938.7s] them back to the promised land in which
[1941.0s] he gave them and it's it's the same
[1942.8s] thing for us regarding this Covenant of
[1945.4s] Love Of Love if we ever turn away from
[1949.3s] God yes he will give us the consequences
[1952.2s] to our actions he does not refuse that
[1954.9s] he won't because every action has a
[1957.0s] consequence but at the end of the day
[1959.0s] when we turn back to God he he will not
[1962.5s] turn away from us just like when one of
[1964.6s] the punch lines I think it's the third
[1966.5s] one if I'm not wrong the third or fourth
[1968.2s] one mhm uh I think it's yeah the second
[1971.4s] one then you will call on me and come
[1973.2s] and pray to me and I will listen to you
[1975.5s] God will never turn away from you and I
[1977.4s] think that's the the biggest the biggest
[1979.7s] promise of love the biggest Covenant of
[1981.5s] Love because even if we turn away the
[1983.7s] away from him completely you know move
[1985.9s] continents or something he will always
[1988.2s] listen yeah um for me regarding the
[1992.8s] Covenant of Love I think this is
[1995.3s] basically God's commands cuz first thing
[1999.4s] when you see from nem's story after all
[2003.5s] this that he go through he he goes
[2006.8s] through and and he basically remembers
[2010.0s] God's covenant of love which is
[2011.9s] basically his commands I mean look at
[2014.9s] the Ten Commandments um the first part
[2018.2s] tells us on love for God and the other
[2021.6s] part the ending part tells us on love
[2023.8s] for our neighbors so this is what I
[2026.2s] think basically is the Covenant of Love
[2029.2s] and I think this is something that we
[2031.8s] really need to reflect on sometimes when
[2034.4s] we get into prayer we need to remember
[2036.6s] that just as I say that God can never
[2039.6s] leave our side and he's always there
[2043.4s] whenever anything happens yeah all right
[2047.1s] thank thanks for that so as you close um
[2050.5s] I think you can read the F Insight
[2055.0s] section I read it you already read it
[2057.6s] okay but I'll just add something on to
[2059.6s] what Winston said about the Commandments
[2061.5s] it's just a small verse I like to remind
[2063.3s] myself about how the Covenant of Love is
[2066.0s] about is about us loving God and how he
[2068.0s] loves us and in John 14:1 15 it says if
[2071.5s] you love me keep my commandments so I
[2074.8s] think that's just a a big reminder on
[2077.4s] what Winston was saying yeah okay uh so
[2081.1s] let me just read uh that forur inside
[2084.9s] section there's something quite profound
[2087.1s] there nemiah did not regard his duty
[2089.2s] done when he had wept and prayed before
[2091.9s] the Lord he United his petitions with
[2094.3s] holy Endeavor putting forth Hest
[2098.4s] prayerful efforts for the success of the
[2102.4s] Enterprise um in which he was
[2106.6s] engaged I think uh we just uh mentioned
[2111.8s] it part
[2113.8s] of showing that we love God or in
[2118.4s] connection with the Covenant of Love is
[2120.5s] that we need to
[2122.6s] obey what God tells us to do and in this
[2126.6s] point nemiah sought God's wisdom and
[2130.5s] after he didn't finish there he went on
[2133.2s] and worked on doing what needed to be
[2137.2s] done that is with wisdom from what God
[2141.4s] had told him
[2144.6s] and I think that that actually just puts
[2147.9s] it puts the best way you know uh seek
[2152.8s] God first and anything that you do like
[2156.0s] nemiah and also I think we can also
[2159.4s] relate it to what Daniel did U seek What
[2163.8s] the Lord Has for you and what you're
[2167.2s] currently doing and in any challenge
[2169.4s] that you face you know he's he's he's a
[2172.6s] Creator he's he's been here since
[2174.8s] eternity passed and he'll be here for
[2178.1s] eternity to
[2179.8s] come yeah so as we close
[2184.5s] uh we can just say the closing remarks
[2187.2s] and I'll ask to pray for
[2190.5s] us after we're done from my right brend
[2193.9s] we can go towards my left um I think
[2197.5s] what the biggest lesson I got
[2200.4s] here uh what I thought of as we were
[2202.9s] going through the lesson is that worldly
[2206.2s] wisdom teaches that prayer is not
[2209.0s] essential and the The Compassion of our
[2213.6s] savior proves that he's willing to
[2216.2s] listen through the prayer of faith and
[2220.3s] all we need to do is have that faith and
[2222.8s] pray even though the world is so against
[2225.0s] it cuz in the world we be told oh prayer
[2228.8s] is not the way to go like it doesn't
[2230.6s] always work God only answers when he
[2232.6s] wants to but what it takes is Faith even
[2235.5s] the Fai the smallest faith and
[2237.3s] determination to act on our prayer
[2240.8s] yeah um for me first I'll say that um
[2244.9s] pray is powerful but the fact that pray
[2248.1s] is powerful doesn't mean that it's just
[2252.0s] enough you know sometimes let's say in
[2255.2s] school you might pray for good grades
[2257.4s] but you're not putting that effort and
[2260.8s] you're basically just putting yourself
[2262.4s] into more trouble and we see even from
[2264.7s] the further insides where nemiah did not
[2268.1s] did not only regard his duty done after
[2271.2s] he had wept and prayed but there's also
[2274.6s] an extra effort he put here where we see
[2277.1s] that he United his petitions with holy
[2280.2s] Endeavor and he put prayerful efforts
[2284.7s] for the success of the Enterprise which
[2287.0s] he was engaged so I feel like it's not
[2290.2s] just about prayer but it's also the
[2293.3s] effort that we put
[2297.5s] Yeah well yeah I think I'd add on what
[2300.8s] Winston has said about prayer not being
[2303.2s] enough in fact I think that's probably
[2305.8s] one of Africa's biggest problems
[2308.9s] cuz out of our religion it's we we'
[2313.4s] become too dependent on prayer for
[2315.0s] certain things even though we can
[2318.6s] actually do them ourselves to a great
[2322.5s] extent of course I mean without God
[2325.4s] nothing's worth it but I feel like we
[2330.2s] sometimes use prayer to hi up we to hide
[2333.9s] behind inability or laziness cuz you
[2338.4s] find uh politicians maybe doing huge
[2341.8s] prayer meetings and all these things but
[2344.8s] on the ground there's nothing they're
[2346.3s] doing I feel like that's why other
[2350.0s] countries which aren
[2352.6s] too religion oriented especially like in
[2356.0s] the west are
[2358.9s] quite are quite far because I mean I'm
[2363.7s] not saying that them not having religion
[2365.7s] is a good thing I'm just saying
[2368.2s] it forces them to actually work cuz they
[2370.5s] know no other way to get what they want
[2373.5s] yeah okay yeah so we can learn to not
[2376.6s] only pray cuz prayer is powerful but
[2379.0s] also act on whatever we praying on yeah
[2382.7s] exactly right you can close for us with
[2384.6s] a
[2387.1s] prayer let's pray heavenly father thank
[2390.6s] you for enabling us to conclude this uh
[2394.9s] session now as we're about to
[2398.2s] finish may you help us to be pray with
[2403.4s] faithfulness but also do as much as we
[2406.8s] can on our own this is my prayer in
[2409.5s] Jesus name amen amen
