FULL TRANSCRIPT:
greetings wherever you are and Welcome to our study of the book of daughters of God you can get this book from ABC or you can scan it from the QR code that is running down our screen we have been able to do the chapter one last week and we are welcoming you today to chapter 2 episode 2 and we're going to learn about a beautiful lady by the name Sarah so before we get into our today's studies I'm going to invite Grace for a word of prayer let's bow our heads for a word of prayer Our Kind and heavenly father thank you so much for bringing us here to expand on this book that your servant wrote Daughters of God and as we delve into this woman of Faith Sarah we pray that you may that you may teach us what we are supposed to learn from her and may you help us to be the women that you want us to be it is our humble prayer trusting and believing in Jesus name I pray amen amen and in our today's studies we have beautiful ladies on set and before we go deep I would like them to introduce themselves kib hello everyone Ruby from the Youth Department hello everyone alen from the pal Department hi Elizabeth from the women Ministries Department hi as she mentioned I'm Grace and I serve in the youth choir hello to you all my name is Nora and I serve in the deaconry department maraa my name is Joan from interest coordination thank you and taking you through today's studies Marina Deber from Deon Department to start us off any fun fact about Sarah something that stands out about her as you're reading you can share with us um I'll start I like that um she was there giving companionship to her husband Abraham you know normally we are told about Abraham and how he was a man of Faith but remember Abraham had been with Sarah for a long time from the time before they even changed their names from Sarai to Abram and they walked together uh for a long time so I can say she was a very good companion who made her husband to trust in God more wow yes that's that's a challenge yes um elen yeah I can say that uh Sarah was real yeah uh in her reactions in in her actions she was she was human she from from her story you see the the human nature in her where when when she had that they're going to Bear children in their old age she she laughed like I'm I'm this old how am how am I going to to give birth to a child so for me she she was she was so real yeah sister Elizabeth yeah uh from The Book of Genesis 20:2 yeah uh Sarah was actually um a relative of Abraham yeah we are told that Sarah and her husband Abraham shared a common parentage for Sarah was Abraham's half sister by his father Tera yeah thank you I like the way um I mean Sarah was obedient hey she was so obedient she left you know the book says that um the message of God came to Abraham and of course it's from the Bible get thee out of thy country she left her country mhm and that's easy right yeah I know it's not and from thy Kindred she left her family and from thy father's house and to a land I will show thee you're sending there's one thing following your husband yeah to Tania but there's another one for him to say I don't know where I'm going you're like my friend you just go because it's I mean that's crazy so she was a woman of Faith yeah I mean and and they they were starting a fresh new faith and God wanted Abraham to move away from the destruction of the old things cuz his family was Idol worshippers so that's crazy that's very yeah so from Sarah we learning that the plan that God had for Eve we find that Sarah picks it and runs with it and one thing that comes out so strongly is that Sarah is very submissive even in helping us realize The Plan of Salvation And even even in accepting that her name changes from SAR Sara isn't it it means she was ready uh to be a collabor collabor with the Lord isn't it to ensuring that the Plan of Salvation comes to to fruition can I add something when you say she was submissive uh first Peter I think 3:5 says how Sarah called her husband law you know her master how many of us call our husbands my okay yeah yeah so she was submissive she was really submissive looking at the background which their background which you have already mentioned she came from an adult adulter background isn't it where they were worshiping so many gods isn't it and when the Lord calls them and I think she understood her Mission because for God to bless you and bring you sometimes he'll have to separate you and she did not refuse to accept this because I remember in our last week's lesson study where the Lord talks about the rule of Engagement the rule of Engagement in bringing salvation Sarah understood it and the idol worship that was there could could have actually hindered even the child that was supposed to be born so they actually she actually gave her husband the support and they moved from that place isn't it and me and you are saved because of that suppos she refused to move we all know what happened to we she's a mother of all Nations yeah she's a mother of all Nation because she accepted to move isn't it what about her beauty what can we say about now they have finally accepted to move yes Grace okay apparently this woman is so pretty that she even made her husband insecure so that so much so that when they went to Egypt he's like okay just tell them that you're my sister okay no we technically our brother and sister like like just tell them that yeah isn't it yeah but you see still had to maintain his objective of saving mankind isn't it and you find the Lord intervenes isn't it and out of that that take us to the next point the Lord still blesses blesses them isn't it mistake when we make a mistake when the Lord has destined us for something even because she could have spoken and I'm his wife isn't it but she she played along yeah she's played along I don't I think because of the fact that Elizabeth shared that they were half sister you sometimes you can be in that state your husband has spoken I'm supposed to be actually this is the relative truth but how do we go about this you see but finally the Lord blesses them because they had a mission to save the man the mankind isn't it and finally we find that Pharaoh say why have you done this please do people get out of my house and and they do not only live but there's a blessings that comes with it they live with more wealth yes so that the work should should be done yeah yeah very very much and something that comes out we H the promise that the Lord had given them the promise that finally a man kind will be saved it is coming through through them and Sarah plays a very important role I remember we mention when she's told that she'll give birth at such a time as this next year she really laughed at it but I believe in her heart she still had that desire and it is very typical of us women sometimes we really want something to be done to us and we look at how will it even happen yeah distrust God yeah yes Grace you have something on that yeah I think just to to expound on what you've just said like I like the way one thing I've gotten from the story is that like even though we have our weaknesses I mean Sarah had weaknesses like that example that you've given she was told that she was going to have a child she was like okay yeah right and also she's the one who started the whole Hagar Fiasco yeah but but still like instead of this despite of all these things MH I'm pretty sure that deep down she really wanted to follow God because God still used her in a very very Mighty way so I guess that goes to show us that even though we are humans we are Fallen we have character traits that are quite questionable but as long as we are you know ladies after God's Own hearten he's more than willing to use us thank you yes uh to just add on that we've seen that there's there was distrust with Eve in last week's Bible study and there's also distrust with Sarah because she did not believe that God was actually going to give her a son at her old age so I feel that as Daughters of God we are not we're not going to not uh have this temp this disbelief in him but all we have to do is because we are Daughters of God we should emphasize that even if we don't understand how it's going to happen knows why he said that and he's not a that will lie because his timing is always the best so if it's not going to happen in our timing it is going to happen when he wants it to happen for his will to be done thank you thank you so much and even as we come to the conclusion of our today's study about Sister Sarah the beautiful Sarah one thing is sure that for the devil can expose ladies to shame but the Lord has promised to give a double portion of blessing and blessed a generation from Sarah and Abraham we not looking forward to see them in the New Jerusalem I want to welcome you into our next week's study even as we look more about other ladies or Daughters of God in the daughters of God kibon and see you next week amen amen so to wind it up we'll have a closing prayer from Sister aen let's pray dear heavenly father we thank you Lord for the story of Sarah we thank you mighty king of glory for the lessons that you've drawn from it Almighty king of glory that father Lord in each and everything that we do we continue to trust in you Almighty father and we continue to believe that father Lord You're Going to fulfill that which you have placed in our hearts oh God and you're going to fulfill Almighty father that which you you want to accomplish in our lives oh God we ask that you may continue walking with us oh Lord as your daughters we pray that we we may dra drawing other men closer to you oh Lord in each and everything that that we do in our actions in our speech Almighty father I pray that you may guide us in Jesus name we pray amen

[114.9s] about Sarah something that stands out
[117.4s] about her as you're reading you can
[119.5s] share with
[120.4s] us um I'll start I like that um she was
[125.8s] there giving companionship to her
[129.8s] husband
[131.6s] Abraham you know normally we are told
[134.1s] about Abraham and how he was a man of
[136.7s] Faith but
[138.2s] remember Abraham had been with Sarah for
[141.2s] a long time from the time before they
[144.1s] even changed their names from Sarai to
[147.4s] Abram and they walked together
[150.9s] uh for a long time so I can say she was
[153.3s] a very good companion who made her
[156.6s] husband to trust in God more wow yes
[161.8s] that's that's a challenge yes um elen
[165.4s] yeah I can say that uh Sarah was real
[168.6s] yeah uh in her reactions in in her
[172.0s] actions she was she was human she from
[175.4s] from her story you see the the human
[177.4s] nature in her where when when she had
[179.5s] that
[180.7s] they're going to Bear children in their
[182.2s] old age she she
[185.8s] laughed like I'm I'm this old how am how
[188.7s] am I going to to give birth to a child
[190.6s] so for me she she was she was so real
[193.6s] yeah sister Elizabeth yeah uh from The
[197.4s] Book of Genesis 20:2 yeah uh Sarah was
[201.5s] actually um a relative of
[206.0s] Abraham yeah we are told that Sarah and
[208.6s] her husband Abraham shared a common
[211.6s] parentage for Sarah was Abraham's half
[214.9s] sister by his father Tera yeah thank
[219.6s] you I like the way um I mean Sarah was
[224.1s] obedient hey she was so obedient she
[228.2s] left you know the book says that um the
[230.9s] message of God came to Abraham and of
[233.6s] course it's from the Bible get thee out
[235.8s] of thy country she left her country mhm
[240.3s] and that's easy right yeah I know it's
[243.3s] not and from thy Kindred she left her
[247.2s] family and from thy father's house and
[250.1s] to a land I will show thee you're
[253.2s] sending there's one thing following your
[255.0s] husband yeah to
[258.0s] Tania but there's another one for him to
[260.2s] say I don't know where I'm
[262.8s] going you're like my friend you just go
[266.5s] because it's I mean that's crazy so she
[270.2s] was a woman of Faith yeah I mean and and
[273.3s] they they were starting a fresh new
[275.2s] faith and God wanted Abraham to move
[277.4s] away from the destruction of the old
[280.0s] things cuz his family was Idol
[281.9s] worshippers so that's crazy that's very
[285.8s] yeah so from Sarah we learning that the
[289.2s] plan that God had for Eve we find that
[291.5s] Sarah picks it and runs with it and one
[294.0s] thing that comes out so strongly is that
[296.2s] Sarah is very submissive even in helping
[298.9s] us realize The Plan of Salvation And
[302.9s] even even in accepting that her name
[305.2s] changes from SAR Sara isn't it it means
[309.0s] she was ready uh to be a collabor
[311.8s] collabor with the Lord isn't it to
[314.2s] ensuring that the Plan of Salvation
[315.9s] comes to to fruition can I add something
[318.4s] when you say she was submissive uh first
[320.6s] Peter I think 3:5 says how Sarah called
[323.1s] her husband law you know her master how
[327.6s] many of us call our husbands my
[332.4s] okay yeah yeah so she was submissive she
[334.7s] was really submissive looking at the
[337.2s] background which their background which
[339.3s] you have already mentioned she came from
[340.9s] an adult adulter background isn't it
[344.7s] where they were worshiping so many gods
[346.5s] isn't it and when the Lord calls them
[349.3s] and I think she understood her Mission
[352.2s] because for God to bless you and bring
[354.3s] you sometimes he'll have to separate you
[356.5s] and she did not refuse to accept this
[359.3s] because I remember in our last week's
[361.7s] lesson study where the Lord talks about
[363.9s] the rule of Engagement the rule of
[366.0s] Engagement in bringing salvation Sarah
[368.4s] understood it and the idol worship that
[370.4s] was there could could have actually
[372.1s] hindered even the child that was
[373.8s] supposed to be born so they actually she
[376.4s] actually gave her husband the support
[378.6s] and they moved from that place isn't it
[381.5s] and me and you are saved because of that
[384.8s] suppos she refused to
[387.2s] move we all know what happened to we
[390.1s] she's a mother of all Nations yeah she's
[391.6s] a mother of all Nation because she
[393.3s] accepted to move isn't it what about her
[395.6s] beauty what can we say about now they
[398.0s] have finally accepted to move yes Grace
[401.2s] okay apparently this woman is so pretty
[403.0s] that she even made her husband insecure
[405.6s] so that so much so that when they went
[407.7s] to Egypt he's like okay just tell them
[410.5s] that you're my sister okay no we
[412.4s] technically our brother and sister like
[414.7s] like just tell them
[416.7s] that yeah isn't it yeah but you see
[419.8s] still had to maintain his objective of
[422.3s] saving mankind isn't it and you find the
[424.4s] Lord intervenes isn't it and out of that
[427.3s] that take us to the next point the Lord
[428.8s] still blesses blesses them isn't it
[431.9s] mistake when we make a mistake when the
[433.6s] Lord has destined us for something even
[436.5s] because she could have spoken and I'm
[438.2s] his wife isn't it but she she played
[441.5s] along yeah she's played along I don't I
[444.3s] think because of the fact that Elizabeth
[445.8s] shared that they were half sister you
[447.6s] sometimes you can be in that state your
[449.1s] husband has spoken I'm supposed to be
[451.2s] actually this is the relative truth but
[454.0s] how do we go about this you see but
[456.6s] finally the Lord blesses them because
[458.4s] they had a mission to save the man the
[462.0s] mankind isn't it and finally we find
[464.2s] that Pharaoh say why have you done this
[466.1s] please do people get out of my house and
[468.3s] and they do not only live but there's a
[470.9s] blessings that comes with it they live
[472.4s] with more wealth yes so that the work
[475.4s] should should be done yeah yeah very
[478.3s] very much and something that comes out
[481.1s] we H the promise that the Lord had given
[484.4s] them the promise that finally a man kind
[487.8s] will be saved it is coming through
[490.3s] through them and Sarah plays a very
[491.9s] important role I remember we mention
[494.5s] when she's told that she'll give birth
[497.2s] at such a time as this next year she
[500.7s] really laughed at it but I believe in
[503.5s] her heart she still had that desire and
[506.0s] it is very typical of us women sometimes
[508.3s] we really want something to be done to
[510.0s] us and we look at how will it even
[512.6s] happen yeah distrust God yeah yes Grace
[515.6s] you have something on that yeah I think
[517.6s] just to to expound on what you've just
[519.6s] said like I like the way one thing I've
[522.1s] gotten from the story is that like even
[525.2s] though we have our weaknesses I mean
[526.4s] Sarah had weaknesses like that example
[529.2s] that you've given she was told that she
[530.6s] was going to have a child she was like
[532.1s] okay yeah right and also she's the one
[534.0s] who started the whole Hagar Fiasco yeah
[536.8s] but but still like instead of this
[540.0s] despite of all these things MH I'm
[542.7s] pretty sure that deep down she really
[544.4s] wanted to follow God because God still
[546.2s] used her in a very very Mighty way so I
[549.3s] guess that goes to show us that even
[551.2s] though we are humans we are Fallen we
[553.2s] have character traits that are quite
[556.0s] questionable but as long as we are you
[559.3s] know ladies after God's Own hearten he's
[561.6s] more than willing to use us thank you
[564.0s] yes uh to just add on that we've seen
[566.2s] that there's there was distrust with Eve
[568.8s] in last week's Bible study and there's
[571.7s] also distrust with Sarah because she did
[574.9s] not believe that God was actually going
[577.8s] to give her a son at her old age so I
[580.8s] feel that as Daughters of God we are not
[584.8s] we're not going
[586.1s] to not uh have this temp this disbelief
[591.1s] in him but all we have to do is because
[593.6s] we are Daughters of God we should
[596.1s] emphasize that even if we don't
[598.3s] understand how it's going to happen
[600.3s] knows why he said that and he's not a
[603.6s] that will lie because his timing is
[606.2s] always the best so if it's not going to
[607.8s] happen in our timing it is going to
[610.2s] happen when he wants it to happen for
[612.8s] his will to be done thank you thank you
[614.9s] so much and even as we come to the
[616.3s] conclusion of our today's study about
[618.8s] Sister Sarah the beautiful Sarah one
[621.2s] thing is sure that for the devil can
[623.8s] expose ladies to shame but the Lord has
[626.7s] promised to give a double portion of
[628.9s] blessing and
[631.3s] blessed a generation from Sarah and
[634.1s] Abraham we not looking forward to see
[636.9s] them in the New
[638.8s] Jerusalem I want to welcome you into our
[641.9s] next week's study even as we look more
[645.1s] about other ladies or Daughters of God
[647.8s] in the daughters of God kibon and see
[651.6s] you next week amen amen so to wind it up
[655.6s] we'll have a closing prayer from Sister
