FULL TRANSCRIPT:
Happy Sabbath church. I want to take this opportunity to say welcome to all of you uh and those who are watching us uh through various social media platforms. Want to thank God for the week and uh just uh a point in the introduction to put things right. Um, Pastor Combe is in charge of evangelism coordination, personal ministries, Sabbath school, AMR, Office of Adventist Mission, and right now we have Adventist Men Ministries. Thank you so much. I want to thank God for those who have been uh joining us uh here during the week but also those who have been following us uh online. I believe that the Lord has been with us and I want to ask us to close our eyes in prayer so that we can one more time invite the presence of God here in our midst. Father God in heaven, thank you so much. Thank you for the privilege to be in your holy presence. Father, we first and foremost are cognizant that we as sinners fallen short of your glory. Forgive us, Lord, and cleanse us from all unrighteousness with the most precious and powerful blood of Jesus Christ. I pray that you'll forgive me my sins, that you'll hide me beneath the cross of Jesus. And I pray that your presence will be in this congregation today, even as you speak unto us through the power of the Holy Spirit. I pray that you sank from my brain cells, touch my lips and my tongue and fill my mouth with the abundance of your word. May we hear you speak to us today one more time for this is our prayer in Jesus name. Amen. Uh this morning our topic is a very interesting topic and it is a question that you ought to answer it yourself before it is too late. And the question is is your name written in heaven? And we will read one more time the passage of scripture that has been read Luke chapter 10 and verse 17 going downwards but I will read only 17 and verse 20. And the 70 returned again with joy saying Lord even the devils the devils are subject unto us through your name. And then Jesus concludes in response by saying, "However, do not rejoice that the spirit submit to you, but rejoice that your names are written in heaven." It is the concern and desire of all of us. It is the concern of every believer in Jesus that after following Jesus all your life, after trusting in him and keeping the Sabbath and returning a faithful tithe, after singing in the choir, after preaching the good news of the gospel to the world, when he come the second time, your name may be in the books of heaven. Praise be to God. Someone captured this thought in the song number 216 says when the trumpet of the Lord shall sound and the time shall be no more and the morning breaks eternal bright and fair when the saved of earth shall gather over on the other shore and the roll is called up yonder. I'll be there when the roll is called up yonder. I'll be there when the roll is called up yonder. Is it your desire that your name be found in the roles of heaven? And I want to give you a brief a brief background of the book of Luke that gives us this very uh important uh message. The book of Luke is written by none other than Luke, Dr. Luke. He he was a physician. I happen to have had the privilege to stumble upon a a biography, a book that talks about Dr. Luke. That is an amazing story to read. How he he was uh serving people as a physician. You could come to him to his office and you are talking about your stomach and your legs and your backbone and your headache and he begins to search on your background and and and and search on your life until he he pinpoints where the problem is says you don't need an injection let us pray and then he prays for you and gives you some counelss and then you go home and then you do what he has said and you get you get well he was a wonderful amazing physician I don't have time to tell you uh more details about how he finally came to get in touch with Paul and the disciples of Jesus and write this book of Luke. But he was in his orchard someday and then there was an earthquake and then there was an eclipse of the sun and as a scientist he went into the to the archives to see whether there was anything about this written on this day and he discovered there was no records about an eclipse of the sun or an earthquake on that day and he began to search why has this happened. He began to travel until he came to Jerusalem until he met the disciples of Jesus who narrated to him these stories and then he captured them. He wrote the book of Luke. He is the author. It is said that this book could have been written between 5 uh9 through uh 63 while others hold the view that maybe it was written between 70 and 80 AD. Who are the recipients of the book of Luke? Who is his audience? The gospel is specifically directed to someone called Theophilus. And the word Theophilus is a Greek word which means one who loves God. Anyone loves God in the congregation? Anyone loves God in the congregation? Can I hear an amen from someone who loves God in the congregation? So this book is written for you. It is written to someone who loves God. And this this doctor captures this pregnant thought in his writing. I want you to notice that no other writer of the gospel captures this particular discussion, this particular thought, this particular statement made by Jesus that it is one thing actually to serve God and it is another thing to have your name written and retained in the book of life and therefore it is a book of interest to It is a thought worthy considering today that while you labor for the master on a dayto-day basis, the question remains, is your name written in the books of heaven? Ask your neighbor, is your name written in heaven? Ask your neighbor, is your name written? So Jesus says, "Not withstanding in this, rejoice not that the spirits are subject unto you, but rather rejoice because your names are written in heaven." Praise be to God. Though it is an honor to work miracles, it is an honor to pray and see evil spirits leave a demon possessed person. It's an honor. You feel honored. You feel happy to lay your hands on the sick and they get well. It's an honor to preach and you see souls saved into the kingdom. People coming to give their hearts to Jesus. But he says not withstanding that. Don't rejoice because of that because that can happen here on earth not recognized in heaven. He says rejoice because your name is written in heaven. Don't thump your chest because of the accomplishments you have. Don't thump your chest because of the great things you do for the Lord. Because remember one day he said many will come and they will say we prophesied in your name and we worked miracles in your name and he will tell them on their faces I didn't know you. So we get something to help us from Paul. What can help us then? Be sure that our names are in the book of life. Philippians 3:3-14. It says, "Brethren, I count not myself to have apprehended, but this one thing I do, forgetting those things which are behind me, and reaching forth unto those things which are before me, I press towards the mark for the prize of the high calling of God in Christ Jesus." He says what you're supposed to do is to forget the things which are behind you and press forward towards the mark, the goal, the crown. Prepare yourself, your heart, your mind. Prepare for the second coming of Jesus and prepare for the kingdom of heaven. Do all you can push aside every distraction and have your mind focused on one thing, Jesus and Jesus alone, the alpha and the finisher of your faith. And someone captures these words in the song number 631 and says, I am pressing on on the upward way. New heights I'm gaining every day. still praying as I onward bound. Lord, plant my feet on higher ground. Says, "My heart has no desire to stay where doubts arise and fears dismay. Though some may dwell, where these abound, my prayer, my aim is higher ground." He says, "I want to live above the world. Those such as doubts at me are hard. For faith has caught the joyful sound, the song of saints on higher ground. So the outright of the song says, "Put your minds on the things above." Be preoccupied by the things of heaven, spiritual things, your relationship with Jesus and how you walk before him as a steward. Just be keen to observe and to do all that he says. Remain focused to the goal because he is coming soon. Or Paul says, I keep pressing forward. As someone who runs arrest, he says, I keep pressing forward for the crown that is coming ahead of me. In the book of Philippians chapter 2:12, he as something we need to consider. says, "Wherefore, my beloved, as you have always obeyed, not as in my presence only, but now much more in my absence, work out your own salvation with fear and trembling." Simply to mean you got a role to play in your salvation. There's something you need to do and you got to do it yourself. Your father cannot do it for you. Your mother won't do it for you. Your wife won't do it for you. You have a role to play in your salvation. Yes. No one can believe Jesus for you. No one can be faithful as a steward on your behalf. You have a role to play as a steward. Tell your neighbor you have a role to play. You got to work out your own salvation with fear and trembling. But time is running out because there is a crown of God of glory, a crown of gold for each one of us. Do you yearn to have your crown? Do you desire to have your crown? Nothing can equate the crown. Nothing can be as good as this crown. It's a crown of glory that fears not. And Paul say these words in the book of 2 Timothy 4:7 and verse 8. I have fought the good fight. I have finished the rest. I have kept the faith. Now there is in store for me the crown of righteousness which the Lord, the righteous judge, will award to me on that day. Ladies and gentlemen, I have good news for you this morning. There's a crown of glory awaiting you at the end of the journey. After your sacrifices, after your commitment, after you're coming to church, after you're keeping the Sabbath, after turning a faithful tithe, after singing in the choir, after preaching the gospel, there is a crown of glory awaiting you. Tell your neighbor, don't give up. Don't give up. Don't give up. Don't give up. Don't give up. Jesus himself will put and place the crown on your head himself. I cannot wait for that day. Jesus calls my name and I jump forward and he picks the crown and puts it on my head. Will you receive your crown? But the question is, are there books in heaven? And the answer is yes. I want to talk about two books. The first one is the book of remembrance. Malachi 3:16. Then they that fear the Lord spake often one to another. And the Lord hearkened and heard it. And a book of remembrance was written before him for them that fear the Lord and that thought upon his name. A book of remembrance and they shall be mine, says the Lord of hosts. In that day when I make up my jewels and I will spare them as a man spares his own son that serves him as they began to speak those who serve the Lord. A book of remembrance was open. This book is a book that records everything that you do, every good thing that you do. I had someone here promoting camp offering. That offering you will give towards the camp meetings will not be in vain. It is recorded in heaven and God will come and reward you for that. Praise be to God. That tithe you return every Sabbath is faithfully recorded in heaven. Every word of kindness, every word of encouragement, every act of charity to the needy is registered in the book of remembrance so that one day you can be rewarded for that. God is a just rewarder. There's nothing you will do. He will take for granted. There has to be a book to record all that you you do so that God when he comes, he can recompense and reward you. That's why Jesus says, "I come quickly with a reward in my hands. to give everyone according to what you have done. But then there's another book, the book of life. This is a book for all those who will be saved. Those who will inherit the kingdom, their names are in this book. Revelation 20 and verse 12 and 13. They saw the dead, small and great, standing before God. And books were opened, and another book was opened, which is the book of life. And the dead were judged according to their works by the things which were written in the books. Then death and hes were cast into the lake of fire. This is the second death. And anyone not found written in the book of life was cast into the lake of fire. Is your name written in the book of life? For anyone not found in that book will not escape the flames of the lake of fire. Death and hate will be cast there. The false prophet will be cast there. and the beast will be cast there. All sinners will be cast there. All those whose names are not written in the book of life will be cast into the flames of fire. The question is, will your name be found in the book of life? And so in the next remaining minutes, I want to answer the question then. How can my name be finally recorded in the book of life? What ought I to do, ladies and gentlemen? What must I do now for me to be sure my name is in the book of life? And I want to take you through some few steps and then I will finish. Yes, your name can be and your name will be registered in the book of life. When you believe in Jesus as Lord and Savior of your life, Bible says in John chapter 1 verse 12, "But as many as received him, to them gave he the power to become the sons of God to them that believe in his name." All those who confess Jesus is Lord. Jesus is my savior. All those who believe he is the son of God. Who believe he died for them. Who believe he came to give us a chance to be saved forever. Who believe in his name. Their names are written in the book of life. Praise be to God. And the question is, do you believe in Jesus as Lord and Savior? John 3:16, for God so loved the world and gave his only begotten son that whosoever believes in him should not perish. You only have to believe. Tell your neighbor, you have to believe. You have to believe. You have to believe. You must believe. It's one thing to be in church. It's another to believe in Jesus. It's one thing even to return a tribe. It's another to believe in Jesus. It's one thing to sing in the choir is another to believe in Jesus. It's another to come to church every Sabbath. It's another to believe in Jesus. And the question is, do you believe in Jesus as your Lord and Savior? When he becomes Lord, then he begins to command you from inside. It tells you how you need to dress, how you need to speak, what you should eat, what music to listen, what friends to walk with, and how to speak. When he is Lord, he orders your life. The question is, is Jesus your Lord and Savior? The Bible says in 1 John 5:12, "And this is the testimony that God has given us eternal life." And this life is in his son. Whoever has the son has life. Whoever does not have the son of God does not have life. And so I p this question to you today. Do you have the son? Is Jesus born in your heart? Have you accepted him to be your Lord and Savior? Do you believe in him? He is life, eternal. And those who have him, the Bible says, they have life. And if you don't believe in him, you don't have life. And so this message goes to those who don't believe in Jesus. How will you be saved? How will you have your name in the records of heaven without believing in Jesus? And the question is Paul is asking how then will you be saved if you neglect such a great salvation. Believe in Jesus ladies and gentlemen. Receive Jesus to be Lord and Savior and you will be automatically a faithful steward. Praise be to God. Nobody will tell you a tenth is a faithful tithe. Nobody will question you on how to be faithful to him. He will be doing everything inside you because the Bible says for both to will and to do. It is God. It is God both to will and to do of his good pleasure. Point number two, how to ensure your name is in the book of life. This book is for those whose sins have been forgiven. Psalms 32:1 and verse two. The servant of God says, "Blessed is he, whose transgression is forgiven, whose sin is covered. Blessed is the man unto whom the Lord impute not iniquity, and in whose spirit there is no guile." It's one thing to believe in Jesus and give him your heart as Lord and Savior. It's another thing now to confess your sins now to surrender your life to him and ask Jesus and his blood to wash you. We are washed by the blood of Jesus. We are cleansed by the blood of Jesus. It's the blood of Jesus that covers the abundance of our sins. And this is something you do on a dayto-day basis. You confess your sins every minute. Come to God every day and tell him, "Lord, forgive me. I may have sinned to you knowingly or unknowingly. For blessed are those whose sins have been forgiven, whose transgressions have been covered by the blood of Jesus." Jesus died on the cross so that you and I can be forgiven. Every time you confess, the Bible says 1 John 1:9, "If we confess our sin, he is faithful and just to forgive our sin and cleanse us from all unrighteousness." You have a promise of forgiveness. As soon as you repent and confess, I want to repeat this. For you to be forgiven, it take someone to confess. take someone to repent and he says I will forgive you. I will forgive you for you. You have to have your name in the book of life and the name to remain in the book of life. Repent of your sins, confess of your iniquities and come to Jesus and ask him to wash you by his precious blood. Praise be to God. If you say you have no sin, you may go to be a liar. For all have sinned and fallen short of the glory of God, and the wages of sin is death. But the free gift of God is eternal life through Christ Jesus our Lord and Savior. Praise be to God. Point number three, how do I gate my name in the book of life? That book of life, those who are in that book of life, there are those who have chosen to be obedient to God. They have chosen to live by every word of God. Jesus said, "Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that proceedth from the mouth of God." Those who choose to obey him, those who live according to his orders. Those who accept Jesus as Lord, there are many who want Jesus as savior, they don't want him as Lord because they want him as savior. They cry to him every time they're in trouble. But they don't want to obey his commands. Listen to this. 1 Samuel chapter 1 verse 15. Okay. 1 Samuel chapter 15 verse 22 and 23. But I read 22. This is a story of a king of Israel who had just been appointed. His name is King Psalm. And God sent orders. go and kill all the um Amorites. Go and kill all of them. And the king goes to war and he begins to win because Jesus has given him that power to win. And he kills them and he wins. He he he wins. He kills them men and the women and the warriors. He kills them and he's winning. Then he he changed his strategy. Instead of destroying all men and women, young and old, he said in his heart, I will spare the bulls which are fattened and the goats which are good and the sheep which are nice for an offering to the Lord. Is there anything wrong with a good animal for an offering to the Lord? there anything wrong to preserve the foren kto for an offering and so he did that when he came to the king a gag he also said even this one I won't kill him now I want everybody to see that I'm a a mighty warrior in war so he comes back to the prophet Samuel and Samuel comes to him and tells him or asks him have you obeyed the word of the lord and I know you know the answer Yes, I have obeyed the word of the Lord. Have you obeyed the word of the Lord? And answer he said, "Yes, I have obeyed the word of the Lord." Then he says, "Why are you hearing like some cows and some some goats and some sheep are bleeding there? What is that?" He's like, "Oh, oh, prophet, relax. Relax. All is well. I obeyed but I thought God needs an offering. I present the foren one for offering. That's why I brought them here. And the prophet was angered. And then he said these words 1 Samuel 15:22. As the Lord as much delight in burnt offerings and sacrifices as in doing what? As in doing what? Obeying the voice of the Lord. Behold, to obey is better than sacrifice, and to listen is better than the fat of an offering. God requires obedience from us. Those who will be found in the book of life are those who chose the life of obedience obeying what he says to us as stewards. Colossians 6:7 the Bible says be not deceived. God is not mocked. Whatsoever a man saweth that shall he also reap. Whatever you do in the presence of God, God cannot be deceived. He knows when you obey. He knows when you're disobedient. He knows when you are faithful. He knows when you're not faithful. The problem is not how much you put in the envelope. The problem is whether you are faithful. Ask your neighbor, are you faithful? It's not how much you bring, it's how much you have left which you should have brought to the Lord. The question is am I faithful? We cannot mock God. You know you can bring 1 million and yet is not what faithful. The question is are you faithful because stewards are also supposed to be faithful. Tell your neighbor be faithful. Be faithful. Be faithful. 2 Corinthians 9:7. Each of you should give what you have decided in your heart to give not reluctantly and a compulsion for God loves a cheerful giver. Whatever you do to the Lord, it's about your heart. It's about your motive. Are you doing this happily? Are you doing it with joy or you feel like you're under compulsion? When Jesus chose to come and die for us, was he forced? Was he compelled? No. He came joyfully. He was born in a manger, lived with us in this world of sin, and he joyfully gave his life for salvation. Praise be to God. He loves a joyful giver. And that's why Malachi 3:10-11, as much as he requests us to be faithful to him, he also says there's a blessing for faithfulness. He says, "Bring the whole tithe into the house that there may be food in my house. Touch me in thee, says the Lord Almighty, and see if I will not throw open the floodgates of heaven and pour out so much blessing that there will be no room enough to store it." Why is he declaring immense blessings? Because he's asking you to be faithful. He says, "You are not losing when you are faithful. You're not losing when you are giving. You are storing up your treasures in heaven ahead of time so that where your heart shall be and where your treasure is, there your heart shall be also. Point number four, how can you be sure that your name is in the book of heaven? It is the book of those who gave their resources supporting God's work. How much are you willing to sacrifice for those in need, for the poor and for the hungry? Matthew 25:36-37. I was hungry and you gave me meat. I was thirsty, you gave me drink. I was a stranger and you took me in. I was naked and you clothed me. I was sick and you visited me. I was in prison and you came unto me. Then shall the righteous answer him, saying, Lord, when when so we thee and hungered and fed thee, or thirsty, and gave it gave thee drink, then he will say, what you did to the least amongst you, you did it to me. Are you willing to give your resources to help those who are in need? A reward is coming. Point number five, it is for it is for those who have devoted their lives into the service of the Lord. Those who have given their hearts and lives and themselves to serve God. Their names are recorded in the book of heaven in the book of Philippians 4:3. And I entreat thee also true fellow. Help those women which labor with me in the gospel with the clement also and with other my fellow laborers whose names are in the book of life. When you choose to serve the Lord you are enrolling in the books of heaven. When number six, those who are ready to lay down their lives for the sake of Jesus. In the book of Matthew 16:2, Jesus says, "Whosoever want to save their life will lose it. Whosoever loses their life for me will find it." Have you come to a place where you feel so much in love with Jesus that you're willing to die for him? Have you come to a place in your spiritual journey where you have surrendered your life fully to Jesus and you are willing to pay the ultimate sacrifice? He said those who are willing to lose their lives for me will save their lives but those who want to save their lives they will lose it. How much are you willing to give yourselves to Jesus? Are you willing to give your heart, your body, your family, your resources, your job, and everything you have for Jesus? If you can't give your money to Jesus, will you give your life to Jesus? That is the question. Listen to this. Revelation 12:1. And they overcame him by the blood of the lamb and by the word of their testimony. and they loved in all their lives unto death. Those who fall in love with Jesus, they see nothingness in this life. Like Solomon, the wisest man who ever lived, they see vanity in life. There's nothing on in this life to cling on to. They only cling on to Jesus and doing the will of God with all their lives. And when they choose to obey, they choose to obey fully. Remember when they wanted to touch on Daniel, they said, "We cannot get him unless it is something about his God." Why? They knew Daniel committed fully to God. He was willing to die for his God. Ask your neighbor, are you willing to die for God? There are many people in history who have paid ultimate sacrifice for their salvation. There are men like John Wickliffe, like John Hush. He was burnt on the state. And as they hung him on a stick, tied him with ropes, they still gave him one more chance to recount his faith. Said, "H, you can leave. you don't have to die. Can you denounce Jesus? And who's in response told them no I cannot recant and I cannot denounce Jesus. Him who could not hold on to the throne in heaven who could not cling to being God chose to humble himself come down and carry a cross for me. He who accepted to be hanged on a cross and nailed with those rusted Roman nails. Who accepted to die for me, I am also willing to die for him. And they lit the fire and they burnt him. And as H was dying, he was singing this song. Jesus, son of David, have mercy on me. Jesus, son of David, have mercy on me. I don't have enough time to tell the story of the wildernesses who were thrown over the mountains and crashed over the rocks. But they clung unto Jesus unto death. They knew whom they had believed in and they were not going to quit their faith because they were sure their names are in the books of heaven. Only when you're sure that your name is in the books of heaven can you make such a decision to even pay the ultimate sacrifice. And this church, not long from now, some of us will be called to pay the ultimate sacrifice. And the question is, will you be willing to do that for Jesus? when you are told not to go to church on Sabbath and when it is crime a crime a crime to obey God it's a crime to call upon the name of Jesus will you stand is the question two things before I finish we learn from Paul as he says I have fought a good fight I have finished the race and I know now a crown is waiting for me it is like he says there are two things you need to take notice of number one remain in the until the end. Winners don't quit and quitters don't win. We have not been promised a safe journey, but we have been promised a safe arrival. Praise be to God. We shall we shall reach home at last. This is the message from Paul. But point number two, it's like Paul says, while you are in it, while you are on it, Colossians 6:9, let us not grow weary in doing good. For in due season, we will reap if we do not faint. We may reap now. Jesus said, "Those who have left everything for me, they will get a 100fold here. You may reap now but then he says at the end of the day they will inherit the kingdom of heaven. Praise be to God. Don't grow weary in doing good. Some of us used to be faithful as stewards. They have given up. They used to sing in the choir. They are pulled out. They used to come early to church on Sabbath. They are now coming late. They are giving up. Paul says don't grow weary in doing good. A reward is coming for you. Praise be to God. Point number two. Paul says, he seems to be saying, as you keep on keeping on, fix your eyes on Jesus. Don't lose focus of Jesus. Hebrews 12:2, looking unto Jesus, the out and the finish of our faith, who for the joy that was set before us or before him, endure the cross, despising the shame, and he sat down at the n at the right hand of the throne of God. Fix your eyes unto Jesus. It is him who came down from heaven to come and save you. It is him who has given you a new leaves of life. He is the way and the truth and the life for you to heaven. Fix your eyes onto Jesus, the author and the finisher of our faith. Fix your eyes onto Jesus because he is the one who gives you the power to overcome. For we are more than conquerors through Christ Jesus. And Paul says, Philippians 4:13, I can do all things through Christ Jesus, my Lord. Praise be to God. Fix your Tell your neighbor, fix your eyes onto Jesus. You cannot be a faithful steward unless your eyes are fixed on Jesus and see how he gives himself. I want to finish this with a small story. One day I was in a camp meeting. I know in one month you'll be in a meeting here. It was a Thursday and the guest speaker in my car meeting invites the host pastor for a visation program. Is that what happens? The guest speaker invites the host pastor for visation. Does that happen here? I say what? How come the guest speaker is inviting the host pastor for a visitation to a family? Is it not upside down? Something told me in my heart, "Relax, relax, relax. Don't quarrel." So I followed 6:00 p.m. 7:00 p.m. We are in this house of this church member and there were many of us with elders, some deacons. And then the first daughter of the family is asked to come to the sitting room and we are given chairs to sit in a carve and she sits there. Then they ask her questions. Do you know this? Say yes I know this. I know this one. Do you know this? Yes, I know this one. You know this. Yeah, I know this one. You know this. He's my pastor. Then I was wondering and asking myself, what kind of interview is this? How do you ask a church member who comes to church every Sabbath whether she knows a pastor? I also kept that in my heart. I didn't know what was going on. All of a sudden, one of them said, "Hey, she cannot sit any longer. Take her to her bedroom." Then she's taken to her bedroom. She's taken helped. Then the parents say, "Pastor, our daughter has been calling for you. Now that you're here, go and talk to her in the bedroom." 7:30 p.m. Everybody's in the sitting room. Pastor, go and talk to her in the bedroom. Because I was with the guest speaker, I said, "Pastor, two are better than one. Let's go." So I discovered very quickly that the whole of this ceremony was for the pastor and I didn't know. So we went to the room. When we entered the room, she was sleeping on her bed. She sat. Then she began talking. Pastor welcome. We were two pastors talking to one. Pastor welcome. I thank you very much. We had that you are calling for me. Uh why are you calling for me? you know where to find me. You you I'm in church every Sabbath. Why are you calling for me? I was trying to be humorous to see if I can see a smile, but she had a serious face. Hey, pastor, I've been calling for you. Where did you call? Where did you look for me? Hey, pastor. Okay. What can I do for you? Then she asked me a question. Do you think I'm okay? Okay. Help me to answer that question. Do you think I'm okay? Help me to answer that question. I look at I say yes yes yes you're okay. Then she says I have already chosen my photograph. I have already chosen my clothes to wear in that suitcase. Choosing a photograph and clothes I didn't like that topic. Said now what can we do for you? Said I want to be baptized. Okay, that's that's a good thing. That's a good thing. Um uh yes we can baptize you but how come? You mean you have not been baptized? The pastor was baptized many years ago but since then until now so many things have happened. Now listen to this and God has told me unless I am baptized I cannot see the kingdom of heaven. How do you behave when you talk to someone who talks to God directly? What do you do when the one talking to you tells you God has told me? What do you do? God, it's 8:00 p.m. baptism. Okay. Okay. Okay. All right. All right. All right. In the Bible, we have rebaptism. We will we can do rebaptism. And now that you have requested for that uh we will do that um the first thing tomorrow morning uh on Friday come meeting week or we can do it on Sabbath. He said no no no pass do it now said no no what we can do because now you know it's hard to find water in that area there's no lake there's no river the Indian Ocean is far and there's no pool of water and there was no tank of water no water you you know you reasoning no right now because it's at night and and because there's no water around h what the only you can do early tomorrow morning we will be we'll begin with your rebaptism said pastor uh tomorrow will be too late. So I turn to my fellow pastor, hey pastor, say something. You can't be here and you're keeping quiet. You came to help me here. Hey pastor, I mean my sister, what the pastor is saying, you know the only way we can do this, we can do it tomorrow. And the young lady said, "Pastor, if you are not willing to baptize me now, you can leave. I will not talk to you again." the wrong person. Oh no no no I remembered you know in this church we the pastor cannot make a decision. It is the the church board and they have elders there give us a minute to go and console went back to the sitting room and when we entered the sitting room the entire team stood in attention stood up. The question was what has he said? Okay sit relax. She has said she wants to be baptized now. Okay. So the first question is everybody lift it up. Second question when? Tomorrow said but but she has said she has cautioned us tomorrow. She wants to baptize now. The mother said, "Okay, okay. So, baptism is tomorrow." I said, "Okay, now relax. Let's take the report. This is a collective report." We went back this to the room and when she saw us back, she sat again on her bed. Okay, pastor. Will you baptize me? Said, "No, I have good news. the entire team has accepted your rebaptism. The first thing tomorrow morning is your rebaptism. And she looked at me and said, "Pastor, tomorrow will be too late." Then she sat up again. You want to sing? Said, "Yes." Then he said, "Sing for me the song which says Narudi, I've wandered away from God." So when she said in the contents there's no title. So I went quickly. Then I said no no. As we were talking our voices were heard in the sitting room. So another lady came. What is the problem? And she wants a song which says Narudi. and she knew where the song could be found. I'm happy the song has got five stanzas. I've wandered away from God. Can we sing that song? Just the first and the last verse as I finish. I've wandered away from God. Now I'm coming home. As we sing that song, put your feet into our shoes. Let these words be the prayer of your heart. I've wandered away as a steward. Wandered away as a Christian. I've been wayward in my ways. But now I am coming home. The first and the last stands. I've wondered far away from home. Now I'm coming home. The parts of sin too long have drawn. Blood and coming home. Coming home. Coming home. Never more to roll. Open wide thy arms of love. Lord I'm coming home. Thank you. I'm so happy that that song has got five stanzas. As we sang the first stanza, my eyes were glued into her eyes. I could see some brightening in her face, shining light in her face like she was forcing a smile out as a son. I've wandered away from God now. I'm coming home. The fifth stanza after finishing singing that song. These are the words that she spoke and now I feel that I am close to Jesus. And so we prayed and then she went back to sleep and we left. When we came to the sitting room they stood again in attention. They said so what is the way forward? said, "No, there's nothing we can do. Let's let's meet tomorrow." Then the parents said, "Pastor, you're not leaving. You will sleep here today because when she wakes up, she will call on your name. Sleep here. We don't sleep just anywhere anyhow." I said, "No, I'm going home." I was now a little upset because of the whole scenario. She had asked for her pastor many days ago. Then they said, "Now, because you are leaving, you are insisting to leave, you have to write a letter. When she wakes up, we don't talk to her. I give her your letter. Okay, I went to school. Give me the letter. The the characters. Give me katas. My dear sister in the Lord. My prayer is that God sustains you until we meet you in the morning and witness your rebirth and your rebaptism. May God sustain you. May God heal you. May God bless you in the name of Jesus. yours in the vineyard and I signed it as if it would be taken to the post office left it with them said okay we are going now left went home went to my house but the whole of this scenario is playing in my mouth why how why they why didn't they tell me earlier slept I don't know whether I slept 4:00 a.m. in the morning and the Holy Spirit is waking me up. I says, "You can't sleep now. You got to wake up and pray." So I woke up in the morning and I knelt down and I was praying, "Oh Lord, in the name of Jesus, please sustain your daughter. Preserve her life." I prayed, wrestling between life and death. And when I said amen and rose on my knees, I felt like I have lost the battle. Lying on my bed, I receive a phone call. The first earliest phone call in my life from my elder. Pastor, how are you? Say, I'm fine, elder. How are you? I'm fine. Oh, do you remember the girl we prayed for yesterday? And yes, tell me about it. She has left us. So, Friday morning, we go there and I'm keen to know whether she read my letter. So, as I enter into the gate, this lady comes, she's crying, Then I go, but I'm keen. I want to know the story. So what happened? And I'm told at exactly 3:00 a.m. she woke up and she called for the pastor. There was no pastor. One day you will call for the pastor. There will be no pastor. Call for the pastor now when it can be found. They said they brought the letter to her. So she read the letter, "My dear sister, in the name of Jesus, and after finishing reading the letter, she threw it away and said, it will be too late." She called her mother to come and help her pray. The mother came, they began to pray. She realized the mother cannot continue with prayer in that atmosphere. and she knelt down and prayed until she slept. One day the last song will be sung. The question is, will your heart be all right? One day the last prayer will be done. The question is, will your heart be all right? One day the last appeal will be made and the question remains, will your heart be all right? How have you prepared yourself for the kingdom? Jesus is coming. Remember the last question she's asking for? Heaven. Shall we stand? Shall we stand? I remember the words of Jesus. He says, "Here are those who are faithful lady things. Enter ye into unto the kingdom of your father prepared for you since the laying of the foundations of the earth." As we sing the closing song, if it is your desire this afternoon, this morning, you want to make a a a unique choice, you want to make a a strange decision today, you want to say, "Lord, today I want to surrender fully to you. I want to cling to you and I will not let you go anymore." as we sing that song. If that is your prayer, I will make an appeal at the end from God. Now I'm coming home the path of sin too long of joy. Lord I'm coming home. Coming home. Coming home. Ever more to roy of love. Lord preedious. Now I'm coming home. I now repent with a tease. Lord, I'm coming home. Coming home. Coming home. Ever more to roll. Oh, thy arms of love. Lord, I'm coming home. I'm tired of seeing and streng Lord. Now I'm coming home. I'll trust thy love. Believe thy word. Lord, I'm coming home. Coming home. Coming home. Ever more to go. Oh w the arms of love. Lord I as we sing the last song. The last verse. As you sing the last verse and you feel you need to recommit your life to Jesus, you feel you need to surrender one more time to Jesus. I want to give you this opportunity for a special prayer. I want you to make a step of faith and move to the front. You want to recommmit your life to Jesus. You want a special prayer this morning in your Christian journey, your Christian walk, you are saying, "Lord, I'm coming home." Open your arms of love for I am coming home. I want to pray with you. I want to make an appeal this morning. You want to make a commitment and a commitment to God. And let me address those who have not yet been baptized. If you're in the congregation and you're saying, "Lord, if you give me the next opportunity, the next available opportunity, I'm willing to be baptized." If you're there in the congregation, can see your hand up. And I see your hand up. You're saying, "The next available opportunity, I've not been baptized. I don't want to miss it. I'm willing to give my heart to Jesus Christ because I want my name to be recorded in heaven." Can I see a hand in the congregation? Not yet baptized. Not yet baptized. You are saying the next available opportunity is mine because I want to record my name in the kingdom of heaven. Not yet baptized. Can I see your hand up? Just lift up your hand. Lift up your hand. You still have pastors who can baptize you before time comes when there's no pastor baptiz you. Is there a hand in the congregation saying, "Not yet baptized, but one day soon I want to baptize. I want to give my heart to Jesus." Can I see a hand in the congregation? Anybody in the congregation? All right. Now, you are there in the congregation and you're saying, "Lord, I want to be committed as faithful steward from today. I've been wondering left, right, and center, but I want now from today be committed as a faithful steward." Can I see your hand up? Lift up your hand as we pray. Lift up your hand as Gracious loving Lord, we thank you this morning. Thank you, Jesus. for your sacrificial love. Thank you for leaving the throne and coming down to die for us. Thank you for giving all and giving your life and giving your blood. This morning we are lifting up our hands because you have spoken to us. We want our names to be recorded in heaven. And we know it can be done as we believe in you. It can be done as we confess our sins. It can be done as we choose to obey you. It can be done as we choose to be faithful as stewards. As we commit our lives to you fully, these hands are a testament and a promise that from today we are choosing Jesus. We are choosing to commit our lives fully to Jesus. And we pray that as we do this Lord also reciprocate by writing our names in the book of life. Thank you Jesus for hearing. Thank you for answering our prayer this afternoon. Bless the leadership of this church. Bless the members of this church. Bless everybody who is under the sound of my voice either here present or those who are online who have been following this message. I pray dear Lord that a special blessing may be given unto them. Thank you Jesus for answering our prayer and thank you because our names are now written in the books of heaven. Keep us faithful until when you shall come again so that when you come you will come and take us home. It is my prayer in the name of the father, the son and the holy spirit. And let every believing saint say amen. Amen.

TIMESTAMPED TRANSCRIPT:
[0.6s] Happy Sabbath church.
[3.1s] I want to take this opportunity to say
[5.4s] welcome to all of you uh and those who
[7.8s] are watching us
[9.8s] uh through various social media
[11.7s] platforms.
[13.8s] Want to thank God for the week
[17.0s] and uh just uh
[19.9s] a point in the introduction
[23.4s] to put things right.
[27.4s] Um, Pastor Combe is in charge of
[31.8s] evangelism coordination,
[35.3s] personal ministries,
[37.8s] Sabbath school,
[40.5s] AMR,
[42.8s] Office of Adventist Mission,
[45.8s] and right now we have Adventist Men
[48.7s] Ministries.
[52.5s] Thank you so much.
[55.1s] I want to thank God for those who have
[56.6s] been uh joining us
[59.8s] uh
[61.3s] here during the week
[66.2s] but also those who have been following
[68.0s] us
[71.0s] uh online.
[75.9s] I believe that the Lord has been with us
[78.9s] and I want to ask us to
[82.2s] close our eyes in prayer so that we can
[84.4s] one more time invite the presence of God
[86.6s] here in our midst. Father God in heaven,
[90.2s] thank you so much.
[93.0s] Thank you for the privilege to be in
[95.4s] your holy presence.
[97.7s] Father, we first and foremost are
[101.0s] cognizant that we as sinners fallen
[103.4s] short of your glory. Forgive us, Lord,
[106.2s] and cleanse us from all unrighteousness
[108.5s] with the most precious and powerful
[110.2s] blood of Jesus Christ.
[112.8s] I pray that you'll forgive me my sins,
[116.3s] that you'll hide me beneath the cross of
[118.8s] Jesus.
[120.4s] And I pray that your presence will be in
[122.7s] this congregation today, even as you
[125.7s] speak unto us through the power of the
[128.1s] Holy Spirit. I pray that you sank from
[130.6s] my brain cells, touch my lips and my
[132.8s] tongue and fill my mouth with the
[134.1s] abundance of your word. May we hear you
[136.8s] speak to us today one more time for this
[140.4s] is our prayer in Jesus name. Amen.
[144.9s] Uh this morning
[148.1s] our topic is a very interesting topic
[153.8s] and it is a question that you ought to
[156.6s] answer it yourself
[160.1s] before it is too late. And the question
[163.8s] is is your name written in heaven?
[169.2s] And we will read one more time the
[172.9s] passage of scripture that has been read
[176.5s] Luke chapter 10 and verse 17 going
[179.2s] downwards but I will read only 17 and
[182.4s] verse 20.
[184.8s] And the 70 returned again with joy
[187.4s] saying Lord
[189.4s] even the devils the devils are subject
[192.6s] unto us through your name.
[197.4s] And then
[199.2s] Jesus concludes
[201.7s] in response by saying, "However,
[204.8s] do not rejoice
[206.7s] that the spirit submit to you, but
[209.5s] rejoice that your names
[212.3s] are written in heaven."
[215.0s] It is the concern and desire of all of
[217.1s] us. It is the concern of every believer
[220.0s] in Jesus that after following Jesus all
[223.4s] your life, after trusting in him and
[226.2s] keeping the Sabbath and returning a
[228.1s] faithful tithe, after singing in the
[230.3s] choir, after preaching the good news of
[232.6s] the gospel to the world, when he come
[234.6s] the second time, your name may be in the
[238.2s] books of heaven. Praise be to God.
[241.4s] Someone captured this thought in the
[243.4s] song number 216 says when the trumpet of
[247.3s] the Lord shall sound and the time shall
[250.2s] be no more and the morning breaks
[252.6s] eternal bright and fair when the saved
[255.1s] of earth shall gather over on the other
[257.6s] shore and the roll is called up yonder.
[261.0s] I'll be there when the roll is called up
[263.7s] yonder. I'll be there when the roll is
[266.7s] called up yonder. Is it your desire that
[269.1s] your name be found in the roles of
[270.8s] heaven?
[275.0s] And I want to give you a brief a brief
[277.0s] background of the book of Luke that
[279.4s] gives us this very uh important uh
[283.0s] message.
[285.5s] The book of Luke is written
[288.9s] by none other than Luke, Dr. Luke. He he
[293.6s] was a physician. I happen to have had
[297.3s] the privilege to stumble upon a a
[300.7s] biography, a book that talks about Dr.
[304.0s] Luke. That is an amazing story to read.
[307.0s] How he he was uh serving people as a
[311.7s] physician. You could come to him to his
[314.5s] office and you are talking about your
[316.6s] stomach and your legs and your backbone
[318.3s] and your headache and he begins to
[320.3s] search on your background and and and
[322.4s] and search on your life until he he
[326.7s] pinpoints where the problem is says you
[329.1s] don't need an injection let us pray and
[332.4s] then he prays for you and gives you some
[334.2s] counelss and then you go home and then
[336.8s] you do what he has said and you get you
[339.0s] get well he was a wonderful amazing
[341.1s] physician I don't have time to tell you
[343.7s] uh more details about how he finally
[345.8s] came to get in touch with Paul and the
[349.1s] disciples of Jesus and write this book
[351.4s] of Luke. But he was in his orchard
[353.9s] someday and then there was an earthquake
[356.6s] and then there was an eclipse of the sun
[359.9s] and as a scientist he went into the to
[362.8s] the archives to see whether there was
[364.8s] anything about this written on this day
[367.5s] and he discovered there was no records
[369.2s] about an eclipse of the sun or an
[371.6s] earthquake on that day and he began to
[373.6s] search why has this happened. He began
[376.2s] to travel until he came to Jerusalem
[378.1s] until he met the disciples of Jesus who
[380.5s] narrated to him these stories and then
[382.4s] he captured them. He wrote the book of
[384.7s] Luke.
[386.2s] He is the author. It is said that this
[389.4s] book could have been written between 5
[391.7s] uh9 through uh 63 while others hold the
[395.2s] view that maybe it was written between
[397.7s] 70 and 80 AD.
[403.7s] Who are the recipients of the book of
[405.8s] Luke? Who is his audience?
[410.2s] The gospel is specifically directed to
[415.0s] someone called Theophilus.
[417.6s] And the word Theophilus is a Greek word
[420.6s] which means one who loves God.
[424.3s] Anyone loves God in the congregation?
[427.6s] Anyone loves God in the congregation?
[430.1s] Can I hear an amen from someone who
[432.1s] loves God in the congregation?
[434.0s] So this book is written for you.
[437.3s] It is written to someone who loves God.
[440.6s] And this this doctor captures this
[444.7s] pregnant thought in his writing. I want
[447.5s] you to notice that no other writer of
[450.1s] the gospel captures this particular
[453.4s] discussion, this particular thought,
[456.2s] this particular statement made by Jesus
[462.1s] that it is one thing actually to serve
[464.8s] God and it is another thing to have your
[468.2s] name written and retained in the book of
[470.9s] life
[474.3s] and therefore it is a book of interest
[476.1s] to It is a thought worthy considering
[479.4s] today
[480.9s] that while you labor for the master on a
[483.4s] dayto-day basis, the question remains,
[486.2s] is your name written in the books of
[489.3s] heaven? Ask your neighbor, is your name
[491.5s] written in heaven? Ask your neighbor, is
[493.8s] your name written?
[499.0s] So Jesus says, "Not withstanding in
[502.2s] this, rejoice not that the spirits are
[505.6s] subject unto you, but rather rejoice
[508.7s] because your names are written in
[511.4s] heaven." Praise be to God. Though it is
[514.3s] an honor to work miracles, it is an
[517.0s] honor to pray and see evil spirits leave
[520.2s] a demon possessed person. It's an honor.
[522.6s] You feel honored. You feel happy to lay
[525.6s] your hands on the sick and they get
[527.4s] well. It's an honor to preach and you
[529.8s] see souls saved into the kingdom. People
[533.2s] coming to give their hearts to Jesus.
[535.3s] But he says not withstanding that. Don't
[538.7s] rejoice because of that because that can
[542.2s] happen here on earth not recognized in
[546.1s] heaven. He says rejoice because your
[549.9s] name is written in heaven.
[554.8s] Don't thump your chest because of the
[557.0s] accomplishments you have. Don't thump
[559.5s] your chest because of the great things
[561.2s] you do for the Lord.
[563.5s] Because remember one day he said many
[565.9s] will come and they will say we
[567.0s] prophesied in your name and we worked
[569.4s] miracles in your name and he will tell
[571.6s] them on their faces I didn't know you.
[577.4s] So we get something to help us
[581.6s] from Paul. What can help us then? Be
[586.2s] sure that our names are in the book of
[588.6s] life. Philippians 3:3-14.
[592.6s] It says, "Brethren, I count not myself
[595.7s] to have apprehended,
[598.2s] but this one thing I do, forgetting
[601.1s] those things which are behind me, and
[603.4s] reaching forth unto those things which
[606.0s] are before me, I press towards the mark
[609.1s] for the prize of the high calling of God
[611.7s] in Christ Jesus." He says what you're
[614.3s] supposed to do is to forget the things
[616.7s] which are behind you and press forward
[620.2s] towards the mark, the goal, the crown.
[624.2s] Prepare yourself, your heart, your mind.
[626.7s] Prepare for the second coming of Jesus
[629.0s] and prepare for the kingdom of heaven.
[631.3s] Do all you can push aside every
[634.3s] distraction and have your mind focused
[636.9s] on one thing, Jesus and Jesus alone, the
[640.4s] alpha and the finisher of your faith.
[643.2s] And someone captures these words in the
[646.0s] song number 631 and says, I am pressing
[649.3s] on on the upward way. New heights I'm
[652.6s] gaining every day. still praying as I
[656.6s] onward bound. Lord, plant my feet on
[661.3s] higher ground. Says, "My heart has no
[664.0s] desire to stay where doubts arise and
[667.0s] fears dismay. Though some may dwell,
[670.4s] where these abound, my prayer, my aim is
[675.1s] higher ground." He says, "I want to live
[678.2s] above the world. Those such as doubts at
[680.9s] me are hard. For faith has caught the
[683.5s] joyful sound, the song of saints on
[687.0s] higher ground.
[689.8s] So the outright of the song says, "Put
[692.0s] your minds on the things above."
[695.2s] Be preoccupied
[697.6s] by the things of heaven, spiritual
[700.5s] things, your relationship with Jesus and
[703.8s] how you walk before him as a steward.
[707.0s] Just be keen to observe and to do all
[710.8s] that he says. Remain focused to the goal
[714.2s] because he is coming soon.
[717.6s] Or Paul says, I keep pressing forward.
[720.8s] As someone who runs arrest, he says, I
[722.9s] keep pressing forward for the crown that
[725.6s] is coming ahead of me.
[729.4s] In the book of Philippians chapter 2:12,
[732.7s] he as something we need to consider.
[735.6s] says, "Wherefore, my beloved, as you
[737.3s] have always obeyed, not as in my
[739.8s] presence only, but now much more in my
[742.2s] absence, work out your own salvation
[745.3s] with fear and trembling." Simply to mean
[748.2s] you got a role to play in your
[750.4s] salvation.
[752.3s] There's something you need to do
[757.2s] and you got to do it yourself. Your
[759.6s] father cannot do it for you. Your mother
[761.7s] won't do it for you. Your wife won't do
[764.2s] it for you. You have a role to play in
[767.0s] your salvation.
[769.3s] Yes. No one can believe Jesus for you.
[772.5s] No one can be faithful as a steward on
[775.0s] your behalf. You have a role to play as
[777.6s] a steward. Tell your neighbor you have a
[778.9s] role to play.
[780.8s] You got to work out your own salvation
[783.2s] with fear and trembling.
[786.1s] But time is running out
[792.9s] because there is a crown of God of
[795.1s] glory, a crown of gold for each one of
[798.5s] us. Do you yearn to have your crown? Do
[802.7s] you desire to have your crown? Nothing
[806.4s] can equate the crown. Nothing can be
[812.5s] as good as this crown.
[815.8s] It's a crown of glory that fears not.
[820.3s] And Paul say these words in the book of
[822.3s] 2 Timothy 4:7 and verse 8. I have fought
[827.7s] the good fight. I have finished the
[830.2s] rest. I have kept the faith. Now there
[833.6s] is
[836.6s] in store for me the crown of
[839.3s] righteousness which the Lord, the
[842.0s] righteous judge, will award to me on
[845.6s] that day. Ladies and gentlemen, I have
[848.2s] good news for you this morning. There's
[850.4s] a crown of glory awaiting you at the end
[855.7s] of the journey. After your sacrifices,
[859.3s] after your commitment, after you're
[861.3s] coming to church, after you're keeping
[863.2s] the Sabbath, after turning a faithful
[865.1s] tithe, after singing in the choir, after
[867.5s] preaching the gospel, there is a crown
[870.1s] of glory awaiting you. Tell your
[873.0s] neighbor, don't give up. Don't give up.
[874.7s] Don't give up. Don't give up. Don't give
[876.7s] up.
[879.4s] Jesus himself will put and place the
[882.7s] crown on your head himself. I cannot
[886.5s] wait for that day. Jesus calls my name
[891.0s] and I jump forward and he picks the
[893.4s] crown and puts it on my head.
[897.1s] Will you receive your crown?
[900.7s] But the question is,
[903.0s] are there books in heaven?
[906.2s] And the answer is yes. I want to talk
[908.2s] about two books. The first one is the
[910.6s] book of remembrance.
[913.3s] Malachi 3:16. Then they that fear the
[917.1s] Lord spake often one to another. And the
[919.6s] Lord hearkened and heard it. And a book
[922.6s] of remembrance was written before him
[925.9s] for them that fear the Lord and that
[928.6s] thought upon his name.
[931.3s] A book of remembrance and they shall be
[934.2s] mine, says the Lord of hosts. In that
[937.8s] day when I
[940.6s] make up my jewels
[944.3s] and I will spare them as a man spares
[947.6s] his own son that serves him as they
[951.7s] began to speak those who serve the Lord.
[955.7s] A book of remembrance was open.
[959.6s] This book is a book that records
[961.4s] everything that you do, every good thing
[963.9s] that you do. I had someone here
[966.2s] promoting camp offering.
[970.3s] That offering you will give towards the
[972.0s] camp meetings will not be in vain. It is
[975.5s] recorded in heaven and God will come and
[977.8s] reward you for that. Praise be to God.
[981.5s] That tithe you return every Sabbath is
[984.4s] faithfully recorded in heaven. Every
[986.5s] word of kindness, every word of
[988.6s] encouragement, every act of charity to
[991.4s] the needy is registered in the book of
[994.5s] remembrance so that one day you can be
[997.0s] rewarded for that. God is a just
[999.5s] rewarder. There's nothing you will do.
[1001.9s] He will take for granted. There has to
[1004.1s] be a book to record all that you you do
[1006.8s] so that God when he comes, he can
[1009.8s] recompense and reward you. That's why
[1012.0s] Jesus says, "I come quickly with a
[1013.9s] reward in my hands. to give everyone
[1016.9s] according to what you have done.
[1020.2s] But then there's another book,
[1023.5s] the book of life.
[1026.7s] This is a book
[1029.2s] for all those who will be saved.
[1034.6s] Those who will inherit the kingdom,
[1036.6s] their names are in this book.
[1039.9s] Revelation 20 and verse 12 and 13. They
[1043.4s] saw the dead, small and great, standing
[1045.6s] before God. And books were opened, and
[1049.0s] another book was opened, which is the
[1051.3s] book of life. And the dead were judged
[1054.5s] according to their works by the things
[1056.3s] which were written in the books.
[1059.8s] Then death and hes were cast into the
[1063.5s] lake of fire. This is the second death.
[1067.1s] And anyone
[1069.4s] not found written in the book of life
[1073.1s] was cast into the lake of fire. Is your
[1078.1s] name written in the book of life? For
[1082.0s] anyone not found in that book will not
[1085.0s] escape the flames of the lake of fire.
[1088.2s] Death and hate will be cast there. The
[1091.5s] false prophet will be cast there. and
[1094.6s] the beast will be cast there. All
[1097.9s] sinners will be cast there. All those
[1100.7s] whose names are not written in the book
[1102.8s] of life will be cast into the flames of
[1107.5s] fire. The question is, will your name be
[1111.2s] found in the book of life?
[1113.8s] And so in the next remaining minutes, I
[1116.9s] want to answer the question then.
[1120.4s] How can my name be finally recorded in
[1124.4s] the book of life? What ought I to do,
[1127.9s] ladies and gentlemen? What must I do now
[1132.1s] for me to be sure my name is in the book
[1135.5s] of life? And I want to take you through
[1138.5s] some few steps and then I will finish.
[1143.1s] Yes, your name can be and your name will
[1146.2s] be registered in the book of life.
[1150.5s] When you believe in Jesus as Lord and
[1153.4s] Savior
[1155.1s] of your life, Bible says in John chapter
[1158.4s] 1 verse 12, "But as many as received
[1162.1s] him, to them gave he the power to become
[1166.9s] the sons of God to them that believe in
[1170.9s] his name." All those who confess Jesus
[1176.6s] is Lord. Jesus is my savior. All those
[1181.0s] who believe he is the son of God. Who
[1184.0s] believe he died for them. Who believe he
[1187.6s] came to give us a chance to be saved
[1191.0s] forever. Who believe in his name. Their
[1194.1s] names are written in the book of life.
[1197.8s] Praise be to God. And the question is,
[1200.4s] do you believe in Jesus as Lord and
[1202.6s] Savior? John 3:16, for God so loved the
[1206.5s] world and gave his only begotten son
[1210.2s] that whosoever believes in him should
[1213.1s] not perish.
[1215.0s] You only have to believe. Tell your
[1217.6s] neighbor, you have to believe. You have
[1218.7s] to believe.
[1220.4s] You have to believe.
[1222.6s] You must believe. It's one thing to be
[1225.5s] in church. It's another to believe in
[1227.6s] Jesus. It's one thing even to return a
[1230.7s] tribe. It's another to believe in Jesus.
[1235.0s] It's one thing to sing in the choir is
[1237.2s] another to believe in Jesus. It's
[1239.4s] another to come to church every Sabbath.
[1241.8s] It's another to believe in Jesus. And
[1244.1s] the question is, do you believe in Jesus
[1246.2s] as your Lord and Savior? When he becomes
[1249.5s] Lord, then he begins to command you from
[1251.6s] inside. It tells you how you need to
[1254.7s] dress, how you need to speak, what you
[1257.0s] should eat, what music to listen, what
[1260.2s] friends to walk with, and how to speak.
[1263.7s] When he is Lord, he orders your life.
[1266.8s] The question is, is Jesus your Lord and
[1269.3s] Savior?
[1272.3s] The Bible says in 1 John 5:12,
[1276.1s] "And this is the testimony that God has
[1279.2s] given us eternal life." And this life is
[1283.5s] in his son.
[1285.6s] Whoever has the son has life.
[1289.0s] Whoever does not have the son of God
[1292.6s] does not have life. And so I p this
[1295.2s] question to you today.
[1297.4s] Do you have the son?
[1300.1s] Is Jesus
[1301.9s] born in your heart?
[1304.5s] Have you accepted him to be your Lord
[1307.4s] and Savior? Do you believe in him? He is
[1310.7s] life, eternal. And those who have him,
[1314.0s] the Bible says, they have life. And if
[1317.4s] you don't believe in him, you don't have
[1319.6s] life. And so this message goes to those
[1322.5s] who don't believe in Jesus. How will you
[1325.0s] be saved?
[1327.8s] How will you have your name in the
[1329.6s] records of heaven without believing in
[1331.8s] Jesus?
[1336.2s] And the question is Paul is asking how
[1339.3s] then will you be saved if you neglect
[1342.0s] such a great salvation.
[1345.0s] Believe in Jesus ladies and gentlemen.
[1347.4s] Receive Jesus to be Lord and Savior and
[1350.7s] you will be automatically a faithful
[1353.0s] steward. Praise be to God. Nobody will
[1355.4s] tell you a tenth is a faithful tithe.
[1359.7s] Nobody will question you on how to be
[1362.2s] faithful to him. He will be doing
[1365.0s] everything inside you because the Bible
[1366.6s] says for both to will and to do. It is
[1370.6s] God. It is God both to will and to do of
[1373.8s] his good pleasure. Point number two, how
[1376.8s] to ensure your name is in the book of
[1380.9s] life. This book is for those whose sins
[1386.2s] have been forgiven.
[1389.5s] Psalms 32:1 and verse two.
[1393.6s] The servant of God says, "Blessed is he,
[1396.6s] whose transgression is forgiven,
[1399.4s] whose sin is covered.
[1402.7s] Blessed is the man unto whom the Lord
[1405.4s] impute not iniquity, and in whose spirit
[1409.2s] there is no guile." It's one thing to
[1412.2s] believe in Jesus and give him your heart
[1415.4s] as Lord and Savior. It's another thing
[1418.9s] now to confess your sins
[1421.8s] now to surrender your life to him and
[1423.7s] ask Jesus and his blood to wash you. We
[1427.6s] are washed by the blood of Jesus. We are
[1431.5s] cleansed by the blood of Jesus. It's the
[1434.1s] blood of Jesus that covers
[1436.9s] the abundance of our sins.
[1439.8s] And this is something you do on a
[1443.0s] dayto-day basis.
[1445.7s] You confess your sins every minute.
[1449.3s] Come to God every day
[1452.6s] and tell him, "Lord, forgive me. I may
[1456.3s] have sinned to you knowingly or
[1458.7s] unknowingly. For blessed are those whose
[1461.9s] sins have been forgiven, whose
[1463.8s] transgressions have been covered by the
[1465.7s] blood of Jesus." Jesus died on the cross
[1468.6s] so that you and I can be forgiven.
[1472.9s] Every time you confess, the Bible says 1
[1475.3s] John 1:9, "If we confess our sin, he is
[1479.2s] faithful and just to forgive our sin and
[1481.6s] cleanse us from all unrighteousness."
[1483.7s] You have a promise of forgiveness.
[1487.4s] As soon as you repent and confess,
[1491.0s] I want to repeat this.
[1493.8s] For you to be forgiven,
[1497.5s] it take someone to confess.
[1501.0s] take someone to repent and he says I
[1503.4s] will forgive you. I will forgive you for
[1506.5s] you. You have to have your name in the
[1508.9s] book of life and the name to remain in
[1511.8s] the book of life.
[1514.1s] Repent of your sins, confess of your
[1516.9s] iniquities and come to Jesus and ask him
[1519.9s] to wash you by his precious blood.
[1522.3s] Praise be to God.
[1525.4s] If you say you have no sin, you may go
[1527.8s] to be a liar.
[1529.9s] For all have sinned and fallen short of
[1531.9s] the glory of God, and the wages of sin
[1535.1s] is death. But the free gift of God is
[1539.3s] eternal life through Christ Jesus our
[1541.4s] Lord and Savior. Praise be to God. Point
[1544.2s] number three, how do I gate my name in
[1547.1s] the book of life?
[1550.2s] That book of life, those who are in that
[1552.2s] book of life, there are those who have
[1554.2s] chosen to be obedient to God.
[1557.4s] They have chosen to live by every word
[1561.0s] of God. Jesus said, "Man shall not live
[1565.0s] by bread alone, but by every word that
[1567.0s] proceedth from the mouth of God." Those
[1569.1s] who choose to obey him, those who live
[1571.9s] according to his orders. Those who
[1573.9s] accept Jesus as Lord, there are many who
[1577.0s] want Jesus as savior, they don't want
[1579.4s] him as Lord
[1581.4s] because they want him as savior. They
[1583.4s] cry to him every time they're in
[1585.4s] trouble. But they don't want to obey his
[1587.9s] commands.
[1591.0s] Listen to this.
[1593.8s] 1 Samuel chapter 1 verse 15. Okay. 1
[1598.2s] Samuel chapter 15 verse 22 and 23.
[1602.9s] But I read 22.
[1605.1s] This is a story of a king of Israel who
[1607.0s] had just been appointed. His name is
[1609.4s] King Psalm.
[1611.4s] And God sent orders.
[1614.3s] go and kill all the um Amorites.
[1619.2s] Go and kill all of them.
[1623.0s] And the king goes to war
[1626.1s] and he begins to win because Jesus has
[1629.2s] given him that power to win. And he
[1633.4s] kills them and he wins. He he he wins.
[1637.3s] He kills them men and the women and the
[1640.2s] warriors. He kills them and he's
[1642.5s] winning. Then he he changed his
[1644.5s] strategy. Instead of destroying all men
[1647.8s] and women, young and old, he said in his
[1651.6s] heart, I will spare the bulls which are
[1655.3s] fattened and the goats which are good
[1658.2s] and the sheep which are nice for an
[1661.2s] offering to the Lord. Is there anything
[1664.5s] wrong with a good animal for an offering
[1667.8s] to the Lord?
[1669.8s] there anything wrong to preserve the
[1671.8s] foren kto for an offering
[1677.0s] and so he did that when he came to the
[1678.7s] king a gag he also said even this one I
[1681.8s] won't kill him now I want everybody to
[1684.4s] see that I'm a a mighty warrior in war
[1687.8s] so he comes back to the prophet Samuel
[1690.7s] and Samuel comes to him and tells him or
[1692.6s] asks him have you obeyed the word of the
[1696.2s] lord and I know you know the answer Yes,
[1699.8s] I have obeyed the word of the Lord. Have
[1701.9s] you obeyed the word of the Lord? And
[1705.5s] answer he said, "Yes, I have obeyed the
[1708.8s] word of the Lord." Then he says, "Why
[1711.6s] are you hearing like some cows and some
[1715.4s] some goats and some sheep are bleeding
[1717.8s] there? What is that?" He's like, "Oh,
[1719.9s] oh, prophet, relax. Relax. All is well.
[1723.4s] I obeyed
[1725.2s] but I thought God needs an offering. I
[1730.5s] present the foren one for offering.
[1733.0s] That's why I brought them here.
[1735.5s] And the prophet was
[1738.3s] angered. And then he said these words 1
[1741.6s] Samuel 15:22.
[1744.3s] As the Lord as much delight in burnt
[1747.3s] offerings
[1749.0s] and sacrifices
[1751.0s] as in doing what? As in doing what?
[1755.8s] Obeying the voice of the Lord.
[1760.6s] Behold, to obey is better than
[1764.1s] sacrifice,
[1765.8s] and to listen is better than the fat of
[1769.0s] an offering.
[1770.9s] God requires obedience from us. Those
[1774.9s] who will be found in the book of life
[1777.1s] are those who chose the life of
[1780.0s] obedience obeying what he says to us as
[1784.0s] stewards.
[1785.8s] Colossians 6:7 the Bible says be not
[1788.5s] deceived. God is not mocked. Whatsoever
[1791.8s] a man saweth that shall he also reap.
[1796.6s] Whatever you do in the presence of God,
[1799.4s] God cannot be deceived. He knows when
[1802.7s] you obey. He knows when you're
[1805.0s] disobedient. He knows when you are
[1807.2s] faithful. He knows when you're not
[1809.1s] faithful. The problem is not how much
[1811.7s] you put in the envelope.
[1814.5s] The problem is whether you are faithful.
[1816.0s] Ask your neighbor, are you faithful?
[1822.0s] It's not how much you bring,
[1824.7s] it's how much you have left
[1828.2s] which you should have brought to the
[1830.2s] Lord.
[1831.9s] The question is am I faithful?
[1835.7s] We cannot mock God. You know you can
[1838.2s] bring 1 million and yet is not what
[1841.2s] faithful. The question is are you
[1843.4s] faithful because stewards are also
[1846.6s] supposed to be faithful.
[1849.3s] Tell your neighbor be faithful. Be
[1850.6s] faithful. Be faithful.
[1855.3s] 2 Corinthians 9:7. Each of you should
[1858.3s] give what you have decided in your heart
[1860.3s] to give not reluctantly and a compulsion
[1863.4s] for God loves a cheerful giver. Whatever
[1866.5s] you do to the Lord, it's about your
[1868.6s] heart. It's about your motive. Are you
[1871.9s] doing this happily? Are you doing it
[1874.4s] with joy
[1877.0s] or you feel like you're under
[1878.5s] compulsion?
[1880.9s] When Jesus chose to come and die for us,
[1884.5s] was he forced? Was he compelled?
[1888.6s] No. He came joyfully.
[1892.0s] He was born in a manger, lived with us
[1894.5s] in this world of sin, and he joyfully
[1897.1s] gave his life for salvation. Praise be
[1899.5s] to God. He loves a joyful giver. And
[1903.0s] that's why Malachi 3:10-11,
[1906.6s] as much as he requests us to be faithful
[1908.4s] to him, he also says there's a blessing
[1911.7s] for faithfulness. He says, "Bring the
[1914.0s] whole tithe into the house that there
[1916.2s] may be food in my house. Touch me in
[1918.6s] thee, says the Lord Almighty, and see if
[1921.4s] I will not throw open the floodgates of
[1924.2s] heaven and pour out so much blessing
[1927.0s] that there will be no room enough to
[1929.4s] store it." Why is he declaring immense
[1932.3s] blessings? Because he's asking you to be
[1934.9s] faithful. He says, "You are not losing
[1937.0s] when you are faithful.
[1939.4s] You're not losing when you are giving.
[1942.2s] You are storing up your treasures in
[1944.6s] heaven ahead of time so that where your
[1948.2s] heart shall be and where your treasure
[1950.1s] is, there your heart shall be also.
[1953.8s] Point number four,
[1955.9s] how can you be sure that your name is in
[1958.5s] the book of heaven?
[1961.1s] It is the book of those who gave their
[1964.2s] resources supporting God's work. How
[1967.4s] much are you willing to sacrifice for
[1969.0s] those in need, for the poor and for the
[1971.8s] hungry? Matthew 25:36-37.
[1975.6s] I was hungry and you gave me meat. I was
[1978.1s] thirsty, you gave me drink. I was a
[1980.5s] stranger and you took me in. I was naked
[1983.3s] and you clothed me. I was sick and you
[1985.4s] visited me. I was in prison and you came
[1988.1s] unto me.
[1989.9s] Then shall the righteous answer him,
[1992.2s] saying, Lord, when
[1995.0s] when so we thee and hungered and fed
[1997.7s] thee, or thirsty, and gave it gave thee
[2000.4s] drink, then he will say, what you did to
[2002.9s] the least amongst you, you did it to me.
[2006.0s] Are you willing to give your resources
[2007.9s] to help those who are in need? A reward
[2011.4s] is coming. Point number five,
[2014.3s] it is for it is for those who have
[2015.9s] devoted their lives into the service of
[2018.7s] the Lord. Those who have given their
[2021.1s] hearts and lives and themselves to serve
[2024.2s] God. Their names are recorded in the
[2026.9s] book of heaven in the book of
[2029.4s] Philippians 4:3. And I entreat thee also
[2032.9s] true fellow. Help those women which
[2036.0s] labor with me in the gospel
[2039.3s] with the clement also and with other my
[2042.4s] fellow laborers whose names are in the
[2045.0s] book of life. When you choose to serve
[2046.8s] the Lord
[2049.6s] you are enrolling in the books of
[2051.4s] heaven.
[2053.7s] When number six, those who are ready to
[2055.9s] lay down their lives for the sake of
[2058.4s] Jesus.
[2060.2s] In the book of Matthew 16:2,
[2063.0s] Jesus says, "Whosoever want to save
[2066.1s] their life will lose it. Whosoever loses
[2069.7s] their life for me will find it." Have
[2073.1s] you come to a place where you feel so
[2076.3s] much in love with Jesus that you're
[2078.5s] willing to die for him?
[2081.2s] Have you come to a place in your
[2082.7s] spiritual journey where you have
[2084.6s] surrendered your life fully to Jesus and
[2087.4s] you are willing to pay the ultimate
[2089.7s] sacrifice?
[2091.8s] He said those who are willing to lose
[2093.3s] their lives for me will save their lives
[2096.6s] but those who want to save their lives
[2099.8s] they will lose it. How much are you
[2102.0s] willing to give yourselves to Jesus?
[2106.2s] Are you willing to give your heart, your
[2108.5s] body, your family, your resources, your
[2111.2s] job, and everything you have for Jesus?
[2114.9s] If you can't give your money to Jesus,
[2118.4s] will you give your life to Jesus?
[2122.9s] That is the question.
[2126.2s] Listen to this. Revelation 12:1.
[2128.9s] And they overcame him by the blood of
[2130.6s] the lamb and by the word of their
[2132.6s] testimony. and they loved in all their
[2135.0s] lives unto death. Those who fall in love
[2137.8s] with Jesus,
[2140.1s] they see
[2142.2s] nothingness in this life. Like Solomon,
[2145.5s] the wisest man who ever lived, they see
[2148.1s] vanity in life.
[2150.6s] There's nothing on in this life to cling
[2152.9s] on to.
[2154.6s] They only cling on to Jesus
[2157.5s] and doing the will of God with all their
[2159.8s] lives.
[2161.4s] And when they choose to obey, they
[2163.3s] choose to obey fully.
[2167.4s] Remember when they wanted to touch on
[2169.5s] Daniel, they said, "We cannot get him
[2172.2s] unless it is something about his God."
[2175.1s] Why? They knew Daniel
[2177.9s] committed fully to God. He was willing
[2181.0s] to die for his God. Ask your neighbor,
[2183.3s] are you willing to die for God?
[2187.2s] There are many people in history who
[2189.3s] have paid ultimate sacrifice
[2192.3s] for their salvation.
[2194.6s] There are men like John Wickliffe, like
[2197.3s] John Hush.
[2199.3s] He was burnt on the state.
[2202.5s] And as they hung him on a stick, tied
[2205.6s] him with ropes,
[2207.5s] they still gave him one more chance to
[2209.3s] recount his faith.
[2211.6s] Said, "H, you can leave. you don't have
[2214.6s] to die. Can you denounce Jesus?
[2219.1s] And who's in response told them
[2222.4s] no
[2224.2s] I cannot recant and I cannot denounce
[2226.3s] Jesus. Him who could not
[2230.1s] hold on to the throne in heaven who
[2233.0s] could not cling to being God chose to
[2236.2s] humble himself come down and carry a
[2239.1s] cross for me. He who accepted to be
[2242.2s] hanged on a cross and nailed with those
[2244.6s] rusted Roman nails. Who accepted to die
[2248.0s] for me, I am also willing to die for
[2251.0s] him. And they lit the fire and they
[2254.5s] burnt him. And as H was dying, he was
[2257.8s] singing this song. Jesus, son of David,
[2260.8s] have mercy on me. Jesus, son of David,
[2263.7s] have mercy on me.
[2266.2s] I don't have enough time to tell the
[2267.8s] story of the wildernesses who were
[2269.9s] thrown over the mountains and crashed
[2272.0s] over the rocks. But they clung unto
[2274.2s] Jesus unto death.
[2277.6s] They knew whom they had believed in and
[2281.0s] they were not going to quit their faith
[2283.5s] because they were sure their names are
[2285.9s] in the books of heaven.
[2289.0s] Only when you're sure that your name is
[2291.9s] in the books of heaven
[2294.2s] can you make such a decision to even pay
[2297.2s] the ultimate sacrifice. And this church,
[2301.7s] not long from now, some of us will be
[2304.2s] called to pay the ultimate sacrifice.
[2306.9s] And the question is, will you be willing
[2308.9s] to do that for Jesus?
[2311.1s] when you are told not to go to church on
[2312.7s] Sabbath
[2314.3s] and when it is
[2316.4s] crime a crime a crime to obey God it's a
[2318.8s] crime to call upon the name of Jesus
[2320.2s] will you stand is the question two
[2323.0s] things before I finish
[2326.6s] we learn from Paul as he says I have
[2328.6s] fought a good fight I have finished the
[2331.3s] race and I know now a crown is waiting
[2333.4s] for me it is like he says there are two
[2336.3s] things you need to take notice of number
[2338.6s] one remain in the until the end.
[2342.9s] Winners don't quit and quitters don't
[2345.5s] win.
[2347.4s] We have not been promised a safe
[2349.3s] journey, but we have been promised a
[2351.5s] safe arrival. Praise be to God. We shall
[2354.2s] we shall reach home at last.
[2356.9s] This is the message from Paul.
[2359.4s] But point number two,
[2361.7s] it's like Paul says,
[2365.4s] while you are in it, while you are on
[2368.5s] it,
[2370.6s] Colossians 6:9,
[2373.2s] let us not grow weary in doing good.
[2377.7s] For in due season, we will reap if we do
[2380.8s] not faint. We may reap now. Jesus said,
[2384.5s] "Those who have left everything for me,
[2386.5s] they will get a 100fold here. You may
[2388.2s] reap now but then he says at the end of
[2390.7s] the day they will inherit the kingdom of
[2392.7s] heaven. Praise be to God. Don't grow
[2394.7s] weary in doing good.
[2397.4s] Some of us used to be faithful as
[2398.9s] stewards. They have given up. They used
[2400.6s] to sing in the choir. They are pulled
[2401.9s] out. They used to come early to church
[2403.8s] on Sabbath. They are now coming late.
[2405.9s] They are giving up. Paul says don't grow
[2408.6s] weary in doing good. A reward is coming
[2410.7s] for you. Praise be to God. Point number
[2413.0s] two. Paul says, he seems to be saying,
[2418.0s] as you keep on keeping on,
[2421.3s] fix your eyes on Jesus. Don't lose focus
[2425.3s] of Jesus.
[2428.2s] Hebrews 12:2, looking unto Jesus, the
[2431.4s] out and the finish of our faith, who for
[2433.7s] the joy that was set before us or before
[2436.4s] him, endure the cross, despising the
[2438.6s] shame, and he sat down at the n at the
[2441.4s] right hand of the throne of God. Fix
[2443.6s] your eyes unto Jesus.
[2446.2s] It is him who came down from heaven to
[2448.5s] come and save you. It is him who has
[2452.2s] given you a new leaves of life. He is
[2455.4s] the way and the truth and the life for
[2457.7s] you to heaven. Fix your eyes onto Jesus,
[2460.5s] the author and the finisher of our
[2462.5s] faith. Fix your eyes onto Jesus because
[2464.7s] he is the one who gives you the power to
[2467.3s] overcome. For we are more than
[2469.6s] conquerors through Christ Jesus. And
[2471.7s] Paul says, Philippians 4:13, I can do
[2475.2s] all things through Christ Jesus, my
[2477.2s] Lord. Praise be to God. Fix your Tell
[2479.4s] your neighbor, fix your eyes onto Jesus.
[2481.5s] You cannot be a faithful steward unless
[2483.9s] your eyes are fixed on Jesus and see how
[2486.6s] he gives himself.
[2493.0s] I want to finish this with a small
[2494.8s] story.
[2498.2s] One day I was in a camp meeting.
[2500.8s] I know in one month you'll be in a
[2502.4s] meeting here. It was a Thursday
[2511.5s] and the guest speaker in my car meeting
[2514.1s] invites the host pastor for a visation
[2516.8s] program. Is that what happens? The guest
[2518.9s] speaker invites the host pastor for
[2520.4s] visation. Does that happen here?
[2524.6s] I say what? How come the guest speaker
[2528.8s] is inviting the host pastor for a
[2531.4s] visitation to a family?
[2534.2s] Is it not upside down? Something told me
[2537.1s] in my heart, "Relax, relax, relax. Don't
[2540.2s] quarrel."
[2541.9s] So I followed
[2544.4s] 6:00 p.m. 7:00 p.m. We are in this house
[2547.4s] of this church member
[2549.6s] and there were many of us with elders,
[2551.8s] some deacons.
[2554.9s] And then the first daughter of the
[2556.3s] family is asked to come to the sitting
[2558.6s] room and we are given chairs to sit in a
[2561.3s] carve
[2562.9s] and she sits there.
[2565.2s] Then they ask her questions. Do you know
[2567.8s] this? Say yes I know this. I know this
[2569.8s] one. Do you know this? Yes, I know this
[2571.7s] one. You know this. Yeah, I know this
[2573.4s] one. You know this. He's my pastor. Then
[2576.3s] I was wondering and asking myself, what
[2578.5s] kind of interview is this?
[2581.2s] How do you ask a church member
[2583.9s] who comes to church every Sabbath
[2585.5s] whether she knows a pastor?
[2590.6s] I also kept that in my heart. I didn't
[2593.5s] know what was going on. All of a sudden,
[2596.3s] one of them said, "Hey, she cannot sit
[2598.3s] any longer. Take her to her bedroom."
[2601.5s] Then she's taken to her bedroom. She's
[2604.2s] taken helped.
[2607.2s] Then the parents say, "Pastor, our
[2609.2s] daughter has been calling for you.
[2612.2s] Now that you're here, go and talk to her
[2614.2s] in the bedroom."
[2617.0s] 7:30 p.m.
[2619.6s] Everybody's in the sitting room. Pastor,
[2622.3s] go and talk to her in the bedroom.
[2629.4s] Because I was with the guest speaker, I
[2631.4s] said, "Pastor, two are better than one.
[2633.4s] Let's go."
[2635.3s] So I discovered very quickly that the
[2636.8s] whole of this ceremony was for the
[2639.8s] pastor and I didn't know.
[2644.2s] So we went to the room. When we entered
[2645.9s] the room, she was sleeping on her bed.
[2647.8s] She sat.
[2650.7s] Then she began talking. Pastor welcome.
[2654.6s] We were two pastors talking to one.
[2656.8s] Pastor welcome. I thank you very much.
[2659.3s] We had that you are calling for me. Uh
[2662.6s] why are you calling for me? you know
[2664.0s] where to find me. You you I'm in church
[2665.8s] every Sabbath. Why are you calling for
[2667.4s] me? I was trying to be humorous to see
[2669.8s] if I can see a smile, but she had a
[2672.6s] serious face. Hey, pastor, I've been
[2675.7s] calling for you. Where did you call?
[2677.8s] Where did you look for me?
[2680.5s] Hey, pastor.
[2682.4s] Okay. What can I do for you?
[2685.8s] Then she asked me a question. Do you
[2687.8s] think I'm okay? Okay. Help me to answer
[2689.8s] that question. Do you think I'm okay?
[2691.5s] Help me to answer that question.
[2695.4s] I look at I say yes yes yes you're okay.
[2699.0s] Then she says I have already chosen my
[2702.9s] photograph.
[2704.4s] I have already chosen my clothes to wear
[2709.0s] in that suitcase.
[2711.2s] Choosing a photograph
[2715.0s] and clothes
[2717.2s] I didn't like that topic. Said now what
[2719.3s] can we do for you? Said I want to be
[2721.3s] baptized.
[2723.6s] Okay, that's that's a good thing. That's
[2725.7s] a good thing. Um
[2728.2s] uh yes we can baptize you but
[2732.6s] how come?
[2734.8s] You mean you have not been baptized? The
[2736.6s] pastor was baptized many years ago but
[2739.0s] since then until now so many things have
[2741.4s] happened. Now listen to this and God has
[2745.4s] told me unless I am baptized I cannot
[2749.9s] see the kingdom of heaven.
[2753.0s] How do you behave when you talk to
[2754.3s] someone who talks to God directly?
[2758.0s] What do you do when the one talking to
[2760.7s] you tells you God has told me? What do
[2763.1s] you do?
[2765.6s] God,
[2767.6s] it's 8:00 p.m. baptism.
[2772.5s] Okay. Okay. Okay. All right. All right.
[2774.2s] All right. In the Bible, we have
[2776.0s] rebaptism. We will we can do rebaptism.
[2778.8s] And now that you have requested for that
[2781.0s] uh we will do that um the first thing
[2783.7s] tomorrow morning uh on Friday come
[2786.8s] meeting week or we can do it on Sabbath.
[2789.4s] He said no no no pass do it now
[2793.8s] said no no what we can do because now
[2795.6s] you know it's hard to find water in that
[2797.0s] area there's no lake there's no river
[2799.0s] the Indian Ocean is far and there's no
[2801.2s] pool of water and there was no tank of
[2803.1s] water no water you you know you
[2805.7s] reasoning no right now because it's at
[2808.2s] night and and because there's no water
[2811.0s] around h what the only you can do early
[2814.8s] tomorrow morning we will be we'll begin
[2816.8s] with your rebaptism said pastor uh
[2819.7s] tomorrow will be too late.
[2823.4s] So I turn to my fellow pastor, hey
[2824.7s] pastor, say something. You can't be here
[2826.2s] and you're keeping quiet. You came to
[2828.5s] help me here. Hey pastor, I mean my
[2830.5s] sister, what the pastor is saying, you
[2832.6s] know the only way we can do this, we can
[2834.8s] do it tomorrow.
[2837.1s] And the young lady said, "Pastor, if you
[2839.8s] are not willing to baptize me now, you
[2841.6s] can leave. I will not talk to you
[2843.5s] again."
[2845.1s] the wrong person. Oh no no no I
[2847.1s] remembered you know in this church we
[2849.4s] the pastor cannot make a decision. It is
[2851.5s] the the church board and they have
[2853.2s] elders there give us a minute to go and
[2855.3s] console went back to the sitting room
[2856.8s] and when we entered the sitting room the
[2859.0s] entire team stood in attention stood up.
[2862.6s] The question was what has he said? Okay
[2865.5s] sit relax.
[2868.0s] She has said
[2870.2s] she wants to be baptized
[2873.0s] now.
[2875.0s] Okay. So the first question is
[2879.4s] everybody lift it up. Second question
[2882.9s] when? Tomorrow
[2886.5s] said but but she has said she has
[2888.2s] cautioned us tomorrow. She wants to
[2891.3s] baptize now. The mother said,
[2901.3s] "Okay, okay. So, baptism is tomorrow." I
[2903.9s] said, "Okay, now relax. Let's take the
[2905.7s] report. This is a collective report." We
[2907.4s] went back this to the room and when she
[2909.9s] saw us back, she sat again on her bed.
[2912.7s] Okay, pastor. Will you baptize me? Said,
[2916.6s] "No, I have good news. the entire team
[2919.6s] has accepted your rebaptism. The first
[2922.7s] thing tomorrow morning is your
[2925.1s] rebaptism. And she looked at me and
[2927.4s] said, "Pastor, tomorrow will be too
[2929.7s] late."
[2931.2s] Then she sat up again. You want to sing?
[2933.8s] Said, "Yes." Then he said, "Sing for me
[2936.6s] the song which says
[2939.1s] Narudi,
[2940.8s] I've wandered away from God." So when
[2944.2s] she said in the contents there's no
[2948.6s] title. So I went quickly.
[2954.2s] Then I said no no.
[2964.1s] As we were talking our voices were heard
[2965.8s] in the sitting room. So another lady
[2967.4s] came. What is the problem? And she wants
[2969.8s] a song which says Narudi. and she knew
[2971.6s] where the song could be found. I'm happy
[2974.4s] the song has got five stanzas.
[2977.2s] I've wandered away from God.
[2980.0s] Can we sing that song?
[2982.3s] Just the first and the last verse as I
[2985.4s] finish.
[2987.0s] I've wandered away from God. Now I'm
[2990.0s] coming home. As we sing that song,
[2994.9s] put your feet into our shoes. Let these
[2999.0s] words be
[3001.1s] the prayer of your heart. I've wandered
[3003.4s] away as a steward. Wandered away as a
[3006.6s] Christian.
[3008.2s] I've been wayward in my ways. But now I
[3011.0s] am coming home.
[3013.1s] The first and the last stands.
[3032.2s] I've wondered far away from home.
[3039.0s] Now I'm coming home.
[3044.6s] The parts of sin too long have drawn.
[3051.4s] Blood and coming home.
[3057.8s] Coming
[3059.4s] home.
[3061.1s] Coming home.
[3064.4s] Never more to roll.
[3071.0s] Open wide thy arms of love.
[3077.6s] Lord I'm coming
[3080.9s] home.
[3085.2s] Thank you.
[3087.4s] I'm so happy that that song has got five
[3089.5s] stanzas.
[3092.6s] As we sang the first stanza,
[3095.6s] my eyes were glued into her eyes.
[3099.6s] I could see some brightening in her
[3101.7s] face, shining light in her face like she
[3106.2s] was forcing a smile out as a son. I've
[3109.3s] wandered away from God now. I'm coming
[3111.0s] home.
[3112.7s] The fifth stanza
[3114.8s] after finishing singing that song. These
[3117.4s] are the words that she spoke and now I
[3122.2s] feel that I am close to Jesus.
[3126.9s] And so we prayed and then she went back
[3131.0s] to sleep and we left.
[3134.8s] When we came to the sitting room they
[3136.2s] stood again in attention.
[3138.3s] They said so what is the way forward?
[3141.4s] said, "No, there's nothing we can do.
[3143.0s] Let's let's meet tomorrow." Then the
[3144.8s] parents said, "Pastor, you're not
[3145.8s] leaving. You will sleep here today
[3148.6s] because when she wakes up, she will call
[3150.3s] on your name. Sleep here. We don't sleep
[3153.9s] just anywhere anyhow."
[3156.1s] I said, "No, I'm going home." I was now
[3158.4s] a little upset because of the whole
[3160.2s] scenario. She had asked for her pastor
[3163.3s] many days ago.
[3165.5s] Then they said, "Now, because you are
[3167.0s] leaving, you are insisting to leave, you
[3168.6s] have to write a letter. When she wakes
[3170.0s] up, we don't talk to her. I give her
[3171.4s] your letter. Okay, I went to school.
[3173.7s] Give me the letter. The the characters.
[3176.8s] Give me katas.
[3179.0s] My dear sister in the Lord.
[3182.6s] My prayer is that God sustains you until
[3185.1s] we meet you in the morning and witness
[3187.8s] your rebirth and your rebaptism.
[3190.7s] May God sustain you. May God heal you.
[3192.8s] May God bless you in the name of Jesus.
[3195.0s] yours in the vineyard and I signed it as
[3197.6s] if it would be taken to the post office
[3200.6s] left it with them said okay we are going
[3202.6s] now left went home went to my house but
[3206.7s] the whole of this scenario is playing in
[3209.2s] my mouth why how why they why didn't
[3212.8s] they tell me earlier slept I don't know
[3216.2s] whether I slept 4:00 a.m. in the morning
[3219.4s] and the Holy Spirit is waking me up. I
[3221.1s] says, "You can't sleep now. You got to
[3223.4s] wake up and pray." So I woke up in the
[3226.3s] morning and I knelt down and I was
[3228.5s] praying, "Oh Lord, in the name of Jesus,
[3231.7s] please sustain your daughter. Preserve
[3234.6s] her life." I prayed, wrestling between
[3238.1s] life and death. And when I said amen and
[3240.7s] rose on my knees, I felt like I have
[3242.8s] lost the battle. Lying on my bed,
[3246.7s] I receive a phone call. The first
[3248.6s] earliest phone call in my life from my
[3251.0s] elder. Pastor, how are you? Say, I'm
[3253.7s] fine, elder. How are you? I'm fine. Oh,
[3256.6s] do you remember the girl we prayed for
[3259.2s] yesterday? And yes, tell me about it.
[3263.3s] She has left us.
[3266.3s] So, Friday morning, we go there and I'm
[3269.5s] keen to know whether she read my letter.
[3272.7s] So, as I enter into the gate, this lady
[3275.8s] comes, she's crying,
[3280.4s] Then I go, but I'm keen. I want to know
[3282.2s] the story. So what happened? And I'm
[3284.2s] told at exactly 3:00 a.m. she woke up
[3288.2s] and she called for the pastor. There was
[3290.4s] no pastor.
[3292.3s] One day you will call for the pastor.
[3294.4s] There will be no pastor.
[3297.3s] Call for the pastor now when it can be
[3299.4s] found.
[3300.9s] They said
[3303.4s] they brought the letter to her. So she
[3305.1s] read the letter, "My dear sister, in the
[3308.2s] name of Jesus,
[3310.6s] and after finishing reading the letter,
[3313.0s] she threw it away and said, it will be
[3316.0s] too late."
[3318.5s] She called her mother to come and help
[3320.2s] her pray.
[3322.0s] The mother came, they began to pray. She
[3324.9s] realized the mother cannot continue with
[3327.9s] prayer in that atmosphere.
[3333.4s] and she knelt down and prayed until she
[3337.6s] slept.
[3342.6s] One day the last song will be sung. The
[3346.2s] question is, will your heart be all
[3347.6s] right? One day the last prayer will be
[3350.2s] done. The question is, will your heart
[3353.1s] be all right? One day the last appeal
[3355.9s] will be made and the question remains,
[3358.9s] will your heart be all right? How have
[3361.2s] you prepared yourself for the kingdom?
[3362.7s] Jesus is coming. Remember the last
[3364.1s] question she's asking for? Heaven.
[3368.4s] Shall we stand?
[3370.6s] Shall we stand?
[3377.6s] I remember the words of Jesus. He says,
[3379.4s] "Here are those who are faithful lady
[3381.0s] things. Enter ye into unto the kingdom
[3382.5s] of your father prepared for you since
[3384.4s] the laying of the foundations of the
[3385.6s] earth." As we sing the closing song,
[3389.8s] if it is your desire this afternoon,
[3391.8s] this morning,
[3394.2s] you want to make a a a unique choice,
[3396.7s] you want to make a a strange decision
[3401.3s] today, you want to say, "Lord, today I
[3404.1s] want to surrender fully to you.
[3408.1s] I want to cling to you and I will not
[3411.0s] let you go anymore."
[3415.4s] as we sing that song.
[3418.2s] If that is your prayer,
[3420.8s] I will make an appeal at the end
[3437.8s] from God.
[3440.2s] Now I'm coming
[3443.1s] home
[3445.8s] the path of sin too long of joy.
[3453.1s] Lord I'm coming
[3456.3s] home.
[3459.8s] Coming
[3461.4s] home.
[3463.1s] Coming
[3464.6s] home.
[3466.6s] Ever more to roy
[3477.9s] of love.
[3480.0s] Lord
[3486.9s] preedious.
[3494.1s] Now I'm coming
[3497.2s] home.
[3500.0s] I now repent
[3503.9s] with
[3505.6s] a tease.
[3507.8s] Lord, I'm coming
[3511.2s] home.
[3514.8s] Coming
[3516.3s] home.
[3518.3s] Coming
[3519.8s] home.
[3521.9s] Ever more to roll.
[3528.8s] Oh,
[3531.8s] thy arms of love.
[3535.8s] Lord, I'm coming
[3539.4s] home.
[3542.2s] I'm tired of seeing and streng
[3548.2s] Lord.
[3550.1s] Now I'm coming
[3553.4s] home.
[3556.4s] I'll trust thy love.
[3560.4s] Believe
[3561.9s] thy word.
[3564.2s] Lord, I'm coming
[3567.8s] home.
[3571.4s] Coming
[3573.1s] home.
[3575.1s] Coming
[3576.7s] home.
[3578.8s] Ever
[3580.3s] more to go.
[3585.8s] Oh
[3587.5s] w the arms of love.
[3593.0s] Lord I
[3600.6s] as we sing the last song. The last
[3602.3s] verse.
[3604.6s] As you sing the last verse
[3608.0s] and you feel you need to recommit your
[3609.7s] life to Jesus,
[3612.2s] you feel you need to surrender one more
[3613.8s] time to Jesus.
[3619.0s] I want to give you this opportunity for
[3620.6s] a special prayer.
[3622.8s] I want you to make a step of faith and
[3625.4s] move to the front.
[3629.4s] You want to recommmit your life to
[3630.8s] Jesus.
[3632.3s] You want a special prayer this morning
[3635.4s] in your Christian journey, your
[3637.2s] Christian walk,
[3640.2s] you are saying, "Lord, I'm coming home."
[3643.6s] Open your arms of love
[3647.3s] for I am coming home.
[3649.4s] I want to pray with you.
[3660.3s] I want to make an appeal this morning.
[3662.2s] You want to make a commitment and a
[3664.3s] commitment to God. And let me address
[3667.1s] those who have not yet been baptized. If
[3668.8s] you're in the congregation and you're
[3670.1s] saying, "Lord, if you give me the next
[3672.3s] opportunity, the next available
[3673.8s] opportunity, I'm willing to be
[3675.1s] baptized." If you're there in the
[3676.6s] congregation, can see your hand up. And
[3678.6s] I see your hand up. You're saying, "The
[3679.9s] next available opportunity, I've not
[3681.4s] been baptized. I don't want to miss it.
[3683.2s] I'm willing to give my heart to Jesus
[3684.9s] Christ because I want my name to be
[3686.6s] recorded in heaven." Can I see a hand in
[3688.6s] the congregation? Not yet baptized. Not
[3692.1s] yet baptized. You are saying the next
[3694.1s] available opportunity is mine because I
[3696.2s] want to record my name in the kingdom of
[3698.8s] heaven. Not yet baptized. Can I see your
[3700.9s] hand up? Just lift up your hand. Lift up
[3703.0s] your hand. You still have pastors who
[3704.4s] can baptize you before time comes when
[3706.4s] there's no pastor baptiz you. Is there a
[3708.0s] hand in the congregation saying, "Not
[3709.8s] yet baptized, but one day soon I want to
[3712.2s] baptize. I want to give my heart to
[3713.6s] Jesus." Can I see a hand in the
[3715.0s] congregation? Anybody in the
[3716.7s] congregation?
[3720.2s] All right. Now, you are there in the
[3721.5s] congregation and you're saying, "Lord, I
[3723.0s] want to be committed as faithful steward
[3725.0s] from today. I've been wondering left,
[3728.0s] right, and center, but I want now from
[3729.6s] today be committed as a faithful
[3732.1s] steward." Can I see your hand up? Lift
[3734.8s] up your hand as we pray. Lift up your
[3737.1s] hand as
[3740.4s] Gracious loving Lord, we thank you this
[3742.9s] morning. Thank you, Jesus.
[3745.8s] for your sacrificial love. Thank you for
[3749.7s] leaving the throne and coming down to
[3752.0s] die for us. Thank you for giving all
[3755.3s] and giving your life and giving your
[3758.1s] blood.
[3759.7s] This morning we are lifting up our hands
[3761.7s] because you have spoken to us. We want
[3763.5s] our names to be recorded in heaven. And
[3766.6s] we know it can be done as we believe in
[3769.8s] you. It can be done as we confess our
[3771.6s] sins. It can be done as we choose to
[3773.0s] obey you. It can be done as we choose to
[3775.3s] be faithful as stewards. As we commit
[3777.0s] our lives to you fully, these hands are
[3779.8s] a testament and a promise that from
[3781.9s] today we are choosing Jesus. We are
[3783.8s] choosing to commit our lives fully to
[3785.4s] Jesus. And we pray that as we do this
[3788.2s] Lord also reciprocate by writing our
[3791.0s] names in the book of life. Thank you
[3793.3s] Jesus for hearing. Thank you for
[3794.8s] answering our prayer this afternoon.
[3796.8s] Bless the leadership of this church.
[3798.2s] Bless the members of this church. Bless
[3800.2s] everybody who is under the sound of my
[3802.0s] voice either here present or those who
[3804.0s] are online who have been following this
[3805.4s] message. I pray dear Lord that a special
[3807.6s] blessing may be given unto them. Thank
[3809.3s] you Jesus for answering our prayer and
[3811.1s] thank you because our names are now
[3812.6s] written in the books of heaven. Keep us
[3814.4s] faithful until when you shall come again
[3816.2s] so that when you come you will come and
[3817.6s] take us home. It is my prayer in the
[3819.3s] name of the father, the son and the holy
[3821.2s] spirit. And let every believing saint
[3823.0s] say amen. Amen.
