We are praying for our brothers and sisters who are abled differently. We are praying for our brothers and sisters who are abled differently. And before I pray, I'd like us to read the scripture reading and then we'll uh have a moment for prayer. Our scripture reading is going to come from the book of Titus. The book of Titus chapter 2 from verse 11-13. Titus chapter 2 from verse 11-13. And it reads, "For the grace of God that bringeth salvation has appeared to all men, teaching us that denying ungodliness and worldly lusts, we should live soberly, righteously and godly in the present world, looking for that blessed hope and the glorious appearing of the great God and our savior Jesus Christ. May the Lord bless the reading. At this point in time, I'd like us to humble ourselves. For those in the congregation, kindly, let's stand and uh share a word of prayer. Heavenly Father, we thank you, we praise you, we honor you for this blessed day that you've given us despite the challenges that we're going through politically, socially, physically, spiritually. Dear God, we give you thanks for the blessed gift of life that you've accorded us. Many would have loved to see this day, but again because of one reason or another, they were not able to. And for that, we don't take it for granted. We give you thanks for the blessed day that you've given us that we can be able to come together during this midweek to just come back to you and give you thanks for the half of the week that you've actually taken care of us. Dear God, we pray for those who are sick. There are many of our members who are not feeling well. Some of them are bedridden in hospital, some in their homes, we pray this evening, dear God, that as we give the supplications of prayer, may your blessings be upon each and every one of them in a special way. Send your holy presence in that person and help them to be able to come out of that bed victorious and even give a testimony for the great gift of health that you've accorded them. Dear God, there are many who are searching for provisions financially, physically, and they're not able to. We bring them before you this evening, dear God, that may please provide for them in a special way. For those who are searching for jobs, may you answer their prayers, dear God. And for those who are seeking promotions in whatever manner, dear God, may your will be done in their in their lives. Dear God, we also pray for those who have lost their loved ones. We give you thanks for allowing us to be able to celebrate lives of those who have been with us. And we pray that you may be with the families that have lost their loved ones at this particular point in time when nothing is making sense. But again, with you everything will indeed come to an end. And we'll be able to also look forward to coming your coming where there'll be no more death and there'll be no more sorrow. Dear God, this month we're giving you thanks for those who have been abled differently. And we pray that may please use them in a special way as they continue to minister in various manners or or within the sanctuary. We pray that dear God, may your presence be among them. May they minister to those who are like them. And as we also look at them, we pray that may you please also help them to be able to understand that indeed you have a purpose for them in life. Dear God, there are those who in the sanctuary who are yearning to just come to you and give you thanks for what you've done in their lives. We give you thanks. We give you praise. For our speaker, Elder Joshua Beni, as he stands to minister unto us, dear God, I pray that you may send your holy presence to guide him. May you please send your spirit to hoover around him that whatever is going to be able to speak, may it come from your throne of grace. And to those who are going to be able to hear this message, may it make them to become better people in their lives. And they can also minister to those who do not know you. We pray for your presence this night, dear God, that as we continue to listen in, may your blessings be upon each and every viewer who is out there. Provide for them in all the aspect of needs they need. Dear God, I pray that you may provide according to your will. Bless us this evening now and forever more. For we pray this believing and trusting in the wonderful name of our Lord Jesus Christ and Savior. Amen. We want to thank God for the opportunity to learn together. And this evening in particular, I want us to appreciate what God has done for you to be in the church today and to be on this world since you were born. What's God's will to you? What is God's will to me and to all of us as we are adults and as we are children? You remember most of us we write a will at a particular time you feel you want to identify what your property is and then you decide how to distribute it. You write a legal will and in most cases you keep it with a trusted lawyer and so that when you die your property which you have worked for can be handed over to those you preferred to receive these gifts. So when God created an opportunity for Christ to come, what was the agenda for Christ to come on this earth? A key text which we read from the book of 2 Titus chapter Titus chapter 2 verse 11-13 was very particular. Paul writes to Titus saying, "For the grace of God that bringeth salvation had appeared to all men, all people, teaching us that denying ungodliness, while last we should live soberly, righteously and godly in the present world. This is a message of salvation. When Jesus came to this world, God has given him an assignment specifically from creation appreciating that there will be sin on this earth. And this is what Christ came to do on this earth. And the Lord's will was for all of us to repent our sins and be saved. To repent our sins and be saved. As Peter explains in 2 Peter chapter 3:9, God's will for our life, each one of us, is a plan that God has for us all to be saved. And that is our lifestyle, saved men and women. When you look at the book of John chapter 6 verse 37-39 John chapter 6 verse 6-39 Jesus said I have come to do the will of my father. I have come to do the will of my father. All that the father giveth me shall I come to came come to me and him that cometh to me I will not wise cast out I came down from heaven not to do my own will but the will of him that sent me and this is the father's will which had sent me that all which he had given me I should not lose nothing but should raise it up again at the last day. For a deeper understanding, Jesus said, "I have come to do the will of my father." So on this earth, you and me, we have to do the will of our father. And what is the will of our father? Is for us to be saved. And once we are saved, what do we do? We do the same. Let others know what we know about Christ is dead on the cross and the repentance that he has extended to all of us. When we decide that by faith we believe that he did this for us and we confess our sins and turn away from them. It is this situation that I we are all encouraged and if we are encouraged to stay on this path, we have to learn obedience. We have to learn submissiveness. What the father has taught us as we read in the book of second Timothy, second Titus, Titus, Titus chapter 2, sorry, Titus chapter 2 verse 11-3. He set an example for us, Jesus Christ. Jesus said in the book of Jo in in the in the book of uh of of John chapter 4:34, Jesus said to them, "My food is to do the will of him who sent me and to finish his work of proclaiming salvation to all mankind." That's Christ's will. What is your will on this earth? What is your will? When you look at the book of 1 Timothy chapter 2 verse 3 and 4, the Bible reads like this. For this is good and acceptable in the sight of God our salvation, our savior. Sorry. who will have all men to be saved and to come unto the knowledge of the truth. That's God's will. All men to be saved and come to the knowledge of the truth. We are looking at Paul writing to Timothy. The same Paul writes in the book of Acts chapter 20 verse 24 that there's nothing so important in his own life as proclaiming the good message to all men if there's anything that I would like to do if there's any life I'm going to be given by God I would like to spend it to proclaim the good news to mankind the salvation of men. Is that your will? Is that your wish? Like Paul did himself and as he read to Timothy, looking at what Christ is coming out clearly when he when Matthew wrote in the book of uh Matthew 7:21, you can appreciate this. Not everyone that said unto me, Lord, Lord, shall enter into the kingdom of heaven, but he that doeth the will of my father which is in heaven. And what is the will of my father who in heaven? Timothy Titus Paul puts it this way. For the grace of God that bringeth salvation has appeared to all men, you and me, teaching us that denying ungodliness. And while lust, we should live soberly, righteously, and godly in this present world, looking for the blessed hope and the glorious appearing of the great God and our savior Jesus Christ. If for example Christ came tonight, shall we be looking forward to his coming tonight? Are we at the point we are saying every day we are looking forward for the blessed hope of Christ's second coming. If you look at Ephesians, Paul puts it this way. 5:1 17. Therefore, do not be foolish, but understand what the will of the Lord is. Don't act thoughtlessly, but understand what the Lord wants you to do. Don't live carelessly, unthinkingly. Make sure you understand what the master wants. Look at our own children. The child is born, does not know anything. The mother takes care of the child. The child starts walking. He has to be taught what to do. He goes to school. We have to guide him to know how to study as he's guided by the teachers. We have to guide him on how to dress. We have to guide him how to eat. We have to guide him, how to prepare his bed, how to wash his clothes. We have to teach him how to behave so that he can be a good child. So he can be a responsible child, somebody who is concerned about others. If the Lord has said help is provided through Christ for us to have a chance to understand Christ and his mission, it is free to all of us. And it is now that I have to make my decision and you no tomorrow. It is should be our lifeline our lives a continuous life to appreciate that there is the Lord's will to live as he has written in the word of God and his book. Paul puts it again in the book of Romans 12:1 and two. I beseech you therefore, brethren, by the mercies of God, that you present your bodies a living sacrifice, holy and acceptable unto God, which is your reasonable service. He's not talking of a one day. is talking full time that we present our bodies as a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable unto God, which is your reasonable service. That's my lifestyle. That's your lifestyle. and do not conform to this world, but be ye transformed by the renewing of your mind, that you may prove what is that good and acceptable, perfect will of God. Imagine you have a you are an employee at whatever level. There are guidelines how you report, what time, what working hours, what's your salary per day, per month, your allowances, your promotions, they all written and we stick to those regulations so that we be on safe ground. What about a Christlike child? There are guidelines. The Lord has given us a guideline how to live and he wants us to live in a particular way that we can be saved now and in the future and when Christ comes it will be a good a good meeting to appreciate that is the one we have been waiting if you are an employee and you don't keep the regulations you are demoted or sometimes you are sacked Christ gives us time. Even when I have committed sin, he gives me a chance to repent. He gives me a chance to confess my sins. And he says he remembers nothing if I for if I have done if I've confessed my sins genuinely and turned away from them. And if that's the case, I'm a child of God. who has guidelines on how to live and the way to live is basically to do God's will. The way to live is personal. And this personal life to live in accordance the will of God is going to be of benefit to others when you also mix with them. When you work with them, when you guide them in various stages, whether as a child or a junior member of your class or as a senior member of an organization, men and women who read what you do, you be a summoned to others. Why? Because you understand the will of God. Why did the Christ make it clear that he came specifically to do God's will? That does does in that give us an example that on this earth you are to do the will of God as a way of life as a priority so that many men and women can be saved. If we don't do that, preaching is not an easy option. The easy option is people witnessing your personal life. And when they now compare it with the word of God, they read for themselves and they can understand that this man, this woman, this teacher, this national the kids Kenyan, he knows God. And that's his lifestyle for others to read. I want to make it clear to all of us. God desires for us to live according to his will. God has extended his pathway and guidelines are very clear through Christ's personal life which is sent which is set for us. He gave us a model for us to follow. The model is to be obedient to God. The model is to seek his will at all times. The model is is to serve God as you serve men. It is a godly living on a daily basis, not only particular times of life. In the book of Hebrews chapter 10 verse 9, this is what Paul wrote as Christ said, "And behold, I have come to do your will, oh God, and it is written in the scroll concerning me." Christ said, "You shall be my witnesses." You shall be my witnesses. How shall I be a witness for Christ's work on this earth? Is through my ministry as I leave as I share the message that I have learned. As I share the message that I leave and then others will appreciate that there is God in heaven. Tonight I want to challenge all of us. What is your position on God's will to you? What is your concern? Yes, you can talk about the environment we are experiencing today. We are experiencing an a political environment. It's a concern. Does that help us to appreciate that the presence of God is what has brought us this far? Does it help you to appreciate that we need to pray for our nation? Does it make it easier for you to appreciate that we need to pray for our children? Because the will of God is to do what's right. The will of God is to appreciate that we have to live a righteous life. The will of God is to be one of humility to represent Christ in everything we do. As we sang this song, song number 602. 602. The song is pointing us to Christ's coming. Oh brother, be faithful. Soon Jesus will come. For whom shall we have waited so long? Oh, soon we shall enter into a glorious home and join in the Congress song. Oh brother, be faithful. For why should you prove and faithful to him who had shown you such deep such unbounded and infinite love who died to redeem us his own. This is the message I want to pass to all of us including me. Let us be faithful. Let us appreciate the will of God for mankind. and I am one of them and you are also one of of his own. When we close, I know that we don't we would have love to sing one song 319 and this 319 if you can sing at at at your own time at home and look at it. It has this message as it is 319 319 as it is pleading for God to help me. God to help you Lord. I want to be a Christian. Lord I in my heart I want to be a Christian. Lord, I want to be more loving in my heart. Lord, I want to be more holy in my heart. Lord, I want to be like Jesus in my heart is my prayer in Jesus name. Amen. God bless you. I would like us to stand and as we pray. Father God, we thank you for the opportunity to learn in thy presence. Jesus came to liberate us from sin. He sacrificed himself and died on the cross and he said it is finished. He had conquered sin. He had conquered death as he resurrected and told us that as you receive the Holy Spirit, he will be our comforter. He will remind us of all that you taught us which is in the Bible now. Father, you said you're going to prepare a place for us and you're coming again. You said that we be faithful witnesses on this earth and to practice as you had shown us. Father, help us to appreciate your will to be faithful, to live a Christlike life, to follow the guidelines which you gave us as it is written in the Bible and other books that you've made possible for us to read. That father we may be good examples for others. That we may attract others who don't know God because of our lifestyle and be able to share the same message we have with others because that's the role you have set aside for us children of God to learn to share and to make others ready for your second coming. The challenges we are facing which are distracting us from being faithful. Oh Lord, we pray Lord that you keep us on course. Thy presence makes a difference. We know we'll be successful in thy presence. Thank you for those of us who have been able to come to the church today. Thank you for those who have been able to watch online. Bless each one of us. Remind us our role on this earth is to do the will of God is my prayer in Jesus name. Amen. We thank the Lord for Elder John Oeni and we thank you very much for ministering unto us and reminding us that indeed we need to be faithful. It's my prayer that all of us who are tuning in, the Lord will use us and actually renew us to be able to know what exactly is the will of God in our lives. We've come to the tail end of this prayer session. And uh before we wrap up, I just want to give a highlight on the announcement that we will have our midweek prayer again next week on Wednesday from 5:30 p.m. You're all invited both physically and virtually. You can also tune in and join us on Sabbath this coming Sabbath as we'll be having our Sabbath program from 8:00 a.m. All of you are invited to tune in. Uh for those who are sharing in your prayer requests, we pray that God may actually answer your prayers in a special way. For now, I request to all stand and share the words of the grace.

[374.2s] that you've given us despite the
[376.2s] challenges that we're going through
[378.5s] politically, socially, physically,
[381.9s] spiritually. Dear God, we give you
[384.2s] thanks for the blessed gift of life that
[385.8s] you've accorded us. Many would have
[387.8s] loved to see this day, but again because
[389.9s] of one reason or another, they were not

[394.0s] for granted. We give you thanks for the

[400.1s] midweek to just come back to you and
[401.9s] give you thanks for the half of the week
[404.2s] that you've actually taken care of us.
[406.5s] Dear God, we pray for those who are
[408.7s] sick. There are many of our members who
[410.7s] are not feeling well. Some of them are
[412.6s] bedridden in hospital, some in their
[414.9s] homes, we pray this evening, dear God,
[417.7s] that as we give the supplications of
[420.4s] prayer, may your blessings be upon each
[422.9s] and every one of them in a special way.
[425.2s] Send your holy presence in that person
[427.6s] and help them to be able to come out of
[430.0s] that bed victorious and even give a
[431.9s] testimony for the great gift of health
[434.6s] that you've accorded them. Dear God,
[437.1s] there are many who are searching for
[438.5s] provisions financially,
[440.8s] physically, and they're not able to. We
[444.0s] bring them before you this evening, dear
[445.9s] God, that may please provide for them in
[447.8s] a special way. For those who are
[449.3s] searching for jobs, may you answer their
[451.4s] prayers, dear God. And for those who are
[453.3s] seeking promotions in whatever manner,
[455.4s] dear God, may your will be done in their
[457.2s] in their lives. Dear God, we also pray
[459.8s] for those who have lost their loved
[461.0s] ones. We give you thanks for allowing us
[463.4s] to be able to celebrate lives of those
[465.0s] who have been with us. And we pray that
[467.0s] you may be with the families that have
[468.4s] lost their loved ones at this particular
[469.9s] point in time when nothing is making
[472.6s] sense. But again, with you everything
[475.0s] will indeed come to an end. And we'll be
[477.1s] able to also look forward to coming your
[479.0s] coming where there'll be no more death
[480.6s] and there'll be no more sorrow. Dear
[482.6s] God, this month we're giving you thanks
[484.2s] for those who have been abled
[485.4s] differently. And we pray that may please
[487.7s] use them in a special way as they
[489.9s] continue to minister in various manners
[491.8s] or or within the sanctuary. We pray that
[494.4s] dear God, may your presence be among
[496.9s] them. May they minister to those who are
[499.9s] like them. And as we also look at them,
[502.6s] we pray that may you please also help
[504.9s] them to be able to understand that
[507.1s] indeed you have a purpose for them in
[509.0s] life. Dear God, there are those who in
[511.1s] the sanctuary who are yearning to just
[513.0s] come to you and give you thanks for what
[514.6s] you've done in their lives. We give you
[516.5s] thanks. We give you praise. For our
[518.5s] speaker, Elder Joshua Beni, as he stands
[520.6s] to minister unto us, dear God, I pray
[523.0s] that you may send your holy presence to
[524.8s] guide him. May you please send your
[527.0s] spirit to hoover around him that
[529.2s] whatever is going to be able to speak,
[531.1s] may it come from your throne of grace.
[533.0s] And to those who are going to be able to
[534.2s] hear this message, may it make them to
[537.6s] become better people in their lives. And
[539.4s] they can also minister to those who do
[541.1s] not know you. We pray for your presence
[543.2s] this night, dear God, that as we
[545.0s] continue to listen in, may your
[546.6s] blessings be upon each and every viewer
[548.4s] who is out there. Provide for them in
[551.0s] all the aspect of needs they need. Dear
[553.5s] God, I pray that you may provide
[555.1s] according to your will. Bless us this
[557.4s] evening now and forever more. For we
[559.4s] pray this believing and trusting in the
[561.4s] wonderful name of our Lord Jesus Christ
[563.4s] and Savior. Amen.
[566.0s] We want to thank God for the opportunity
[567.9s] to learn together.
[570.2s] And this evening in particular,
[573.1s] I want us to appreciate
[575.8s] what God has done
[578.3s] for you to be in the church today and to
[582.2s] be on this world since you were born.
[587.5s] What's God's will to you?
[591.1s] What is God's will to me
[594.5s] and to all of us
[597.5s] as we are adults and as we are children?
[603.6s] You remember most of us
[606.9s] we write a will
[610.6s] at a particular time you feel you want
[613.8s] to identify what your property is and
[618.0s] then you decide how to distribute it.
[621.3s] You write a legal will and in most cases
[626.7s] you keep it with a trusted lawyer
[630.6s] and so that when you die
[634.4s] your property which you have worked for
[637.6s] can be handed over to those you
[639.3s] preferred to receive these gifts.
[642.4s] So when God created an opportunity for
[646.3s] Christ to come,
[649.0s] what was the agenda for Christ to come
[651.0s] on this earth?
[653.3s] A key text which we read from the book
[656.5s] of 2 Titus
[659.3s] chapter
[661.7s] Titus chapter 2
[664.2s] verse 11-13
[667.8s] was very particular.
[671.8s] Paul writes to Titus saying, "For the
[675.0s] grace of God
[679.0s] that bringeth salvation had appeared to
[682.0s] all men,
[685.4s] all people,
[688.8s] teaching us
[690.8s] that denying ungodliness,
[696.2s] while last we should live soberly,
[701.7s] righteously
[704.5s] and godly in the present world.
[709.4s] This is a message of salvation.
[714.7s] When Jesus came to this world,
[718.1s] God has given him an assignment
[720.0s] specifically from creation
[724.7s] appreciating that there will be sin on
[726.6s] this earth.
[728.6s] And this is what Christ came to do on
[730.4s] this earth.
[732.6s] And the Lord's will
[735.8s] was for all of us to repent our sins
[741.0s] and be saved.
[743.8s] To repent our sins and be saved. As
[746.8s] Peter explains in 2 Peter chapter 3:9,
[752.5s] God's will
[755.3s] for our life, each one of us,
[759.4s] is a plan that God has for us all to be
[763.0s] saved. And that is our lifestyle,
[767.6s] saved men and women.
[771.2s] When you look at the book of
[774.5s] John chapter 6 verse 37-39
[779.2s] John chapter 6 verse 6-39
[784.4s] Jesus said I have come to do the will of
[787.8s] my father.
[789.8s] I have come to do the will of my father.
[795.2s] All that the father giveth me shall I
[797.1s] come to came come to me and him that
[800.4s] cometh to me I will not
[804.7s] wise cast out
[807.1s] I came down from heaven not to do my own
[811.6s] will but the will of him that sent me
[815.8s] and this is the father's will which had
[819.2s] sent me that all which he had given me I
[823.1s] should not lose nothing but should raise
[826.5s] it up again at the last day. For a
[831.0s] deeper understanding, Jesus said, "I
[833.4s] have come to do the will of my father."
[837.7s] So on this earth, you and me,
[842.5s] we have to do the will of our father.
[846.3s] And what is the will of our father? Is
[849.0s] for us to be saved.
[851.9s] And once we are saved, what do we do?
[855.6s] We do the same. Let others know what we
[859.3s] know about Christ is dead on the cross
[863.7s] and the repentance that he has extended
[866.6s] to all of us.
[868.6s] When we decide that by faith we believe
[872.4s] that he did this for us and we confess
[875.3s] our sins and turn away from them. It is
[878.4s] this situation that I we are all
[880.6s] encouraged
[882.3s] and if we are encouraged to stay on this
[885.2s] path, we have to learn obedience.
[889.0s] We have to learn submissiveness.
[891.9s] What the father has taught us as we read
[895.1s] in the book of second Timothy, second
[897.8s] Titus, Titus, Titus chapter 2, sorry,
[900.6s] Titus chapter 2 verse 11-3.
[908.7s] He set an example for us, Jesus Christ.
[914.9s] Jesus said in the book of Jo in in the
[917.7s] in the book of uh of of John chapter
[921.9s] 4:34,
[924.9s] Jesus said to them,
[927.8s] "My food is to do the will of him
[932.3s] who sent me and to finish his work of
[936.5s] proclaiming salvation to all mankind."
[941.0s] That's Christ's will.
[945.0s] What is your will on this earth?
[947.8s] What is your will?
[954.9s] When you look at the book of 1 Timothy
[956.7s] chapter 2 verse 3 and 4,
[963.0s] the Bible reads like this. For this is
[967.0s] good and acceptable in the sight of God
[969.7s] our salvation, our savior. Sorry.
[974.0s] who will have all men to be saved
[977.6s] and to come unto the knowledge of the
[980.0s] truth.
[981.6s] That's God's will.
[984.4s] All men to be saved and come to the
[987.7s] knowledge of the truth.
[991.5s] We are looking at Paul writing to
[995.9s] Timothy.
[998.2s] The same Paul writes in the book of Acts
[1002.0s] chapter 20 verse 24
[1004.9s] that there's nothing so important in his
[1007.3s] own life
[1009.4s] as proclaiming the good message
[1013.6s] to all men
[1015.7s] if there's anything that I would like to
[1017.4s] do if there's any life I'm going to be
[1020.2s] given by God I would like to spend it to
[1023.8s] proclaim the good news to mankind the
[1026.4s] salvation
[1028.2s] of men.
[1031.0s] Is that your will?
[1033.4s] Is that your wish? Like Paul did himself
[1036.7s] and as he read to Timothy,
[1041.0s] looking at what Christ is coming out
[1043.0s] clearly when he when Matthew wrote in
[1047.0s] the book of uh Matthew 7:21,
[1052.0s] you can appreciate this.
[1054.6s] Not everyone that said unto me, Lord,
[1057.4s] Lord, shall enter into the kingdom of
[1060.1s] heaven, but he that doeth the will of my
[1063.8s] father which is in heaven.
[1067.4s] And what is the will of my father who in
[1069.4s] heaven?
[1071.1s] Timothy
[1073.1s] Titus Paul puts it this way. For the
[1077.5s] grace of God that bringeth salvation has
[1079.8s] appeared to all men, you and me,
[1083.1s] teaching us that denying ungodliness.
[1086.2s] And while lust, we should live soberly,
[1090.6s] righteously,
[1092.2s] and godly in this present world, looking
[1095.8s] for the blessed hope and the glorious
[1098.8s] appearing of the great God
[1102.4s] and our savior Jesus Christ.
[1106.2s] If for example Christ came tonight,
[1110.9s] shall we be looking forward to his
[1112.5s] coming tonight?
[1115.1s] Are we at the point we are saying every
[1117.6s] day we are looking forward
[1120.6s] for the blessed hope of Christ's second
[1123.5s] coming.
[1127.8s] If you look at Ephesians,
[1130.2s] Paul puts it this way.
[1133.4s] 5:1 17.
[1135.8s] Therefore,
[1137.8s] do not be foolish,
[1143.6s] but understand
[1145.6s] what the will of the Lord is.
[1150.6s] Don't act thoughtlessly,
[1153.3s] but understand what the Lord wants you
[1155.4s] to do.
[1159.0s] Don't live carelessly,
[1161.9s] unthinkingly.
[1163.8s] Make sure you understand what the master
[1166.4s] wants.
[1168.1s] Look at our own children.
[1171.1s] The child is born,
[1174.2s] does not know anything.
[1176.6s] The mother takes care of the child. The
[1179.5s] child starts walking. He has to be
[1182.3s] taught what to do. He goes to school. We
[1186.8s] have to guide him to know how to study
[1191.1s] as he's guided by the teachers. We have
[1193.9s] to guide him on how to dress. We have to
[1196.8s] guide him how to eat. We have to guide
[1200.2s] him,
[1201.8s] how to prepare his bed, how to wash his
[1206.1s] clothes.
[1207.9s] We have to teach him how to behave
[1211.4s] so that he can be a good child. So he
[1215.2s] can be a responsible child, somebody who
[1218.3s] is concerned about others.
[1224.2s] If the Lord has said help is provided
[1229.8s] through Christ for us to have a chance
[1234.2s] to understand Christ and his mission,
[1238.9s] it is free to all of us.
[1242.6s] And it is now that I have to make my
[1244.8s] decision and you no tomorrow. It is
[1248.9s] should be our lifeline our lives
[1252.9s] a continuous life to appreciate that
[1256.5s] there is the Lord's will to live as he
[1260.5s] has written in the word of God and his
[1262.5s] book.
[1264.9s] Paul puts it again in the book of Romans
[1267.2s] 12:1
[1268.7s] and two.
[1270.6s] I beseech you therefore, brethren, by
[1273.8s] the mercies of God,
[1276.2s] that you present your bodies a living
[1278.7s] sacrifice,
[1280.4s] holy and acceptable unto God, which is
[1283.6s] your reasonable
[1285.4s] service.
[1288.8s] He's not talking of a one day.
[1293.0s] is talking
[1295.5s] full time
[1300.5s] that we present our bodies
[1303.4s] as a living sacrifice,
[1306.4s] holy, acceptable unto God, which is your
[1309.3s] reasonable service.
[1312.1s] That's my lifestyle. That's your
[1314.2s] lifestyle.
[1315.8s] and do not conform to this world,
[1319.0s] but be ye transformed by the renewing of
[1322.2s] your mind, that you may prove what is
[1326.7s] that good and acceptable,
[1329.8s] perfect will of God.
[1335.4s] Imagine you have a you are an employee
[1338.2s] at whatever level.
[1340.5s] There are guidelines
[1342.8s] how you report, what time, what working
[1345.4s] hours, what's your salary per day, per
[1348.8s] month, your allowances, your promotions,
[1352.3s] they all written and we stick to those
[1355.5s] regulations so that we be on safe
[1357.8s] ground.
[1359.8s] What about a Christlike child? There are
[1364.0s] guidelines. The Lord has given us a
[1366.9s] guideline how to live and he wants us to
[1369.9s] live in a particular way that we can be
[1372.8s] saved now and in the future and when
[1376.5s] Christ comes it will be a good a good
[1380.3s] meeting to appreciate that is the one we
[1383.0s] have been waiting
[1385.7s] if you are an employee and you don't
[1387.4s] keep the regulations you are demoted or
[1391.4s] sometimes you are sacked
[1395.5s] Christ gives us time.
[1399.0s] Even when I have
[1402.3s] committed sin, he gives me a chance to
[1405.1s] repent. He gives me a chance to confess
[1407.1s] my sins. And he says he remembers
[1410.2s] nothing if I for if I have done if I've
[1413.9s] confessed my sins genuinely and turned
[1416.6s] away from them. And if that's the case,
[1420.9s] I'm a child of God. who has guidelines
[1423.8s] on how to live and the way to live is
[1426.7s] basically to do God's will.
[1429.7s] The way to live is personal.
[1433.0s] And this personal life to live in
[1436.2s] accordance the will of God is going to
[1439.2s] be of benefit to others when you also
[1443.4s] mix with them. When you work with them,
[1446.8s] when you guide them in various stages,
[1450.3s] whether as a child or a junior member of
[1453.4s] your class or as a senior member of an
[1457.4s] organization,
[1459.0s] men and women who read what you do, you
[1462.5s] be a summoned to others. Why? Because
[1465.5s] you understand the will of God.
[1469.1s] Why did the Christ make it clear that he
[1471.9s] came specifically to do God's will?
[1476.2s] That does does in that give us an
[1478.5s] example that on this earth
[1482.0s] you are to do the will of God as a way
[1485.0s] of life as a priority so that many men
[1489.6s] and women can be saved.
[1492.9s] If we don't do that,
[1495.9s] preaching is not an easy option. The
[1499.5s] easy option is people witnessing your
[1502.2s] personal life. And when they now compare
[1505.0s] it with the word of God, they read for
[1507.6s] themselves and they can understand that
[1510.2s] this man,
[1512.1s] this woman,
[1514.0s] this teacher,
[1515.9s] this national the kids Kenyan,
[1520.3s] he knows God. And that's his lifestyle
[1524.3s] for others to read. I want to make it
[1527.8s] clear to all of us. God desires for us
[1533.0s] to live according to his will. God has
[1536.2s] extended his pathway and guidelines are
[1539.4s] very clear through Christ's personal
[1541.9s] life which is sent which is set for us.
[1546.6s] He gave us a model for us to follow.
[1551.9s] The model is to be obedient to God. The
[1556.0s] model is to seek his will at all times.
[1560.2s] The model is is to serve God as you
[1563.9s] serve men.
[1566.3s] It is a godly living
[1569.1s] on a daily basis,
[1571.6s] not only particular times of life.
[1575.8s] In the book of Hebrews chapter 10
[1579.0s] verse 9,
[1581.5s] this is what Paul wrote
[1585.2s] as Christ said, "And behold, I have come
[1589.0s] to do your will, oh God, and it is
[1592.5s] written in the scroll concerning me."
[1598.3s] Christ said, "You shall be my
[1600.2s] witnesses."
[1602.8s] You shall be my witnesses.
[1606.6s] How shall I be a witness for Christ's
[1608.6s] work on this earth? Is through my
[1612.6s] ministry as I leave as I share the
[1617.0s] message that I have learned. As I share
[1620.1s] the message that I leave and then others
[1624.0s] will appreciate that there is God in
[1627.0s] heaven. Tonight I want to challenge all
[1630.6s] of us.
[1632.6s] What is your
[1635.6s] position on God's will to you?
[1641.8s] What is your concern?
[1645.8s] Yes, you can talk about the environment
[1648.1s] we are experiencing today.
[1650.7s] We are experiencing an a political
[1652.7s] environment.
[1654.6s] It's a concern.
[1657.0s] Does that help us to appreciate that the
[1658.9s] presence of God is what has brought us
[1661.7s] this far? Does it help you to appreciate
[1664.4s] that we need to pray for our nation?
[1667.7s] Does it make it easier for you to
[1669.8s] appreciate that we need to pray for our
[1671.6s] children?
[1673.5s] Because
[1675.2s] the will of God is to do what's right.
[1679.4s] The will of God is to
[1683.2s] appreciate that we have to live a
[1685.5s] righteous life. The will of God is to be
[1690.2s] one of humility
[1693.0s] to represent Christ in everything we do.
[1697.8s] As we sang this song, song number 602.
[1704.9s] 602.
[1707.2s] The song
[1709.2s] is pointing us to Christ's coming.
[1714.6s] Oh brother, be faithful.
[1717.1s] Soon Jesus will come. For whom shall we
[1720.6s] have waited so long? Oh, soon we shall
[1724.5s] enter into a glorious home and join in
[1727.7s] the Congress song. Oh brother, be
[1730.6s] faithful. For why should you prove
[1735.2s] and faithful to him who had shown you
[1738.6s] such deep such unbounded and infinite
[1742.1s] love who died to redeem us his own.
[1747.5s] This is the message I want to pass to
[1750.8s] all of us including me.
[1753.8s] Let us be faithful. Let us appreciate
[1756.8s] the will of God
[1759.0s] for mankind. and I am one of them and
[1762.4s] you are also one of of his own.
[1767.8s] When we close,
[1771.2s] I know that we don't
[1775.6s] we would have love to sing one song 319
[1779.5s] and this 319
[1782.5s] if you can sing at at at your own time
[1785.0s] at home and look at it. It has this
[1787.8s] message
[1789.3s] as it is 319
[1793.1s] 319 as it is pleading for God to help
[1797.4s] me. God to help you
[1801.4s] Lord. I want to be a Christian.
[1805.0s] Lord I in my heart
[1809.0s] I want to be a Christian.
[1811.9s] Lord, I want to be more loving in my
[1815.6s] heart.
[1817.8s] Lord, I want to be more holy in my
[1819.9s] heart. Lord, I want to be like Jesus in
[1823.5s] my heart
[1826.5s] is my prayer in Jesus name. Amen.
[1831.8s] God bless you.
[1836.7s] I would like us to stand and as we pray.
[1847.4s] Father God,
[1850.5s] we thank you for the opportunity to
[1852.1s] learn in thy presence.
[1856.0s] Jesus came
[1858.8s] to liberate us from sin.
[1862.1s] He sacrificed himself and died on the
[1865.5s] cross
[1867.2s] and he said it is finished. He had
[1869.6s] conquered sin. He had conquered death as
[1874.0s] he resurrected
[1876.2s] and told us that as you receive the Holy
[1880.0s] Spirit, he will be our comforter.
[1883.9s] He will remind us
[1886.2s] of all that you taught us which is in
[1889.5s] the Bible now.
[1891.8s] Father, you said you're going to prepare
[1893.4s] a place for us and you're coming again.
[1897.3s] You said that we be faithful witnesses
[1899.3s] on this earth and to practice as you had
[1903.0s] shown us. Father, help us to appreciate
[1906.0s] your will to be faithful,
[1909.8s] to live a Christlike life,
[1912.7s] to follow the guidelines which you gave
[1914.6s] us as it is written in the Bible and
[1917.0s] other books that you've made possible
[1918.7s] for us to read. That father we may be
[1921.7s] good examples for others. That we may
[1924.5s] attract others who don't know God
[1927.2s] because of our lifestyle and be able to
[1931.4s] share the same message we have with
[1933.1s] others because that's the role you have
[1935.4s] set aside for us

[1942.2s] make others ready for your second
[1943.9s] coming. The challenges we are facing
[1946.6s] which are distracting us from being
[1948.6s] faithful. Oh Lord, we pray Lord that you
[1951.9s] keep us on course.
[1954.2s] Thy presence makes a difference. We know
[1957.3s] we'll be successful in thy presence.

[2009.3s] is the will of God in our lives. We've
[2012.0s] come to the tail end of this prayer
