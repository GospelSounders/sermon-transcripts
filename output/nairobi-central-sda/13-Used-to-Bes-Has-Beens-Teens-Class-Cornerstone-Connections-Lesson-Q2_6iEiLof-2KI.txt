Good afternoon, good morning from wherever you're watching us. This is Nairobi Central SDA Church class and um our mission has been in Thailand and today's mission being uh 28th of June we are going to look at uh the miracle at a sea and the story is about Jak. So let's pray before we start. Let's pray. Thank you dear Jesus for this day. Thank you for the gift of life. Thank you for the gift of uh the mission that you are about to study this morning. As we dive into the mission, I pray that you may guide us and protect us. For this we pray, trusting, believing in Jesus name we pray. Um a jakum is a traditional Indonesian boat. It looks like an ordinary canoe. It is long and narrow and often made of each side each side of the often made of of wood. On each side of the boat are long floats called autoiras. The auto tigers help help the boat keep its balance on the water and and not trip over. In the back of the jakung is a powerful outboard engine that propels the bo the boat forward. The jacon in this story look like an any river any any regular regular jakung. It was a special special color. It wasn't special. It wasn't a special length. It didn't have a special outboard engine. So um what this story is trying to tell us is um towards your 13th Sabbath offering will help us get a jacon for people to travel on. So let's pray. Thank you dear Jesus for this day. Thank you for the gift of life. Thank you for the gift of the mission that you have heard about the jacum. I pray that we may uh buy more jacombs for the people living in the median sea. I pray for everything uh about the mission for this prayer team believing in Jesus name we pray. Good morning, good afternoon and good evening. Thank you for joining us for our final lesson of this quarter, quarter two. And our title is used to be and has beans. That's a very long my mouthful title. And our theme for this quarter right behind us has been boundless freedom. Boundless freedom. Beside about the story of Christ when he began his ministry. Our last quarter was when Christ was a baby. This time is Christ in his ministry. So before we begin like to introduce our panelists. I'll start from my immediate right. Move towards the left. Hello everyone. My name is Silas. Good afternoon, good evening and good morning everyone. My name is Kevin. Hello everyone. My name is Seth Mukaya and I'm privileged to be here. Thank you. My name is Jonan Mana. I'll be moderating the lesson. I'd like to ask Silas to pray with us before we begin. Let's pray. Our kind and loving father, we thank you for this day. We thank you for this opportunity to read your word and discuss it. We pray that you may give us understanding in Jesus name I pray. Amen. Amen. Amen. Thank you. So just to tie up our lesson for last week was about faithful soldier, the centurion who um had faith more than Jesus had seen the whole of Israel. Now today's lesson is what happened after you were a demon-possessed man, a stormy sea, a lot of things that happened. So um we usually have a fundamental belief in each and every lesson. And our fundamental belief for this lesson is fundamental belief number 10, which is the experience of salvation. It's a very um iffy and very controversial topic. Most people don't really understand it about what salvation is, how salvation is to us. And before we get into that, just go to a lesson and we have an image there. Those who have accessed the lesson, there's an image right there and it shows uh a girl, two girls actually, but it seems like it's one girl in a different picture in a different way as well. What can you tell from that picture before we begin? Like I say, Calvin, what can you tell that picture? Um, I think from the picture, um, I can tell there's one photo whereby this girl is not smiling or maybe she's sad or probably annoyed. And there's another one where it seems that everything has changed and and and that girl is happy. So, one is not happy, sad. The other one is happy, smiling, and maybe seems to be satisfied. Okay, thanks for that. Silus, what can you tell from the image? Okay, from the image, I can tell that one person looks uh more docile than the other and the person in the background looks like they're admiring the life of the person in the light. Okay, that's a different perspective. admiring the light or the person the light herself. What What do you see? Um I think I see the girl is sort of happy. Happy. Yeah, he's happy. But uh the other hand, I see uh the girl is upset of something that might happened to her. Okay. During her life. Yeah. Right. Actually, I like that because it ties to a lesson, you know, used to be and has been. You like one is about her former life than what she is in the present. Thanks for that. So, we get into our key text. I'd like to ask um Silus read our key text for us. Those who do not have our lesson with you, our key text from the book of Luke 8 38 and 39. Luke 88 and 39. As Silas is uh reading that for us. Luke chapter 8 from verse 38 to 39 says the man from whom the demons had gone out to gone out begged to go with him but Jesus sent him away saying return home and tell how much God has done for you. So the man went away and told all over town how much Jesus had done for him. Thank you. So, this is the story of the demon-possessed man being healed. And we're going to see that in a bit. But before we get to that, you can just go straight to the what do you think section. What do you think section? I'd like to ask Seth to read out what is written there. Um the what do you think section indicate where you are on the continuation below the personal stories that other pe others tell about Christ that in inspire me the most tend to be dramatic long lifelong learning carnivorous Where why do you think that some believers have given grown up in Christ feel as if their experience is not as as amazing because it is not as dramatic explain what is what powerful about both terms types of experiences for me. Mhm. Um, I think I could go for a lifelong learning. Okay. Cuz through learning from Christ, Yeah. you get to be closer to him. Mhm. And I can I can see that uh that is one of the biggest lesson that I learned when I was away for some time for drama festivals like I was thinking about myself after watching my performance. If God wasn't there for all of us Yeah. we wouldn't have made it to where we are. All right. Thanks for that, Seth. Um, teacher Kevin, when someone is sharing about their how they met Christ, which story sticks out most to you? Someone who had a really dramatic conversion, say someone who was probably just about to take a sip of beer and then they hear a voice telling him, "Drop that." Or someone who's just telling you about how they grew up in the church, they've just known Christ all their life. Which one sticks out most to you? I I think for me and and and this is possibly for me and maybe for many I can't confirm that or maybe agree or disagree but I think for me the dramatic uh kind of a you know something that you know I I I was through this journey this is how my life used to be but after a certain conversation after going to this evangelistic campaign after meeting this brother or this sister then things change. I think that seems to be something that can really bring you along for me as opposed to this other one of ah you know me I've grown in church you know I just every Saturday or whichever day people go to church I've been a good person you know that one for me may not add up for many people and and possibly but this other one of a story of someone who has been through a certain challenge who was going through a challenge an addiction or possibly through a life that you look at it and you're like how did you come through? I think that will bring me closer to Christ than any other I think. Yeah. All right. Thanks for that. Now to to Silus, what I can ask you is um why do you think that especially people who've grown up in church feel like their experience is not as amazing enough and so they don't really share about Christ more in their personal life? Why do you think people feel like you need to have a very dramatic experience for you to actually meet Christ? Mostly it uh happens from how the how how you grew up. Mhm. How your parents made church seem to you like uh it could for some time it it is a burden most of the time as you grow up. So you look at it as I can do this, I can do that because of yeah I have to go to church, I have to consider what God likes. But uh for someone who has been out there, they know that they feel that this life is easier. It's more enjoyable than the life they lived. So we people who have grown in the church tend to look at it as what I don't have than what they have. And people who have grown up in the world think of it as what I have gained. Mhm. I like that. Thanks for that. And just to just clarify on that both experiences are actually very important. They have their advantages and disadvantages as well. You just read some expert from uh the teachers lesson. It says some positive aspects of growing up as a Christian can be one you have a rich background of information about Christ and your outlook is very hopeful and healthy. They tend to meet people who've grown up in church tend to meet challenges with a very hopeful outlook because since childhood they have seen how Christ has been there for them every single time. And you also don't get blown around by extremes as much. It's harder to sway someone who's been brought up in the church. Now, on the flip side, people who had a very dramatic conversion, they have a very deep hatred for the old life and sin, right? Um there there's a pastor I remember in our church one time, uh pastor Lyel, he used to tell us about how in his in his older times when he was in the world, quote unquote, he used to listen to rock music. So every time he'd sit in a place that plays such kind of music, even if it was in church, he'd always walk out because it reminded him of what his past life looked like. So people who had a dramatic experience often tend to have a very deep hatred for the older life and for sin. And they're also very passionate about Christ. When something you realize is most of the passionate preachers and evangelists, they had a very um dramatic change. Doug Bachelor for one. Yeah. He used to live a very rowdy life as a youth and he's one of the most passionate preachers and speakers right now. Found it amazing facts. Okay. So, both experiences very important to Christ and Christ reaches out to us. If even if you're brought up in church or even if you're outside church, Christ still looks for you wherever you are. Now, we can move into a lesson. And I'd like to ask Silas to give us a summary of our story. It comes from the book of Luke 8 26-39. So our story talks about when Jesus was casting demons out of a man and there were pigs. There were pigs close by and the demons begged Jesus to let them go into the pigs and Jesus did permit them to go and after that the pigs went into the lake and drowned themselves. And uh later on the people who were watching the pigs went to the authorities and reported it. And then Jesus left the place using a boot. And the people the person he had saved from the demonic possession uh wanted to go with him but he said no and told him to go to the city and tell others what he had seen. And at that moment the people who the authorities say that Jesus is is is not not is is is working with the demons casting a demon casting out a demon. Yeah. Yeah. Thanks for that Silus. And just to share the context um the background before that Christ was had been dealing with people questioning his authority including his own disciples doubting him. Remember right before Christ came to the shore and healed a demon-possessed man they had been crossing the lake there was a really bad storm and the disciples most of them who are were fishermen they were afraid. Now when you get to a point where a storm is bad to the extent that people who are always in the water are afraid that means it's bad and these guys forgot that Jesus is in the boat with them. Finally Jesus woke up calm the storm they went back and and the disciples questioned who is this man who tells the winds and the waves to come and they listen. So Christ was dealing with opposition from both sides. Now here he is again being chased after doing a good thing. It's a sad thing to think about, right? Let's answer some questions from the out of the story section. Okay. Um, first question I like to ask, let me just get it. Um, yeah. So, our lesson talks about the power Christ has over demon possession. And, uh, for some of us might seem really unreachable, like it's something that's farfetched nowadays. But there's a question here where we ask um based on what you observe in this story, how do the demons respond to the presence of Jesus? Silence. How do demons respond when Christ is in their presence? There are they're quite afraid of Christ because when when you know what what is right and you're in the wrong, you feel rebuked. Mhm. Yes. Mhm. So that it's their sense of wrongdoing that makes them feel afraid of Jesus like they should not be there. Yes. All right. Thanks for that. Seth, what do you think? How how how do demons respond when Christ is in their presence or why do they respond that way? M I think for me is um the demons are more afraid of the Holy Spirit. And you know when a person just comes into your life and acts as if he's one of the p most powerful preachers to come and cleanse the demons away from this person. Mhm. Of which the demons will eventually go. Yeah. But the demons are more afraid of the Holy Spirit and the Holy Spirit is God. Amen. Thanks for that. So it's the power behind the person who's casting them out. Thanks for that. Seth to Kevin, what are your thoughts? Probably can even tie to what Glen White speaks about on the same. Um I think for me this is more of like a burden. You see it is actually also written that there are also fellas um who went to cast out demons and they asked Christ we know so and so we know who are you who are you? Yeah and whatever happened is a story we wouldn't want to experience today. So that actually confirms to you that we live in a world whereby demon possession is real. True. It is real. Even in our church, you will hear of pastors going somewhere so that they have to sleep overnight praying for someone with a demon possession and those who go there are those who are strong. So that something doesn't happen and then this person is relieved and the demons come to you. True. So you will find that the demon possession aspect is not anything to be taken lightly. In the same way angels came from heaven and they came to this world and they know that their times their time is short the angels you know the fallen angels and that's why they are trying their very best to get to everyone and if possible as the Bible says the devil in this last day is trying to get to the most elect. So that means that the demons are real and should they get a chance and one of us has that possession then the people of God the men of God those who have faith as as has been something that we've been speaking the whole quarter then have to come out and pray in faith because they recognize and actually if I go to the spirit of prophecy whereby this week we studying from um um the dissolved ages of humble hero chapter 34 and 35 we get to learn about burdens. We get to learn about committing our burdens to Christ like uh the the we dissolve ages. That is the first verse says that come unto me only who are heavy laden and I will give you rest. And this actually comes from Matthew 11 28-30 and and these words are to be used as a comfort for the multitude that followed Christ. The savior had said that the only through himself could men receive a knowledge of God. True. There's a song that they have sung many a times that burdens are lifted at Calvary. You know, cast your burdens come to Jesus. You know that we are supposed to bring our burdens to Christ and he'll lift them. And you see in our world today, we have so many tribulations. So what the spirit of prophecy is trying to bring us in brief is that whether we are publicans, whether we are people in church, Mhm. Instead of carrying all these burdens with us like what the man who was possessed with demons who almost was cutting himself instead of carrying all these things to you're supposed to get them to the burden bearer and that is Christ Christ Jesus so that we don't get too much beaten by life beaten by troubles beaten by evil things and at the end we end up in in losing eternal life and that's why I want to read just a a simple thing from dissolve of ages that is 3:30 that says mhm I'm There are many whose hearts are aching under load of care because they seek to reach the world's standard. They have chosen its service, accepted its perplexity and adapted its customs. Thus, their character is mad and their life has made a weariness in order to gratify ambition. That is what most of us are looking for and worldly desires. They wound the concerns and bring upon themselves an additional burden of remorse. The continual worry is wearing out life forces. Our Lord desires them to lay aside the yoke of bondage. He invites them to accept his yoke. He says, "My yoke is easy and my burden is light." He beats them to seek first the kingdom of God and his righteousness. And his promise is that all the things needed for them for this life shall be added. But what is happening instead? What is blind and cannot discern the future. But Jesus seeks the end from the beginning. He sees our end. He sees the end of everything. In every difficulty he has his way prepared to bring relief. And lastly and not the least it says our heavenly father has a thousand ways to you who is following to provide for us of which we know nothing. So those who accent the one principle of making the service and order of God supreme will find perplexities vanish. So in a nutshell and from chapter 34 and chapter 35 simplified, we need to commit our burdens to God. Amen. As we seek whatever we are seeking, excellence, success and all this, we've been affirmed today that we need to commit our worries to God because worries will not take us anywhere but rather they will wear us out and we'll end up in getting astonished and maybe worn out. Amen. Thanks for that Kevin. And um just to just add something on that when the man that's in the book of Luke chapter 8 the exact verse is chapter 30 let me just read it as it is says to the the demon-possessed man Jesus asked him saying what is your name and he said legion because many demons had entered him now a legion in the Roman culture was made up of about 6,000 soldiers 6,000 soldiers were enough to to destroy an entire village. Okay? Now, imagine having about 6,000 demons in you. This was a man who was struggling. Every demon probably had its own desire, trying to hurt you, trying to hurt others. But Christ peered and looked into that man's heart and just found a very small space where Christ would reach to the conscience of this man. Mhm. That's the part that Christ reached out to. And so this man in answering Jesus, this was a cry for help. And Elen White speaks about it in Desire chapter 30 34 that is. And she speaks about how the cry for help does not go unanswered by God. Yeah. At times we might take up yolks on ourselves without knowing what really we're putting on ourselves. burdens and worries as shaven had mentioned before. But Christ wants to give us a yoke, his yoke that is light. Now people misinterpret that verse and think that the yoke that Christ is putting on us is meant to be slavery. But a yoke is put on an ox or donkeys to guide them. Without a yoke cannot really guide animals in the field to plow. So the yoke is meant to guide. Christ's yoke is easy. It's meant to guide us into the path that God wants us to be in. And as Chav has just read for us, God has a thousand and thousands of ways to provide for us that we have no idea about. Just imagine Seth. Yeah. God owns everything that you need. He's just waiting for you to ask him. Silus, that one thing you're lacking in your life, it's because you have not asked. And it's sad because in Christianity we tend to lose out a lot on that. We find troubles in life but we're so stressed up trying to figure them out in our own way. Case in point the demonpossessed man. Let me use him. He was put in chains. He was trying to break off from the chains. It could be the demons. It could be him just trying to get away from it all. But until he surrendered himself to Christ and just cried, "Help, help me." That is when he found truly relief. It's only in Christ that we find true peace and happiness. As we move on, I'd like us to read the flashlight. Like to ask Silus, read the flashlight for us. The flashlight says, "With authority, he made the unclean spirits come out of them. His word penetrated the darkened minds of the unfortunate men. They realized dimly that one was near who could save them from the tormenting demons. They fell at the Savior's feet to worship him. But when their lips were opened to entreat his mercy, the demons spoke through them. Thank you. Right. When Christ spoke, that's when the demons just got out and the people realizing the great miracle, they decided just follow Jesus' feet. Now a question we see after the story ends right after Christ has removed the demons from the mans to you Silas. The man wanted to follow Jesus but Christ told him no go tell the people what the Lord has done for you. Question one, why do you think he wanted to follow Jesus instead of remaining where he was? because he had he was afraid that uh what can I do if I'm back in that situation? True. So he wanted to follow Jesus to be sure that if he is back there, Jesus could save him again. True. I agree. Yeah. I mean if if someone saves you out of a very bad situation, you'll not want to go back there again. your PTSD and trauma. That's the same thing happened to this guy. But Christ told him to go and witness. Now, let me give a short story as we're about to wrap up. Story is told of a man. This was a pastor was giving his own personal story. Um, can you remember the pastor's name, but he's talking about how on New Year's Eve, he was driving to go shop. He was just a single man that time. He just moved into a new town. He actually had his wife, but his wife and the kids were away. So, he was trying to set up the house. And since he was alone at that time, wanted to do a little bit of shopping to just relax and wait for the new year. And as he was driving, he was about to he was on a bend and he just got rammed into on the side by another vehicle. Now, the person who was driving the other vehicle was an old lady about in her 80s. And a surprising thing happened. After the lady rammed his vehicle, she just stepped out of the car and walked out and went straight to the bank to do her business. Okay. Now, when the police officers came to the scene, they asked, "What happened here?" Mhm. And so, this this person was trying to explain himself that I was just driving and this the owner of this vehicle drummed into me. So, the policeman asked, "Where is she? Where is he?" And the the pastor said she just walked into the bank and they thought this guy was crazy. Then the old lady just walked out of the bank, came to the vehicle and her story was I was driving and this man is the one who hit me right now. Picture this, Kelvin. It's you. Yeah, you're a young man against a 70 or 80year-old fragile woman. Who looks more believable? It's the older woman. Definitely. And so the police officer believed that was a woman and the pass was about to be put in chains in handcuffs until someone who was just standing on the side came by and gave his story. I saw everything. I witnessed everything. That is what saved the pastor. Now do you see what a witnessing story does? The impact it has. That is what Christ wanted to teach his disciples as well. It's not just about when Christ saves you from his situation, you just follow him and not share your story. The reason why Christ saved you from that situation so that you can tell others what Christ has done to you. The greatest someone ever preached is some of the life well lived. Yeah. Very true. People connect more to personal stories than to what is in the Bible. Mhm. If silos to go and to share with the neighbors and tell them I was in such a situation Christ came through for me come see what he can do for you. That is what Christ desires. Not just opening a Bible and let's go to the book of revelation. So the mark of the beast says now you'll have little impact on that. So just to finish up our lesson like us to read the further insight. Like to ask Seth to read one of the further insights. Then Shelvin the second one as we get closing remarks on our story. Further insight. Um the father insight says the Lord saves us us we perish. Never did a a soul out that cry unhealed. Thank you. Unhealed. Mhm. Um Mhm. I think this applies to our daily lives as teenagers. Mhm. We tend to think that our parents actually know everything that we you go through. We go through. But in deep down in their hearts, they are trying to like get to know us better. Mhm. and get to know what actually we are going through in our lives. Yeah. Only God knows. Only God knows what we are going through in our lives. True. Thanks for that, Seth. Uh to check Kevin the second for the insight. Yeah, I think this one is a very interesting one. He says it is in the working to spread the gospel to spread the good news of the salvation that you are brought near the savior. That comes from dissolve ages page 339. So mostly to mean that in the doing in the spreading of the good news of salvation then we are brought near to the savior. So that means as in the previous last week's lesson whereby we got to learn that Christ spent most of his time doing good and you know reaching out to the people and that which they needed as opposed to possibly being in church or maybe preaching as we call it today. Then actually in those many ways that's how possibly many people got to come to Christ and got to know you because like in John 4:29 says come see a man who knew all the things I did who knows me inside and out do you think this could be the Messiah and they went all out to see for themselves that is John 4:29 and 30 so it's simple and clear that in in the example of our daily lives in us reaching out to spread the good news in going to hospitals and and of course looking back to what has been the global youth day that is the aspect of our community transformed in us being the transformation that we want and in us being the example that we want the world to see and by that way we get to bring more to Christ and we get to know him more so I think that's what I'd say and I'll challenge my follower and and and my viewer to go and actually also look at their lives and see how best they can serve they can serve and and do All right. Thank you for that. Silus, your parting comments from this lesson. I'd just say that when you go through something, most people are afraid to say what they go through because they because of being singled out and other things. Yeah. That happen when you share your story. But sometimes it helps people even though they're quiet, they they think about where they are and because someone else could have been there and could have made it or in a worse in a worse position got out. They have strength to fight whatever they're going through. And that's why Jesus told the man to go and share share what he knew what God has done for him. Amen. Thank you for that. And maybe before you wrap it up, I think on top of what he has said, I think it's important and something that I'm learning today and I think I had this statement previously that your personal story, you are the only one who can tell it and they cannot dispute it. They may dispute who you are called. They may dispute that much you've achieved in life and whatever you've done and maybe when you are born and when you are not born and all that but your personal story of how you came maybe to know Christ. Your personal story of how you came from wherever you are to where you are. How you used to be and now can never be disputed. So I believe in the personal testimony. I believe in that. And I think I would also want to challenge whoever comes across this lesson to look at their story. And even if no one thinks they know the Bible, just share your story. And that story will touch someone and that someone will touch another and that's how the gospel will go. That's how many others will get to have the faith that you have. Amen. Amen. Thank you so much for panelists for that. And uh thank you for joining us for the entire quarter. Looking forward to seeing you in the next quarter in the month of July. So just to urge you trust in God, call upon him. He always listens. There's not a a word of help that he not does not listen to. We'll close a word of prayer from Kevin. Let us h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h ourselves and we pray. Our father who art in heaven, we do come before you on this day. We want to thank you for you've led us. You've guided us and been with us, God. From the start of this lesson and equally from the start of the whole quarter, we've been learning about many disciplines and equally about many themes. We've learned about faith. We've learned about trusting God and about reaching out and and getting to the people and and serving them God. Today's lesson has been good. We've learned about the demonp possessed person who really wanted to get out of his situation and that he may follow Christ so that he can be a better person. Our prayer today is that God for each one of us there is that aspect of our lives that we would love change. There is that used to be that we love change to someone who is different. We are praying and trusting in you that you'll convert each one of us God that the challenges we may be going through, the battles we may be battling God possibly could be addition and whatever it is that we may be going through that you've told us today to commit ourselves to bring our burdens to you so that God we may push on with our journeys because we know that in your hands we are safe. in your hands. Our burdens have been taken care of and that we may continue being provided for and you may continue living a great life. We want to thank you for you've led us all the way from the beginning of the quarter and as we look forward into the next quarter. We trust that you shall see us through that you'll start with us and equally also end with us. We trust in your name. We thank you for listening to us and we praise you and we pray for your leading and in Jesus name we pray name we believe in. Amen. Amen. Amen. Thank you.

[131.6s] will help us get a jacon for people to
[138.4s] travel on.
[141.1s] So let's pray. Thank you dear Jesus for
[144.6s] this day. Thank you for the gift of
[146.2s] life. Thank you for the gift of the
[148.8s] mission that you have heard about the
[150.8s] jacum. I pray that we may uh buy more
[154.7s] jacombs for the people living in the
[158.0s] median sea. I pray for everything uh
[162.5s] about the mission for this prayer team
[165.2s] believing in Jesus name we pray. Good
[167.9s] morning, good afternoon and good
[169.8s] evening. Thank you for joining us for
[171.6s] our final lesson of this quarter,
[174.6s] quarter two. And our title is used to be
[178.8s] and has beans. That's a very long my
[182.3s] mouthful title. And our theme for this
[184.3s] quarter right behind us has been
[186.9s] boundless freedom. Boundless freedom.
[190.1s] Beside about the story of Christ when he
[192.6s] began his ministry. Our last quarter was
[194.6s] when Christ was a baby. This time is
[196.5s] Christ in his ministry. So before we
[199.4s] begin like to introduce our panelists.
[201.8s] I'll start from my immediate right. Move
[204.1s] towards the left. Hello everyone. My
[207.1s] name is Silas.
[210.4s] Good afternoon, good evening and good
[213.5s] morning everyone. My name is Kevin.
[216.1s] Hello everyone. My name is Seth Mukaya
[218.8s] and I'm privileged to be here. Thank
[221.2s] you. My name is Jonan Mana. I'll be
[224.1s] moderating the lesson. I'd like to ask
[226.2s] Silas to pray with us before we begin.
[229.5s] Let's pray. Our kind and loving father,
[232.6s] we thank you for this day. We thank you
[234.1s] for this opportunity to read your word
[238.2s] and discuss it. We pray that you may
[240.9s] give us understanding in Jesus name I
[242.9s] pray. Amen. Amen. Amen. Thank you. So
[246.7s] just to tie up our lesson for last week
[249.6s] was about faithful soldier, the
[251.4s] centurion who um had faith more than
[255.0s] Jesus had seen the whole of Israel. Now
[257.4s] today's lesson is what happened after
[260.2s] you were a demon-possessed man, a stormy
[262.4s] sea, a lot of things that happened. So
[265.7s] um we usually have a fundamental belief
[269.8s] in each and every lesson. And our
[272.5s] fundamental belief for this lesson is
[274.5s] fundamental belief number 10, which is
[276.9s] the experience of salvation. It's a very
[280.9s] um iffy and very controversial topic.
[283.5s] Most people don't really understand it
[285.8s] about what salvation is, how salvation
[290.4s] is to us. And before we get into that,
[293.4s] just go to a lesson and we have an image
[295.8s] there. Those who have accessed the
[298.2s] lesson, there's an image right there and
[301.7s] it shows uh a girl,
[305.8s] two girls actually, but it seems like
[308.3s] it's one girl in a different picture in
[310.9s] a different way as well. What can you
[313.4s] tell from that picture before we begin?
[316.1s] Like I say, Calvin, what can you tell
[318.3s] that picture? Um, I think from the
[322.2s] picture, um, I can tell there's one
[325.5s] photo whereby this girl is not smiling
[329.0s] or maybe she's sad or probably annoyed.
[331.7s] And there's another one where it seems
[333.5s] that everything has changed and and and
[336.2s] that girl is happy. So, one is not
[338.7s] happy, sad. The other one is happy,
[341.0s] smiling, and maybe seems to be
[343.0s] satisfied. Okay, thanks for that. Silus,
[346.7s] what can you tell from the image?
[350.4s] Okay, from the image, I can tell that
[353.8s] one person looks uh more docile than the
[357.9s] other and the person in the background
[360.9s] looks like they're admiring the life of
[362.6s] the person in the light. Okay, that's a
[365.1s] different perspective. admiring the
[366.3s] light or the person the light herself.
[368.1s] What What do you see? Um
[371.4s] I think I see the girl is sort of happy.
[377.7s] Happy. Yeah, he's happy. But uh the
[381.0s] other hand, I see uh the girl is
[385.7s] upset of something that might happened
[389.5s] to her. Okay. During her life. Yeah.
[392.5s] Right. Actually, I like that because it
[394.4s] ties to a lesson, you know, used to be
[396.3s] and has been. You like one is about her
[400.2s] former life than what she is in the
[402.1s] present. Thanks for that. So, we get
[403.6s] into our key text. I'd like to ask um
[406.3s] Silus read our key text for us. Those
[408.3s] who do not have our lesson with you, our
[411.3s] key text from the book of Luke 8 38 and
[414.6s] 39. Luke 88 and 39. As Silas is uh
[419.4s] reading that for us. Luke chapter 8 from
[423.5s] verse 38 to 39 says the man from whom
[428.0s] the demons had gone out to gone out
[432.1s] begged to go with him but Jesus sent him
[434.8s] away saying return home and tell how
[438.5s] much God has done for you. So the man
[440.9s] went away and told all over town how
[444.1s] much Jesus had done for him. Thank you.
[447.0s] So, this is the story of the
[448.8s] demon-possessed man being healed. And
[450.6s] we're going to see that in a bit. But
[452.6s] before we get to that, you can just go
[454.4s] straight to the what do you think
[455.9s] section.
[457.4s] What do you think section? I'd like to
[459.0s] ask Seth to read out what is written
[461.1s] there.
[462.6s] Um
[464.6s] the what do you think section indicate
[467.7s] where you are on the continuation below
[473.2s] the personal stories that other pe
[475.8s] others tell about Christ that in inspire
[480.0s] me the most tend to be dramatic
[485.6s] long lifelong
[487.9s] learning
[489.7s] carnivorous
[491.8s] Where why do you think that some
[495.0s] believers have given grown up in Christ
[498.9s] feel as if their experience is not as as
[504.2s] amazing because it is not as dramatic
[509.1s] explain what is what powerful
[513.9s] about both terms
[516.7s] types of experiences for me. Mhm. Um,
[522.7s] I think I could go for a lifelong
[527.0s] learning. Okay. Cuz through learning
[530.6s] from Christ, Yeah. you get to be closer
[534.2s] to him. Mhm. And I can I can see that uh
[541.2s] that is one of the biggest lesson that I
[544.5s] learned when I was away for some time
[549.8s] for drama festivals like I was thinking
[553.4s] about myself after watching my
[555.7s] performance. If God wasn't there for all
[559.0s] of us Yeah. we wouldn't have made it to
[562.6s] where we are. All right. Thanks for
[564.7s] that, Seth. Um, teacher Kevin, when
[568.5s] someone is sharing about their how they
[571.0s] met Christ, which story sticks out most
[574.2s] to you? Someone who had a really
[575.5s] dramatic conversion, say someone who was
[578.3s] probably just about to take a sip of
[580.2s] beer and then they hear a voice telling
[582.4s] him, "Drop that." Or someone who's just
[585.0s] telling you about how they grew up in
[587.2s] the church, they've just known Christ
[589.1s] all their life. Which one sticks out
[590.6s] most to you? I I think for me and and
[593.7s] and this is possibly for me and maybe
[596.1s] for many I can't confirm that or maybe
[599.2s] agree or disagree but I think for me the
[601.4s] dramatic uh kind of a you know something
[604.1s] that you know I I I was through this
[606.3s] journey this is how my life used to be
[609.8s] but after a certain conversation after
[613.7s] going to this evangelistic campaign
[615.7s] after meeting this brother or this
[617.8s] sister then things change. I think that
[619.8s] seems to be something that can really
[621.9s] bring you along for me as opposed to
[624.7s] this other one of ah you know me I've
[626.6s] grown in church you know I just every
[628.8s] Saturday or whichever day people go to
[630.9s] church I've been a good person you know
[634.2s] that one for me may not add up for many
[636.2s] people and and possibly but this other
[639.2s] one of a story of someone who has been
[641.6s] through a certain challenge who was
[643.8s] going through a challenge an addiction
[645.8s] or possibly through a life that you look
[648.2s] at it and you're like how did you come
[649.7s] through? I think that will bring me
[651.5s] closer to Christ than any other I think.
[654.2s] Yeah. All right. Thanks for that. Now to
[656.0s] to Silus, what I can ask you is um why
[660.3s] do you think that especially people
[662.5s] who've grown up in church feel like
[665.0s] their experience is not as amazing
[667.0s] enough and so they don't really share
[668.8s] about Christ more in their personal
[670.9s] life? Why do you think people feel like
[673.1s] you need to have a very dramatic
[674.9s] experience for you to actually meet
[676.9s] Christ?
[678.5s] Mostly it uh happens from how the how
[682.4s] how you grew up. Mhm. How your parents
[686.4s] made church seem to you like uh it could
[690.9s] for some time it it is a burden
[694.2s] most of the time as you grow up. So you
[697.2s] look at it as I can do this, I can do
[700.4s] that because of yeah I have to go to
[703.1s] church, I have to consider what God
[705.4s] likes. But uh for someone who has been
[709.3s] out there, they know that they feel that
[712.5s] this life is easier. It's more enjoyable
[716.9s] than the life they lived. So
[720.6s] we people who have grown in the church
[723.0s] tend to look at it as what I don't have
[726.1s] than what they have. And people who have
[728.9s] grown up in the world think of it as
[731.4s] what I have gained. Mhm. I like that.
[734.3s] Thanks for that. And just to just
[736.4s] clarify on that both experiences are
[738.7s] actually very important. They have their
[740.8s] advantages and disadvantages as well.
[743.1s] You just read some expert from uh the
[746.2s] teachers lesson. It says some positive
[749.4s] aspects of growing up as a Christian can
[752.1s] be one you have a rich background of
[754.2s] information about Christ and your
[756.8s] outlook is very hopeful and healthy.
[758.7s] They tend to meet people who've grown up
[760.2s] in church tend to meet challenges with a
[762.8s] very hopeful outlook because since
[764.8s] childhood they have seen how Christ has
[766.8s] been there for them every single time.
[769.4s] And you also don't get blown around by
[771.2s] extremes as much. It's harder to sway
[774.8s] someone who's been brought up in the
[776.1s] church. Now, on the flip side, people
[778.9s] who had a very dramatic conversion, they
[782.0s] have a very deep hatred for the old life
[785.2s] and sin, right? Um there there's a
[788.8s] pastor I remember in our church one
[790.4s] time, uh pastor Lyel, he used to tell us
[793.3s] about how in his in his older times when
[797.0s] he was in the world, quote unquote, he
[799.4s] used to listen to rock music. So every
[802.0s] time he'd sit in a place that plays such
[805.0s] kind of music, even if it was in church,
[807.1s] he'd always walk out because it reminded
[809.3s] him of what his past life looked like.
[813.0s] So people who had a dramatic experience
[815.0s] often tend to have a very deep hatred
[817.1s] for the older life and for sin. And
[819.8s] they're also very passionate about
[821.5s] Christ.
[823.2s] When something you realize is most of
[825.4s] the passionate preachers and
[827.0s] evangelists, they had a very um dramatic
[829.8s] change. Doug Bachelor for one.
[833.1s] Yeah. He used to live a very rowdy life
[835.7s] as a youth and he's one of the most
[837.5s] passionate preachers and speakers right
[839.8s] now. Found it amazing facts. Okay. So,
[842.5s] both experiences very important to
[844.2s] Christ and Christ reaches out to us. If
[847.5s] even if you're brought up in church or
[849.3s] even if you're outside church, Christ
[851.0s] still looks for you wherever you are.
[853.8s] Now, we can move into a lesson. And I'd
[856.6s] like to ask Silas to give us a summary
[859.0s] of our story.
[860.4s] It comes from the book of Luke 8 26-39.
[865.8s] So our story talks about when Jesus was
[870.3s] casting demons out of a man and there
[874.4s] were pigs. There were pigs close by and
[877.5s] the demons begged Jesus to let them go
[880.5s] into the pigs and Jesus did permit them
[884.7s] to go and after that the pigs went into
[888.6s] the lake and drowned themselves. And uh
[893.2s] later on the people who were watching
[896.2s] the pigs went to the authorities and
[899.4s] reported it. And then Jesus left the
[903.4s] place using a boot. And the people the
[908.6s] person he had saved from the demonic
[911.9s] possession
[913.7s] uh wanted to go with him but he said no
[916.2s] and told him to go to the city and tell
[919.1s] others what he had seen. And
[924.2s] at that moment the people who the
[928.2s] authorities say that Jesus is
[933.4s] is is not not is is is
[937.6s] working with the demons casting a demon
[940.8s] casting out a demon. Yeah. Yeah. Thanks
[943.7s] for that Silus. And just to share the
[946.1s] context um the background before that
[949.4s] Christ was had been dealing with people
[951.4s] questioning his authority including his
[953.7s] own disciples doubting him. Remember
[955.9s] right before Christ came to the shore
[958.9s] and healed a demon-possessed man they
[961.4s] had been crossing the lake there was a
[964.0s] really bad storm and the disciples most
[966.6s] of them who are were fishermen they were
[969.2s] afraid. Now when you get to a point
[971.2s] where a storm is bad to the extent that
[973.2s] people who are always in the water are
[974.8s] afraid that means it's bad and these
[977.5s] guys forgot that Jesus is in the boat
[979.1s] with them. Finally Jesus woke up calm
[981.8s] the storm they went back and and the
[984.0s] disciples questioned who is this man who
[987.8s] tells the winds and the waves to come
[989.3s] and they listen. So Christ was dealing
[991.5s] with opposition from both sides. Now
[994.1s] here he is again being chased after
[996.4s] doing a good thing.
[998.2s] It's a sad thing to think about, right?
[1001.2s] Let's answer some questions from the out
[1002.6s] of the story section. Okay.
[1006.0s] Um, first question I like to ask, let me
[1009.0s] just get it.
[1012.6s] Um, yeah. So, our lesson talks about the
[1015.8s] power Christ has over demon possession.
[1018.5s] And, uh, for some of us might seem
[1020.3s] really unreachable, like it's something
[1021.7s] that's farfetched nowadays. But there's
[1024.0s] a question here where we ask um based on
[1027.6s] what you observe in this story, how do
[1030.2s] the demons respond to the presence of
[1032.2s] Jesus?
[1034.5s] Silence. How do demons respond when
[1036.6s] Christ is in their presence?
[1039.7s] There are they're quite afraid of Christ
[1043.6s] because
[1045.6s] when when you know what what is right
[1050.2s] and you're in the wrong, you feel
[1052.2s] rebuked. Mhm. Yes. Mhm. So that it's
[1056.2s] their sense of wrongdoing that makes
[1058.0s] them feel afraid of Jesus like they
[1059.9s] should not be there. Yes. All right.
[1062.0s] Thanks for that. Seth, what do you
[1064.4s] think?
[1065.9s] How how how do demons respond when
[1068.3s] Christ is in their presence or why do
[1070.3s] they respond that way? M I think for me
[1075.3s] is um the demons are more afraid of the
[1080.0s] Holy Spirit. And you know when a person
[1084.4s] just comes into your life and acts as if
[1089.3s] he's one of the p most powerful
[1091.8s] preachers to come and cleanse the demons
[1095.1s] away from this person. Mhm. Of which the
[1098.3s] demons will eventually go. Yeah. But the
[1101.5s] demons are more afraid of the Holy
[1104.6s] Spirit and the Holy Spirit is God. Amen.
[1107.8s] Thanks for that. So it's the power
[1109.0s] behind the person who's casting them
[1110.5s] out. Thanks for that. Seth to Kevin,
[1113.4s] what are your thoughts? Probably can
[1115.0s] even tie to what Glen White speaks about
[1116.8s] on the same. Um I think for me this is
[1121.3s] more of like a burden. You see it is
[1124.4s] actually also written that there are
[1126.2s] also fellas um who went to cast out
[1129.0s] demons and they asked Christ we know so
[1132.6s] and so we know who are you who are you?
[1135.2s] Yeah and whatever happened is a story we
[1137.8s] wouldn't want to experience today. So
[1139.6s] that actually confirms to you that we
[1142.6s] live in a world whereby demon possession
[1145.8s] is real. True. It is real. Even in our
[1148.4s] church, you will hear of pastors going
[1151.4s] somewhere so that they have to sleep
[1153.4s] overnight praying for someone with a
[1155.6s] demon possession and those who go there
[1157.3s] are those who are strong. So that
[1159.4s] something doesn't happen and then this
[1161.6s] person is relieved and the demons come
[1164.1s] to you. True. So you will find that the
[1166.6s] demon possession aspect is not anything
[1169.9s] to be taken lightly. In the same way
[1172.4s] angels came from heaven and they came to
[1176.0s] this world and they know that their
[1178.6s] times their time is short the angels you
[1181.4s] know the fallen angels and that's why
[1183.4s] they are trying their very best to get
[1185.6s] to everyone and if possible as the Bible
[1188.8s] says the devil in this last day is
[1191.0s] trying to get to the most elect. So that
[1192.8s] means that the demons are real and
[1195.0s] should they get a chance and one of us
[1197.4s] has that possession then the people of
[1200.8s] God the men of God those who have faith
[1203.3s] as as has been something that we've been
[1205.7s] speaking the whole quarter then have to
[1207.6s] come out and pray in faith because they
[1209.6s] recognize and actually if I go to the
[1212.1s] spirit of prophecy whereby this week we
[1214.9s] studying from um um the dissolved ages
[1218.3s] of humble hero chapter 34 and 35 we get
[1221.8s] to learn about burdens. We get to learn
[1224.2s] about committing our burdens to Christ
[1226.5s] like uh the the we dissolve ages. That
[1229.4s] is the first verse says that come unto
[1233.0s] me only who are heavy laden and I will
[1236.0s] give you rest. And this actually comes
[1237.5s] from Matthew 11 28-30 and and these
[1240.9s] words are to be used as a comfort for
[1243.4s] the multitude that followed Christ. The
[1245.0s] savior had said that the only through
[1247.4s] himself could men receive a knowledge of
[1249.6s] God. True. There's a song that they have
[1252.0s] sung many a times that burdens are
[1255.3s] lifted at Calvary. You know, cast your
[1257.8s] burdens come to Jesus. You know that we
[1261.3s] are supposed to bring our burdens to
[1262.9s] Christ and he'll lift them. And you see
[1265.0s] in our world today, we have so many
[1266.5s] tribulations. So what the spirit of
[1268.6s] prophecy is trying to bring us in brief
[1271.0s] is that whether we are publicans,
[1273.2s] whether we are people in church, Mhm.
[1276.1s] Instead of carrying all these burdens
[1277.9s] with us like what the man who was
[1280.5s] possessed with demons who almost was
[1282.1s] cutting himself instead of carrying all
[1283.9s] these things to you're supposed to get
[1285.5s] them to the burden bearer and that is
[1288.1s] Christ Christ Jesus so that we don't get
[1290.7s] too much beaten by life beaten by
[1293.0s] troubles beaten by evil things and at
[1295.5s] the end we end up in in losing eternal
[1297.8s] life and that's why I want to read just
[1299.7s] a a simple thing from dissolve of ages
[1302.4s] that is 3:30 that says mhm I'm There are
[1306.2s] many whose hearts are aching under load
[1308.2s] of care because they seek to reach the
[1310.2s] world's standard. They have chosen its
[1312.9s] service, accepted its perplexity and
[1315.2s] adapted its customs. Thus, their
[1317.4s] character is mad and their life has made
[1320.0s] a weariness in order to gratify
[1322.0s] ambition. That is what most of us are
[1324.1s] looking for and worldly desires. They
[1326.1s] wound the concerns and bring upon
[1328.2s] themselves an additional burden of
[1330.0s] remorse. The continual worry is wearing
[1332.5s] out life forces. Our Lord desires them
[1335.7s] to lay aside the yoke of bondage. He
[1338.7s] invites them to accept his yoke. He
[1340.6s] says, "My yoke is easy and my burden is
[1343.2s] light." He beats them to seek first the
[1345.7s] kingdom of God and his righteousness.
[1347.9s] And his promise is that all the things
[1349.9s] needed for them for this life shall be
[1352.0s] added. But what is happening instead?
[1354.4s] What is blind and cannot discern the
[1356.2s] future. But Jesus seeks the end from the
[1360.0s] beginning. He sees our end. He sees the
[1362.6s] end of everything. In every difficulty
[1364.4s] he has his way prepared to bring relief.
[1367.0s] And lastly and not the least it says our
[1369.5s] heavenly father has a thousand ways to
[1372.2s] you who is following to provide for us
[1374.5s] of which we know nothing. So those who
[1377.9s] accent the one principle of making the
[1380.9s] service and order of God supreme will
[1383.2s] find perplexities vanish. So in a
[1386.3s] nutshell and from chapter 34 and chapter
[1389.2s] 35 simplified, we need to commit our
[1391.9s] burdens to God. Amen. As we seek
[1394.5s] whatever we are seeking, excellence,
[1396.3s] success and all this, we've been
[1398.0s] affirmed today that we need to commit
[1399.5s] our worries to God because worries will
[1402.1s] not take us anywhere but rather they
[1404.1s] will wear us out and we'll end up in
[1406.4s] getting astonished and maybe worn out.
[1409.0s] Amen. Thanks for that Kevin. And um just
[1412.2s] to
[1413.8s] just add something on that
[1416.6s] when the man that's in the book of Luke
[1420.1s] chapter 8 the exact verse is chapter 30
[1422.3s] let me just read it as it is says to the
[1425.8s] the demon-possessed man Jesus asked him
[1428.4s] saying what is your name and he said
[1431.4s] legion because many demons had entered
[1434.2s] him now a legion in the Roman culture
[1438.1s] was made up of about 6,000 soldiers
[1440.9s] 6,000 soldiers were enough to to destroy
[1443.4s] an entire village. Okay? Now, imagine
[1446.3s] having about 6,000 demons in you. This
[1449.8s] was a man who was struggling.
[1452.2s] Every demon probably had its own desire,
[1455.0s] trying to hurt you, trying to hurt
[1456.7s] others. But Christ peered and looked
[1460.6s] into that man's heart and just found a
[1462.7s] very small space where Christ would
[1464.9s] reach to the conscience of this man.
[1466.7s] Mhm. That's the part that Christ reached
[1469.5s] out to. And so this man in answering
[1473.2s] Jesus, this was a cry for help. And Elen
[1476.7s] White speaks about it in Desire chapter
[1479.3s] 30 34 that is. And she speaks about how
[1483.8s] the cry for help does not go unanswered
[1486.1s] by God. Yeah. At times we might take up
[1491.4s] yolks on ourselves without knowing what
[1494.6s] really we're putting on ourselves.
[1496.4s] burdens and worries as shaven had
[1498.3s] mentioned before. But Christ wants to
[1501.1s] give us a yoke, his yoke that is light.
[1504.1s] Now people misinterpret that verse and
[1507.2s] think that the yoke that Christ is
[1509.0s] putting on us is meant to be slavery.
[1511.8s] But a yoke is put on an ox or donkeys to
[1516.2s] guide them. Without a yoke cannot really
[1519.0s] guide animals in the field to plow. So
[1521.4s] the yoke is meant to guide. Christ's
[1523.8s] yoke is easy. It's meant to guide us
[1526.2s] into the path that God wants us to be
[1528.2s] in. And as Chav has just read for us,
[1530.6s] God has a thousand and thousands of ways
[1533.2s] to provide for us that we have no idea
[1535.5s] about. Just imagine Seth. Yeah.
[1540.7s] God owns everything that you need. He's
[1543.9s] just waiting for you to ask him.
[1547.1s] Silus, that one thing you're lacking in
[1549.5s] your life, it's because you have not
[1550.8s] asked.
[1552.6s] And it's sad because in Christianity we
[1554.9s] tend to lose out a lot on that. We find
[1558.7s] troubles in life but we're so stressed
[1560.7s] up trying to figure them out in our own
[1563.2s] way. Case in point the demonpossessed
[1565.6s] man. Let me use him. He was put in
[1568.2s] chains. He was trying to break off from
[1570.4s] the chains. It could be the demons. It
[1573.0s] could be him just trying to get away
[1574.3s] from it all. But until he surrendered
[1577.8s] himself to Christ and just cried, "Help,
[1581.1s] help me." That is when he found truly
[1583.4s] relief. It's only in Christ that we find
[1585.8s] true peace and happiness. As we move on,
[1589.6s] I'd like us to read the flashlight.
[1592.1s] Like to ask Silus, read the flashlight
[1594.3s] for us.
[1599.7s] The flashlight says, "With authority, he
[1603.5s] made the unclean spirits come out of
[1605.4s] them. His word penetrated the darkened
[1608.6s] minds of the unfortunate men. They
[1611.5s] realized dimly that one was near who
[1614.7s] could save them from the tormenting
[1617.1s] demons. They fell at the Savior's feet
[1620.3s] to worship him. But when their lips were
[1623.0s] opened to entreat his mercy, the demons
[1626.6s] spoke through them. Thank you. Right.
[1629.8s] When Christ spoke, that's when the
[1631.6s] demons just got out and the people
[1634.0s] realizing the great miracle, they
[1635.6s] decided just follow Jesus' feet. Now a
[1638.2s] question
[1639.8s] we see after the story ends right after
[1642.1s] Christ has removed the demons from the
[1643.3s] mans to you Silas. The man wanted to
[1646.2s] follow Jesus but Christ told him no
[1649.8s] go tell the people what the Lord has
[1651.2s] done for you. Question one, why do you
[1654.2s] think he wanted to follow Jesus instead
[1656.3s] of remaining where he was?
[1659.8s] because he had he was afraid that uh
[1666.2s] what can I do if I'm back in that
[1669.4s] situation? True. So he wanted to follow
[1673.0s] Jesus to be sure that if he is back
[1678.2s] there, Jesus could save him again. True.
[1681.7s] I agree. Yeah. I mean if if someone
[1684.7s] saves you out of a very bad situation,
[1686.5s] you'll not want to go back there again.
[1688.1s] your PTSD and trauma. That's the same
[1690.6s] thing happened to this guy. But Christ
[1692.9s] told him to go and witness. Now, let me
[1695.6s] give a short story as we're about to
[1697.4s] wrap up. Story is told of a man. This
[1700.2s] was a pastor was giving his own personal
[1701.7s] story. Um, can you remember the pastor's
[1705.0s] name, but he's talking about how on New
[1707.0s] Year's Eve, he was driving to go shop.
[1710.2s] He was just a single man that time. He
[1712.1s] just moved into a new town. He actually
[1715.1s] had his wife, but his wife and the kids
[1717.3s] were away. So, he was trying to set up
[1719.0s] the house. And since he was alone at
[1720.6s] that time, wanted to do a little bit of
[1722.3s] shopping to just relax and wait for the
[1724.9s] new year. And as he was driving, he was
[1727.8s] about to he was on a bend and he just
[1730.6s] got rammed into on the side by another
[1732.6s] vehicle. Now, the person who was driving
[1735.1s] the other vehicle was an old lady about
[1738.0s] in her 80s. And a surprising thing
[1740.6s] happened. After the lady rammed his
[1742.6s] vehicle, she just stepped out of the car
[1746.2s] and walked out and went straight to the
[1748.4s] bank to do her business.
[1750.7s] Okay. Now, when the police officers came
[1753.2s] to the scene, they asked, "What happened
[1756.4s] here?" Mhm. And so, this this person was
[1759.0s] trying to explain himself that I was
[1761.3s] just driving and this the owner of this
[1763.4s] vehicle drummed into me. So, the
[1765.5s] policeman asked, "Where is she? Where is
[1767.8s] he?" And the the pastor said she just
[1771.2s] walked into the bank and they thought
[1773.0s] this guy was crazy. Then the old lady
[1775.7s] just walked out of the bank, came to the
[1777.4s] vehicle and her story was I was driving
[1780.8s] and this man is the one who hit me right
[1784.4s] now. Picture this, Kelvin. It's you.
[1786.8s] Yeah, you're a young man against a 70 or
[1790.4s] 80year-old fragile woman. Who looks more
[1793.4s] believable?
[1796.4s] It's the older woman. Definitely. And so
[1798.6s] the police officer believed that was a
[1800.4s] woman and the pass was about to be put
[1802.5s] in chains in handcuffs until
[1806.0s] someone who was just standing on the
[1807.8s] side came by and gave his story. I saw
[1810.2s] everything. I witnessed
[1812.6s] everything. That is what saved the
[1814.2s] pastor.
[1815.9s] Now do you see what a witnessing story
[1819.7s] does? The impact it has. That is what
[1822.2s] Christ wanted to teach his disciples as
[1824.2s] well.
[1825.4s] It's not just about when Christ saves
[1827.4s] you from his situation, you just follow
[1829.7s] him and not share your story. The reason
[1831.8s] why Christ saved you from that situation
[1833.8s] so that you can tell others what Christ
[1835.8s] has done to you.
[1838.2s] The greatest someone ever preached is
[1840.6s] some of the life well lived. Yeah. Very
[1843.0s] true. People connect more to personal
[1845.7s] stories than to what is in the Bible.
[1848.0s] Mhm. If silos to go and to share with
[1851.7s] the neighbors and tell them I was in
[1854.1s] such a situation Christ came through for
[1856.2s] me come see what he can do for you. That
[1859.0s] is what Christ desires. Not just opening
[1862.1s] a Bible and let's go to the book of
[1863.7s] revelation. So the mark of the beast
[1865.7s] says now you'll have little impact on
[1868.7s] that. So just to finish up our lesson
[1872.2s] like us to read the further insight.
[1874.2s] Like to ask Seth to read one of the
[1875.6s] further insights. Then Shelvin the
[1877.8s] second one as we get closing remarks on
[1880.7s] our story. Further insight.
[1884.4s] Um the father insight says the Lord
[1886.9s] saves us us we perish. Never did a a
[1891.8s] soul out that cry unhealed. Thank you.
[1896.7s] Unhealed. Mhm. Um Mhm. I think this
[1903.0s] applies to our daily lives as teenagers.
[1908.2s] Mhm. We tend to think that our parents
[1912.9s] actually know everything that we you go
[1918.1s] through. We go through. But in deep down
[1921.9s] in their hearts, they are trying to like
[1926.3s] get to know us better. Mhm. and get to
[1929.9s] know what actually we are going through
[1933.4s] in our lives. Yeah. Only God knows. Only
[1936.9s] God knows what we are going through in
[1939.2s] our lives. True. Thanks for that, Seth.
[1941.4s] Uh to check Kevin the second for the
[1943.1s] insight. Yeah, I think this one is a
[1945.6s] very interesting one. He says it is in
[1947.4s] the working to spread the gospel to
[1950.8s] spread the good news of the salvation
[1952.8s] that you are brought near the savior.
[1954.4s] That comes from dissolve ages page 339.
[1957.3s] So mostly to mean that in the doing in
[1960.4s] the spreading of the good news of
[1961.9s] salvation then we are brought near to
[1964.2s] the savior. So that means as in the
[1966.4s] previous last week's lesson whereby we
[1968.9s] got to learn that Christ spent most of
[1970.7s] his time doing good and you know
[1972.8s] reaching out to the people and that
[1974.5s] which they needed as opposed to possibly
[1976.9s] being in church or maybe preaching as we
[1979.1s] call it today. Then actually in those
[1981.8s] many ways that's how possibly many
[1983.8s] people got to come to Christ and got to
[1985.8s] know you because like in John 4:29
[1989.2s] says come see a man who knew all the
[1991.7s] things I did who knows me inside and out
[1994.6s] do you think this could be the Messiah
[1997.2s] and they went all out to see for
[1999.0s] themselves that is John 4:29 and 30 so
[2002.2s] it's simple and clear that in in the
[2004.6s] example of our daily lives in us
[2007.5s] reaching out to spread the good news in
[2010.0s] going to hospitals and and of course
[2012.2s] looking back to what has been the global
[2015.0s] youth day that is the aspect of our
[2017.3s] community transformed in us being the
[2019.6s] transformation that we want and in us
[2021.9s] being the example that we want the world
[2023.6s] to see and by that way we get to bring
[2026.3s] more to Christ and we get to know him
[2028.2s] more so I think that's what I'd say and
[2030.0s] I'll challenge my follower and and and
[2032.9s] my viewer to go and actually also look
[2035.3s] at their lives and see how best they can
[2037.4s] serve they can serve and and do All
[2039.7s] right. Thank you for that. Silus, your
[2041.8s] parting comments from this lesson.
[2046.8s] I'd just say that
[2049.5s] when you go through something,
[2052.9s] most people are afraid to say what they
[2054.7s] go through because they because of being
[2060.2s] singled out and other things. Yeah. That
[2063.0s] happen when you share your story. But
[2065.8s] sometimes it helps people even though
[2069.1s] they're quiet, they
[2072.1s] they think about where they are and
[2075.4s] because someone else could have been
[2078.2s] there and could have made it or in a
[2080.1s] worse in a worse position got out. They
[2084.8s] have strength to
[2087.4s] fight whatever they're going through.
[2089.8s] And that's why Jesus told the man to go
[2092.7s] and share share what he knew what God
[2095.4s] has done for him. Amen. Thank you for
[2097.9s] that. And maybe before you wrap it up, I
[2100.6s] think on top of what he has said, I
[2102.9s] think it's important and something that
[2104.3s] I'm learning today and I think I had
[2106.0s] this statement previously that your
[2108.3s] personal story, you are the only one who
[2110.7s] can tell it and they cannot dispute it.
[2112.8s] They may dispute who you are called.
[2114.7s] They may dispute that much you've
[2116.5s] achieved in life and whatever you've
[2118.2s] done and maybe when you are born and
[2120.2s] when you are not born and all that but
[2122.1s] your personal story of how you came
[2124.2s] maybe to know Christ. Your personal
[2126.2s] story of how you came from wherever you
[2128.3s] are to where you are. How you used to be
[2130.2s] and now can never be disputed. So I
[2132.2s] believe in the personal testimony. I
[2134.2s] believe in that. And I think I would
[2135.7s] also want to challenge whoever comes
[2137.5s] across this lesson to look at their
[2139.4s] story. And even if no one thinks they
[2142.0s] know the Bible, just share your story.
[2144.0s] And that story will touch someone and
[2145.9s] that someone will touch another and
[2147.6s] that's how the gospel will go. That's
[2149.6s] how many others will get to have the
[2151.7s] faith that you have. Amen. Amen. Thank
[2154.4s] you so much for panelists for that. And
[2156.7s] uh thank you for joining us for the
[2158.5s] entire quarter. Looking forward to
[2160.1s] seeing you in the next quarter in the
[2161.8s] month of July. So just to urge you trust
[2165.8s] in God, call upon him. He always
[2168.3s] listens. There's not a a word of help
[2171.6s] that he not does not listen to. We'll
[2173.8s] close a word of prayer from Kevin. Let
[2176.4s] us h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h
[2177.4s] h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h
[2177.4s] h h ourselves and we pray. Our father
[2179.7s] who art in heaven, we do come before you
[2181.6s] on this day. We want to thank you for
[2183.7s] you've led us. You've guided us and been
[2185.4s] with us, God. From the start of this
[2187.8s] lesson and equally from the start of the
[2190.2s] whole quarter, we've been learning about
[2192.6s] many disciplines and equally about many
[2194.8s] themes. We've learned about faith. We've
[2197.0s] learned about trusting God and about
[2199.6s] reaching out and and getting to the
[2201.7s] people and and serving them God. Today's
[2204.1s] lesson has been good. We've learned
[2206.2s] about the demonp possessed person who
[2208.0s] really wanted to get out of his
[2209.4s] situation and that he may follow Christ
[2211.4s] so that he can be a better person. Our
[2214.2s] prayer today is that God for each one of
[2216.5s] us there is that aspect of our lives
[2218.6s] that we would love change. There is that
[2220.8s] used to be that we love change to
[2222.9s] someone who is different. We are praying
[2225.1s] and trusting in you that you'll convert
[2228.0s] each one of us God that the challenges
[2230.7s] we may be going through, the battles we
[2232.5s] may be battling God possibly could be
[2234.8s] addition and whatever it is that we may
[2236.6s] be going through that you've told us
[2238.6s] today to commit ourselves to bring our
[2240.9s] burdens to you so that God we may push
[2243.4s] on with our journeys because we know
[2245.1s] that in your hands we are safe. in your
[2248.7s] hands. Our burdens have been taken care
[2250.5s] of and that we may continue being
[2253.5s] provided for and you may continue living
[2256.0s] a great life. We want to thank you for
[2257.6s] you've led us all the way from the
[2259.2s] beginning of the quarter and as we look
[2261.3s] forward into the next quarter. We trust
[2264.0s] that you shall see us through that
[2265.9s] you'll start with us and equally also
[2268.3s] end with us. We trust in your name. We
[2270.6s] thank you for listening to us and we
[2272.6s] praise you and we pray for your leading
[2275.1s] and in Jesus name we pray name we
[2276.7s] believe in. Amen. Amen. Amen. Thank you.
