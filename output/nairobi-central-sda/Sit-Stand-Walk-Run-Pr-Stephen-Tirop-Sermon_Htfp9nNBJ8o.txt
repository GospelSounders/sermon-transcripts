FULL TRANSCRIPT:
Hallelujah. Praise the Lord. What do we say to our lovely children? We thank the Lord for leading, for guiding and for the effort of the teachers and for you parents for working with the teachers to raise up such a wonderful heritage of the Lord. The Bible tells us children are heritage from God and is the one who gives the fruit of the womb. We thank the Lord for such wonderful blessing because of our children who are in this stage which is called adventurers world adventurers day travel with faith world adventurers day travel with faith travel with faith World Adventurers Day. It is such a moment of reflection to think about traveling by faith and I want to invite all of us uh into this fellowship. Uh I just want to let you know that um we are here all uh the families represented. Pastor Amayo is with the branch Sabah school team at Lenana where they are preparing for the um the rally the school rallies which will be here with us very soon. uh but his family uh is here wherever you are. Pastor Edna uh Eba and Bana may you wave to us. May I ask also my family is here uh everyone in their uniform and I have made sure that I'm in uniform today as well. Uh where are you by? Yes, Chapanch Cherono and Pastor Naga is somewhere in full regalia. Uh you stand and wave to our senior pastor. What do we say? Amen. We are fully in this and we support our children as pastor and church leadership. And as you have seen most of our elders who are serving today are in either scarf or full uniform. We praise the Lord. Hallelujah. And may we now turn to uh our thoughts. But before that may I bring to our notice that um immediately we are done with the divine hour and prayer session. We are going to remain seated for a brief uh business meeting whereby we will be discussing the way forward for the pews. We want to improve the comfort of our pews or make a decision today on which way forward. And so please uh don't be in a hurry to leave. Remain uh seated so that we can have that brief conversation about enhancing and refurbishment of this sanctuary. May God bless us. Um allow me now to take us to this journey just as we've been taken to this journey by the youngsters. But before then let's pray so that the Lord may guide us. Let's pray wherever we are. Young people let's pray. Children we are praying. Eternal heavenly father we move. We have our being and our sustainance in you. Thank you because you have given us the strength and moved our hearts so that Lord we have yearned to come to the accord to listen from you and to fellowship with one another. Father, use me as your vessel and may you speak to our hearts directly through your powerful word in Jesus name we pray. Amen. Thank you so much. Let's now brethren move into this wonderful journey because we are traveling with faith. What does the Bible say about our life journey? You will realize that this thought of traveling which in thinking about this I have entitled our today's uh sermon sit walk and stand with faith. sit, walk, and run. Sit, walk, and stand with faith. Thank you so much. I want us to reflect back in the book of Genesis and listen to what God says in Genesis chapter 1 and vers 26. says, "Then God said, let us make man in our image, according to our likeness. Let them have dominion over the fish, over the kettle, over all the earth, and over every cripping thing that crips on the earth." So God created man in his own image, in the image of God. He created him. Male and female he created them. Verse 28. Then God blessed them and God said to them, "Be fruitful and multiply. Fill the earth and subdue it. Have dominion over the fish." Again, it is repeated there. But how far was man to go in populating the earth? Fill the earth. Fill the earth. This blessing, this command that is given to man that he should fill the earth was thwarted a bit. But even if it had to take another direction yet the earth is almost full now of humanity. The only sad thing is that it is full of humanity. But not every other human being realizes that our presence here is because there's a creator who made the world and all that fills it and he owns this world. Instead, men have come up with their own ideas. And because they think that being rich means being so greedy, when you have a privilege, you can push others and occupy as much land as possible. No. Jesus came and said, "What shall it profit a man to have the entire world and lose his soul?" And so today I want to invite you to re look again at what God intended when he in fact having created man in the garden of Eden wanted this man to have dominion to multiply to fill the earth And so he man was not to be confined to only a small portion but to go beyond that environment where he was. And so the garden of Eden was meant to expand as human beings increased human beings who have the image of God. And so the text that we have which is 2 Corinthians chapter 5 and verse 7 which our adventurer memorized. What does it say? For we walk by faith and not by sight. that we have to have the map. We have to have something that guides us. And what guides us in this journey of fulfilling this blessing of fulfilling this walk of faith is to have faith as the guide. Because without it we are cropping in darkness and we will try this and the other one so that we are fulfilled but that will not be fulfilling. We see immediately after creation that Satan came and using the serpent he tricked Adam and Eve and told them that don't worry God did not mean it. You will not die. Uh in fact you will be wiser. You'll be like God knowing good and evil. And so he tricked them to eat the fruit and go against God's command. The result is that humanity has taken a journey of pain of sorrow and the earth which had been populated by beautiful lovely flowers. Trees that did not have thorns now have thorns and thistles are all over pricking us. So that here humanity instead of enjoying an environment that God had planned for them in a beautiful garden have to sweat. And in this we see that even if the desire is still there and that is why when we talk about travel when we talk about journeys you see even the youngsters here when they were asked where would you want to travel they want to travel to places they have had even places like Russia where there's war with Ukraine they want to travel there because they have heard of that place. Tourism and journey is part of human excitement. Sometimes we give priority to other things but given resources everyone would want to travel the world. It is a natural desire. It is an instinct that God placed in us and although sin has m it we desire to travel. And so my young friend and my believer, fellow believer, we are in this life to walk to travel to know that we are traveling and we always want to find the right way to travel. You know after this Adam and Eve when they were lied to, cheated, deceived, what happened is that immediately they gave birth to the first child that son Kane became a murderer. He wanted all the love, all the the the the the attention from his parents and from God. When it appeared that God favored Abel, instead of seeking what is it that I missed out, we see that kind was enraged. He was angry. Hello children alone. Would you want to be like Abel or K children? Are we together? Do you remember the children of Abh Adam and Eve? How many were there at that time? Two. Before Seth was born, there were how many? Two. Only two. And there was there was the entire world and they were there. But you see anger and being so jealous. What did K do? He told his brother, "Let's take a walk." And when they were working, he took something big, maybe a stick, a big one, and maybe that stick had crooked things that were out there. And he he lifted it when his brother was not uh was not expecting. Maybe he told him, "Look at this beautiful flower." When the brother was looking at it, him raised his hand. He raised it up and hit him. And what happened to Abel? He died. He died. Why? Because Abel had discovered what faith is. And so walking or traveling with faith is important because you are able to know what our children are taken through. Adventurers Club is a group of children from ages four all the way to ages five which are the classes that we have. The little lambs who are ages or pre kindergarten and then we have kindergarten which forms what? Alibad. And then we have those who are busy running. And you could see the work that teachers are trying to do here. They these guys are busy and they are called busy B. And then from that we have grade that is BCB grade one. Grade twos are sunbeam. And then finally we have builders strong. They are guides who can build their own things. And that is why in this age they learn to use their muscle and they want to experience it. they want to do it themselves. It is at this stage where some of us being in the village, we would get our own small pangas and there you are busy cutting a a tree and after that you chop this size. make make a a wheel in this other side by chopping in between and getting this stick that is uh uh that that has a branching whatever and there you are. You have your own car and you are busy driving it something that you have made yourself. Let us enable allow afford these children an opportunity to interact with their fellow h their fellows by socializing. It is the desire. It is the the the policy and and and the plan of this group that they can learn to develop faith. And so they grow spiritually. They are taught on how to be careful even as they are growing physically to be people who are respectful, people who are kind, people who will grow up to love God, to be reverent, to be cheerful, to be thoughtful. They are taught these virtues in these classes that they have to be attentive and helpful in as much as they may be very busy engaged with one another and seem to be distracted. But they are taught and when they are taught to be obedient, to be respectful, they learn and they accepted from their teachers. Just like in school, you know, in this group, when you have the right school, a school where God is mentioned, this group will tell you, "No, the teacher did not teach me this way. because they believe they are teachers. And so the 27 teachers including leaders that this group have, it is it is a group that we as a church ought to be keen. Who are they? Who are these people handling? because you know they copy and they see their teachers and the love that their teachers give to them in church. If it is added and complemented by the schools they attend. Brothers and sisters, fellow believer, then you are sure that your child is growing and indeed having faith to travel with to journey through life. From this stage, we have ages 10 to 15 which comprises of what? Pathfinders. Pathfinders. After adventuring here and there then in this church we have but finders and this is where what they have learned in this stage of ages 4 to 9 is now grounded as they take faith personally. It is in this stage that any young person rightly train in the way they should go. They will take faith personally and they can go through the youthful tumultous stormy years of youth with some sense of direction. Just like Joseph, Daniel and his four friends did away from home. Even in those boarding schools, they can go and they can travel through life with with direction. They can travel through life knowing that this is a path which their parents travel, their grandparents travel, they can travel with less hurdles and difficulties. Let us smoon the way for our children so that they can travel with faith. Hallelujah. And so from 16 to 30 then we have as you saw this flag in between this is the Adventist youth society and there we have ambassadors. We have also um which team young adults. And in this group there is where they are settling into careers and finding their path in life. Yes, we can travel and walk not by sight but by faith. And soon this uh topic this uh theme that we are given in this world adventurers day which I have entitled sit walk and stand. Paul added a fourth dimension in Timothy where he says he did not only hold to this faith but he has also fought but he also continued to do what? Run the race and he has won it. And so in this life where we have to learn how to move today, we are reminded by our youngsters that we have to keep these virtues which they learn as young uh children. Obedience, purity, being people who are true, kind, respectful, attentive, helpful, cheerful, thoughtful, and being reverent. These are not things that we forget when we grow up. We have to walk with it. And so when our children are trained, when they are made to exercise, experience joy from one another as they interact, they will shape up and we will have a society and a community where love is demonstrated. not only talked about but where it is practiced. And so just as God created man and said fill the earth, this expansion of people who are faithful. When it comes to the church, the church is a congregation of people who have taken up faith and who want to practice every day these virtues which our children are being taught. And so because of sin, because of deception, humanity is now outside that plan. And so the church when it came into being are a are people who are called out. They are called to live wherever they want. Just as in the story of Abraham in chapter 12 of of of of Genesis in where he's told get out of your people and move and show you a place he had to move. So the church is also called out just as Abraham was called out and therefore we take a journey. We move from our situation, our environment, our our our societal norms which are against the Bible into living by faith mentally choosing to live by faith. And so church is called a clia. And so ecclesia in Greek means e is out and then calle is called. So a people who are called out and so this ecclesia becomes the assembly the gathering of those who have been called out who have accepted to take this journey and in this therefore at leia the church are a People who are on the move, who are taking a journey of faith, who are living this faith in their daily life, not being conformed in the world into the way the world live, but being transformed in their minds. Journeying does not have to be physical movement but we can make a journey. We can travel by how we are incorporating these virtues by trusting in God walking from whatever journey you might have taken. You know in the story of the prodical son, the one who actually got lost was not the one who had gone away but the one who is protocol is the one who remained at home. That proximity to righteousness, proximity to holy things does not mean you are living that which is within that environment. And so we can be within a place where holiness is lived. We interact with these holy things but fail to be in that journey. And so this one who had gone and realized that home had what he missed out there actually came home. He had traveled. But the one who did not move even if he was so close had actually traveled far from the character of his parent from the character of his father. And when his father showed mercy, when his father showed love and said, "This son of mine was dead, was lost, he is back. He was dead but now he's alive. Let us celebrate. The other son said, I have worked hard. I have been here and now you are showing love to someone who has been away there more than me. He was far away from the heart of his father although he was around. And so friends, let us accept to walk and learn mentally, spiritually. Move from the distance that this world has pushed us into back into knowing and living with our father who is full of love. And so we are called to travel travel with faith the way Paul puts it in Ephesians. But before we go to Ephesians, you see man was told go multiply fill the whole earth in the New Testament. This call to fill the earth to populate the earth with people who have the character the image of God. Although sin had married when Jesus came now we do not have to go far because he says go into the world doing what? teaching them, preaching the gospel, teaching and baptizing them in the name of the father, the son and the holy spirit. This going, this traveling, this populating of the world with those who have accepted to be recreated in the image of God. We have that opportunity. And so Paul in Ephesians reminds us that [Music] this journey begins by knowing in chapter 1 of Ephesians chapter 1 verse 4 and verse 13. Paul is reminding us that we have been chosen. We have been called from the foundation of the world. God had you in his mind. He had you. He knew that we would have the children that we have and they will travel this journey of faith just as you also are in this journey of faith. And it says because of this we are seated together with him. I want to ask pathfinders who are the guest choir to prepare to come up front. As I conclude in chapter 2 verse 6, it says God who is so full of love, made us to alive after we are dead. He makes us alive and makes us to sit together with Christ in the heavenly places. And so being called, we are called. And our position in heaven in Christ Jesus is that of sitting down upon the throne of God, the kingdom of God. We are seated with Christ by faith in the heavenly places. We are called to accept and to be in that line. And therefore, since Christ has taken the kingdom, we are to sit to have dominion with Christ in the heavenly places. Paul continues this thought and he said that we are united in fact in this in in this faith we have a father who through whom when we we believe in him he is the father whose name is mentioned in heaven and here on earth we have to accept it and so the gospel is about accepting that kingdom of dominion. Sit, walk, stand, and run this race of faith. Chapter 4 verse 1 to3 says, I beg you that you may walk worthy of the calling. And chapter six says, "Make sure that you put on the whole armor of the Lord that you may stand against the attacks of the evil one." Please come up front. And so friends, the journey is real. Traveling is real. We may have wondered or we may have remained in the church but are still confused as to what true love really is. But we are called to travel back to the heart of God to discover who he is and to live that life as we teach our youngsters what being pure, being true, being kind, being respectful, being attentive, being a people who are obedient and reverent really means because We ourself are in that journey. And so just like Paul who concluded to Timothy whom he was handing over the ministry, we too are called to walk this journey. And I just want to conclude by reading this are part as our youngsters are organizing themselves. Listen to how Paul puts it so that we not only sit with not only walk with not only stand but we fight and we run the race. Let us get into this journey. Let us walk with faith. Let us travel with faith. This is how Paul puts it in second Timothy chapter 4 verse 6 to8. He says, "For I am already being poured out as a drink offering and the time of my departure is at hand. I have fought the good fight. I have finished the race. I have kept the faith. Finally, there is laid up for me the crown of righteousness which the Lord which the Lord the righteous judge will give to me on that day. But you know what is exciting my friend? Paul says, "And not only to me only, but also to all who have loved his appearing." May God help us in this walk, in this travel of faith so that you and I can truly be assured of our destiny. How many with me are saying Lord I want to remain faithful, pure, kind, obedient. I want to be true. I want to be reverent. How many are saying Lord I have walked this journey and I want to travel with you with faith. Hallelujah.

[314.4s] pray. Amen. Thank you so much. Let's now
[319.6s] brethren move into this wonderful
[324.5s] journey because we are traveling with
[328.3s] faith.
[329.9s] What does the Bible say about our life
[335.5s] journey? You will realize that this
[338.9s] thought of traveling which in thinking
[345.4s] about this I have entitled our today's
[351.5s] uh sermon sit walk and stand with faith.
[357.9s] sit, walk, and run. Sit,
[362.8s] walk, and stand with faith. Thank you so
[367.6s] much.
[368.8s] I want us to reflect back in the book of
[375.8s] Genesis and listen to what God says in
[380.3s] Genesis chapter 1 and vers 26. says,
[384.6s] "Then God said, let us make man in our
[388.8s] image, according to our likeness. Let
[391.9s] them have dominion over the fish, over
[395.7s] the kettle, over all the earth, and over
[399.8s] every cripping thing that crips on the
[404.7s] earth." So God created man in his own
[408.4s] image, in the image of God. He created
[411.6s] him. Male and female he created them.
[415.9s] Verse 28. Then God blessed them and God
[420.1s] said to them, "Be fruitful and multiply.
[424.3s] Fill the earth and subdue it. Have
[428.8s] dominion over the fish." Again, it is
[431.9s] repeated there. But how far was man to
[437.2s] go in populating the earth?
[441.5s] Fill the
[443.7s] earth. Fill the
[446.9s] earth. This
[449.3s] blessing, this
[452.0s] command that is given to man that he
[457.3s] should fill the
[461.0s] earth was thwarted a bit.
[465.4s] But even
[466.9s] if it
[469.5s] had to take another direction yet the
[475.4s] earth is almost full now of humanity.
[482.7s] The only sad thing is that it is full of
[488.8s] humanity. But not every other human
[492.4s] being realizes that our presence here is
[497.8s] because there's a creator who made the
[502.4s] world and all that fills it and he owns
[506.7s] this
[508.3s] world.
[510.3s] Instead, men have come up with their own
[516.0s] ideas. And because they
[519.4s] think that being rich
[522.8s] means being so greedy, when you have a
[526.8s] privilege, you can push others and
[530.8s] occupy as much land as
[534.8s] possible. No.
[538.4s] Jesus came and said, "What shall it
[541.8s] profit a man to have the entire world
[544.5s] and lose his soul?"
[547.1s] And so today I want to invite you to re
[553.5s] look again at what God
[557.2s] intended when he in fact having created
[562.1s] man in the garden of
[565.2s] Eden wanted this
[568.0s] man to have dominion to multiply to fill
[574.3s] the earth And so he man was not to be
[579.3s] confined to only a small portion but to
[583.2s] go beyond that environment where he was.
[587.7s] And so the garden of Eden was meant to
[590.8s] expand as human beings
[594.5s] increased human beings who have the
[597.7s] image of
[601.0s] God. And so the text that we have which
[606.1s] is 2 Corinthians chapter 5 and verse 7
[611.3s] which our
[615.2s] adventurer memorized. What does it say?
[618.6s] For we
[620.4s] walk by faith and not by
[625.8s] sight. that we have to have the
[631.3s] map. We have to have something that
[635.7s] guides us. And what guides us in this
[639.9s] journey of fulfilling this blessing of
[644.8s] fulfilling this walk of faith is to have
[651.4s] faith as the
[653.1s] guide. Because without it we are
[657.4s] cropping in darkness and we will try
[661.1s] this and the other one so that we are
[663.7s] fulfilled but that will not be
[668.7s] fulfilling. We see immediately after
[672.6s] creation
[674.4s] that Satan came and using the serpent he
[678.9s] tricked Adam and Eve and told them that
[683.8s] don't worry God did not mean it. You
[687.0s] will not die. Uh in fact you will be
[692.2s] wiser. You'll be like God knowing good
[694.9s] and evil. And so
[697.6s] he tricked them to eat the fruit and go
[702.0s] against God's
[704.3s] command. The result is that humanity has
[709.2s] taken a journey of pain of sorrow and
[713.5s] the earth which had been populated by
[718.3s] beautiful lovely flowers. Trees that did
[722.0s] not have
[724.0s] thorns now have thorns and
[728.4s] thistles are all over
[732.1s] pricking us. So that here humanity
[737.5s] instead of enjoying an environment that
[740.6s] God had planned for them in a beautiful
[744.4s] garden have to sweat.
[749.2s] And in this we see that even if the
[753.8s] desire is still
[755.6s] there and that is why when we talk about
[759.0s] travel when we talk about
[761.6s] journeys you see even the youngsters
[765.2s] here when they were asked where would
[767.5s] you want to travel they want to travel
[770.1s] to places they have had even places like
[773.7s] Russia where there's war with Ukraine
[777.8s] they want to travel there because they
[780.4s] have heard of that place.
[783.9s] Tourism and journey is part of human
[789.9s] excitement. Sometimes we give priority
[793.6s] to other things but given resources
[796.8s] everyone would want to travel the
[799.7s] world. It is a natural
[802.7s] desire. It is an instinct that God
[805.8s] placed in us and although sin has m it
[811.6s] we desire to travel. And so my young
[816.6s] friend and my believer, fellow
[821.8s] believer,
[823.6s] we are in this life to walk to travel to
[829.7s] know that we are traveling and we always
[834.0s] want to find the right way to travel.
[838.6s] You know after this Adam and Eve when
[842.7s] they
[844.4s] were lied to, cheated,
[848.0s] deceived, what happened is that
[851.5s] immediately they gave birth to the first
[855.2s] child that son
[857.7s] Kane
[859.3s] became a murderer.
[862.2s] He wanted all the love, all the the the
[867.4s] the
[869.6s] the attention from his parents and from
[874.3s] God. When it appeared that God
[878.2s] favored Abel, instead of seeking what is
[882.2s] it that I missed out, we see that kind
[887.7s] was enraged. He was angry.
[891.8s] Hello children
[895.4s] alone. Would you want to be like Abel or
[899.2s] K children? Are we
[901.6s] together? Do you remember the children
[904.6s] of Abh Adam and
[907.2s] Eve? How many were there at that
[910.1s] time? Two. Before Seth was born, there
[914.3s] were how many? Two. Only
[917.8s] two. And there was there was the entire
[922.7s] world and they were there. But you see
[928.9s] anger
[930.6s] and being so jealous. What did K do? He
[936.5s] told his brother, "Let's take a walk."
[939.0s] And when they were
[941.0s] working, he took
[944.2s] something big, maybe a stick, a big one,
[950.3s] and maybe that stick had crooked things
[953.3s] that were out
[955.6s] there. And he he lifted it when his
[959.3s] brother was not uh was not expecting.
[963.8s] Maybe he told him, "Look at this
[965.3s] beautiful flower." When the brother was
[967.5s] looking at it, him raised his hand. He
[971.8s] raised it up and hit him. And what
[975.2s] happened to
[977.2s] Abel? He died. He died. Why? Because
[982.9s] Abel had discovered what faith is. And
[988.7s] so walking or traveling with faith is
[992.3s] important because you are able to know
[998.0s] what our children are taken through.
[1001.2s] Adventurers Club
[1005.1s] is a group of children from ages four
[1009.6s] all the way to ages five which are the
[1012.8s] classes that we have. The little lambs
[1018.1s] who are ages or pre kindergarten and
[1023.0s] then we have kindergarten which forms
[1026.0s] what? Alibad. And then we have those who
[1030.5s] are busy running. And you could see the
[1033.0s] work that teachers are trying to do
[1035.8s] here. They these guys are busy and they
[1039.8s] are called busy B. And then from that we
[1045.1s] have grade that is BCB grade one. Grade
[1049.2s] twos are sunbeam. And then finally we
[1054.7s] have
[1056.2s] builders strong. They are guides who can
[1059.4s] build their own things. And that is why
[1063.0s] in this age they learn to use their
[1065.3s] muscle and they want to experience it.
[1069.4s] they want to do it themselves.
[1073.4s] It is at this stage where some of us
[1076.1s] being in the
[1077.9s] village, we would get our own small
[1082.6s] pangas and there you are busy cutting a
[1086.6s] a tree and after that you chop this
[1089.9s] size. make make a a wheel in this other
[1094.2s] side by chopping in between and getting
[1097.5s] this stick that is uh uh that that has a
[1102.0s] branching whatever and there you are.
[1104.4s] You have your own car and you are busy
[1107.4s] driving it something that you have made
[1110.6s] yourself. Let us enable allow afford
[1115.8s] these children an opportunity to
[1118.3s] interact with their fellow h their
[1122.1s] fellows by
[1124.2s] socializing. It is the desire. It is the
[1128.9s] the the policy and and and the plan of
[1133.4s] this group that they can learn to
[1136.9s] develop
[1138.0s] faith. And so they grow
[1141.8s] spiritually. They are taught on how to
[1147.3s] be careful even as they are growing
[1150.8s] physically to be people who are
[1154.3s] respectful, people who are kind, people
[1158.8s] who will grow up to love God, to be
[1164.7s] reverent, to be cheerful, to be
[1167.8s] thoughtful. They are taught these
[1171.2s] virtues in these classes that they have
[1175.9s] to be attentive and helpful in as much
[1180.2s] as they may be very busy engaged with
[1184.2s] one another and seem to be distracted.
[1188.0s] But they are taught and when they are
[1191.3s] taught to be obedient, to be
[1194.4s] respectful, they learn and they accepted
[1198.6s] from their teachers. Just like in
[1201.4s] school, you know, in this group, when
[1204.9s] you have the right school, a school
[1207.8s] where God is
[1209.5s] mentioned, this group will tell you,
[1213.1s] "No, the teacher did not teach me this
[1216.5s] way.
[1217.8s] because they believe they are teachers.
[1221.4s] And so the 27 teachers including leaders
[1227.2s] that this group have, it is it is a
[1231.7s] group that we as a church ought to be
[1235.9s] keen. Who are they? Who are these people
[1239.0s] handling? because you know they copy and
[1242.8s] they see their teachers and the love
[1246.0s] that their teachers give to them in
[1249.7s] church. If it is added and complemented
[1254.9s] by the schools they
[1256.8s] attend. Brothers and sisters, fellow
[1260.2s] believer, then you are sure that your
[1263.1s] child is growing and indeed having faith
[1268.6s] to travel
[1270.2s] with to journey through
[1273.0s] life. From this stage, we have ages 10
[1277.7s] to 15 which comprises of what?
[1283.6s] Pathfinders.
[1285.7s] Pathfinders. After adventuring here and
[1289.8s] there then in this church we have but
[1293.7s] finders and this is where what they have
[1297.6s] learned in this stage of ages 4 to 9 is
[1303.0s] now grounded as they take faith
[1307.8s] personally. It is in this stage that any
[1313.0s] young person rightly
[1315.7s] train in the way they should
[1318.9s] go. They will take faith personally and
[1323.8s] they can go through the youthful
[1327.6s] tumultous stormy years of
[1331.6s] youth with some sense of direction. Just
[1335.8s] like Joseph, Daniel and his four friends
[1339.4s] did away from home. Even in those
[1343.0s] boarding schools, they can go and they
[1346.9s] can travel through
[1349.4s] life
[1351.2s] with
[1352.8s] with direction. They can travel through
[1357.2s] life knowing that this is a path which
[1361.7s] their parents travel, their grandparents
[1365.0s] travel, they can travel with less
[1369.6s] hurdles and difficulties. Let us smoon
[1374.1s] the way for our children so that they
[1377.4s] can travel with faith. Hallelujah.
[1381.8s] And so from 16 to 30 then we have as you
[1386.6s] saw this flag in between this is the
[1391.1s] Adventist youth society and there we
[1398.0s] have
[1399.9s] ambassadors. We have also
[1403.1s] um which
[1405.8s] team young
[1407.8s] adults. And in this group there is where
[1413.4s] they are settling into careers and
[1417.3s] finding their path in
[1420.0s] life. Yes, we can travel and walk not by
[1425.8s] sight but by faith.
[1428.6s] And
[1429.8s] soon this
[1433.0s] uh topic this uh theme that we are given
[1438.2s] in this world adventurers day which I
[1442.8s] have entitled sit walk and stand.
[1450.4s] Paul added a fourth
[1453.4s] dimension in Timothy where he says he
[1458.7s] did not only hold to this faith but he
[1462.8s] has also fought but he also continued to
[1468.3s] do what? Run the race and he has won it.
[1473.5s] And so in this life where we have to
[1478.1s] learn how to
[1481.0s] move today, we are reminded by our
[1485.5s] youngsters
[1487.0s] that we have to keep these virtues which
[1491.1s] they learn as young uh children.
[1496.0s] Obedience,
[1498.4s] purity, being people who are true, kind,
[1503.2s] respectful, attentive, helpful,
[1506.2s] cheerful, thoughtful, and being
[1510.4s] reverent. These are not things that we
[1514.1s] forget when we grow up. We have to walk
[1518.3s] with it. And so when our children are
[1521.4s] trained, when they are made to
[1526.4s] exercise, experience joy from one
[1529.5s] another as they
[1530.9s] interact, they will shape up and we will
[1534.7s] have a society and a community where
[1539.9s] love is demonstrated.
[1543.6s] not
[1545.6s] only talked about but where it is
[1550.9s] practiced. And
[1553.8s] so just
[1555.6s] as God created man and said fill the
[1560.5s] earth, this expansion of people who are
[1564.6s] faithful.
[1568.1s] When it comes to the church, the church
[1571.9s] is a congregation of people who have
[1574.5s] taken up faith and who want to practice
[1579.4s] every day these virtues which our
[1583.8s] children are being taught.
[1586.8s] And
[1587.8s] so because of
[1590.7s] sin, because of
[1593.8s] deception, humanity is now outside that
[1599.7s] plan. And so the church when it came
[1604.1s] into
[1606.1s] being are a are people who are called
[1611.4s] out. They are called to live wherever
[1614.9s] they want. Just as in the story of
[1617.5s] Abraham in chapter 12 of of of of
[1622.4s] Genesis in where he's told get out of
[1626.4s] your people and move and show you a
[1629.9s] place he had to move. So the church is
[1635.6s] also called out just as Abraham was
[1639.1s] called out and therefore we take a
[1644.0s] journey. We move
[1647.0s] from our situation, our environment, our
[1651.8s] our our societal norms which are against
[1656.6s] the Bible into living by faith mentally
[1662.8s] choosing to live by faith. And so church
[1668.6s] is called a
[1670.7s] clia. And so ecclesia in
[1674.3s] Greek means e is
[1678.4s] out and then
[1680.9s] calle is called.
[1685.0s] So a people who are called
[1689.6s] out and so this ecclesia becomes the
[1694.4s] assembly the gathering of those who have
[1698.8s] been called out who have accepted to
[1702.8s] take this
[1705.3s] journey and in this
[1708.4s] therefore at
[1710.1s] leia the
[1712.6s] church are a People who are on the move,
[1717.8s] who are taking a journey of faith, who
[1721.0s] are living this faith in their daily
[1725.9s] life, not being conformed in the world
[1730.7s] into the way the world live, but being
[1733.6s] transformed in their minds.
[1738.7s] Journeying does not have to
[1742.5s] be physical movement but we can make a
[1748.9s] journey. We can
[1751.3s] travel by how we are
[1756.8s] incorporating these
[1759.2s] virtues by trusting in God walking from
[1764.7s] whatever journey you might have taken.
[1768.2s] You know in the story of the prodical
[1772.6s] son, the one who actually got
[1775.8s] lost was not the one who had gone away
[1780.3s] but the one who is protocol is the one
[1783.0s] who remained at home.
[1786.2s] That proximity to righteousness,
[1790.1s] proximity to holy things does not mean
[1794.9s] you are living that which is within that
[1800.3s] environment. And so we can be
[1803.3s] within a place where holiness is lived.
[1808.6s] We interact with these holy things but
[1811.9s] fail to be in that journey.
[1815.3s] And so this one who had gone and
[1818.9s] realized that
[1820.6s] home had what he missed out there
[1826.2s] actually came home. He had traveled. But
[1831.4s] the one who did not
[1833.3s] move even if he was so
[1836.1s] close had actually traveled far from the
[1840.4s] character of his parent from the
[1843.4s] character of his father. And when his
[1846.6s] father showed mercy, when his father
[1850.4s] showed love and said, "This son of mine
[1855.1s] was dead, was lost, he is back. He was
[1859.4s] dead but now he's alive. Let us
[1863.0s] celebrate. The other son said, I have
[1865.9s] worked hard. I have been here and now
[1869.0s] you are showing love to someone who has
[1872.5s] been away there more than
[1875.5s] me. He was far away from the heart of
[1878.7s] his father although he was around.
[1881.8s] And so friends, let us accept to walk
[1886.6s] and learn mentally, spiritually. Move
[1891.0s] from the distance that this world has
[1894.7s] pushed us into back into knowing and
[1899.9s] living with our father who is full of
[1904.7s] love.
[1906.2s] And so we are called to
[1908.4s] travel travel with faith the way Paul
[1913.0s] puts it in
[1916.0s] Ephesians. But before we go to
[1918.1s] Ephesians, you see man was told go
[1922.7s] multiply fill the whole earth in the New
[1927.0s] Testament.
[1929.2s] This call to fill the earth to populate
[1931.8s] the earth with people who have the
[1935.1s] character the image of God. Although sin
[1939.1s] had married when Jesus came now we do
[1943.6s] not have to go far because he says go
[1949.7s] into
[1951.2s] the
[1953.5s] world doing what? teaching them,
[1957.8s] preaching the gospel, teaching and
[1960.8s] baptizing them in the name of the
[1964.3s] father, the son and the holy spirit.
[1968.0s] This going, this traveling, this
[1972.3s] populating of the world with those who
[1976.6s] have accepted to be recreated in the
[1980.4s] image of God. We have that opportunity.
[1985.2s] And so Paul in
[1988.1s] Ephesians reminds us
[1991.0s] that
[1992.2s] [Music]
[1993.3s] this journey begins by knowing in
[1998.2s] chapter 1 of
[1999.9s] Ephesians chapter 1 verse 4 and verse
[2006.4s] 13. Paul is reminding us that we have
[2011.3s] been chosen. We have been called from
[2015.0s] the foundation of the world. God had you
[2019.0s] in his mind. He had you. He knew that we
[2024.0s] would have the children that we have and
[2026.8s] they will travel this journey of faith
[2031.3s] just as you also are in this journey of
[2034.2s] faith. And it says because of this we
[2037.1s] are seated together with him.
[2041.8s] I want to ask pathfinders who are the
[2044.9s] guest choir to prepare to come up
[2049.2s] front. As I conclude in chapter 2 verse
[2053.0s] 6, it says God who is so full of
[2057.6s] love, made us to
[2061.4s] alive after we are dead. He makes us
[2065.1s] alive and makes us to sit
[2068.8s] together with Christ in the heavenly
[2072.9s] places. And so being called, we are
[2077.8s] called. And our position in heaven in
[2082.5s] Christ Jesus is that of sitting down
[2087.0s] upon the throne of God, the kingdom of
[2090.8s] God. We are seated with Christ by
[2095.8s] faith in the heavenly places.
[2100.4s] We are
[2102.4s] called to accept and to be in that line.
[2107.7s] And therefore, since Christ has taken
[2110.6s] the kingdom, we are to sit to have
[2115.2s] dominion with Christ in the heavenly
[2118.4s] places.
[2122.2s] Paul continues this thought and he said
[2126.9s] that we are united in fact in this in in
[2130.7s] this faith we have a
[2133.8s] father who through whom when we we
[2137.0s] believe in him he is the
[2139.4s] father whose
[2141.6s] name is mentioned in heaven and here on
[2145.6s] earth we have to accept it and so the
[2149.1s] gospel
[2150.0s] is about accepting that kingdom of
[2153.2s] dominion.
[2154.8s] Sit, walk, stand, and run this race of
[2163.2s] faith. Chapter 4 verse 1 to3 says, I beg
[2168.3s] you that you may walk worthy of the
[2172.2s] calling.
[2174.1s] And chapter six says, "Make sure that
[2178.6s] you put on the whole armor of the Lord
[2181.0s] that you may stand against the attacks
[2185.5s] of the evil one." Please come up
[2189.5s] front. And so
[2193.6s] friends, the journey is
[2197.3s] real. Traveling is real. We may have
[2202.1s] wondered or we may have remained in the
[2205.5s] church but are still confused as to what
[2208.9s] true love really
[2210.7s] is. But we are called to travel back to
[2215.9s] the heart of God to discover who he is
[2220.2s] and to live that life as we teach our
[2224.8s] youngsters what being pure, being true,
[2229.6s] being kind, being respectful, being
[2233.2s] attentive, being a people who are
[2237.1s] obedient and reverent really means
[2240.7s] because We ourself are in that
[2244.4s] journey. And so just like Paul who
[2248.9s] concluded to Timothy whom he was handing
[2253.3s] over the ministry, we too are called to
[2258.1s] walk this journey. And I just want to
[2261.0s] conclude by reading this are part as our
[2267.5s] youngsters are organizing themselves.
[2271.4s] Listen to how Paul puts it so that we
[2275.9s] not only
[2278.4s] sit with not only walk with not only
[2282.6s] stand but we fight and we run the race.
[2288.8s] Let us get into this journey. Let us
[2292.6s] walk with faith. Let us travel with
[2296.7s] faith. This is how Paul puts it in
[2299.3s] second Timothy chapter 4 verse 6 to8. He
[2303.8s] says, "For I am already being poured out
[2307.0s] as a drink offering and the time of my
[2310.9s] departure is at hand. I have fought the
[2314.2s] good fight. I have finished the race. I
[2318.3s] have kept the faith. Finally, there is
[2321.9s] laid up for me the crown of
[2326.0s] righteousness which the
[2328.7s] Lord which the Lord the righteous judge
[2332.5s] will give to me on that day. But you
[2336.6s] know what is exciting my friend? Paul
[2339.8s] says, "And not only to me only, but also
[2345.3s] to all who have loved his
[2349.9s] appearing." May God help us in this
[2353.8s] walk, in this travel of faith so that
[2357.8s] you and I can truly be assured of our
[2363.0s] destiny. How many with me are saying
[2366.6s] Lord I want to remain faithful, pure,
[2371.5s] kind,
[2372.8s] obedient. I want to be true. I want to
[2377.8s] be reverent. How many are saying Lord I
[2381.7s] have walked this journey and I want to
[2385.0s] travel with you with faith. Hallelujah.
