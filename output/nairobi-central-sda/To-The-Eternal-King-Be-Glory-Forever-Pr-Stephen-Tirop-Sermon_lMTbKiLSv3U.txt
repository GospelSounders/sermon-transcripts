us in Jesus name amen thank you thank you so much this is better indeed even me I'm feeling uh I'm feeling psych to preach uh because of the good um good instruments that we have have thank you it has been a journey indeed an epic epic cruise and to look at our children going from class to class and others waiting for their teachers to come to their stations it has taken months and months of preparation by the teachers what do we say to them Hallelujah and so may the Lord bless the teachers may the Lord bless the leadership on in children Ministry who work collaborate together having this Synergy so that our children and those from the neighborhood can have a place where they can learn more and enter into this journey and Journey from where Genesis 2 Revelation and learning the Seven Seas I know very very soon even as I'm being I'll be done they cannot wait to come and sing the songs that remind them of the lessons that they have learned thank you so much for your dedication and indeed the Lord is gracious and he has created us in a wonderful way I am talking about to the Eternal King be glory forever to the Eternal King be glory forever and this is at the introduction part of this letter that Paul is writing to Timothy when there he begins by telling his story that he is a born servant and that he wants Timothy to take his work seriously as young as he was he is telling Timothy take this task so that you can fulfill what has to be done in the congregation he was left to take care of and he's telling him to teach the right teaching so that he can correct the errors of those who had different Viewpoint of the matters that touches on religion and so he is setting these matters clearly before Timothy and as he continues he talks about himself who he calls himself the chief of Sinners why because this glorious gracious Immortal Eternal King had mercy on him who was a blasphemer who was a persecutor P who had in fact used all his skills and knowledge to convince judges to convince rulers that Christians those who believed in Jesus Christ become that those who believe in Jesus Christ be were worthy of being killed and he dragged them from time to time friends this Paul is the one who now says to the Eternal King be glory forever and ever why because of the goodness of the Lord hallelujah and and so I want to bring to you this story the story that happened just in our neighborhood that the power of Grace is still operating in the hearts and of men and women who have received Jesus as their personal savior right across a few borders we have Rwanda and at one time in 1994 the country descended into chaos when men and women fellow citizen descended on each other with machetes with weapons of Destruction and actually butchered each other so many died unfortunately the church was not paired the church was divided and when the church was divided one of the members of the church in fact he was baptized by this pastoral family because of this enmity that had grown he thought to do he's part of communial commitment and as a community he wanted to do away with the hu the the Tooty and being a Hu he decided to go with others I himself went into the pastor's house with a sharp machete he chopped off the head of his Pastor he raised his machete and hit his wife She fainted in the in the skull there was gashing wound and She fainted the son who was 20 years came and he thought he would find his parents safe only to arrive his father was dead his mother was fighting for life he picked the mother took him to hospital and for a whole month she was in coma but praise the Lord she survived the attack now after all this turel after all these terrible acts this woman when she had gone back to a village chose to go to the market and as she was there in the market the tormenta was there this man who had killed his husband the pastor who baptized him was there in the market and Alas and behold they met face to face and when this man recognized this shepher pastor's wife whom he thought he had killed he was shocked and immediately he fell down and in conversion roll from side to side everyone wondered what is happening and they came the marketplace people came men and women and he say she said don't lay your hands on him I think he's shocked please help me carry him to my house when the man came to himself he was escorted and helped the clothes were torn and dirty she took this man to her house gave him water to birth gave him food and after that she gave him the clothes of his 20 year-old son to put on and then told this man I hear you are no longer going to church I have forgiven you and I would want you to give your life to Jesus run to Jesus and go back to the church so that you can make ways right with God as for me have forgiven you you killed my husband and you were you thought you had killed me but the Lord kept me alive and I'm telling you I forgiven you because of the love of God go back to God and go back to the church so that you you can make your ways right with God grace is Av valuable to us and because of the grace that we have received we can treat each other better Hallelujah it is because of this reason friends that in this Epic cruise in this journey this wonderful Journey that the children are hard and it is coined in this jungle travel in this one week that the children have interacted with the stories of the Bible it is indeed that Christ who in spite of the perfect creation the confusion the catastrophe that is there yet Jesus came this Christ Our Savior came went to the cross and from the cross we have the consumation of the love of God that wants us to sit and be and worship our king forever and ever Hallelujah and so in this one this story Paul who was a religious man in his Zeal to eliminate this new religion that seem to go against all that they had been taught this religion which elevated a man who walked in the streets of of Galilee with sleepers this man whom they knew the mother to be Mary and they thought that his son of Joseph this man who they accused that he was preaching and blaspheming God that they were elevating him and saying this Jesus is also God and is a king hello praise the Lord [Music] Church in observing religious beliefs men have killed in the name of God and Paul is saying he is such a one insolent persecutor Blasphemous yet the grace of God was poured unto him and together with his grace this love of God boiled in his heart and when it was reveal to him this killer this persecutor this proponent of Mur and relation of men and women who believed in Jesus Christ this man said I discovered that although I was all this yet God l loved me and that is why this Grace which he says was outpoured produced faith and love in his heart for others that is in verse 13 and so he says I Paul I'm also an object of this grace and because of the grace of God although I persecuted the church I killed many I am less I am the least of the Apostles and then as he preached the gospel and members joined the church and people were baptized and they loved Jesus Christ and the saint continued and the churches continued as he wrote to the churches he said I am the least of the Saints pleasing himself although he was a leader yet he placed himself at the position of every believer because friends although we may serve in whatever status or levels of leadership our saity is in believing Jesus Christ as our personal Savior and relating with him not because of our positions of leadership or status but because he had Grace and saved us from ourself from our confusion from the things that we have done in our past history we each have a history and despite that history God's grace is available to all of us and so for that matter whatever our circumstances as young people as children we may be coming from homes where we are seeing terrible things but by the grace of God we can be with the king of kings and worship him because he deserves of all our glory and praise Hallelujah and so this King of Kings to whom we worship Paul is giving us in his introduction is talking about teaching to correct error as a theme and the second one is gratitude for grace and that is worship and then the third theme that he is is bringing to Timothy is the motive for Ministry we will not touch on those I'm I'm only today because of the theme to The Eternal King be glory forever I'll touch on gratitude for Grace which is worship Hallelujah and so because of this Grace this Mercy Paul is saying he is thanking God for giving him strength for trusting him with his privilege of ministry but as he recognizes this grace in vers 13 He talks about that he was counted fit to also have this gracious love of God poured in his heart and together with Grace he saying there was born in his heart love for God and Faith which is also a gift of Grace Hallelujah and so friends in our weakness in our confused circumstances in our at times when we do not know how to align faith and Duty how to align line the Commandments of God and how God changes Us by his grace and at times because we are confused like Paul we may be hard hitting we may be people who are too strict that we fail to show love to even our children at home why because we think that they're missing something in our confused circumstances as our young ones grow into adolescence and teenage and into youthful years they need people who have discovered the grace of God like Paul and who say I am a repositor of God's grace and because of God's grace which have been given even although I was less than perfect although I missed myself somewhere this grace of God is evident that each and every living human being can find that Grace and worship the king of kings and so Paul is saying I am praising God I am saying to the king in Eternal be glory forever why because he has bestowed Grace he has given me Faith and love he has made me to minister which is a privilege and because of all this it shows that he values me and he wants me to unite with him in bringing a difference in the world that which we preach in the church for men and women to come to church we can preach in our families by understanding that despite our weakness despite the things we have done this God who forgive us can forgive our children loves our children and he is ready and he has prepared a place for them and for me so that we can worship him in the the kingdom forever and ever Hallelujah so don't be too hard like Paul don't be too harsh don't be too strict let the grace and the love of God melt your heart as a parent as a leader and let us make smooth paths for the weak feet of our children let us make a smooth path by being an example of this love of God that changes cruel people like Paul into Ministers of the gospel and so Brethren I invite you so that we can glorify this King to know that indeed as Paul lived this is the truth that he wants everyone to know that Christ came and he came to save Sinners and Paul is saying is not only the list of the Apostles and the list of the Saints but he is also among the Sinners the chief of Sinners and if he was forgiven God can forgive everyone and make him a minister of the Gospel are we choosing to tell others of God's love and to let God love God's love fill our hearts are we choosing to leave it in our family do we want to be filled with this love that Paul says by grace and this love he poured it into my heart and it is not only Grace and love that he poured but he also poured faith because love and grace encourages and gives birth to life that is why Christ is the author and finisher of our faith how many with me are saying Lord you loved me you came you died and though I am I'm not perfect I've done wrong things but I Need Your Love are you there praise the Lord I need that you can make me a minister by this Grace Pour Your Grace and love and faith in my heart that I may serve you are

[112.7s] of preparation by the teachers what do

[125.4s] leadership on in children Ministry who
[129.5s] work collaborate together having this
[133.4s] Synergy so that our children and those
[137.9s] from the neighborhood can have a place
[142.0s] where they can learn more and enter into
[146.8s] this
[148.7s] journey and Journey from
[152.0s] where Genesis
[154.8s] 2 Revelation and learning the Seven Seas
[160.0s] I know very very soon even as I'm being
[164.8s] I'll be
[165.8s] done they cannot wait to come and sing
[169.6s] the songs that remind them of the

[173.8s] learned thank you so much for your
[177.4s] dedication and indeed the Lord is
[180.7s] gracious and he has created us in a
[183.2s] wonderful
[186.0s] way I am talking about to the Eternal
[190.4s] King be glory
[193.8s] forever to the Eternal King be glory
[199.0s] forever and this is at the introduction
[203.6s] part of this letter that Paul is writing
[207.2s] to
[208.6s] Timothy when there he
[211.0s] begins by telling his story that he is a
[216.0s] born servant and that he wants Timothy
[221.7s] to take his work
[224.2s] seriously as young as he was he is
[227.8s] telling Timothy take this task so that
[232.9s] you can fulfill what has to be done in
[238.9s] the congregation
[240.5s] he was left to take care of and he's
[244.2s] telling him to teach the right teaching
[248.3s] so that he can correct the
[251.2s] errors of those
[254.1s] who had different Viewpoint of the
[259.3s] matters that touches on
[263.0s] religion and so he is setting these
[267.5s] matters
[268.7s] clearly before Timothy and as he
[272.7s] continues he talks about himself who he
[277.2s] calls
[278.9s] himself the chief of Sinners why because
[285.1s] this glorious gracious Immortal Eternal
[291.2s] King had mercy on him who was a
[296.8s] blasphemer who was a persecutor P who
[302.2s] had in fact used all his skills and
[308.0s] knowledge to convince judges to convince
[313.4s] rulers that
[315.4s] Christians those who believed in Jesus
[320.9s] Christ
[323.3s] become that those who believe in Jesus
[327.9s] Christ be were worthy of being killed
[333.1s] and he dragged them from time to time
[339.0s] friends this Paul is the one who now
[343.6s] says to the
[345.7s] Eternal King be
[349.3s] glory forever and ever why because of
[355.4s] the goodness of the Lord
[358.5s] hallelujah and and so I want to bring to
[362.0s] you this
[363.4s] story the story that happened just in
[367.0s] our
[368.8s] neighborhood that the power of Grace is
[372.4s] still operating in the hearts and of men
[376.7s] and women who have received Jesus as
[379.5s] their personal
[381.9s] savior right across a few borders we
[387.0s] have
[387.9s] Rwanda and at one
[390.1s] time in
[393.6s] 1994 the country descended into chaos
[399.3s] when men and women fellow citizen
[403.6s] descended on each
[405.4s] other with
[407.6s] machetes with
[410.2s] weapons of Destruction and actually
[414.8s] butchered each
[417.1s] other so many died
[420.4s] unfortunately the church was not
[424.4s] paired the church was divided and when
[428.1s] the church was
[430.4s] divided one of the members of the
[434.1s] church in fact he was baptized by this
[439.0s] pastoral
[440.9s] family because of this enmity that had
[446.2s] grown he thought to do he's part of
[451.2s] communial commitment and as a community
[455.5s] he wanted to do away with the hu the the
[460.0s] Tooty and being a
[462.3s] Hu he decided to go with others I
[467.7s] himself went into the pastor's
[472.9s] house with a sharp
[476.6s] machete he chopped off the head of his
[481.9s] Pastor he raised his
[485.8s] machete and
[488.2s] hit his
[490.6s] wife She
[493.4s] fainted in the in the skull there was
[498.3s] gashing
[500.4s] wound and She
[503.8s] fainted the son who was 20 years
[507.8s] came and
[510.9s] he
[512.0s] thought he would find his parents
[516.2s] safe only to arrive his father was dead
[520.7s] his mother was fighting for
[524.0s] life he picked the mother took him to
[528.0s] hospital and for a whole
[531.4s] month she was in
[533.6s] coma but praise the Lord she survived
[537.9s] the attack
[541.7s] now after all
[545.4s] this turel after all these terrible
[552.0s] acts this woman when she had gone back
[557.0s] to a village chose to go to the
[562.9s] market and as she was there in the
[566.5s] market the tormenta was there
[570.6s] this man who had

[576.4s] baptized him was there in the
[579.9s] market and Alas and
[583.2s] behold they met face to
[587.3s] face and when this
[590.1s] man
[591.8s] recognized this shepher pastor's wife
[596.9s] whom he thought he had killed
[601.0s] he was
[602.5s] shocked and immediately he fell down and
[606.6s] in conversion roll from side to
[612.4s] side everyone wondered what is
[615.4s] happening and they
[619.2s] came the marketplace people came men and
[623.8s] women and he say she said don't lay your
[628.2s] hands on him I think he's
[631.0s] shocked please help me carry him to my

[641.8s] was escorted and helped the clothes were
[646.1s] torn and

[654.7s] birth gave him
[657.3s] food and
[659.8s] after that she gave him the clothes of
[663.9s] his 20 year-old son to put on and then
[668.5s] told this man I hear you are no longer
[672.0s] going to
[673.8s] church I have forgiven
[676.5s] you and I would want you to give your
[681.3s] life to Jesus run to Jesus and go back
[686.4s] to the church so that you can make
[689.9s] ways right with God as for me have

[698.7s] you
[700.4s] were you thought you had killed me but

[708.2s] you I forgiven you because of the love
[712.0s] of God go back to God and go back to the
[717.7s] church so that you you can make your
[720.2s] ways right with God grace is Av valuable
[725.4s] to us and because of the grace that we
[728.8s] have received we can treat each other
[732.8s] better
[734.8s] Hallelujah it is because of this reason
[738.6s] friends that in this Epic cruise in this
[744.5s] journey this wonderful Journey that the
[748.1s] children are hard and it is coined in
[752.2s] this jungle
[755.2s] travel in this one week that the
[758.8s] children have interacted with the
[761.2s] stories of the Bible it is indeed that
[766.6s] Christ who in spite of the perfect
[771.6s] creation the confusion the catastrophe
[775.2s] that is
[776.8s] there yet Jesus
[779.7s] came this Christ Our Savior came went to
[784.7s] the cross and from the cross we have the
[791.0s] consumation of the love of God that
[794.6s] wants us to sit and be and worship our
[799.6s] king forever and
[802.4s] ever
[805.6s] Hallelujah and so in this one this
[811.5s] story Paul who was a religious
[816.4s] man in his Zeal to eliminate this new
[823.5s] religion that seem to go
[826.9s] against all that they had been
[830.0s] taught this religion which
[835.0s] elevated a man who walked in the streets
[838.9s] of of
[841.0s] Galilee
[842.9s] with
[846.2s] sleepers this man whom they knew the
[850.7s] mother to be
[852.8s] Mary and they thought that his son of
[857.2s] Joseph this man who they accused that he
[862.0s] was preaching and
[864.6s] blaspheming
[867.6s] God that they were elevating him and
[871.1s] saying this Jesus is also God and is a
[877.8s] king
[879.7s] hello praise the
[882.2s] Lord
[883.7s] [Music]
[885.7s] Church in observing religious
[891.8s] beliefs men have killed in the name of
[897.1s] God and Paul is saying he is such a
[903.8s] one
[905.6s] insolent
[907.6s] persecutor
[909.6s] Blasphemous yet the grace of
[914.4s] God was poured unto him and together
[919.5s] with his
[921.8s] grace this love of God boiled in his
[926.4s] heart and when it was reveal to him this
[933.0s] killer this
[935.6s] persecutor this proponent
[940.3s] of Mur and relation of men and women who
[945.9s] believed in Jesus
[948.1s] Christ
[950.0s] this man said I discovered that although
[955.6s] I was all this yet God l loved me and
[960.0s] that is why this Grace which he says was
[964.5s] outpoured produced faith and love in his
[969.0s] heart for
[970.6s] others that is in verse 13 and so he
[974.4s] says I Paul I'm also an object of this
[978.3s] grace and because of the grace of God
[982.2s] although I persecuted the church I
[985.0s] killed many I am less
[989.9s] I am the least of the
[993.3s] Apostles and then as he preached the
[996.0s] gospel and members joined the church and
[999.3s] people were baptized and they loved
[1001.9s] Jesus
[1003.2s] Christ and the saint continued and the
[1006.4s] churches continued as he wrote to the
[1009.2s] churches he said I am the least of the
[1014.0s] Saints pleasing himself although he was
[1017.8s] a leader yet he placed himself at the
[1022.0s] position of every believer because
[1026.0s] friends although we may serve in
[1028.8s] whatever status or levels of
[1032.8s] leadership our saity is in believing
[1036.4s] Jesus Christ as our personal
[1039.4s] Savior and relating with him not because
[1043.6s] of our positions of leadership or status
[1047.6s] but because he had Grace and saved us
[1051.9s] from ourself from our confusion from the
[1055.9s] things that we have done in our past
[1059.2s] history we each have a
[1063.6s] history and despite that
[1067.1s] history God's grace is available to all
[1071.0s] of
[1072.4s] us and so for that
[1076.0s] matter whatever our circumstances as
[1079.0s] young people as children we may be
[1082.8s] coming from homes where we are seeing
[1086.2s] terrible
[1088.8s] things but by the grace of God we can be
[1094.0s] with the king of kings and worship him
[1097.2s] because he deserves of all our glory and
[1100.4s] praise
[1102.6s] Hallelujah and so this King of Kings to
[1107.2s] whom we worship
[1109.3s] Paul is giving
[1113.0s] us in his introduction is talking about
[1117.9s] teaching to correct error as a theme and
[1121.8s] the second one is gratitude for grace
[1126.2s] and that is worship and then the third
[1129.1s] theme that he is is bringing to Timothy
[1134.5s] is the motive for
[1137.2s] Ministry we will not touch on those I'm
[1140.1s] I'm only today because of the theme to
[1143.2s] The Eternal King be glory forever I'll
[1147.0s] touch on gratitude for Grace which is
[1151.4s] worship
[1155.2s] Hallelujah and so because of this
[1158.5s] Grace this
[1160.7s] Mercy Paul is saying he is thanking God
[1166.6s] for giving him strength for trusting him
[1170.2s] with his privilege of
[1172.3s] ministry but as he recognizes this grace
[1176.8s] in vers 13 He talks about that he was
[1183.2s] counted
[1185.8s] fit to
[1187.8s] also have this gracious love of God
[1193.2s] poured in his heart and together with
[1195.8s] Grace he saying there was born in his
[1199.7s] heart love for God and
[1203.4s] Faith which is also a gift of Grace
[1208.5s] Hallelujah and so friends in our
[1212.4s] weakness in our confused
[1216.1s] circumstances in our at times when we do
[1221.5s] not know how to
[1224.4s] align faith and
[1226.9s] Duty how to align line the Commandments
[1231.2s] of God and how God changes Us by his
[1236.6s] grace and at times because we are
[1240.6s] confused like
[1242.4s] Paul we may be hard hitting we may be
[1248.7s] people who are too strict that we fail
[1252.4s] to show love to even our children at
[1255.1s] home why because we think that they're
[1258.9s] missing
[1261.0s] something in our confused circumstances
[1265.1s] as our young ones grow into adolescence
[1268.5s] and teenage and into youthful years they
[1273.2s] need people who have discovered the
[1275.5s] grace of God like
[1277.3s] Paul and who say I
[1281.2s] am a repositor of God's grace and
[1285.4s] because of God's grace which have been
[1288.3s] given even although I was less than
[1291.1s] perfect although I missed myself
[1295.4s] somewhere this grace of God is evident
[1300.2s] that each and every living human being
[1305.5s] can find that Grace and worship the king
[1308.4s] of
[1309.5s] kings and so Paul is saying I
[1313.5s] am praising God I am saying to the king
[1318.6s] in Eternal be glory forever why because
[1323.2s] he has bestowed Grace he has given me
[1326.6s] Faith and love he has made me to
[1330.2s] minister which is a privilege and
[1333.4s] because of all this it shows that he
[1336.9s] values me and he wants me to unite with
[1341.5s] him in bringing a difference in the
[1345.6s] world that which we preach in the church
[1348.5s] for men and women to come to church we
[1351.6s] can preach in our families by
[1355.6s] understanding that despite our weakness
[1358.8s] despite the things we have done this God
[1362.0s] who forgive
[1363.6s] us can forgive our children loves our
[1368.6s] children and he is ready and he has
[1372.7s] prepared a place for them and for me so
[1376.8s] that we can worship him in the the
[1378.8s] kingdom forever and
[1381.0s] ever
[1382.8s] Hallelujah so don't be too hard like
[1386.5s] Paul don't be too harsh don't be too
[1390.8s] strict let the grace and the love of God
[1394.6s] melt your heart as a parent as a leader
[1398.4s] and let us make smooth
[1402.7s] paths for the weak feet of our
[1406.0s] children let us make a smooth
[1409.0s] path by being an example of this love of
[1413.3s] God that changes cruel people like Paul
[1418.7s] into Ministers of the
[1420.8s] gospel and so
[1423.0s] Brethren I invite
[1425.6s] you so that we can glorify this King to
[1430.9s] know that indeed as Paul lived this is
[1436.1s] the truth that he wants
[1439.1s] everyone
[1440.7s] to know that Christ came and he came to
[1446.1s] save Sinners and Paul is saying is not
[1450.5s] only the list of the
[1453.4s] Apostles and the list of the
[1456.4s] Saints but he is also among the Sinners
[1461.2s] the chief of Sinners and if he was
[1464.5s] forgiven God can forgive everyone and
[1468.5s] make him a minister of the
[1471.1s] Gospel are we choosing to tell others of
[1474.4s] God's love and to let God love God's
[1477.7s] love fill our hearts are we choosing to
[1480.7s] leave it in our family do we want to be
[1485.3s] filled with this love that Paul says by
[1488.3s] grace and this love he poured it into my
[1491.6s] heart and it is not only Grace and love
[1494.5s] that he poured but he also poured faith
[1498.6s] because love and
[1501.4s] grace encourages and gives birth to life
[1505.1s] that is why Christ is the author and
[1508.1s] finisher of our faith how many with me
[1510.8s] are saying Lord you loved me you came
[1514.4s] you died and though I am I'm not perfect
[1518.8s] I've done wrong things but I Need Your
