FULL TRANSCRIPT:
good morning good evening good afternoon from wherever you are uh it's so nice to have you once again uh as we discussed the book When God Says remember last time we talked about A Day to Remember chapter 3 and previously we had talked about chapter 1 uh rest for The Rush and set free to obey but today today we're talking about History's Greatest Hox History's Greatest HX but before we start I'd just like to invite uh our our co- panel is here to introduce themselves we'll start from my right hello my name is siir and I'm so glad to be here fantastic hi my name is Winston and welcome back yeah uh before I invite Winston to take us through a summary perhaps let us pray dear Father in heaven we come before you father at this time once again oh Lord God we ask for your grace we ask you oh Father to be with us to be our companion as we discuss this book when you said remember oh father now be with us I pray in Jesus name amen amen Winston please give us a summary of chapter 4 History's Greatest hes um thank you so much for the introduction shabis and over to start with the chapter History's Greatest Hawks so the first thing that we need to ask ourselves is what is a hawk and you know speaking of hawks sometimes you see things aren't always what they appear to be and I feel like they very good examples when in the beginning of the Book of Mark Finley where first he starts by speaking of the fact that for many very very many centuries scientists uh believed that Earth was stationary and everything including the Sun the Stars rotated around the the Sun but the fact sorry rotated around the Earth but the fact that they actually believe that this was true doesn't mean that it was actually true and later on there was this scientist called Copernicus who is the one who actually figured out that it's it's it's not earth that is stationary but Earth is the one that is rotating around the Sun another good example is um the belief that the spider was insect you know for many years people used to think that the spider was an insect and it has six legs but the fact is that it is an arachnid with eight legs and I feel like you know this brings us to the deceitful nature of Saturn where we see that Saturn is really good in his tactics and his work of deceiving the people of God and something that we see is that according to these things that we've seen the fact that um people believe that Earth was stationary and the theory about the spider the big question is could it be a tradition like this one could have slipped into the church and what I actually say is you know for someone to deceive you a very good example again given in the book is for a counter fater you know if you're a counter fater let's take an example te bismar if you were to make a counterfeit of money here Kenya would you like make a counterfeit of 13 Shillings or rather 300 Shillings actually not cuz it doesn't exist if you are good in your work of counterfeiting you'll probably make 100 chilling NES 200 chilling notes and 1,000 chilling notes so it actually also brings the fact that Saturn is really good in his work and he targets the truth he cloths the truth with falsehood yes so that you know we can see that it's actually true yes but the real nature is that it's it's false and so the big question regarding that you're speaking of Sabbath is who changed the Sabbath when was it changed and why yeah and we see from Malachi 3:6 I think this speaks about God it says that you know God is the same he doesn't change and we see that he actually didn't change the Sabbath and if God didn't change the Sabbath did Jesus change the Sabbath neither did he he did not and even as we Pi of in the previous chapter that um you know even When Jesus ascended in heaven he left us with a a PL to to keep the Sabbath also so his disciples also didn't change the Sabbath and this is actually where we get the theories and meats where how the Sabbath changed where we have the the prophecies about the the mysterious little horn and about the beasts speaking of the where the Beast symbolizes the kingdoms and all that and I feel like you know this historical change on how the Sabbath came to change from Saturday to Sunday it has really you know brought some sort of confusion so i' i' like to ask subira you know according to this historical change where we see in the book that the Sabbath was changed from Saturday to Sunday what do you think um how does it influence our Christian faith and how does it affect our spiritual journey yeah okay thank you so much for that beautiful summary and also the question that you posed my thing that comes out to me first is does the church have the authority to change God's law and even as we yeah so even as we looked in our prophecy class for teens's class we we talked about the law with no amendments and how God's law is immutable unchangeable it's constant it has sort of had a Timeless effect throughout all these Generations there's not been compromised of the law for the sake of the impurities and inconsist encies of man therefore as there's a historical shift from Saturday observance of the Sabbath to Sunday observance of the Sabbath that's extremely detrimental to what we stand for and so even as seventh day Adventists for us to stay with this sabbath rule it's really to defy the so-called Authority that man has put for himself and so man has no Authority our Faith needs to be rooted in the law and most importantly rooted in truth the second our faith is dependent on the authority of man it's not really strong as much as we want it to be strong it's not really and so I think the influence on our faith and the impact of it is many people who go to church on Sunday whether they know it or not are defying God intentionally defying find God because they're not keeping the Sabbath and I know that there are brothers and sisters in these different denominations of Christianity and we recognize them as with us because we all believe in Christ Jesus however it's very crucial to have an unwavering understanding of what God's truth and God's law is yeah thank you so much to and we have actually seen that um this historical change has an effect on our spiritual journey and just to touch a bit on the history of how the Sabbath got to change to be changed from Saturday to Sunday um we see it from prophecies and the translation of the pro prophecies from what has been experienced in history we get answers both from the Bible and history where from the Bible about the little horn the mysterious little horn to change times yeah yeah the Beast and all that that's Biblical reference and from historical reference we see from the superpowers all the way from Daniel's uh Reign no not rain the when Daniel was there from Babylon Babylon to Media to Greece and to the Roman where the Roman church now Chang the Sabbath Constantine you have something oh I apologize really quickly that made me definitely think about a quote that I saw in this book where it is important to choose to follow the Bible and God's law and obey his word rather than the tradition or human teachings just really quickly and how sometimes we're so focused on this traditional norms and so because humans have done it for a long time why are we defying but I would like to argue that if we are faced with this normany that is against God's law our Defiance becomes so much more rare and so experiencing this Rarity of defiance in the name of God is ex very very crucial to the human experience and God Prides in those who are faithful towards him yeah thank you so much subir and just to wind up um for us we recognize and we know that the true biblical Sabbath is on Saturday and so just to ask teacher bismar how do you think we as the Believers of the biblical Sabbath you know how can we respond to this historical change that happened ages ago and in a way that can still promote Unity among our churches yeah I think that's a good question for us uh as Sabbath Keepers I think our our path is one you know and it's even given there in the book and uh it references the Book of Joshua CH 24:15 where it says choose for yourselves the this day whom you will serve will it be the Bible or tradition will it be Jesus or religious leaders will it be God's law or man's law will it be God's instruction or human teaching what will it be will it be God's way or man's way you know we have to choose for ourselves uh precisely what we will do however how can we reconcile this with our fellow Brethren and does that mean that everybody who worships on Sunday will go to hell uh certainly not it does not mean that it what it does mean is that you know perhaps we could conclude that there are some people who worship on Sunday who truly love God you know and are worshiping him to the best of their knowledge you know and they have whatever knowledge that they have you know they say you know this is what I know and this is what I'll I shall I shall do however for the people who know the truth and are actively and purposefully uh rejecting it and looking to do their own thing you know then un fortunately I think you know they are defiant against God you know they they defying God as it were and so you know our job as Christians is really to pray for them and to ask God really to have mercy on them and to show them the right way and I think that is our duty that's our duty yeah yeah yeah thank you so much and I think here we have a privilege where we get the privilege of choice just as you said where we can either choose Bible or tradition or the man's way or God's way yeah thank you thank you so much Winston and thank you so much dear viewer thank you so much subira thank you so much everyone uh for joining us uh on on discussing this this this particular chapter you know it's so important for us to know you know uh these sort of or really the truth behind uh the Sabbath uh uh yes and funnily enough that this really quickly it's called history's great hoax but we find that human history there is a historical record of our shift into sin but also there's a historical record all the way back to the creation story in which God offers us truth so in our history there is light and darkness choose light amen amen choose light choose light well join us once again ladies and gentlemen as next time uh we'll be discussing chapter five chapter 5 and it's a wonderful chapter it's called unad Advance on eternity and Advance on eternity see you then thank you you

TIMESTAMPED TRANSCRIPT:
[0.2s] good morning good evening good afternoon
[1.6s] from wherever you are uh it's so nice to
[4.5s] have you once again uh as we discussed
[7.3s] the book When God Says remember last
[10.3s] time we talked about A Day to Remember
[12.5s] chapter 3 and previously we had talked
[14.6s] about chapter 1 uh rest for The Rush and
[17.7s] set free to obey but today today we're
[20.6s] talking about History's Greatest Hox
[24.3s] History's Greatest HX but before we
[26.8s] start I'd just like to invite uh our our
[29.5s] co- panel is here to introduce
[31.1s] themselves we'll start from my right
[33.6s] hello my name is siir and I'm so glad to
[36.2s] be here fantastic hi my name is Winston
[39.9s] and welcome back yeah uh before I invite
[43.4s] Winston to take us through a summary
[45.0s] perhaps let us pray dear Father in
[47.5s] heaven we come before you father at this
[49.3s] time once again oh Lord God we ask for
[52.0s] your grace we ask you oh Father to be
[54.9s] with us to be our companion as we
[57.2s] discuss this book when you said remember
[60.8s] oh father now be with us I pray in Jesus
[63.7s] name amen amen Winston please give us a
[67.0s] summary of chapter 4 History's Greatest
[69.3s] hes um thank you so much for the
[71.2s] introduction shabis and over to start
[74.2s] with the chapter History's Greatest
[76.1s] Hawks so the first thing that we need to
[79.6s] ask ourselves is what is a hawk and you
[84.0s] know speaking of hawks sometimes you see
[87.6s] things aren't always what they appear to
[89.7s] be
[91.0s] and I feel like they very good examples
[94.2s] when in the beginning of the Book of
[96.5s] Mark Finley where first he starts by
[99.5s] speaking of the fact that for many very
[101.9s] very many centuries scientists uh
[104.4s] believed that Earth was stationary and
[107.0s] everything including the Sun the Stars
[109.8s] rotated around the the Sun but the fact
[113.4s] sorry rotated around the Earth but the
[116.6s] fact that they actually believe that
[119.1s] this was true doesn't mean that it was
[121.4s] actually true and later on there was
[125.1s] this scientist called Copernicus who is
[128.8s] the one who actually figured out that
[132.7s] it's it's it's not earth that is
[134.3s] stationary but Earth is the one that is
[137.5s] rotating around the Sun another good
[139.7s] example is um the belief that the spider
[143.2s] was insect you know for many years
[146.0s] people used to think that the spider was
[149.6s] an insect and it has six legs but the
[152.4s] fact is that it is an arachnid with
[155.0s] eight legs and I feel like you know this
[158.8s] brings us to the deceitful nature of
[162.0s] Saturn where we see that Saturn is
[165.6s] really good in his tactics and his work
[169.2s] of deceiving the people of God and
[173.6s] something that we see is
[175.8s] that according to these things that
[177.9s] we've seen the fact that um people
[181.2s] believe that Earth was stationary and
[183.8s] the theory about the spider the big
[186.4s] question is could it be a tradition like
[190.0s] this one could have slipped into the
[192.4s] church and what I actually say is you
[196.4s] know for someone to deceive you a very
[198.6s] good example again given in the book is
[201.0s] for a counter fater you know if you're a
[203.6s] counter fater let's take an example te
[206.3s] bismar if you were to make a counterfeit
[209.1s] of money here Kenya would you like make
[212.7s] a counterfeit of 13 Shillings or rather
[216.0s] 300
[217.1s] Shillings actually not cuz it doesn't
[219.8s] exist if you are good in your work of
[222.0s] counterfeiting you'll probably make 100
[224.7s] chilling NES 200 chilling notes and
[227.5s] 1,000 chilling notes so it actually also
[230.4s] brings the fact that Saturn is really
[232.2s] good in his work and he targets the
[235.6s] truth he cloths the truth with falsehood
[239.4s] yes so that you know we can see that
[243.6s] it's actually true yes but the real
[245.8s] nature is that it's it's false and so
[249.2s] the big question regarding that you're
[251.2s] speaking of Sabbath is who changed the
[254.0s] Sabbath when was it changed and
[257.7s] why yeah and we see from Malachi 3:6 I
[263.0s] think this speaks about God it says that
[265.6s] you know God is the same he doesn't
[268.4s] change and
[270.6s] we see that he actually didn't change
[272.6s] the Sabbath and if God didn't change the
[275.1s] Sabbath did Jesus change the Sabbath
[278.3s] neither did he he did not and even as we
[281.6s] Pi of in the previous chapter that
[286.4s] um you know even When Jesus ascended in
[289.3s] heaven he left us with a a PL to to keep
[294.4s] the Sabbath also so his disciples also
[297.2s] didn't change the Sabbath and this is
[299.7s] actually where we get the theories and
[301.4s] meats where how the Sabbath changed
[304.5s] where we have the the prophecies about
[307.6s] the the mysterious little horn and about
[310.8s] the beasts speaking of the where the
[313.2s] Beast symbolizes the kingdoms and all
[316.4s] that
[317.9s] and I feel like you know this historical
[320.6s] change on how the Sabbath came to change
[324.0s] from Saturday to Sunday it has really
[326.8s] you know brought some sort of confusion
[329.2s] so i' i' like to ask subira you know
[332.0s] according to this historical change
[334.2s] where we see in the book that the
[335.9s] Sabbath was changed from Saturday to
[339.6s] Sunday what do you think um how does it
[343.0s] influence our Christian faith and how
[345.7s] does it affect our spiritual journey
[348.0s] yeah okay thank you so much for that
[350.1s] beautiful summary and also the question
[351.8s] that you posed my thing that comes out
[354.8s] to me first is does the church have the
[358.8s] authority
[360.2s] to change God's
[362.4s] law and even as we yeah so even as we
[365.7s] looked in our prophecy class for teens's
[367.7s] class we we talked about the law with no
[370.8s] amendments and how God's law is
[373.8s] immutable
[375.5s] unchangeable it's constant it has sort
[379.8s] of had a Timeless effect throughout all
[382.6s] these Generations there's not been
[384.4s] compromised of the law for the sake of
[387.8s] the impurities and inconsist encies of
[390.5s] man
[392.3s] therefore as there's a historical shift
[394.9s] from Saturday observance of the Sabbath
[397.8s] to Sunday observance of the
[401.0s] Sabbath that's extremely detrimental to
[403.8s] what we stand for and so even as seventh
[406.4s] day Adventists for us to stay with this
[408.8s] sabbath rule it's really to
[412.0s] defy the so-called Authority that man
[414.8s] has put for himself and so man has no
[418.1s] Authority our Faith needs to be rooted
[421.1s] in the law and most importantly rooted
[423.9s] in truth the second our faith is
[426.3s] dependent on the authority of
[429.4s] man it's not really strong as much as we
[432.7s] want it to be strong it's not really and
[435.2s] so I think the influence on our faith
[437.4s] and the impact of it is many people who
[440.3s] go to church on
[442.0s] Sunday whether they know it or not
[445.2s] are defying
[447.6s] God intentionally defying find God
[450.3s] because they're not keeping the Sabbath
[452.6s] and I know that there are brothers and
[454.2s] sisters in these different denominations
[456.2s] of Christianity and we recognize them as
[460.1s] with us because we all believe in Christ
[462.7s] Jesus however it's very crucial to have
[466.3s] an
[467.1s] unwavering understanding of what God's
[469.3s] truth and God's law is yeah thank you so
[472.0s] much to and we have actually seen that
[476.0s] um this historical change has an effect
[479.8s] on our spiritual journey and just to
[482.0s] touch a bit on the history of how the
[485.1s] Sabbath got to change to be changed from
[487.2s] Saturday to Sunday um we see it from
[490.5s] prophecies and the translation of the
[493.0s] pro prophecies from what has been
[495.0s] experienced in history we get answers
[497.9s] both from the Bible and history where
[500.2s] from the Bible about the little horn the
[503.1s] mysterious little horn to change times
[506.1s] yeah yeah the Beast and all that that's
[509.6s] Biblical reference and from historical
[512.5s] reference we see from the superpowers
[516.9s] all the way from
[518.3s] Daniel's uh Reign no not rain the when
[522.8s] Daniel was there from Babylon Babylon to
[526.5s] Media to Greece and to the
[530.1s] Roman where the Roman church now Chang
[533.6s] the Sabbath Constantine you have
[535.8s] something oh I apologize really quickly
[538.7s] that made me definitely think about a
[540.7s] quote that I saw in this book where it
[542.9s] is important to choose to follow the
[544.8s] Bible and God's law and obey his word
[548.0s] rather than the tradition or human
[550.4s] teachings just really quickly and how
[554.0s] sometimes we're so focused on this
[555.6s] traditional norms and so because humans
[558.7s] have done it for a long time why are we
[561.1s] defying but I would like to argue that
[564.3s] if we are faced with this normany that
[566.6s] is against God's law our Defiance
[569.8s] becomes so much more rare and so
[573.2s] experiencing this Rarity of defiance in
[575.4s] the name of God is ex very very crucial
[579.8s] to the human experience and God Prides
[582.3s] in those who are faithful towards him
[585.5s] yeah thank you so much subir and just to
[589.5s] wind up um for us we recognize and we
[592.8s] know that the true biblical Sabbath is
[595.5s] on Saturday and so just to ask teacher
[598.1s] bismar how do you think we as the
[601.1s] Believers of the biblical Sabbath you
[603.7s] know how can we respond to this
[605.9s] historical change that happened ages ago
[609.5s] and in a way that can still promote
[611.5s] Unity among our churches yeah I think
[614.8s] that's a good question for us uh as
[617.6s] Sabbath Keepers I think our our path is
[620.6s] one you know and it's even given there
[622.5s] in the book and uh it references the
[625.4s] Book of Joshua CH 24:15 where it says
[627.8s] choose for yourselves the this day whom
[631.2s] you will serve will it be the Bible or
[633.7s] tradition will it be Jesus or religious
[636.2s] leaders will it be God's law or man's
[638.9s] law will it be God's instruction or
[641.1s] human teaching what will it be will it
[643.0s] be God's way or man's way you know we
[645.4s] have to choose for ourselves uh
[648.0s] precisely what we will do however how
[650.4s] can we reconcile this with our fellow
[652.1s] Brethren and does that mean that
[653.8s] everybody who worships on Sunday will go
[655.6s] to hell uh certainly not it does not
[658.6s] mean that it what it does mean is that
[662.0s] you know perhaps we could conclude that
[664.5s] there are some people who worship on
[666.1s] Sunday who truly love God you know and
[668.6s] are worshiping him to the best of their
[670.2s] knowledge you know and they have
[672.4s] whatever knowledge that they have you
[673.7s] know they say you know this is what I
[675.1s] know and this is what I'll I shall I
[676.8s] shall do however for the people who know
[680.2s] the truth and are actively and
[683.7s] purposefully uh rejecting it and looking
[686.4s] to do their own thing you know then un
[689.3s] fortunately I think you know they are
[691.6s] defiant against God you know they they
[693.9s] defying God as it were and so you know
[696.6s] our job as Christians is really to pray
[698.5s] for them and to ask God really to have
[701.4s] mercy on them and to show them the right
[703.1s] way and I think that is our duty that's
[705.9s] our duty yeah yeah yeah thank you so
[708.6s] much and I think here we have a
[711.0s] privilege where we get the privilege of
[713.1s] choice just as you said where we can
[715.6s] either choose Bible or tradition or the
[717.7s] man's way or God's way yeah thank you
[720.1s] thank you so much Winston and thank you
[721.8s] so much dear viewer thank you so much
[723.3s] subira thank you so much everyone uh for
[725.4s] joining us uh on on discussing this this
[728.4s] this particular chapter you know it's so
[730.8s] important for us to know you know uh
[733.3s] these sort of or really the truth behind
[736.3s] uh the Sabbath uh uh yes
[740.9s] and funnily enough that this really
[744.3s] quickly it's called history's great hoax
[747.9s] but we find that human history there is
[751.4s] a historical record of our shift into
[755.3s] sin but also there's a historical record
[758.1s] all the way back to the creation story
[760.8s] in which God offers us truth so in our
[763.7s] history there is light and darkness
[766.6s] choose light amen amen choose light
[769.8s] choose light well join us once again
[771.5s] ladies and gentlemen as next time uh
[774.4s] we'll be discussing chapter five chapter
[776.7s] 5 and it's a wonderful chapter it's
