FULL TRANSCRIPT:
Children of the most high God, happy Sabbath. Are you happy to be in the house of the Lord? I want to take this opportunity to thank God most sincerely because he is our enabler. Nobody has ever seen such a holy Sabbath. And I also want to thank uh the pastoral team of Nairobi Central Church, the elders, the leaders who have made this day to be a success. receive greetings from my family and also from my church Nairobi East. Our senior pastor, Nairobi East District, Pastor Samson Moache, that is ENF. So I'm in a in a new conference all together. Today as you know it's AWM emphasis day worldwide and I've seen a number of us especially ladies we are in uniform if you're just there in in any uniform I'm seeing the blue I'm seeing the touch a heart I'm seeing the beautiful ladies who are here singing in just rise because it's our day we we are also guests we need to wave we need to be known that we are here just stand in whatever uniform you are in just rise up we want to see you know some people don't know these uniforms Yes. Yes. At least almost if not all because I'm not seeing green. I think most of it and doas. Most of it is represented. Just wave to us. God bless you. Don't they look like a bunch of beautiful butterflies? Yes. We thank God for you ladies. May the Lord bless you so so much. Allow me in the interest of time just uh go to the word of God which is my task at this moment. And as our key text was brought to us by my sister remains to be Ephesians 2 verse 10. Ephesians 2:10. The Bible says this in my version. For we are his workmanship created in Christ Jesus for good works which God prepared beforehand that we should walk in them. The title rather the theme that is going to guide us all through the day says cravings of the soul. Cravings of the soul. What is it? It is finding fulfillment in Christ. We are praying. Dear Jesus, except you hide me behind the cross at this moment, then my standing here as your maid servant will be in vain. I want to ask the help of the Holy Spirit who can guide me and all of us into all truth to take charge not only for me but even for our fellow congregation and those of us following across the airwaves. Dear Lord, I beseech you that for the sake of your kingdom that is very nigh, reveal yourself one more time to us, oh God, because our souls are craving I will also remember the family of our elder who at their difficult and their lowest moment at this time. Oh God, may you Lord come through for them. May the joy of the Sabbath take charge of their grief and all of us may we see you revealed in a very very special way in our lives because we pray in Jesus name. Amen. Cravings of the soul. My prayer remains children of God that at the end of this presentation each one of us youngest amongst the old will be able to discover our divine purpose fulfillment in Christ. Why? Because God has crafted us for a divine purpose to live a life of good works in Christ. The book of Ephesians as we know it is a book if you like you can call that book in Christ. That is the dominant theme in that in the book of Ephesians. Paul's writes, "This letter to the church at Ephesus is a powerful exposition of God's grace, the mystery of the gospel, and the unity of believers in Christ." The writer of this book, Paul, wanted to affirm that salvation as we know it is by grace through faith. You can find that in Ephesians 28. Look at verse 9. not by works. Yet true faith always results in a transformed life of good works. Allow me just try to unpack this verse 10 of Ephesians chapter 2 in three eyes. You'll find time to go and go over them. And the eyes are in the form of identity, intimacy and intention. Or you can put it identity, intention and intimacy. Whichever way you find it easy, I want to do that within this time that I have. When you talk of identity in Ephesians chapter 2 verse 10, the question that comes is who am I? Where do you belong? Did you just come to existence like that? You know there are a lot of theories that try to explain the existence of man. We do that for knowledge purposes but we know that is not true. Who are you? Paul is trying to answer that today that even as you exit the gates of the church, you know who you are and what your purpose is. We have a belonging. We do not just we're not just there. We have a place. Paul answers and says that our identity is for we are his workmanship. That is first identity. child of God that we are his is what his workmanship and you'll find time to go and look what is workmanship you can say it is a masterpiece or a work of art you know a work of art doesn't just come for an art to be an art it has taken creativity some brains had to roll the brain was disturbed so that we have an art that we can admire for example look at the paintings of even uh uh she's called This lady and jealous. Look at her paintings. For you to for a paint to be a to be a paint to be to be something admired, it has taken time. So the word of God says that we are his workmanships. God has recreated as a new. Look at 2 Corinthians 5:17. We are not random beings but intrically crafted by the divine hand. Praise God. If you do not know that God took time and by design to create to make who you are today, I want you to take it from me that you're not by accident. God took time. He purposed. He made it deliberate. Then look at the second after the first comma of verse 10. For we are his workmanship. The next one comes and says created in Christ for good works. Created in Christ who? Christ Jesus. Our new identity is not inherited. The fact that I'm I'm a pastor. My son seated there cannot be a pastor. Cannot inherit. He has to make a personal decision. It is not inherited or even earned. There is no money that can pay for you to be able to to be created in Christ. You know, many of the things around this world are equated with money. And you know, everything right now when you talk of money, you talk of dollars. The word of God tells us that it's not earned, but it's received only through who? Jesus Christ. Allow me rush to explain to you why only in Jesus Christ. When you go to your Bible, the book of the beginnings in Genesis 3, you know what happened there. Genesis one, the world was peaceful. Two, the housekeeping rules. These are how we're going to coexist, me and man. God doing it. But when you come to three, it's like it is a is a totally different scenario from the first and the second. Genesis chapter 3, this is where we find man falling into sin and not only falling into sin but also running away from God. I don't know why sin has always made us to run away from somebody who can restore us. Sin has that attribute of making us running away when man lost his identity with his creator. There is something that happened. All was not lost. Go to Philippians chapter 2:8. You just put these verses. You'll find time to read. There is a son of God that we know very well. When you read the inspired writer desired of Ages says when man fail to sin there was silence in heaven. There was a meeting and one man said I will not sit here and man perishes and the man is Jesus Christ. This man left his power, left his comfort zone, left wherever that was attributed to him and said, "I'm going to become like one of them squeezed." I always wonder that mystery. When I get to heaven, this is what I want to understand. How can God squeeze himself in the womb of a woman and a sinful woman? And it is sad that today other religions consider that womb as the main source of salvation than what the womb carried. And in that religion you know Jesus is still regarded as a child and Mary is given the position of Jesus. Christ squeezed himself in the womb of a woman and came out walked in the streets here in Palestine on the dusty lands of of of Palestine trying to tell men that please come your salvation is here. But you know there were a group of the church leaders just like you and me called the Pharisees. You know those men had studied their word. They knew the little word in the scripture but they could not conceptualize how this word has become flesh and dwelt among them. This man did all that you we know after that he went to the cross for you and me. the man Jesus Christ. By Christ doing that, that's where I need your attention because you do not know what happened at the cross. Or maybe you've just heard, this is where I beg your attention, children of God, that when Christ went to the cross, what happened by him dying, he shared his sunship in heaven together with you and me. And that's where we go to the identity. When you go to John uh should be 1 verse 12. There is a powerful name that you are given that to all those who have accepted him have been given the power to become who? Children of God. Christ decided that he comes to share his identity and by that we are called children of God. Praise the Lord. I want to go to the intention. What was the intention? Look at this after the the second comma. Created in Christ for good works. Look at that phrase unto good works. Works do not save us. If I if I try by all means in my own strength to keep the Sabbath holy, I will not. If I try to tithe faithfully, I will not. Works as we know them, they do not save us, but they are evidence of what? Our salvation. We've been saved so that we give. We've been saved so that we go and tell others Christ is coming. We've been saved. That's why we extend love not only to our family members, but even to our enemies. Children of God, good works are natural fruit of grace. Just as healthy trees, they bear what? Good fruit. Look at Matthew 7:E1 17. Look at the second which says which God prepared or which God had beforehand ordained. God has a divine plan for your life and my life before we were born. And you'll find that in Jeremiah 15 that he has a plan for all of us. His purpose is not only to save us, but to use as instruments of righteousness. You know, God did not call you to be an Adventist, to be a Christian in this time for your own cause. No. So that you become an instrument of what? Righteousness. You will have to be holy children of God. You know sometimes it's not easy to be called an Adventist even at such a time. There are things that I look around in my country and I don't like. What do I do? The word of God tells me, "Be ye holy because your father is holy." and his word says that without holiness no one will see God. How is your social media? What do you write there? Can somebody see the God you serve? How do you fight your battles? Children of God, God has ordained us for righteousness, for good works. And I where where you can find that very well, go to the book of John 15:E1 16. Allow me paraphrase that verse. John 15:16. John the gospel. The Bible says this that remember you did not choose me. But I chose you and have ordained you that you go forth and bear what? Fruit and that fruit should remain in season and out of season. That's a very powerful text if you ask me that you did not choose you know nobody knows how to choose children of you know as as as as human beings think we know how to choose I want to ask fellow ladies who are here those of us who are blessed to be married or one time you're married did you make a choice yes you did by the way I'm glad to be here This is the pull pit where I made my vows to be married many years. We made a choice to be what? To be a wife to that man. But after some times, what happens? You ask yourself, was I the one who made a choice? But you remember the vows you made here and you say God me and him till you come the second time because you made the vow to God even with your good choice after some time you realize you don't know how to choose even men you know men think when we get married they are the ones who choose even women we choose you didn't know we choose because we look at you and we try to imagine the kind of children you'll will give me when I get into a mat. Will somebody be able to help me carry my child? That's what we look at. We don't we are not just picked like tomatoes. We also look at you properly. Children of God, even with our choices, God says we do not know how to choose. He's the one who has chosen us and ordained us that we should go forth and do what? Bear fruits. You know, some of us wither. Ordinarily, even a plant withers. When it is dry season, it dries up. But look at the word of God in John. He says that even in and out you are bearing fruits. Allow me wind up with this word called intimacy. Intimacy. We had the identity, the intention, and intimacy. Look at the last part of that verse 10. That we should walk in them. That we should walk in them. Walk here means a lifestyle. It is not a one thing like on Sabbath or during the come meetings. No, it's a lifetime. It is something that you have to do. And I like it when the inspired writer says that the greatest sermon ever preached is a sermon of a life well-lived. Live life that is worth of your calling. Allow me take our attention to Psalms chapter 1. Powerful text. Psalms chapter 1. Psalms chapter 1 verse one. My version says this. Blessed is the man who walks not in the counsel of the ungodly, nor stands in the path of sinners, nor sits in the seat of the scornful. the walking. You know, David, I also consider him one of the wisest men that ever lived after his son Solomon. Blessed is the man who walks not in the counsel of the ungodly, nor stands in the path of sinners, nor sits in the seat of the scornful. There are three actions there. There are three verbs there. In verse one, we have walk, stand, and sit. You know, sin has got three levels. You don't just find yourself on the wrong side. I want to give a perfect example to us ladies. On a Sabbath like this, you have a friend and you know ladies, stories come from anything. Even a fly just flying is a story. By the way, did you know that even cockroaches I realized recently that even cockroaches ladies just do like this? It has eight of them. But human beings are busy walking what? Naked. On a Sabbath like this, you are walking and a friend comes and tell did you did you hear the story? And he tells you a story and you know the story becomes very very interesting. You are doing what? Initially you are walking because the story has become so interesting and it's not even pertaining to the Sabbath. You decide uh let's have what? Let's stand here. You stand. The story continues until you find yourself say huh this one we cannot no longer stand. What we need to do is to do what? Sit. Three levels of sin. You walk, you do not realize that you are walking with the devil. You find yourself standing. If standing is not enough, you decide to sit. But come back in the afternoon. We look at the rest of the verses. How you can come out of what? Sitting in sin. daily obedience, faithfulness, even in service. As children of God, we are called that may our lives emulate what we preach, what we say, what we believe in. One theologian wrote and said that the saddest Adventist that the saddest person in hell will be an Adventist. Why? Because you know the whole truth, but you don't live by that which you know. Children of God, fellow ladies, I want to invite us today AWM emphasis that we reconsider our ways. Me and you, are you living a life worth of your calling? In as much as all of us have come, but I believe that if ladies or rather women were not created, the life will have been a mistake. There must be a purpose for you. What were you created for? Are you struggling keeping the Sabbath? Are you struggling even embracing health reform? Are you struggling evangelizing even to your house help? Are you struggling even in character development in your daily life? What are your cravings dear daughter of God? The man in the house. What are your cravings? One day a story is told of a man who was running in church. When this man was running in church, the other man asked him, "Why are you running?" Then the man told him, "I've forgotten my phone near my wife and it's not locked." Then the man answered him, "You should run faster than that. Fellow men, are you the one running for your phone because you've left it next to your wife? As I wind up, children of God, what takes away your joy? Is your soul tired? Are you searching for meaning? What do you want in this life? Fellow ladies, as I wind up, there is something I must tell you that I've discovered that for us to win the battles of life, we must take our knees to the ground and if possible with your head facing up. That is prayer. I want to beg us fellow ladies that do not allow your hairstyle to be more expensive than your brain. Don't spend so much time improving the outside because this tend to work very soon will perish. Spend time building the spiritual thing, nourishing your soul. I want to be sitting on this outside thing. It will not last. Somewhere Paul says that though the outward man is perishing in Corinthians, the inward man is doing what? Being renewed day by day. Continue building it, children of God. As I wind up, spend time building the inside because it will stand the test of time. Not only in this life, but in the life to come. When you see the outside glittering so much, know that the inside is empty. That's a fact. Young men, run away from these shine shine girls. As Adventist children, run for your life. You know, many of us like these shine shine girls. Remember Samson and Delilah? You know Samson, the armies could not contain him. The gates could not stop him. But he took one shine shine girl and he was on the ground. I want to speak to the young ladies. Run from these six experts that you see. Run from these looks. Run from this mustach because largely they are a zero. Ladies, is your husband a heartache? The men in the house is your lady a headache. Today we were looking at the story, two stories of powerful ladies. What a coincidence. Ruth and Naomi. You know when people read the book of Ruth in Ruth 1:16, they see that girl the the daughter-in-law pronouncing powerful words to Naomi. But for me, I look at it different. Do we have mother-in-laws in this house? Supposing Naomi was not a good mother-in-law to Ruth, could Ruth have said those words in Ruth 1:16 that your people be my people? So, mothersin-laws in the house, this is also for us this week. Powerful women in the Bible, Ruth and Esther. I want to beseech us children of God as we look at cravings of the soul as we desire to live our holy life. What is your purpose? What are you craving for this day? I want to invite all of us to make a decision to follow the Lord and allow him lead you in your daily endeavors. May the Lord bless you and keep you even as you make a decision to live for him. Amen. Let's rise for the closing song. Song number 260. Hoover or me, Holy Spirit. Song number 260. 

==================================================

TIMESTAMPED TRANSCRIPT:
[1.0s] Children of the most high God, happy
[3.1s] Sabbath.
[4.9s] Are you happy to be in the house of the
[6.6s] Lord? I want to take this opportunity to
[10.1s] thank God most sincerely because he is
[13.4s] our enabler. Nobody has ever seen such a
[16.2s] holy Sabbath. And I also want to thank
[19.8s] uh the pastoral team of Nairobi Central
[22.3s] Church, the elders, the leaders who have
[26.4s] made this day to be a success. receive
[29.8s] greetings from my family and also from
[33.0s] my church Nairobi East. Our senior
[36.6s] pastor,
[38.1s] Nairobi East District, Pastor Samson
[42.1s] Moache,
[45.4s] that is ENF. So I'm in a in a new
[48.9s] conference all together.
[52.3s] Today as you know it's AWM emphasis day
[56.1s] worldwide
[57.8s] and I've seen a number of us especially
[60.5s] ladies we are in uniform if you're just
[62.6s] there in in any uniform I'm seeing the
[64.8s] blue I'm seeing the touch a heart I'm
[67.0s] seeing the beautiful ladies who are here
[69.0s] singing in just rise because it's our
[70.8s] day we we are also guests we need to
[72.8s] wave we need to be known that we are
[75.0s] here just stand in whatever uniform you

[81.0s] uniforms
[82.5s] Yes. Yes. At least almost if not all
[85.5s] because I'm not seeing green. I think
[87.4s] most of it and doas. Most of it is
[90.3s] represented. Just wave to us. God bless
[93.7s] you. Don't they look like a bunch of
[96.4s] beautiful butterflies?
[98.4s] Yes. We thank God for you ladies. May
[101.4s] the Lord bless you so so much.
[105.4s] Allow me in the interest of time just uh
[109.8s] go to the word of God which is my task
[113.8s] at this moment.
[116.7s] And as our key text was brought to us by
[118.8s] my sister remains to be Ephesians 2
[124.3s] verse 10.
[127.8s] Ephesians 2:10.
[130.6s] The Bible says this in my version.
[134.1s] For we are his workmanship created in
[137.3s] Christ Jesus for good works
[140.8s] which God prepared beforehand that we
[144.0s] should walk in them.
[147.8s] The title rather the theme that is going
[151.2s] to guide us all through the day says
[155.2s] cravings of the soul.
[158.7s] Cravings of the soul. What is it?
[163.3s] It is finding fulfillment in Christ.
[168.6s] We are praying.
[173.8s] Dear Jesus,
[176.2s] except you hide me behind the cross at
[178.9s] this moment,
[181.0s] then my standing here as your maid
[182.8s] servant will be in vain.
[185.1s] I want to ask the help of the Holy
[187.3s] Spirit
[189.5s] who can guide me and all of us into all
[192.4s] truth to take charge not only for me but
[195.8s] even for our fellow congregation and
[199.0s] those of us following across the
[200.6s] airwaves.
[202.5s] Dear Lord, I beseech you that for the
[205.6s] sake of your kingdom that is very nigh,
[208.3s] reveal yourself one more time to us, oh
[210.6s] God, because our souls are craving
[215.2s] I will also remember the family of our
[218.3s] elder who at their difficult and their
[221.4s] lowest moment at this time. Oh God, may
[224.6s] you Lord come through for them. May the
[227.2s] joy of the Sabbath take charge of their
[229.6s] grief and all of us may we see you
[233.1s] revealed in a very very special way in
[235.0s] our lives because we pray in Jesus name.
[238.6s] Amen.
[240.9s] Cravings of the soul.
[245.5s] My prayer remains children of God that
[247.5s] at the end of this presentation each one
[249.7s] of us youngest amongst the old will be
[252.2s] able to discover our divine purpose
[256.9s] fulfillment in Christ.
[260.1s] Why? Because God has crafted us for a
[263.2s] divine purpose
[265.2s] to live a life of good works
[268.6s] in Christ.
[271.0s] The book of Ephesians as we know it is a
[274.3s] book if you like you can call that book
[277.8s] in Christ.
[279.9s] That is the dominant theme in that in
[282.4s] the book of Ephesians. Paul's writes,
[285.0s] "This letter to the church at Ephesus is
[288.0s] a powerful exposition of God's grace,
[291.7s] the mystery of the gospel, and the unity
[294.5s] of believers in Christ."
[298.2s] The writer of this book, Paul, wanted to
[301.1s] affirm that salvation as we know it is
[303.9s] by grace through faith. You can find
[306.6s] that in Ephesians 28.
[310.1s] Look at verse 9.
[313.0s] not by works.
[317.8s] Yet
[319.8s] true faith always results in a
[323.2s] transformed life of good works.
[327.0s] Allow me just try to unpack this verse
[331.2s] 10 of Ephesians chapter 2 in three eyes.
[336.2s] You'll find time to go and go over them.
[339.5s] And the eyes are in the form of
[341.5s] identity,
[345.1s] intimacy
[347.0s] and intention.
[350.0s] Or you can put it identity,
[352.8s] intention and intimacy. Whichever way
[355.8s] you find it easy, I want to do that
[358.1s] within this time that I have.
[362.6s] When you talk of identity in Ephesians
[365.5s] chapter 2 verse 10, the question that
[368.7s] comes is who am I?
[372.0s] Where do you belong?
[374.5s] Did you just come to existence like
[377.0s] that? You know there are a lot of
[378.8s] theories that try to explain the
[380.6s] existence of man. We do that for
[383.6s] knowledge purposes but we know that is
[386.4s] not true.
[388.7s] Who are you?
[391.2s] Paul is trying to answer that today that
[393.7s] even as you exit the gates of the
[395.8s] church, you know who you are and what
[398.6s] your purpose is. We have a belonging. We
[402.6s] do not just we're not just there.
[406.2s] We have a place. Paul answers and says
[409.8s] that our identity is
[413.7s] for we are his workmanship.
[418.1s] That is first identity. child of God
[420.6s] that we are his is what his workmanship
[423.6s] and you'll find time to go and look what
[425.5s] is workmanship you can say it is a
[427.8s] masterpiece or a work of art you know a
[431.1s] work of art doesn't just come for an art
[434.5s] to be an art it has taken creativity
[438.2s] some brains had to roll the brain was
[441.2s] disturbed so that we have an art that we
[443.8s] can admire for example look at the
[446.2s] paintings of even uh uh she's called
[450.1s] This lady
[452.6s] and jealous.
[454.6s] Look at her paintings. For you to for a
[456.6s] paint to be a to be a paint to be to be
[458.9s] something admired, it has taken time. So
[461.6s] the word of God says that we are his
[463.7s] workmanships.
[465.5s] God
[467.8s] has recreated as a new. Look at 2
[470.2s] Corinthians 5:17. We are not random
[473.3s] beings but intrically crafted by the
[476.8s] divine hand. Praise God.
[480.6s] If you do not know that God took time
[485.0s] and by design to create to make who you
[488.6s] are today, I want you to take it from me
[492.4s] that you're not by accident. God took
[494.6s] time.
[496.2s] He purposed. He made it deliberate.
[500.8s] Then look at the second after the first
[504.1s] comma of verse 10. For we are his
[507.0s] workmanship. The next one comes and says
[509.8s] created in Christ for good works.
[513.0s] Created in Christ who? Christ Jesus. Our
[516.8s] new identity is not inherited.
[520.8s] The fact that I'm I'm a pastor. My son
[523.4s] seated there cannot be a pastor. Cannot
[525.8s] inherit. He has to make a personal
[528.7s] decision. It is not inherited or even
[532.2s] earned. There is no money that can pay
[534.6s] for you to be able to to be created in
[537.7s] Christ. You know, many of the things
[539.8s] around this world are equated with
[541.7s] money. And you know, everything right
[544.2s] now when you talk of money, you talk of
[545.9s] dollars. The word of God tells us that
[548.6s] it's not earned, but it's received only
[551.2s] through who? Jesus Christ.
[554.8s] Allow me rush
[557.0s] to explain to you why only in Jesus
[559.7s] Christ. When you go to your Bible, the
[562.5s] book of the beginnings in Genesis 3, you
[565.8s] know what happened there. Genesis one,
[568.8s] the world was peaceful. Two, the
[572.4s] housekeeping rules. These are how we're
[574.0s] going to coexist, me and man. God doing
[576.6s] it. But when you come to three, it's
[579.3s] like it is a is a totally different
[581.8s] scenario from the first and the second.
[584.7s] Genesis chapter 3, this is where we find
[587.0s] man falling into sin and not only
[590.1s] falling into sin but also running away
[593.0s] from God.
[595.5s] I don't know why sin has always made us
[598.8s] to run away from somebody who can
[602.2s] restore us. Sin has that attribute of
[605.7s] making us running away when man lost his
[609.1s] identity with his creator.
[613.2s] There is something that happened. All
[615.3s] was not lost. Go to Philippians chapter
[618.2s] 2:8. You just put these verses. You'll
[620.6s] find time to read.
[623.4s] There is a son of God that we know very
[625.5s] well.
[627.5s] When you read the inspired writer
[629.4s] desired of Ages says when man fail to
[632.2s] sin there was silence in heaven. There
[635.0s] was a meeting
[637.6s] and one man said I will not sit here and
[641.2s] man perishes and the man is Jesus
[644.2s] Christ.
[645.8s] This man left his power, left his
[651.0s] comfort zone, left wherever that was
[654.6s] attributed to him
[657.2s] and said, "I'm going to become like one
[661.3s] of them
[663.2s] squeezed."
[664.8s] I always wonder that mystery. When I get
[667.0s] to heaven, this is what I want to
[668.8s] understand. How can God squeeze himself
[673.2s] in the womb of a woman and a sinful
[676.5s] woman?
[678.8s] And it is sad that today
[681.8s] other religions
[683.8s] consider that womb
[687.5s] as the main source of salvation
[690.6s] than what the womb carried. And in that
[693.4s] religion you know Jesus is still
[695.8s] regarded as a child
[698.3s] and Mary is given the position of Jesus.
[702.8s] Christ squeezed himself in the womb of a
[705.7s] woman
[707.3s] and came out walked in the streets here
[710.2s] in Palestine on the dusty lands of of of
[713.0s] Palestine
[714.5s] trying to tell men that please come your
[717.5s] salvation is here. But you know there
[721.1s] were a group of the church leaders just
[722.9s] like you and me called the Pharisees.
[726.1s] You know those men had studied their
[728.1s] word. They knew the little word in the
[730.7s] scripture but they could not
[732.6s] conceptualize how this word has become
[735.4s] flesh and dwelt among them. This man did
[739.0s] all that you we know
[741.6s] after that he went to the cross for you
[744.6s] and me. the man Jesus Christ. By Christ
[749.4s] doing that, that's where I need your
[751.0s] attention because you do not know what
[752.6s] happened at the cross. Or maybe you've
[754.9s] just heard, this is where I beg your
[757.5s] attention, children of God, that when
[759.8s] Christ went to the cross, what happened
[765.7s] by him dying,
[768.4s] he shared his sunship in heaven together
[773.4s] with you and me.
[775.8s] And that's where we go to the identity.
[778.5s] When you go to John uh should be 1 verse
[782.0s] 12. There is a powerful name that you
[784.9s] are given that to all those who have
[787.0s] accepted him have been given the power
[789.6s] to become who? Children of God. Christ
[794.3s] decided that he comes to share his
[797.1s] identity and by that we are called
[799.5s] children of God.
[802.5s] Praise the Lord.
[804.3s] I want to go to the intention. What was
[806.5s] the intention?
[809.4s] Look at this after the the second comma.
[813.0s] Created in Christ for good works.
[816.9s] Look at that phrase unto good works.
[820.7s] Works do not save us.
[824.5s] If I if I try by all means in my own
[827.4s] strength to keep the Sabbath holy, I
[829.4s] will not.
[831.1s] If I try to tithe faithfully, I will
[833.5s] not.
[836.0s] Works as we know them, they do not save
[839.6s] us, but they are evidence of what? Our
[843.8s] salvation. We've been saved so that we
[846.7s] give. We've been saved so that we go and
[849.6s] tell others Christ is coming. We've been
[852.6s] saved. That's why we extend love not
[855.3s] only to our family members, but even to
[857.4s] our enemies.
[860.0s] Children of God, good works are natural
[862.8s] fruit of grace. Just as healthy trees,
[866.6s] they bear what? Good fruit. Look at
[869.2s] Matthew 7:E1 17.
[874.2s] Look at the second which says which God
[878.6s] prepared
[880.9s] or which God had beforehand ordained.
[885.8s] God has a divine plan for your life and
[888.9s] my life before we were born. And you'll
[892.0s] find that in Jeremiah 15 that he has a
[895.4s] plan for all of us. His purpose is not
[898.3s] only to save us, but to use as
[901.5s] instruments of righteousness.
[905.1s] You know, God did not call you to be an
[907.6s] Adventist, to be a Christian in this
[909.5s] time for your own cause. No.
[912.6s] So that you become an instrument of
[914.9s] what? Righteousness.
[917.7s] You will have to be holy children of
[919.7s] God. You know sometimes it's not easy to
[923.0s] be called
[925.0s] an Adventist even at such a time. There
[928.6s] are things that I look around in my
[930.3s] country and I don't like.
[932.8s] What do I do? The word of God tells me,
[936.4s] "Be ye holy because your father is
[938.6s] holy." and his word says that without
[941.8s] holiness no one will see God.
[947.1s] How is your social media? What do you
[950.6s] write there?
[952.5s] Can somebody see the God you serve?
[955.9s] How do you fight your battles?
[959.5s] Children of God,
[962.2s] God has ordained us for righteousness,
[965.7s] for good works. And I where where you
[969.6s] can find that
[972.2s] very well, go to the book of John 15:E1
[976.8s] 16.
[978.7s] Allow me paraphrase that verse. John
[980.8s] 15:16. John the gospel. The Bible says
[984.2s] this
[987.1s] that remember you did not choose me.
[992.1s] But I chose you
[994.4s] and have ordained you
[997.5s] that you go forth and bear what? Fruit
[1001.8s] and that fruit should remain in season
[1004.6s] and out of season. That's a very
[1006.3s] powerful text
[1008.4s] if you ask me
[1011.2s] that you did not choose you know nobody
[1013.3s] knows how to choose children of you know
[1016.3s] as as as as human beings think we know
[1019.4s] how to choose I want to ask fellow
[1021.8s] ladies who are here
[1024.1s] those of us who are blessed to be
[1025.8s] married or one time you're married
[1029.2s] did you make a choice
[1031.6s] yes you did
[1033.8s] by the way I'm glad to be here This is
[1035.7s] the pull pit where I made my vows to be
[1037.5s] married many years.
[1040.5s] We made a choice
[1043.5s] to be what? To be a wife to that man.
[1047.0s] But after some times, what happens?
[1050.3s] You ask yourself, was I the one who made
[1052.5s] a choice?
[1054.2s] But you remember the vows you made here
[1057.1s] and you say God me and him till you come
[1061.4s] the second time because you made the vow
[1064.3s] to God even with your good choice after
[1067.6s] some time you realize you don't know how
[1069.4s] to choose even men you know men think
[1072.1s] when we get married they are the ones
[1073.6s] who choose even women we choose
[1077.4s] you didn't know we choose because we
[1080.4s] look at you and we try to imagine the
[1083.0s] kind of children you'll will give me
[1086.3s] when I get into a mat. Will somebody be
[1088.6s] able to help me carry my child?
[1092.4s] That's what we look at. We don't we are
[1095.0s] not just picked like tomatoes. We also
[1096.7s] look at you properly.
[1099.7s] Children of God, even with our choices,
[1102.7s] God says we do not know how to choose.
[1105.2s] He's the one who has chosen us
[1108.6s] and ordained us
[1111.5s] that we should go forth and do what?
[1114.2s] Bear fruits.
[1116.6s] You know, some of us wither.
[1119.7s] Ordinarily,
[1121.4s] even a plant withers. When it is dry
[1123.7s] season, it dries up. But look at the
[1126.7s] word of God in John. He says that even
[1128.8s] in and out you are bearing fruits.
[1133.2s] Allow me wind up with this word called
[1135.3s] intimacy.
[1137.1s] Intimacy. We had the identity, the
[1140.1s] intention, and intimacy.
[1143.5s] Look at the last part of that verse 10.
[1150.2s] That we should walk in them.
[1154.6s] That we should walk in them.
[1157.8s] Walk here means a lifestyle.
[1162.7s] It is not a one thing like on Sabbath or
[1166.6s] during the come meetings. No, it's a
[1168.7s] lifetime.
[1172.0s] It is something that you have to do. And
[1175.8s] I like it when the inspired writer says
[1178.4s] that the greatest sermon ever preached
[1180.3s] is a sermon of a life well-lived.
[1184.5s] Live life that is worth of your calling.
[1188.4s] Allow me take our attention to Psalms
[1191.5s] chapter 1. Powerful text. Psalms chapter
[1196.2s] 1.
[1204.4s] Psalms chapter 1
[1207.4s] verse one.
[1210.0s] My version says this.
[1213.0s] Blessed is the man who walks not in the
[1216.0s] counsel of the ungodly,
[1219.4s] nor stands in the path of sinners,
[1223.0s] nor sits in the seat of the scornful.
[1229.1s] the walking.
[1234.3s] You know, David,
[1238.1s] I also consider him one of the wisest
[1240.3s] men that ever lived after his son
[1243.0s] Solomon.
[1246.6s] Blessed is the man who walks not in the
[1249.2s] counsel of the ungodly, nor stands in
[1251.8s] the path of sinners, nor sits in the
[1254.6s] seat of the scornful.
[1257.7s] There are three actions there. There are
[1259.3s] three verbs there. In verse one, we have
[1262.7s] walk,
[1264.6s] stand,
[1266.2s] and sit.
[1268.8s] You know, sin has got three levels. You
[1271.2s] don't just find yourself on the wrong
[1272.9s] side.
[1274.4s] I want to give a perfect example to us
[1276.7s] ladies.
[1278.5s] On a Sabbath like this, you have a
[1280.4s] friend
[1282.9s] and you know ladies, stories come from
[1285.0s] anything. Even a fly just flying is a
[1287.7s] story.
[1291.3s] By the way, did you know that even
[1293.8s] cockroaches I realized recently that
[1295.8s] even cockroaches ladies
[1299.8s] just do like this? It has eight of them.
[1302.7s] But human beings are busy walking what?
[1305.0s] Naked.
[1307.4s] On a Sabbath like this, you are walking
[1310.8s] and a friend comes and tell did you did
[1312.9s] you hear the story?
[1315.1s] And he tells you a story and you know
[1317.4s] the story becomes very very interesting.
[1319.3s] You are doing what? Initially you are
[1321.3s] walking because the story has become so
[1323.8s] interesting and it's not even pertaining
[1327.0s] to the Sabbath. You decide uh let's have
[1330.2s] what? Let's stand here. You stand. The
[1333.8s] story continues
[1336.2s] until you find yourself say huh this one
[1338.8s] we cannot no longer stand. What we need
[1340.6s] to do is to do what? Sit.
[1345.9s] Three levels of sin. You walk,
[1350.5s] you do not realize that you are walking
[1353.1s] with the devil. You find yourself
[1355.3s] standing. If standing is not enough, you
[1358.5s] decide to sit. But come back in the
[1360.8s] afternoon. We look at the rest of the
[1363.2s] verses. How you can come out of what?
[1366.3s] Sitting in sin.
[1369.7s] daily obedience,
[1371.8s] faithfulness, even in service. As
[1375.0s] children of God, we are called that may
[1377.6s] our lives emulate what we preach, what
[1381.6s] we say, what we believe in.
[1384.7s] One theologian wrote and said that the
[1387.7s] saddest Adventist that the saddest
[1389.9s] person in hell will be an Adventist.
[1392.3s] Why? Because you know the whole truth,
[1395.0s] but you don't live by that which you
[1396.9s] know.
[1399.5s] Children of God, fellow ladies,
[1403.3s] I want to invite us today AWM emphasis
[1406.2s] that we reconsider our ways. Me and you,
[1409.6s] are you living a life worth of your
[1411.4s] calling? In as much as all of us have
[1414.2s] come,
[1415.8s] but I believe that if ladies or rather
[1419.0s] women were not created, the life will
[1422.2s] have been a mistake.
[1425.2s] There must be a purpose for you. What
[1427.9s] were you created for?
[1430.6s] Are you struggling keeping the Sabbath?
[1433.6s] Are you struggling even embracing health
[1436.2s] reform? Are you struggling evangelizing
[1439.7s] even to your house help? Are you
[1442.0s] struggling even in character development
[1445.0s] in your daily life?
[1448.7s] What are your cravings dear daughter of
[1450.7s] God?
[1452.9s] The man in the house. What are your
[1454.8s] cravings?
[1456.6s] One day a story is told of a man who was
[1459.6s] running in church.
[1467.7s] When this man was running in church, the
[1470.2s] other man asked him, "Why are you
[1471.9s] running?" Then the man told him, "I've
[1474.8s] forgotten my phone near my wife and it's
[1477.4s] not locked."
[1480.0s] Then the man answered him, "You should
[1481.8s] run faster than that.
[1486.8s] Fellow men, are you the one running for
[1489.2s] your phone because you've left it next
[1491.2s] to your wife? As I wind up, children of
[1493.7s] God,
[1495.4s] what takes away your joy? Is your soul
[1499.7s] tired?
[1503.2s] Are you searching for meaning?
[1505.8s] What do you want in this life?
[1509.0s] Fellow ladies, as I wind up, there is
[1511.1s] something I must tell you that I've
[1513.3s] discovered that for us to win the
[1515.1s] battles of life, we must take our knees
[1518.6s] to the ground and if possible with your
[1521.5s] head facing up. That is prayer.
[1524.4s] I want to beg us fellow ladies that do
[1526.9s] not allow your hairstyle to be more
[1529.5s] expensive than your brain. Don't spend
[1532.6s] so much time improving the outside
[1535.9s] because this tend to work very soon will
[1538.6s] perish. Spend time building the
[1541.9s] spiritual thing, nourishing your soul. I
[1544.7s] want to be sitting
[1549.9s] on this outside thing. It will not last.
[1553.8s] Somewhere Paul says
[1556.2s] that though the outward man is perishing
[1558.5s] in Corinthians, the inward man is doing
[1560.9s] what? Being renewed day by day. Continue
[1564.4s] building it, children of God. As I wind
[1567.4s] up,
[1569.0s] spend time building the inside because
[1571.7s] it will stand the test of time. Not only
[1574.6s] in this life, but in the life to come.
[1578.9s] When you see the outside glittering so
[1581.0s] much, know that the inside is empty.
[1584.0s] That's a fact. Young men, run away from
[1588.2s] these shine shine girls. As Adventist
[1590.7s] children, run for your life. You know,
[1593.5s] many of us like these shine shine girls.
[1596.2s] Remember Samson and Delilah? You know
[1599.0s] Samson, the armies could not contain
[1600.8s] him. The gates could not stop him. But
[1603.2s] he took one shine shine girl and he was
[1606.7s] on the ground. I want to speak to the
[1609.4s] young ladies. Run from these six experts
[1612.0s] that you see. Run from these looks. Run
[1615.0s] from this mustach
[1617.1s] because largely they are a zero.
[1621.0s] Ladies, is your husband a heartache? The
[1624.6s] men in the house is your lady a
[1627.5s] headache.
[1631.0s] Today we were looking at the story,
[1635.4s] two stories of powerful ladies. What a
[1637.4s] coincidence. Ruth and Naomi.
[1641.6s] You know when people read the book of
[1643.0s] Ruth in Ruth 1:16,
[1645.6s] they see that girl the the
[1647.4s] daughter-in-law pronouncing powerful
[1648.9s] words to Naomi. But for me, I look at it
[1651.8s] different.
[1653.8s] Do we have mother-in-laws in this house?
[1656.9s] Supposing Naomi was not a good
[1659.8s] mother-in-law to Ruth,
[1662.2s] could Ruth have said those words in Ruth
[1664.4s] 1:16 that your people be my people? So,
[1667.7s] mothersin-laws in the house, this is
[1670.2s] also for us
[1672.3s] this week. Powerful women in the Bible,
[1675.4s] Ruth and Esther. I want to beseech us
[1679.4s] children of God
[1682.2s] as we look at cravings of the soul as we
[1685.4s] desire to live our holy life.
[1688.8s] What is your purpose? What are you
[1691.0s] craving for
[1693.4s] this day? I want to invite all of us
[1698.0s] to make a decision to follow the Lord
[1700.9s] and allow him lead you in your daily
[1703.7s] endeavors. May the Lord bless you and
[1706.6s] keep you even as you make a decision to
[1709.2s] live for him. Amen.
[1712.4s] Let's rise for the closing song. Song
[1714.9s] number 260. Hoover or me, Holy Spirit.
[1719.0s] Song number 260.
