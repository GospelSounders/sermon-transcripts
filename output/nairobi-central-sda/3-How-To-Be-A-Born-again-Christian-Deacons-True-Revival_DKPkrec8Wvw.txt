FULL TRANSCRIPT:
thank you for joining us today for an episode of the book review of the book true Revival we've so far covered two chapters already the first one was calls for Revival the second was conversions are they fake or real today we'll be covering chapter 3 which is about how to be a born again Christian I know many times people want to get baptized and they say I am born again but what does it actually mean to be born again I'd like my panelist to introduce themselves on my left we have Steven M thank you and on my right op hayanga thank you my name is Nik opio and we'll be covering a review of the chapter three of the book through Revival before we begin I'd like to invite opata to offer a word of prayer before we start let's pray Our Father what in heaven we thank you for this opportunity to review this book The True Revival father we pray that you may Revive Our Lives father so that we may be inclined in our thoughts in our actions father to the cross of on Calvary that where Jesus shed his blood so that we may have salvation and of all the religions father that exist in the world is only the religion of Christianity father that offers solution to the needs and the challenges that we go through and one of these this solution father is that Jesus is coming back again to take us home and to live with him father forever and ever how we pray father as even we discuss this we invite the Holy Spirit father to speak to your heart so that you may get true conversion and all this your us trusting and believing in Jesus name we pray amen amen how to be a born again Christian the title of chapter 3 now there are some facts that we have to acknowledge as we look at what it means to be born again the first is that God pardons The Sinner he remits the punishment he deserves and then he treats The Sinner as though he had not sinned and then receives him into his Divine favor and then he justifies The Sinner through the merits of Christ's righteousness and The Sinner can only be justified through faith in the atonement that has been given by Christ if we look at these things we actually notice Christ is doing a lot of the work for us but you have to notice something that you can't let Christ do everything there's a part for us to play as Christians because being born again is evidence that Jesus has died on our behalf but we also need to accept him as our personal savior not as somebody who has died for others only but as someone who has died for us so many people believe in God but they don't trust him to transform their character and this is something that happens in our Christian lives that makes it hard for us to actually determine is someone truly born again now many times people say You must repent you must repent and do this and it makes it very hard for some people to actually come to God because they believe repentance is only the work of The Sinner but I could say today that repentance is something that God puts in our hearts to go to him it's not the Sinners who go to God to repent of themselves it's God who actually impresses you that you need to repent in fact if you go to the multiple instances in the Bible where a sinner is actually described the Bible calls Sinners lost sheep lost sheep never go back to the pen where they're kept on their own it's the shepherd who goes out to find them and it's the same thing with repentance we can't go back to God of our own selves it's actually a gift of God and I'd like to read a statement from the book to Revival that says repentance is no less the gift of God than our pardon and justification and it cannot be experienced except at it as it is given to the soul by Christ so it's important for us to remember that we can't repent of our own selves now what is this repentance that we talking about from the book there's a statement that reads uh in order to obtain the righteousness of Christ it is necessary for the sinner to know what that repentance is which works a radical change of Mind and Spirit and action I remember when I was a young boy sometimes you go and tell the teacher after you've done something wrong that I will not do this again or I tell my parents I will not do this again but you find yourself doing the same thing over and over again and I believe if you're a parent or you're a teacher you've experienced this with your own children or even with your own students and sometimes even the people who you given charge over and you have to remind them now repentance enables us to actually be better as Christians it's not always going over the same thing and doing the same thing over and over again now the Bible says in Ephesians 2:8 that for by grace are you saved through faith and that it is not of your own self it is the gift of God so when we are born again after we are repentant we have repented then we have have to believe that we are saved by grace now the chapter talks about this aspect of Being Fit to be saved and here is where I'd like to pass it on to my panelists if I were to ask you today do you think that you're are fit for heaven would you tell me today I'm ready God come and take me now or You' step back a bit what would be your take on this maybe you can start that's a that's a very good question that's a that's a very thought-provoking question that that um that that call me as a person to to introspect very deeply that am I really fit M for heaven yes and and you know our daily walk with Christ the ultimate price is that we see Heaven is that when Christ comes we are counted among the number mhm but if this is our daily walk with Christ MH then should we get to a point where we say ah I am there already um I don't think I don't think I would be in a position to comfortably tell myself that I am fit for heaven but I would be comfortable to tell myself that I am fit to be saved because salvation came to all brother opata who mentioned that that salvation came to everybody and and the ask is not very difficult the price for salvation is is is actually Priceless the only thing you you the cost is actually um there's no cost to it the only thing that I need to do is just to believe you know and accept Christ um elen white says uh allow me to to read as I answer that please go ahead that the believer is not called upon to make his peace with God he never has nor ever can do this the only thing I need to do he is to accept Christ as his peace so that is the only thing we are being called for accept Christ as our peace for with Christ is God and peace because on the cross he made sin bearable he said he actually ended sin not even bearable Christ made an end of sin bearing its heavy cast in his own body so I think just in a natural maybe to reply that I would say that I am fit to be saved the only ask that Christ um has for me is just to believe just to accept him as my peace because in him is God himself because Christ is a true reflection true image of God so in him is God and peace amen amen thank you and this coming it to you even as you answer this question even as you question your Fitness for salvation could you talk about how works are related to this salvational process is it possible for you to be saved without good works or it's just the faith that is fine for that yeah thank you thank you very much this is this is a very interesting uh discussion and the review of that book and uh the Bible says that uh God will bring everything to judgment everything into judgment whether it be evil or good so when you ask this question that are we fit to be to be saved mhm you realize that uh Salvation is for all so everybody is a candidate yes for salvation amen but now what is the Hance I think the the the sin factor is what that now separate us from the love of God the sin factor is what separate us but you realize there's a question that was asked up there can I Repent without help and then again you realize that from Genesis you realize when you fall we have this tendency of running away the Bible says the wicked run even when nobody's chasing them I have a dog and every time you come back home MH the dog excitedly Wags the tail and welcomes you home mhm but there are days when you open the door but you're not seeing the dog automatically you realize and you know there's something wrong that this dog has done that's the nature even dogs and you know when we talk about lws even even naturally even the the Bible says inet and inet even things that do not even have life there's law that guides them so you realize that even this dog knows that there's something wrong that I've done I can't I can't approach my master so by that sinful nature you cannot bring yourself to Christ Christ comes for you God reach out to you and this is something that is very powerful and it gives me courage that uh you are not alone God cares about you yes thank you maybe if I could add um I I like how P has brought has brought that out um sister white says that to believe that he will not save he will save others but not save youh is not genuine Faith unbelief it's it's unbelief exactly cuz we are called we are told that faith is more than talk so we cannot profess to be Christians MH and we pray but we believe that you know I believe that brother Niko brother opata will be saved but my sins are red as Scarlet I don't have that enough faith that I will be saved so that is not genuine Faith sister white contined to say as I finish but when the soul lays hold upon Christ as the only hope of Salvation then genuine faith is manifested to all including self amen amen thank you all for those responses and I'd also like to just share a few statements that touched me even as we consider this we're told that genuine faith will be manifested in good works for good works are the true fruits of Faith yes I believe every Christian is a tree MH and if you are a baren tree there'll be no fruits that are seen absolutely now some trees are mango trees apple trees uh passion fruit trees orange trees and they all produce fruit but I can try to imagine where you see a tree you see some leaves but you can't see what it is producing that's like a Christian who doesn't have any attached to him which actually means that when you are saved and when you born again there are some works that must come through you so it says that it is an evidence that a man is not justified by faith when his Works do not correspond to his profession because James says seest Thou how Faith wrought with his works and by his Works was his faith made perfect this is in reference to a Abraham so it's important for us to note what we do holds as much weight as what we say it's not enough to say that I am a born again Christian the next thing will ask where are your works for example if you're stopped by a police officer on the road he's saying you're a driver but he'll ask where is your license your driving license exactly so your faith has to be in line with those two and in closing we say we are following in the footsteps of Christ and I loved one statement which came at the close of this chapter that said where faith is good works appear faith without works is dead amen so in conclusion feed on Christ who is the bread of life and you will manifest the loveliness of character and spirit that's how this chapter actually ends amen amen amen so I'd like you all to join us for chapter 4 next week that is entitled God has rules too what are these rules how do we navigate around them and how does do they relate to the works which we have like to invite brother Steve to close for us with a word of prayer thank you very much look forward to seeing you next week M it will be interesting let's close with a word of prayer Our Father Who Art in Heaven Heaven once again we thank you and we praise you we glorify your name for your goodness oh Father forgive us our sins you have reminded us today on how to be born again Christians that Lord we should adopt true Faith real faith that helps us to believe that indeed you died on the cross for our sins that be it that our sins may be as red as Scarlet you shall make them white as snow Lord as we break we pray that you shall grant us your mercies until when we meet next week be with us until then for it is in Jesus name we pray amen

TIMESTAMPED TRANSCRIPT:
[0.8s] thank you for joining us today for an
[3.8s] episode of the book review of the book
[6.4s] true Revival we've so far covered two
[9.6s] chapters already the first one was calls
[11.8s] for Revival the second was conversions
[14.8s] are they fake or real today we'll be
[17.7s] covering chapter 3 which is about how to
[20.7s] be a born again Christian I know many
[24.2s] times people want to get baptized and
[26.7s] they say I am born again but what does
[29.2s] it actually mean to be born again I'd
[32.2s] like my panelist to introduce themselves
[34.5s] on my left we have Steven M thank you
[37.5s] and on my right op hayanga thank you my
[40.7s] name is Nik opio and we'll be covering a
[43.6s] review of the chapter three of the book
[46.0s] through Revival before we begin I'd like
[49.6s] to invite opata to offer a word of
[51.9s] prayer before we start let's pray Our
[55.2s] Father what in heaven we thank you for
[58.2s] this opportunity to review this book The
[61.1s] True
[62.1s] Revival father we pray that you may
[64.2s] Revive Our Lives father so that we may
[66.9s] be inclined in our thoughts in our
[69.3s] actions father to the cross of on
[72.8s] Calvary that where Jesus shed his blood
[75.8s] so that we may have salvation and of all
[78.6s] the religions father that exist in the
[80.4s] world is only the religion of
[82.6s] Christianity father that offers solution
[85.6s] to the needs and the challenges that we
[88.2s] go through and one of these this
[90.2s] solution father is that Jesus is coming
[93.4s] back again to take us home and to live
[97.1s] with him father forever and ever how we
[99.6s] pray father as even we discuss this we
[101.8s] invite the Holy Spirit father to speak
[103.8s] to your heart so that you may get true
[106.6s] conversion and all this your us trusting
[108.9s] and believing in Jesus name we pray amen
[112.2s] amen how to be a born again Christian
[116.0s] the title of chapter 3 now there are
[118.8s] some facts that we have to acknowledge
[121.0s] as we look at what it means to be born
[123.8s] again the first is that God pardons The
[127.3s] Sinner he remits the punishment he
[131.0s] deserves and then he treats The Sinner
[133.5s] as though he had not sinned and then
[136.4s] receives him into his Divine favor and
[139.4s] then he justifies The Sinner through the
[141.8s] merits of Christ's
[143.8s] righteousness and The Sinner can only be
[146.2s] justified through faith in the atonement
[149.0s] that has been given by Christ if we look
[151.6s] at these things we actually notice
[153.7s] Christ is doing a lot of the work for us
[157.5s] but you have to notice something that
[160.0s] you can't let Christ do everything
[163.0s] there's a part for us to play as
[165.8s] Christians because being born again is
[168.6s] evidence that Jesus has died on our
[172.2s] behalf but we also need to accept him as
[174.9s] our personal savior not as somebody who
[177.7s] has died for others only but as someone
[180.6s] who has died for us so many people
[184.4s] believe in God but they don't trust him
[186.9s] to transform their character and this is
[189.3s] something that happens in our Christian
[191.0s] lives that makes it hard for us to
[193.3s] actually determine is someone truly born
[197.5s] again now many times people say You must
[200.9s] repent you must repent and do this and
[203.4s] it makes it very hard for some people to
[205.7s] actually come to God because they
[207.5s] believe repentance is only the work of
[210.0s] The Sinner but I could say today that
[213.8s] repentance is something that God puts in
[216.6s] our hearts to go to him it's not the
[219.6s] Sinners who go to God to repent of
[221.7s] themselves it's God who actually
[223.5s] impresses you that you need to
[226.3s] repent in fact if you go to the multiple
[230.2s] instances in the Bible where a sinner is
[232.4s] actually described the Bible calls
[234.9s] Sinners lost sheep lost sheep never go
[238.5s] back to the pen where they're kept on
[241.1s] their own it's the shepherd who goes out
[244.1s] to find them and it's the same thing
[246.5s] with repentance we can't go back to God
[250.1s] of our own selves it's actually a gift
[252.7s] of God and I'd like to read a statement
[255.2s] from the book to Revival that says
[258.2s] repentance is no less the gift of God
[261.3s] than our pardon and justification and it
[264.8s] cannot be experienced except at it as it
[268.1s] is given to the soul by Christ so it's
[271.8s] important for us to remember that we
[274.6s] can't repent of our own selves now what
[278.9s] is this repentance that we talking about
[282.0s] from the book there's a statement that
[284.1s] reads uh in order to obtain the
[286.8s] righteousness of Christ it is necessary
[289.5s] for the sinner to know what that
[291.3s] repentance is which works a radical
[294.4s] change of Mind and Spirit and action I
[299.8s] remember when I was a young boy
[301.8s] sometimes you go and tell the teacher
[303.7s] after you've done something wrong that I
[306.0s] will not do this again or I tell my
[308.5s] parents I will not do this again but you
[311.7s] find yourself doing the same thing over
[314.2s] and over again and I believe if you're a
[316.9s] parent or you're a teacher you've
[319.2s] experienced this with your own children
[321.0s] or even with your own students and
[323.2s] sometimes even the people who you given
[325.1s] charge over and you have to remind them
[328.2s] now repentance enables us to actually be
[331.3s] better as Christians it's not always
[334.1s] going over the same thing and doing the
[336.2s] same thing over and over
[339.4s] again now the Bible says in Ephesians
[343.4s] 2:8 that for by grace are you saved
[347.0s] through faith and that it is not of your
[349.6s] own self it is the gift of God so when
[354.5s] we are born again after we are repentant
[357.5s] we have repented then we have have to
[360.2s] believe that we are saved by
[364.3s] grace now the chapter talks about this
[368.4s] aspect of Being Fit to be saved and here
[371.5s] is where I'd like to pass it on to my
[374.1s] panelists if I were to ask you today do
[377.9s] you think that you're are fit for heaven
[380.6s] would you tell me today I'm ready God
[382.6s] come and take me now or You' step back a
[387.6s] bit what would be your take on this
[392.1s] maybe you can start that's a that's a
[393.8s] very good question that's a that's a
[396.3s] very thought-provoking question that
[399.2s] that um that that call me as a person to
[402.9s] to introspect very deeply that am I
[405.8s] really fit M for heaven yes and and you
[409.9s] know our daily walk with Christ the
[413.0s] ultimate price is that we see Heaven is
[416.6s] that when Christ comes we are counted
[418.6s] among the number mhm but if this is our
[421.1s] daily walk with Christ MH then should we
[425.1s] get to a point where we say ah I am
[428.8s] there
[430.0s] already um I don't think I don't think I
[433.1s] would be in a position to comfortably
[435.6s] tell myself that I am fit for heaven but
[441.1s] I would be comfortable to tell myself
[443.4s] that I am fit to be saved because
[445.9s] salvation came to all brother opata who
[448.3s] mentioned that that salvation came to
[451.3s] everybody and and the ask is not very
[455.8s] difficult the price for salvation is is
[459.7s] is actually Priceless the only thing you
[462.9s] you the cost is actually um there's no
[465.6s] cost to it the only thing that I need to
[467.4s] do is just to believe you know and
[470.2s] accept Christ um elen white says uh
[474.0s] allow me to to read as I answer that
[476.1s] please go ahead that the believer is not
[479.1s] called upon to make his peace with God
[482.1s] he never has nor ever can do
[485.5s] this the only thing I need to do he is
[489.5s] to accept Christ as his peace so that is
[492.6s] the only thing we are being called for
[494.5s] accept Christ as our peace for with
[496.8s] Christ is God and peace because on the
[500.6s] cross he made sin bearable he said he
[503.7s] actually ended sin not even bearable
[505.7s] Christ made an end of sin bearing its
[508.7s] heavy cast in his own body so I think
[511.1s] just in a natural maybe to reply that I
[513.7s] would say that I am fit to be saved the
[517.5s] only ask that Christ um has for me is
[521.8s] just to believe just to accept him as my
[524.6s] peace because in him is God himself
[528.0s] because Christ is a true reflection true
[529.9s] image of God so in him is God and peace
[533.0s] amen amen thank you and this coming it
[536.4s] to you even as you answer this question
[539.1s] even as you question your Fitness for
[542.2s] salvation could you talk about how works
[545.9s] are related to this salvational process
[549.6s] is it possible for you to be saved
[551.4s] without good works or it's just the
[553.4s] faith that is fine for
[555.0s] that yeah thank you thank you very much
[557.2s] this is this is a very interesting uh
[559.1s] discussion and the review of that book
[562.1s] and uh the Bible says that uh God will
[566.0s] bring everything to judgment
[569.8s] everything into judgment whether it be
[572.0s] evil or good
[575.0s] so when you ask this question that are
[577.6s] we fit to be to be saved mhm you realize
[581.5s] that uh Salvation is for
[585.1s] all so everybody is a candidate yes for
[588.6s] salvation amen but now what is the
[592.6s] Hance I think the the the sin factor is
[596.4s] what that now separate us from the love
[598.5s] of God the sin factor is what separate
[601.3s] us but you realize there's a question
[604.0s] that was asked up there can I Repent
[606.8s] without
[608.2s] help and then again you realize that
[610.7s] from Genesis you realize when you fall
[614.2s] we have this tendency of running away
[616.6s] the Bible says the wicked run even when
[619.2s] nobody's chasing them I have a
[622.0s] dog and every time you come back home MH
[626.0s] the dog excitedly Wags the tail and
[628.8s] welcomes you home mhm but there are days
[631.6s] when you open the door but you're not
[634.0s] seeing the
[635.0s] dog automatically you realize and you
[638.2s] know there's something wrong that this
[640.0s] dog has done that's the nature even dogs
[643.2s] and you know when we talk about lws even
[645.5s] even naturally even the the Bible says
[648.5s] inet and inet even things that do not
[652.6s] even have life there's law that guides
[654.3s] them so you realize that even this dog
[657.0s] knows that there's something wrong that
[658.6s] I've done I
[660.5s] can't I can't approach my master so by
[665.2s] that sinful nature you cannot bring
[668.4s] yourself to Christ Christ comes for you
[671.3s] God reach out to you and this is
[673.8s] something that is very powerful and it
[675.4s] gives me courage that uh you are not
[678.0s] alone God cares about you yes thank you
[681.4s] maybe if I could add um I I like how P
[684.5s] has brought has brought that out um
[688.0s] sister white says that to believe that
[691.2s] he will not save he will save others but
[694.1s] not save youh is not genuine Faith
[698.4s] unbelief it's it's unbelief exactly cuz
[701.1s] we are called we are told that faith is
[703.1s] more than talk so we cannot profess to
[706.0s] be Christians MH and we pray but we
[709.2s] believe that you know I believe that
[711.4s] brother Niko brother opata will be saved
[714.7s] but my sins are red as Scarlet I don't
[717.2s] have that enough faith that I will be
[719.6s] saved so that is not genuine Faith
[721.3s] sister white contined to say as I finish
[723.1s] but when the soul lays hold upon Christ
[725.6s] as the only hope of Salvation then
[727.7s] genuine faith is manifested to all
[731.0s] including self amen amen thank you all
[734.6s] for those
[735.7s] responses and I'd also like to just
[738.1s] share a few statements that touched me
[740.4s] even as we consider this we're told that
[743.4s] genuine faith will be manifested in good
[747.1s] works for good works
[749.7s] are the true fruits of Faith yes I
[753.0s] believe every Christian is a tree MH and
[757.2s] if you are a baren tree there'll be no
[759.5s] fruits that are seen absolutely now some
[762.0s] trees are mango trees apple trees uh
[766.0s] passion fruit trees orange trees and
[768.6s] they all produce fruit but I can try to
[771.1s] imagine where you see a tree you see
[773.2s] some leaves but you can't see what it is
[775.6s] producing that's like a Christian who
[777.9s] doesn't have any
[779.7s] attached to him which actually means
[782.3s] that when you are saved and when you
[784.2s] born again there are some works that
[786.7s] must come through you so it says that it
[789.9s] is an evidence that a man is not
[792.8s] justified by faith when his Works do not
[796.1s] correspond to his profession because
[799.0s] James says seest Thou how Faith wrought
[802.3s] with his works and by his Works was his
[805.5s] faith made perfect this is in reference
[808.4s] to a Abraham so it's important for us to
[811.6s] note what we do holds as much weight as
[816.0s] what we say it's not enough to say that
[819.2s] I am a born again Christian the next
[821.9s] thing will ask where are your works for
[824.7s] example if you're stopped by a police
[826.4s] officer on the road he's saying you're a
[828.8s] driver but he'll ask where is your
[831.1s] license your driving license exactly so
[834.0s] your faith has to be in line with those
[837.0s] two and in closing
[839.7s] we say we are following in the footsteps
[842.3s] of Christ and I loved one statement
[845.4s] which came at the close of this chapter
[848.3s] that said where faith is good works
