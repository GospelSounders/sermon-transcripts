FULL TRANSCRIPT:
Hello, my name is Saha and I'm going to be taking you through the mission reading which is entitled A New Heart. Hannah loved her twin brothers, Zeie and Jerry, but they could be so annoying as their older sister. But they could be so annoying as their older sister. She felt like she needed to make sure they controlled themselves and were well behaved. So, she spoke up at lunch when the boys loaded their plates with food. "Save some for mommy and daddy," she said. "It's fine," Zeie said without putting back any food. Mommy and daddy already ate, Jerry chimed in. But it seemed to Hana that the boys had taken too much food and she wanted them to put some back. No, they haven't eaten yet, Hannah insisted, her voice rising. Save some for them. Really, it's fine, Zeie declared, his voice also rising. Overhearing the growing disagreement, Daddy and Mommy sought to restore calm. "It's fine," Daddy said. "Let the boys eat," Mommy said. But that wasn't all that Hana found annoying. The twins also liked to go into her bedroom and play with her toys. She was alarmed one day when they took her teddy bear and began play fighting with it. She worried that they might accidentally tear it apart. She grabbed the teddy bear. "Play with your own things," she whispered fiercely. She whispered because she didn't want to disturb daddy and mommy. The family was living in an apartment on the campus of an of the Adventist International Institute of Advanced Studies in the Philippines. Daddy was in the other room studying to become a missionary and mommy was working. The twins weren't bothered that Hana had taken the teddy bear. They found another teddy bear in her room and started to play fight. "Stop," Hannah whispered. "Take your own things to play fight with." And so it went on and on and on. It was so annoying. Hannah didn't know what to do. Then Hannah and her family went to the spiritual to the week of spiritual emphasis at the Adventist International Institute of Advanced Studies. Hannah listened carefully to the speaker. Her heart was touched as she heard about Jesus's great love. When the speaker asked who would like to give their hearts to Jesus and be baptized, she looked up at her she looked up at her parents. "Daddy and mommy, should I go?" she whispered. Daddy and mommy saw that Hannah loved Jesus very much. They saw that the Holy Spirit was speaking to her heart. They nodded their heads that that she could go. Hannah made her way to the front. Zeie and Jerry joined her as did other children. The church pastor prayed a special prayer for the children and invited them to study the Bible with him. Then on a bright happy Sabbath, Hannah and her brothers gave their hearts to Jesus in baptism. Something happened after the her baptism. Hannah began to wake up 30 minutes earlier to have her own morning worship. As she read, she felt that God was really was really with her. She liked being with God and and she prayed. Dear heavenly father, she whispered. Thank you for this day. Please help me to understand this devotional. Help me to understand what I hear today. Please bless my parents and and brothers. As Hannah prayed, things began to change at home. She found that the things that once annoyed her were no longer annoying. She was no longer annoyed by anything. And she only had kind things to say to her brothers. Today, Hana is happy all the time, and she is sure that God is making her heart to be like this, to be like his. God is changing my heart, she said. Your 13th Sabbath offering this quarter will help children in the Southern Pacific Asia-Pacific division, which includes the Philippines, learn about the God who changes hearts to be like his. Thank Thank you for planning a generous offering on June 28th. Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat. [Music] Heat. Heat. Yeah. Heat. Good morning, good afternoon, and good evening from wherever you're joining us from. Welcome to lesson 11 of the teens cornerstone lesson of the second quarter. But before we begin, I'd like to introduce our panelists. Start from my left. Hello, my name is Saha. Hi, my name is Blessing. Hi, my name is Despendo. Hello, my name is Jack. And my name is Jonan Mana. Welcome to our lesson. I'd like to ask blessings of prayer before we begin. Let's pray. Our kind and loving father, we thank you for this day. Thank you for the gift of life. Thank you for enabling us to meet here to discuss this lesson. Um and when we finish um successfully remind us to glorify your holy name in Jesus name I believe and pray. Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. Thank you blessing. So our lesson is titled Jesus Calling. Now this is a followup from lesson 10. We're talking about um front and center. That was the title about the Sabbath. So our lesson today is about the calling of the 12 disciples and it's also tied back to the sermon on the mount. Now just something worth of noting is that on a hillside sometime 2,000 years ago Christ was teaching his 12 chosen people. Christ was trying to build a new kingdom on earth and he chose 12 people to help him build that kingdom. And on that mountain 2,000 years ago, he was teaching his disciples what that kingdom meant, but he's not talking to his disciples alone. He spoke to them with a multitude of people, probably 5,000 plus people. So the sermon of the mount, as much as it was meant to the people who are listening, it was also a lesson to the disciples on what this kingdom that they been brought into really talks about. Okay. So, we're going to get into a lesson today. For those who have it, um our story is going to come from the book of Luke, chapter 6, verse 17-31. So, you can just open your Bibles and just keep uh your finger there. But before we get to our lesson, I'd like to ask blessing to read our key text. Um, our key text for today comes from the book of Luke 12:E3, which says, "One of those days Jesus went out to a mountain side to pray and spent the night praying to God. When when morning came, he called his disciples to him and chose 12 of them whom he designated whom he also designated apostles." H interesting verse. Um before Jesus started out his ministry that is before he called out the 12 disciples Christ prayed for the entire night and it's very interesting. Now let us read something about the 12 disciples. I'd like to ask Pendle to read the did you know section. Did you know section? Did you know? Many people believe that all of Jesus disciples were with him from the very beginning of his public ministry, but that's not true. Five were, but most were were not. John 1:4 to 49. The other seven were chosen about midway through the 3 and 1/2 years that Jesus ministered publicly on earth. As Luke as Luke notes in Luke chapter 6, Jesus already had a great following by the time the complete pose of the disciples were was chosen. Jesus demonstrated the power of his ministry by healing, casting out demons and reaching out to the poor and the forgotten. This led people to follow him. From this people he selected some of his disciples and then he shared the foundation of princip of his then he shared the foundation principles of his kingdom with the 12 and who all wanted to hear him all right thank you for that now I'd just like to ask our panelists right Christ had 12 disciples right and as we've read there were originally five who were following Which ones do you think were among the first five? Start with Jackson. Which of the 12 disciples do you think were among the first five Jesus had? I think Simon Peter. Simon Peter. Thank you. Uh Pendle Andrew. Andrew. I think James. James. And James brother John. Yes. So those are among the first five disciples that Jesus had. And originally these guys actually used to follow John the Baptist but after John the Baptist was in prison they had to find another teacher. So they saw Jesus that's way they went to him. So you're going to go into the what do you think se section Christ was launching a very new initiative in Israel and I'd like Pendle to take us through that the questions in the what do you think section what do you think section mhm if you are going to launch a new mission initiative calling people to God's kingdom what kind of ad advertisement will you create to get people interested okay all Right. Probably you can tell us. Let's say you've been you've been given um a task, right, to create a a campaign for for Jesus to get people into our church. I'll give this to all our panelist. What slogan would you use a catchy phrase? All right. Like for us in our church right now, it's I will go for for like 5 years now. So what would you choose? What what slogan could you go for? You can also think of a song. I'll ask you guys. Yeah, think of a song as well. And then if you were to ask for money, a budget, how much do you think, let's work in Kenyan shillings, okay? How much do you think will be enough for you to get that campaign rolling? Getting people to church. The money will be about Let's say uh 100k. 100k. Okay. That means you want to reach out to like a small area maybe. Okay. 100k is her budget. Uh what kind of song would you guys choose? You have a song in mind? You can just tell us or or a slogan like a title. Yes. Blessing. Um one for Christ and Christ for all. Ah nice nice. One for Christ. One for Christ and Christ for all. That is a good one. That's a good slogan. Uh-huh. What kind of music or what will be the theme song? Maybe song number 213. 213. Yeah. Jesus is coming again. Jesus is coming again. Ah, good, good, good. Uh-huh. Jackson, anything you'd like to add? What would be like a campaign slogan for you or a song you'd choose or how much money would you budget? Um, the song will be redeemed. Redeemed. Okay. Uh-huh. How much money will you budget? 250K. 250K. Very specific number. Okay. Saha, how much money will you budget for that? 427K. 427. 27. Very specific number. Okay. So, this is considering um you have volunteers. Let's say it's like a oneweek campaign. You have volunteers. They have to eat. And then you'll have to like give books to people. Then people will come who are sick. So you can like set up a medical camp, free blood pressure checks. You guys need blood pressure checks at your age, but the older folks do, right? So free blood pressure check, cancer screening and the like. Yeah. So it's it's quite something. And to imagine Jesus did not have a theme song or a budget. He just went for 12 people and he ran his mission. And it's because of that mission that we are here right now. It's because Jesus chose 12 people that we have our Bibles. All right. Okay. Let's move on. Now, we're going to get to our flashlights. I like to ask Jack to read our flashlight for us. Just share the lesson with him. Our flashlight says, "In training his disciples, Jesus chose to withdraw from the confusion of the city to the quiet fields of the hills as more in harmony with the lessons of self obnigation. He desired to teach them. And during his ministry, he loved to gather people but the people around him under the blue heavens on some grassy hillside or on the beach besides the lake. He surrounded by the works of his own creation. He could turn the thoughts of his hearers from the artificial to the natural. In the growth and development of nature were revealed the principles of his kingdom. Mhm. Thank you for that. Um there's something about nature. I want to ask you guys a question. When you were kids, how how many of you used to just lie down on the grass and just look at the sky and try to to look at the clouds and say that clouds will look like a like a teddy bear or like a car? You've all done that right now. When was the last time you did that? Like s when's the last time you just laid down and just look up in the at the sky? Last week. Last week. That's pretty recent. Pendo. Uh blessing. Sorry. Last year. Last year. Uhhuh. offender. Um, during Easter. During Easter, that's like a few months ago. Uh-huh. 3 years ago. 3 years ago. Yeah. And the older you get, trust me, the harder it gets to just get time and look at nature. But Christ, as we've read in our flashlight, Christ took his disciples and taught them using nature. Elenoid speaks about it in the book Desire of Ages chapter 30. But how Christ will take his disciples out into nature, teach them lessons using trees, rocks, um, water and everything else. He wanted to teach them that they do not need to rely on the things that man has put for himself in the cities. That is why Christ took them out of the cities. So, we're going to go into our story. I'd like to ask Saha to just give us a summary of what what the story talks about. For those who do not have the lesson with them, the story is from Luke 6:E1 17-31 where I just put you told you to put your finger on Saha. So this story is basically about the when Jesus it was on the sermon on the mount. Mhm. And Jesus was basically saying the beatitudes and he was saying if if the people do certain things then certain things will happen to them. For example um he said that blessed are you who are poor for yours is the kingdom of God. Mhm. So he continues to say that blessed are you who hunger for now you'll be satisfied. Mhm. So these verses are just saying that people who might have a certain like a part of them that's going a bit down then in the kingdom of heaven then they will be elevated. True. Thank you for that Saha. That's actually a very um good summary of what Christ was talking about. And uh Jesus in his story, he mostly talked about the people who society looked down upon. Blessed are those who moan. Blessed are the poor. Blessed are the meek. Blessed are those who hunger and thirst. People who you do not really look into uh look at in society. Those are the people Christ wanted to elevate in his kingdom. And why do you think Jesus did that? Jesus had the chance to talk about blessed are the rich because God will give them more, right? Christ could have said that which is also true. But he chose to speak about blessed are the poor. Why do you think he did that blessing? Why do you think Christ chose the poor and the hungry and the meek? No, not those guys high in society. Um I think uh you see the high people they they think they have everything. So they they believe they do not need anything more. But the people who are looked down upon on society, they they they want a place to belong. And that's what Jesus was giving them. He wanted them to feel equal to the rest. He wanted them to feel loved and cared for. Mhm. I like that. I like that. Uh Jack, what are your thoughts? Why do you think Jesus talked about the people who are lowly in society? Um so he can show that he values everyone and not only the people who have made it in life but also the people who are not that high in society are valued to him. True. True. Yeah. And if you actually look at his disciples what are some of the professions they did? Most of them were fishermen. Fishermen are considered uneducated. Number one, same level as shepherds. uneducated people, very poor, they they earned very little, right? So the Pharisees looked down upon his disciples. Some of the rich disciples Jesus had was like Matthew Levi only because he was a tax collector and most of his wealth was from stealing. Wasn't exactly genuinely rich. So Christ surrounded himself with a lowly in society to reach out to the people who had been cast out, make them feel part of this new kingdom that is coming up. Right? And there's a story that's given um in the teachers lesson by a pastor. Let me just get his name. Uh his name is Pastor Jimmy Chapman. So he was giving a story about two brothers in uh England back in the I think the early 1800s and uh they were born to a family called the Taylor family. There's the older brother. He decided to go into politics, became an MP. Then the younger brother chose a more of a humble path. He became a missionary. Went out to China, went out to Africa and all those places that people had not heard about the gospel. And he's the one who's known his name was Hudson Taylor. Now very interesting thing is years later when you look at the encyclopedia in England, when you look for the name of Hudson Taylor, that's the missionary, you'll find a whole almost half a page talking about him. But you look at his brother for his brother's name in the same encyclopedia, his brother who's a politician, the only thing written about him is the brother of Hudson Taylor. All right? So you might have thought because this girl is an MP, popular, newspapers know him, King knows him, he would have been there would been more to him than just a single line. But this shows you that even choosing a humble path in life, as long as it's with it is with God, it'll take you way farther than just choosing um to gratify your own needs. Okay? And that is the message we have for us today. Our title is Jesus Calling. Christ calls anyone and everyone. He he he does not matter if you're poor, if you've you've had a very sinful past, if you're struggling in your exams in school and people are laughing at you. Christ is calling. He wants you s to be part of his kingdom. Right now, let us move on with our lesson. And I'd like to ask um Jack to read the Thursday part of our lesson. The Thursday part of our lesson. When Jesus chose his disciples, he knew their gifts, talents, and weakness. Read again about each of the disciples listed below. What are some of their weaknesses, blind spots, areas in which they needed to make changes. H Okay. So, let us read about that. So, we'll have each person just open one of the verses. So, we'll start with you, Jack. You can open the book of John chapter 18 verse 10. Then we'll have Pendo Mark 3:17. We'll have Blessing do John 20:2. Then we'll have Saha open the book of John 12:5 and 6. Okay. So as you're opening, let me just explain something again. Each of our lesson is usually tied to one of the fundamental beliefs. And our fundamental belief for this lesson is spiritual gifts and ministries. Each disciples had different backgrounds. That is what we're going to see in the verses. And as much as they had their own weaknesses, Christ used that for the glory of his mission. So we'll start with the disciple Peter. That's John 18:10. Can you kindly read? Then Simon Peter who had a sword drew it and struck the high priest servant cutting off his right ear. Okay. So what weakness did Simon Peter have from that verse? I think his weakness was he didn't have self-control at a point that he knew his friend was going to die. True. Yeah. S Peter lacked self-control. All right. This was a very solemn time. Christ is being arrested. I know emotions are high and everything, but he acted rashly. Just cut off someone's ear. He didn't care. That is Simon Peter. That was his weakness. Thank you for that. Then we have the two disciples, James and John. That's Mark 3:17. Pendle and it and it says that James the son of Zebedee and John the brother of James to whom he gave the name Bon Bon Jazz. Mhm. That is sons of thunder. Sons of thunder. Now what does thunder do? How does thunder feel like when you're just chilling in the house all just what's the first reaction? Uh we're surprised. You're surprised. A bit scared as well. So the reason they were called Sons of Thunder, these guys were terrorists. Okay. No, no, like literally bombing themselves up or something. But they they were they were known for their anger issues. That is what we get. That was the weaknesses of these two brothers, James and John. Thanks for that, Pendle. Now Thomas, John 20:2. That's blessing. And it says, "The other disciples therefore said to him, we've seen the Lord." So he said to them, "Unless I see in his hands the print of the nails and put my finger into the print of the nails and put my hand into his side, I will not believe." And after 8 days, his disciples were again inside. The and Thomas was with them. Jesus came, the doors being shut, and stood in the midst and said, "Peace to you." Then he said to Thomas, "Reach your finger here and look at my hands and reach your hand here and put it into my side. Do not be unbelieving but believing." Thank you. So, what was Thomas's weakness? I think he he was doubtful. He was doubtful. Yeah. Yeah. That that is it. And it's actually a very common phrase nowadays. Don't be doubting Thomas. He he doubted. He did not believe anything until he saw. That is his witness. Now, let's see Judas. That's from John 12:5 and 6. Yes, sir. And it says, why was this fragrant oil not sold for 300 dinari and given to the poor? This he said not that he cared for the poor, but because he was a thief and had the money box, and he used to take what was put in it. Right? So what was Judah's weakness? It was a thief. It was a thief. It's plain and simple, right? We might think it's greed. It is greed. Now um chapter 12 verse 6 as Sah has read. Judas was the treasurer for the disciples. In case there was any money amongst the disciples, Judas is the one who kept it. And it's surprising this is the same person who sold Jesus only 30 30 pieces of silver. This guy was greedy number one. And he was a thief cuz the Bible tells us here he used to take what was put in need. This is the equivalent of the offering being taken after we've collected offering in church taken to the back to the by the deacons to to be counted after the sermon and then someone just decides just like ah they won't realize let me just take a bit of it. That is what Judas did. Now question to us and to the audience. If Jesus chose disciples with such qualities, what makes you think he's going to push you out just because you you you took your friend's pen in school? Do you think Jes will just throw you away? No. Right. That is back to what the main title of our lesson is about today. Jesus is calling. He's calling anyone and everyone who hears his voice to come to him. Okay, as we finish up the lesson, like us to just look at the punchlines, just look at the punch lines and then I just want you to pick a verse that speaks to you out of the verses that we have there. Just pick a verse that speaks to you. I'll start from uh this side with Saha. Okay. What verse speaks to you? The verse that speaks to me is Proverbs 22:4. Mhm. Why? You can just read it and then just explain why it stands out for you. It says, "Humility is the fear of the Lord. Its wages are are riches and honor and life." Mhm. So, it speaks out to me because I also want to be humble and and I want to live a good life. Yeah. It's the only way. Humble thyself in the sight of the Lord and he will lift you up. And he will lift you up. Thank you, Sah. blessing. Um, the one that speaks to me the most is Matthew chapter 6 verse1. It says, "Be careful not to practice your righteousness in front of others to be seen by them. If you do, you will have no reward from your father in heaven." So, this verse is practically self-explanatory. Um, it practically shows you not to show off. It's not salvation is personal. So if you're holy um you can you can show it by helping people but don't don't be boastful about um don't be boastful about your righteousness and just be humble and God will reward you openly in heaven. Amen. Thank you for that. You don't have to blog to people that I I pray four or five times a day. I've read the Bible how many times. Just humble religion. Thanks for that, Pendle. Also me, Matthew 6:1 stands out for me. Mhm. It says, "Take heed that you do not do your charitable deeds before men to be seen." Mhm. Otherwise, you have no reward in you have no reward from your father in heaven. Mhm. It reminds me that I should only do good to please God, not men. Exactly. Um you everything you do on earth is just for the audience of one. You're not here to please anyone. Only only God has to be pleased. Thanks for that Pendle. And finally Jack. So the verse that speaks to me is Deuteronomy 10:12 which says and now Israel what does the Lord your God ask for you but to fear the Lord your God to walk in obedience to him to love him to serve the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul. So it's basically telling us that or telling me that God has given us everything we need and the only thing he wants in return is to be praised and he wants also us to be obedient to him. All right. Thanks for that. Thanks for that. Now just to finish up our lesson, God calls everyone. God says come as you are with your burdens, with everything that you have. All that luggage, all that feeling that you're the worst person on earth, come with it and then it's going to make the burden lighter for you. Okay? So, just a call to us, just a reminder again. When you feel that you are not good enough for Christ, that's the time he really wants you to come to him. When you feel like you're in a a failure in school, like something has happened and you you're never going to recover again with exams or anything of the sort. Christ. That's the time he wants you. Okay, we'll just wrap up our lesson with that and I'll read the final quote and the further insight. It says, "God takes men as they are with the human elements in their character and trains them for his service through the knowledge and practice of the truth through the grace of Christ. They may become transformed into his image." That's from the desire of ages, page 294. So it is my prayer that we will listen to this call that Christ is giving us and that we will answer him and just come to him. Jesus is calling. Will you listen? Amen. Amen. Thank you for joining us. I'd like to ask Justin to offer a word of prayer as we close up. Let's pray. Our dear and heavenly father, we thank you for this day. We thank you for the gift of life. Oh Lord, as we're finishing our lesson, please may you help us impact our Please may you help it impact our lives, oh Lord. And in Jesus name I pray. Amen. Amen. Amen. 

==================================================

TIMESTAMPED TRANSCRIPT:
[0.4s] Hello, my name is Saha and I'm going to
[2.6s] be taking you through the mission
[3.8s] reading which is entitled A New Heart.
[6.3s] Hannah loved her twin brothers, Zeie and
[8.6s] Jerry, but they could be so annoying as
[10.4s] their older sister. But they could be so
[13.1s] annoying as their older sister. She felt
[15.2s] like she needed to make sure they
[16.9s] controlled themselves and were well
[18.3s] behaved. So, she spoke up at lunch when
[20.7s] the boys loaded their plates with food.
[22.6s] "Save some for mommy and daddy," she
[24.6s] said. "It's fine," Zeie said without
[27.1s] putting back any food. Mommy and daddy
[29.3s] already ate, Jerry chimed in. But it
[31.8s] seemed to Hana that the boys had taken
[33.8s] too much food and she wanted them to put
[35.9s] some back. No, they haven't eaten yet,
[38.9s] Hannah insisted, her voice rising. Save
[42.2s] some for them. Really, it's fine, Zeie
[45.3s] declared, his voice also rising.
[48.2s] Overhearing the growing disagreement,
[50.2s] Daddy and Mommy sought to restore calm.
[52.5s] "It's fine," Daddy said. "Let the boys
[55.0s] eat," Mommy said. But that wasn't all
[58.2s] that Hana found annoying. The twins also
[60.9s] liked to go into her bedroom and play
[63.0s] with her toys. She was alarmed one day
[65.4s] when they took her teddy bear and began
[67.4s] play fighting with it. She worried that
[69.7s] they might accidentally tear it apart.
[72.6s] She grabbed the teddy bear. "Play with
[75.0s] your own things," she whispered
[76.7s] fiercely.
[78.5s] She whispered because she didn't want to
[80.7s] disturb daddy and mommy. The family was
[83.5s] living in an apartment on the campus of
[85.5s] an of the Adventist International
[87.4s] Institute of Advanced Studies in the
[89.5s] Philippines. Daddy was in the other room
[92.3s] studying to become a missionary and
[94.3s] mommy was working. The twins weren't
[96.9s] bothered that Hana had taken the teddy
[98.8s] bear. They found another teddy bear in
[100.8s] her room and started to play fight.
[102.8s] "Stop," Hannah whispered. "Take your own
[105.7s] things to play fight with." And so it
[108.2s] went on and on and on. It was so
[110.9s] annoying. Hannah didn't know what to do.
[113.4s] Then Hannah and her family went to the
[116.5s] spiritual to the week of spiritual
[118.7s] emphasis at the Adventist International
[121.7s] Institute of Advanced Studies. Hannah
[124.4s] listened carefully to the speaker. Her
[127.1s] heart was touched as she heard about
[129.0s] Jesus's great love. When the speaker
[131.8s] asked who would like to give their
[133.6s] hearts to Jesus and be baptized, she
[135.8s] looked up at her she looked up at her
[137.7s] parents. "Daddy and mommy, should I go?"
[140.8s] she whispered. Daddy and mommy saw that
[143.3s] Hannah loved Jesus very much. They saw
[146.2s] that the Holy Spirit was speaking to her
[149.4s] heart. They nodded their heads that that
[152.4s] she could go. Hannah made her way to the
[155.3s] front. Zeie and Jerry joined her as did
[158.5s] other children. The church pastor prayed
[161.1s] a special prayer for the children and
[162.9s] invited them to study the Bible with
[164.8s] him.
[166.3s] Then on a bright happy Sabbath, Hannah
[169.3s] and her brothers gave their hearts to
[171.1s] Jesus in baptism.
[173.3s] Something happened after the her
[174.8s] baptism. Hannah began to wake up 30
[177.6s] minutes earlier to have her own morning
[179.6s] worship. As she read, she felt that God
[182.5s] was really was really with her. She
[185.4s] liked being with God and and she prayed.
[188.5s] Dear heavenly father, she whispered.
[191.2s] Thank you for this day. Please help me
[193.3s] to understand this devotional. Help me
[195.6s] to understand what I hear today. Please
[198.1s] bless my parents and and brothers. As
[200.9s] Hannah prayed, things began to change at
[203.0s] home. She found that the things that
[204.9s] once annoyed her were no longer
[206.4s] annoying. She was no longer annoyed by
[209.2s] anything. And she only had kind things

[434.2s] Good morning, good afternoon, and good
[436.6s] evening from wherever you're joining us
[438.8s] from. Welcome to lesson 11 of the teens
[442.3s] cornerstone lesson of the second
[444.7s] quarter. But before we begin, I'd like
[447.0s] to introduce our panelists. Start from
[449.5s] my left. Hello, my name is Saha. Hi, my
[453.4s] name is Blessing. Hi, my name is
[455.8s] Despendo. Hello, my name is Jack. And my
[459.1s] name is Jonan Mana. Welcome to our
[461.8s] lesson. I'd like to ask blessings of
[463.9s] prayer before we begin.
[466.0s] Let's pray. Our kind and loving father,
[468.6s] we thank you for this day. Thank you for
[470.1s] the gift of life. Thank you for enabling
[472.3s] us to meet here to discuss this lesson.
[475.6s] Um and when we finish um successfully
[478.9s] remind us to glorify your holy name in
[481.6s] Jesus name I believe and pray. Amen.
[483.8s] Amen. Amen. Amen. Thank you blessing. So
[487.0s] our lesson is titled Jesus Calling. Now
[490.3s] this is a followup from lesson 10. We're
[492.6s] talking about um front and center. That
[495.7s] was the title about the Sabbath. So our
[498.7s] lesson today is about the calling of the
[500.7s] 12 disciples and it's also tied back to
[503.1s] the sermon on the mount. Now just
[505.7s] something worth of noting
[509.1s] is that on a hillside sometime 2,000
[511.8s] years ago
[513.7s] Christ was teaching his 12 chosen
[516.7s] people. Christ was trying to build a new
[519.5s] kingdom on earth and he chose 12 people
[522.8s] to help him build that kingdom. And on
[525.8s] that mountain 2,000 years ago, he was
[528.4s] teaching his disciples what that kingdom
[530.9s] meant, but he's not talking to his
[533.1s] disciples alone. He spoke to them with a
[536.0s] multitude of people, probably 5,000 plus
[538.7s] people. So the sermon of the mount, as
[541.8s] much as it was meant to the people who
[543.2s] are listening, it was also a lesson to
[545.4s] the disciples on what this kingdom that
[548.0s] they been brought into really talks
[551.3s] about. Okay. So, we're going to get into
[554.2s] a lesson today.
[556.8s] For those who have it, um our story is
[559.4s] going to come from the book of Luke,
[562.6s] chapter 6, verse 17-31. So, you can just
[565.1s] open your Bibles and just keep uh your
[567.7s] finger there. But before we get to our
[569.8s] lesson,
[571.4s] I'd like to ask blessing to read our key
[574.0s] text.
[576.0s] Um, our key text for today comes from
[578.3s] the book of Luke 12:E3,
[581.6s] which says, "One of those days Jesus
[584.4s] went out to a mountain side to pray and
[587.1s] spent the night praying to God. When
[589.7s] when morning came, he called his
[591.4s] disciples to him and chose 12 of them
[594.6s] whom he
[596.8s] designated
[598.5s] whom he also designated apostles." H
[602.4s] interesting verse. Um before Jesus
[605.4s] started out his ministry that is before
[608.4s] he called out the 12 disciples Christ
[611.4s] prayed for the entire night and it's
[613.8s] very interesting. Now let us read
[616.8s] something about the 12 disciples. I'd
[618.8s] like to ask Pendle to read the did you
[621.3s] know section. Did you know section?
[625.0s] Did you know? Many people believe that
[628.2s] all of Jesus disciples were with him
[630.4s] from the very beginning of his public
[632.6s] ministry, but that's not true. Five
[636.0s] were, but most were were not. John 1:4
[642.3s] to 49. The other seven were chosen about
[645.4s] midway through the 3 and 1/2 years that
[648.7s] Jesus ministered publicly on earth. As
[652.5s] Luke
[654.2s] as Luke notes in Luke chapter 6, Jesus
[657.6s] already had a great following by the
[660.3s] time
[662.0s] the complete pose of the disciples were
[664.6s] was chosen. Jesus demonstrated the power
[667.5s] of his ministry by healing, casting out
[670.8s] demons and reaching out to the poor and
[673.4s] the forgotten.
[675.4s] This led people to follow him. From this
[678.9s] people he selected some of his disciples
[682.4s] and then he shared the foundation of
[684.5s] princip of his then he shared the
[687.8s] foundation principles of his kingdom
[690.6s] with the 12 and who all wanted to hear
[694.2s] him all right thank you for that now I'd
[697.0s] just like to ask our panelists right
[700.7s] Christ had 12 disciples right and as
[703.7s] we've read there were originally five
[705.8s] who were following
[707.7s] Which ones do you think were among the
[709.7s] first five? Start with Jackson.
[712.7s] Which of the 12 disciples do you think
[714.5s] were among the first five Jesus had?
[717.7s] I think Simon Peter. Simon Peter. Thank
[720.5s] you. Uh Pendle Andrew. Andrew.
[723.9s] I think James. James. And
[727.2s] James brother
[729.8s] John. Yes. So those are among the first
[733.0s] five disciples that Jesus had. And
[735.4s] originally these guys actually used to
[737.2s] follow John the Baptist but after John
[739.9s] the Baptist was in prison they had to
[741.8s] find another teacher. So they saw Jesus
[744.0s] that's way they went to him. So you're
[745.8s] going to go into the what do you think
[747.2s] se section Christ was launching a very
[750.6s] new initiative in Israel and I'd like
[752.8s] Pendle to take us through that the
[755.5s] questions in the what do you think
[757.0s] section
[759.2s] what do you think section mhm if you are
[762.0s] going to launch a new mission initiative
[764.9s] calling people to God's kingdom what
[767.5s] kind of ad advertisement will you create
[770.3s] to get people interested
[773.2s] okay
[774.7s] all Right. Probably you can tell us.
[777.3s] Let's say you've been you've been given
[779.7s] um
[782.0s] a task, right, to create a a campaign
[785.5s] for for Jesus to get people into our
[788.2s] church. I'll give this to all our
[790.3s] panelist.
[791.8s] What slogan would you use a catchy
[793.9s] phrase? All right. Like for us in our
[796.2s] church right now, it's I will go for for
[799.5s] like 5 years now. So what would you
[802.1s] choose?
[809.1s] What what slogan could you go for? You
[811.5s] can also think of a song. I'll ask you
[813.7s] guys. Yeah, think of a song as well. And
[815.8s] then if you were to ask for money, a
[819.0s] budget, how much do you think, let's
[821.4s] work in Kenyan shillings, okay? How much
[823.4s] do you think will be enough for you to
[825.7s] get that campaign rolling? Getting
[827.4s] people to church.
[829.4s] The money will be about
[832.6s] Let's say uh 100k. 100k. Okay. That
[837.8s] means you want to reach out to like a
[839.7s] small area maybe. Okay. 100k is her
[842.5s] budget. Uh what kind of song would you
[844.6s] guys choose? You have a song in mind?
[847.0s] You can just tell us or or a slogan like
[850.2s] a title.
[852.2s] Yes. Blessing. Um
[856.2s] one for Christ and Christ for all. Ah
[858.6s] nice nice. One for Christ. One for
[861.4s] Christ and Christ for all. That is a
[863.1s] good one. That's a good slogan. Uh-huh.
[864.7s] What kind of music or what will be the
[866.8s] theme song?
[870.2s] Maybe song number 213.
[873.5s] 213. Yeah. Jesus is coming again. Jesus
[875.6s] is coming again. Ah, good, good, good.
[877.8s] Uh-huh. Jackson, anything you'd like to
[879.9s] add? What would be like a campaign
[881.8s] slogan for you or a song you'd choose or
[884.4s] how much money would you budget?
[887.0s] Um, the song will be
[890.4s] redeemed. Redeemed. Okay. Uh-huh. How
[893.3s] much money will you budget?
[897.3s] 250K. 250K. Very specific number. Okay.
[901.0s] Saha, how much money will you budget for
[903.3s] that?
[905.3s] 427K.
[907.0s] 427. 27. Very specific number. Okay. So,
[910.6s] this is considering
[912.7s] um you have volunteers. Let's say it's
[915.9s] like a oneweek campaign. You have
[917.6s] volunteers. They have to eat. And then
[920.9s] you'll have to like give books to
[922.9s] people. Then people will come who are
[925.0s] sick. So you can like set up a medical
[926.8s] camp, free blood pressure checks. You
[929.4s] guys need blood pressure checks at your
[930.8s] age, but the older folks do, right? So
[933.5s] free blood pressure check, cancer
[935.1s] screening and the like. Yeah. So it's
[937.8s] it's quite something. And to imagine
[939.8s] Jesus did not have a theme song or a
[944.5s] budget. He just went for 12 people and
[948.4s] he ran his mission. And it's because of
[950.5s] that mission that we are here right now.
[952.6s] It's because Jesus chose 12 people that
[954.3s] we have our Bibles. All right. Okay.
[957.3s] Let's move on. Now, we're going to get
[960.2s] to our flashlights. I like to ask Jack
[962.6s] to read our flashlight for us. Just
[964.3s] share the lesson with him.
[967.8s] Our flashlight says, "In training his
[971.1s] disciples, Jesus chose to withdraw from
[973.6s] the confusion of the city to the quiet
[976.7s] fields of the hills as more in harmony
[979.8s] with the lessons of self obnigation. He
[983.5s] desired to teach them. And during his
[985.8s] ministry, he loved to gather people but
[989.1s] the people around him under the blue
[991.7s] heavens on some grassy hillside or on
[995.4s] the beach besides the lake.
[998.3s] He surrounded by the works of his own
[1000.5s] creation. He could turn the thoughts of
[1003.0s] his hearers from the artificial to the
[1005.7s] natural. In the growth and development
[1008.3s] of nature were revealed the principles
[1011.4s] of his kingdom. Mhm. Thank you for that.
[1015.5s] Um there's something about nature.
[1020.2s] I want to ask you guys a question. When
[1022.3s] you were kids, how how many of you used
[1024.1s] to just lie down on the grass and just
[1026.6s] look at the sky and try to to look at
[1028.8s] the clouds and say that clouds will look
[1030.3s] like a like a teddy bear or like a car?
[1033.0s] You've all done that right now. When was
[1035.0s] the last time you did that?
[1038.6s] Like s when's the last time you just
[1040.2s] laid down and just look up in the at the
[1042.5s] sky? Last week. Last week. That's pretty
[1045.7s] recent. Pendo. Uh blessing. Sorry. Last
[1048.5s] year. Last year. Uhhuh. offender.
[1052.1s] Um, during Easter. During Easter, that's
[1054.2s] like a few months ago. Uh-huh. 3 years
[1056.6s] ago. 3 years ago. Yeah. And the older
[1059.2s] you get, trust me, the harder it gets to
[1061.7s] just get time and look at nature. But
[1065.1s] Christ, as we've read in our flashlight,
[1067.5s] Christ took his disciples and taught
[1069.9s] them using nature.
[1072.3s] Elenoid speaks about it in the book
[1074.2s] Desire of Ages chapter 30. But how
[1077.0s] Christ will take his disciples out into
[1079.0s] nature, teach them lessons using trees,
[1082.3s] rocks, um, water and everything else. He
[1086.1s] wanted to teach them that they do not
[1088.3s] need to rely on the things that man has
[1090.6s] put for himself in the cities. That is
[1093.1s] why Christ took them out of the cities.
[1095.3s] So, we're going to go into our story.
[1097.2s] I'd like to ask Saha to just give us a
[1099.7s] summary of what what the story talks
[1101.2s] about. For those who do not have the
[1103.6s] lesson with them, the story is from Luke
[1105.9s] 6:E1 17-31 where I just put you told you
[1108.7s] to put your finger on Saha.
[1111.7s] So this story is basically about the
[1117.5s] when Jesus
[1120.7s] it was on the sermon on the mount. Mhm.
[1123.0s] And
[1127.3s] Jesus was
[1130.0s] basically saying the beatitudes and
[1134.0s] he was
[1135.8s] saying if if the people do certain
[1139.8s] things then certain things will happen
[1141.8s] to them. For example um he said that
[1144.7s] blessed are you who are poor for yours
[1147.4s] is the kingdom of God. Mhm. So
[1151.7s] he continues to say that blessed are you
[1153.8s] who hunger for now you'll be satisfied.
[1157.2s] Mhm. So these verses are just saying
[1162.0s] that people who might have a certain
[1165.3s] like
[1166.8s] a part of them that's going a bit down
[1170.7s] then in the kingdom of heaven then they
[1174.1s] will be elevated. True. Thank you for
[1177.2s] that Saha. That's actually a very um
[1179.5s] good summary of what Christ was talking
[1181.1s] about. And uh Jesus in his story, he
[1184.2s] mostly talked about the people who
[1186.5s] society looked down upon.
[1189.1s] Blessed are those who moan. Blessed are
[1191.1s] the poor. Blessed are the meek. Blessed
[1193.8s] are those who hunger and thirst. People
[1195.9s] who you do not really look into uh look
[1197.8s] at in society. Those are the people
[1200.0s] Christ wanted to elevate in his kingdom.
[1202.6s] And why do you think Jesus did that?
[1206.4s] Jesus had the chance to talk about
[1209.1s] blessed are the rich because God will
[1211.6s] give them more, right? Christ could have
[1214.1s] said that which is also true. But he
[1216.6s] chose to speak about blessed are the
[1218.9s] poor. Why do you think he did that
[1222.0s] blessing? Why do you think Christ chose
[1224.4s] the poor and the hungry and the meek?
[1226.9s] No, not those guys high in society. Um I
[1230.3s] think uh you see the high people they
[1232.8s] they think they have everything. So they
[1236.0s] they believe they do not need anything
[1238.6s] more. But the people who are looked down
[1241.7s] upon on society, they they they want a
[1245.4s] place to belong. And that's what Jesus
[1247.8s] was giving them. He wanted them to feel
[1250.0s] equal to the rest. He wanted them to
[1252.2s] feel loved and cared for. Mhm. I like
[1255.0s] that. I like that. Uh Jack, what are
[1257.8s] your thoughts? Why do you think Jesus
[1259.0s] talked about the people who are lowly in
[1260.8s] society?
[1262.4s] Um so he can show that he values
[1266.2s] everyone and not only the people who
[1268.3s] have made it in life but also the people
[1271.5s] who are not that high in society are
[1275.4s] valued to him. True. True. Yeah. And if
[1278.1s] you actually look at his disciples
[1280.9s] what are some of the professions they
[1282.2s] did? Most of them were fishermen.
[1284.6s] Fishermen are considered uneducated.
[1287.3s] Number one, same level as shepherds.
[1289.5s] uneducated people, very poor, they they
[1292.6s] earned very little, right? So the
[1294.8s] Pharisees looked down upon his
[1296.2s] disciples. Some of the rich disciples
[1298.6s] Jesus had was like Matthew Levi only
[1300.5s] because he was a tax collector and most
[1302.3s] of his wealth was from stealing. Wasn't
[1305.2s] exactly genuinely rich. So Christ
[1307.8s] surrounded himself with a lowly in
[1309.4s] society to reach out to the people who
[1311.4s] had been cast out, make them feel part
[1314.7s] of this new kingdom that is coming up.
[1317.0s] Right? And there's a story that's given
[1319.4s] um in the teachers lesson
[1321.9s] by a pastor. Let me just get his name.
[1324.5s] Uh his name is Pastor Jimmy Chapman.
[1327.8s] So he was giving a story about two
[1329.9s] brothers in uh England back in the I
[1333.0s] think the early 1800s
[1335.3s] and uh they were born to a family called
[1337.3s] the Taylor family. There's the older
[1340.3s] brother. He decided to go into politics,
[1343.8s] became an MP. Then the younger brother
[1346.4s] chose a more of a humble path. He became
[1349.0s] a missionary. Went out to China, went
[1352.2s] out to Africa and all those places that
[1354.4s] people had not heard about the gospel.
[1356.2s] And he's the one who's known his name
[1358.8s] was Hudson Taylor. Now very interesting
[1361.7s] thing is years later when you look at
[1364.5s] the encyclopedia in England, when you
[1366.5s] look for the name of Hudson Taylor,
[1368.2s] that's the missionary, you'll find a
[1370.3s] whole almost half a page talking about
[1372.7s] him. But you look at his brother for his
[1375.9s] brother's name in the same encyclopedia,
[1378.2s] his brother who's a politician, the only
[1380.6s] thing written about him is the brother
[1382.3s] of Hudson Taylor.
[1385.0s] All right? So you might have thought
[1387.2s] because this girl is an MP, popular,
[1390.1s] newspapers know him, King knows him, he
[1393.0s] would have been there would been more to
[1394.9s] him than just a single line. But this
[1398.1s] shows you that even choosing a humble
[1400.2s] path in life, as long as it's with it is
[1403.8s] with God, it'll take you way farther
[1406.7s] than just choosing um to gratify your
[1409.9s] own needs. Okay? And that is the message
[1412.7s] we have for us today.
[1415.2s] Our title is Jesus Calling.
[1418.6s] Christ calls anyone and everyone. He he
[1422.2s] he does not matter if you're poor, if
[1425.6s] you've you've had a very sinful past, if
[1428.2s] you're struggling in your exams in
[1429.7s] school and people are laughing at you.
[1431.5s] Christ is calling. He wants you s to be
[1434.6s] part of his kingdom. Right now, let us
[1437.6s] move on with our lesson.
[1439.8s] And I'd like to ask um Jack
[1443.7s] to read
[1445.7s] the Thursday part of our lesson. The
[1449.4s] Thursday part of our lesson.
[1452.8s] When Jesus chose his disciples, he knew
[1455.4s] their gifts, talents, and weakness. Read
[1458.2s] again about each of the disciples listed
[1460.2s] below. What are some of their
[1462.0s] weaknesses, blind spots, areas in which
[1464.4s] they needed to make changes. H Okay. So,
[1467.4s] let us read about that. So, we'll have
[1469.4s] each person just open one of the verses.
[1472.0s] So, we'll start with you, Jack. You can
[1473.9s] open the book of John chapter 18 verse
[1477.4s] 10. Then we'll have Pendo Mark 3:17.
[1483.5s] We'll have Blessing do John 20:2.
[1487.2s] Then we'll have Saha open the book of
[1489.3s] John 12:5 and 6. Okay. So as you're
[1494.0s] opening, let me just explain something
[1496.2s] again.
[1497.9s] Each of our lesson is usually tied to
[1499.5s] one of the fundamental beliefs. And our
[1501.3s] fundamental belief for this lesson is
[1503.8s] spiritual gifts and ministries. Each
[1507.1s] disciples had different backgrounds.
[1508.7s] That is what we're going to see in the
[1510.0s] verses. And as much as they had their
[1512.1s] own weaknesses, Christ used that for the
[1515.5s] glory of his mission. So we'll start
[1517.3s] with the disciple Peter. That's John
[1520.1s] 18:10. Can you kindly read? Then Simon
[1522.8s] Peter who had a sword drew it and struck
[1525.6s] the high priest servant cutting off his
[1527.4s] right ear. Okay. So what weakness did
[1530.3s] Simon Peter have from that verse?
[1534.3s] I think his weakness was he didn't have
[1537.8s] self-control at a point that he knew his
[1540.6s] friend was going to die. True. Yeah. S
[1543.4s] Peter lacked self-control. All right.
[1545.6s] This was a very solemn time. Christ is
[1547.6s] being arrested. I know emotions are high
[1549.8s] and everything, but he acted rashly.
[1552.2s] Just cut off someone's ear. He didn't
[1554.0s] care. That is Simon Peter. That was his
[1556.2s] weakness. Thank you for that. Then we
[1558.2s] have the two disciples, James and John.
[1560.4s] That's Mark 3:17. Pendle and it and it
[1565.1s] says that James the son of Zebedee and
[1568.3s] John the brother of James
[1571.5s] to whom he gave the name Bon Bon Jazz.
[1576.7s] Mhm. That is sons of thunder. Sons of
[1579.7s] thunder. Now what does thunder do? How
[1583.8s] does thunder feel like when you're just
[1585.3s] chilling in the house all just
[1588.6s] what's the first reaction?
[1592.6s] Uh we're surprised. You're surprised. A
[1594.8s] bit scared as well. So the reason they
[1596.7s] were called Sons of Thunder, these guys
[1598.8s] were terrorists.
[1600.7s] Okay. No, no, like literally bombing
[1602.2s] themselves up or something. But they
[1604.2s] they were they were known for their
[1605.5s] anger issues.
[1607.6s] That is what we get. That was the
[1608.8s] weaknesses of these two brothers, James
[1610.7s] and John. Thanks for that, Pendle. Now
[1612.9s] Thomas, John 20:2. That's blessing.
[1617.6s] And it says, "The other disciples
[1619.7s] therefore said to him, we've seen the
[1622.2s] Lord." So he said to them, "Unless I see
[1625.2s] in his hands the print of the nails and
[1628.2s] put my finger into the print of the
[1630.0s] nails and put my hand into his side, I
[1632.9s] will not believe." And after 8 days, his
[1635.7s] disciples were again inside. The and
[1638.6s] Thomas was with them. Jesus came, the
[1641.8s] doors being shut, and stood in the midst
[1644.3s] and said, "Peace to you." Then he said
[1646.8s] to Thomas, "Reach your finger here and
[1650.1s] look at my hands and reach your hand
[1652.4s] here and put it into my side. Do not be
[1656.4s] unbelieving but believing." Thank you.
[1659.1s] So, what was Thomas's weakness?
[1661.9s] I think he he was doubtful. He was
[1665.0s] doubtful. Yeah. Yeah. That that is it.
[1668.2s] And it's actually a very common phrase
[1670.5s] nowadays. Don't be doubting Thomas. He
[1673.4s] he doubted. He did not believe anything
[1675.4s] until he saw. That is his witness. Now,
[1678.0s] let's see Judas.
[1680.2s] That's from John 12:5 and 6. Yes, sir.
[1683.3s] And it says, why was this fragrant oil
[1686.0s] not sold for 300 dinari and given to the
[1689.9s] poor? This he said not that he cared for
[1694.3s] the poor, but because he was a thief and
[1697.0s] had the money box, and he used to take
[1699.9s] what was put in it. Right? So what was
[1703.0s] Judah's weakness? It was a thief. It was
[1704.9s] a thief. It's plain and simple, right?
[1707.0s] We might think it's greed. It is greed.
[1709.8s] Now um chapter 12 verse 6 as Sah has
[1714.2s] read. Judas was the treasurer for the
[1716.8s] disciples.
[1718.4s] In case there was any money amongst the
[1719.9s] disciples, Judas is the one who kept it.
[1722.6s] And it's surprising this is the same
[1724.1s] person who sold Jesus only 30 30 pieces
[1728.1s] of silver. This guy was greedy number
[1730.6s] one. And he was a thief cuz the Bible
[1732.3s] tells us here he used to take what was
[1734.6s] put in need. This is the equivalent of
[1737.8s] the offering being taken after we've
[1740.0s] collected offering in church taken to
[1741.7s] the back to the by the deacons to to be
[1743.9s] counted after the sermon and then
[1746.2s] someone just decides just like ah they
[1748.3s] won't realize let me just take a bit of
[1750.0s] it. That is what Judas did.
[1753.9s] Now question to us and to the audience.
[1756.3s] If Jesus chose disciples with such
[1758.8s] qualities,
[1760.4s] what makes you think he's going to push
[1762.2s] you out just because you you you took
[1764.9s] your friend's pen in school?
[1768.0s] Do you think Jes will just throw you
[1769.4s] away? No. Right. That is back to what
[1773.9s] the main title of our lesson is about
[1775.8s] today. Jesus is calling. He's calling
[1779.0s] anyone and everyone who hears his voice
[1781.5s] to come to him. Okay, as we finish up
[1784.7s] the lesson,
[1786.5s] like us to just look at the punchlines,
[1791.5s] just look at the punch lines and then I
[1794.2s] just want you to pick a verse that
[1796.8s] speaks to you
[1798.9s] out of the verses that we have there.
[1800.3s] Just pick a verse that speaks to you.
[1803.6s] I'll start from uh this side with Saha.
[1806.4s] Okay. What verse speaks to you? The
[1808.9s] verse that speaks to me is Proverbs
[1811.2s] 22:4. Mhm. Why? You can just read it and
[1814.2s] then just explain why it stands out for
[1816.2s] you. It says, "Humility is the fear of
[1818.2s] the Lord. Its wages are are riches and
[1821.8s] honor and life." Mhm. So, it speaks out
[1825.4s] to me because I also want to be humble
[1827.3s] and
[1828.8s] and I want to live a good life. Yeah.
[1831.8s] It's the only way. Humble thyself in the
[1833.7s] sight of the Lord and he will lift you
[1835.4s] up. And he will lift you up. Thank you,
[1837.1s] Sah. blessing. Um, the one that speaks
[1840.3s] to me the most is Matthew chapter 6
[1842.3s] verse1. It says, "Be careful not to
[1845.0s] practice your righteousness in front of
[1846.7s] others to be seen by them. If you do,
[1849.4s] you will have no reward from your father
[1851.4s] in heaven." So, this verse is
[1853.5s] practically self-explanatory.
[1855.8s] Um, it practically shows you not to show
[1858.4s] off. It's not salvation is personal. So
[1862.1s] if you're holy um you can you can show
[1865.8s] it by helping people but don't don't be
[1868.6s] boastful about
[1870.9s] um
[1873.5s] don't be boastful about your
[1875.4s] righteousness and just be humble and God
[1879.0s] will reward you openly in heaven. Amen.
[1881.7s] Thank you for that. You don't have to
[1882.8s] blog to people that I I pray four or
[1885.0s] five times a day. I've read the Bible
[1886.6s] how many times. Just humble religion.
[1889.7s] Thanks for that, Pendle. Also me,
[1894.0s] Matthew 6:1 stands out for me. Mhm. It
[1897.8s] says, "Take heed that you do not do your
[1900.9s] charitable deeds before men to be seen."
[1903.7s] Mhm. Otherwise, you have no reward in
[1906.9s] you have no reward from your father in
[1908.7s] heaven. Mhm. It reminds me that I should
[1911.8s] only do good to please God, not men.
[1914.4s] Exactly. Um you everything you do on
[1917.4s] earth is just for the audience of one.
[1919.5s] You're not here to please anyone. Only
[1922.2s] only God has to be pleased. Thanks for
[1923.8s] that Pendle. And finally Jack. So the
[1926.6s] verse that speaks to me is Deuteronomy
[1929.3s] 10:12 which says and now Israel what
[1932.6s] does the Lord your God ask for you but
[1934.8s] to fear the Lord your God to walk in
[1937.1s] obedience to him to love him to serve
[1939.4s] the Lord your God with all your heart
[1941.2s] and with all your soul. So it's
[1943.4s] basically telling us that or telling me
[1945.7s] that God has given us everything we need
[1949.1s] and the only thing he wants in return is
[1950.8s] to be praised and he wants also us to be
[1954.0s] obedient to him. All right. Thanks for
[1956.2s] that. Thanks for that. Now just to
[1958.5s] finish up our lesson,
[1961.8s] God calls everyone. God says come as you
[1964.9s] are with your burdens, with everything
[1967.4s] that you have. All that luggage, all
[1969.3s] that feeling that you're the worst
[1970.7s] person on earth, come with it and then
[1973.7s] it's going to make the burden lighter
[1975.2s] for you. Okay? So, just a call to us,
[1979.4s] just a reminder again.
[1981.8s] When you feel that you are not good
[1984.6s] enough for Christ, that's the time he
[1986.7s] really wants you to come to him. When
[1989.4s] you feel like you're in a a failure in
[1990.9s] school, like something has happened and
[1993.0s] you you're never going to recover again
[1994.5s] with exams or anything of the sort.
[1996.4s] Christ. That's the time he wants you.
[1998.6s] Okay, we'll just wrap up our lesson with
[2001.0s] that and I'll read the final quote and
[2003.1s] the further insight. It says,
[2006.0s] "God takes men as they are with the
[2008.3s] human elements in their character and
[2010.2s] trains them for his service through the
[2012.6s] knowledge and practice of the truth
[2014.3s] through the grace of Christ. They may
[2016.4s] become transformed into his image."
[2019.0s] That's from the desire of ages, page
[2021.4s] 294. So it is my prayer that we will
[2025.7s] listen to this call that Christ is
[2027.3s] giving us and that we will answer him
[2031.0s] and just come to him. Jesus is calling.
[2034.0s] Will you listen? Amen. Amen. Thank you
[2037.0s] for joining us. I'd like to ask Justin
[2038.9s] to offer a word of prayer as we close
[2040.2s] up.
[2041.8s] Let's pray. Our dear and heavenly
[2044.2s] father, we thank you for this day. We
[2045.5s] thank you for the gift of life. Oh Lord,
[2047.1s] as we're finishing our lesson, please
[2049.3s] may you help us impact our Please may
[2051.2s] you help it impact our lives, oh Lord.
[2053.2s] And in Jesus name I pray. Amen. Amen.
[2056.0s] Amen.
