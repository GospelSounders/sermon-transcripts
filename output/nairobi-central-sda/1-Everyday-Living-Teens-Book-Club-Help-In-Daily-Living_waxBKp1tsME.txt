FULL TRANSCRIPT:
greetings to you all this is the Teens book club and we'll be reviewing the book help in daily living do you need help in your life as we think through all the things that we go through in our lives there are many challenges that sometimes we face and all of us at some point think that we actually need help in our lives so there's this Gem of a book written by Ellen White a couple of years back and they extracts from the book The Ministry of healing and and there are four specific chapters the first is everyday living the second is living with others the third is developing Christian character and the fourth chapter is pressing towards the mark now if we cover these elements we surely will get some help that is needed in our lives to help me cover these chapters we have the other panelists with me and I'll start the introductions from my immediate right going all the way to my extreme right everyone can introduce themselves hello my name is sair kundi and I'm happy to be here hi my name is Amy andalu hi everyone my name is Brenda Maya thank you and my name is Nik opio and I'll be moderating the discussion for today so before we begin I'd like us to Bow our heads for a word of prayer Our Kind and loving father in Heaven we pray that even as we learn about the help that you're going to give us in our lives I pray that that we may get the help that we need I pray that this message may be an inspiration to any teen and anyone watching to actually understand how we can get help from you please guide us through the lesson for we ask in Jesus name amen amen amen so the first chapter is everyday living I'd like to invite Brenda to actually give us a summary of the chapter then we can go through some of the points in finer detail the brief summary thank you so much ano um chapter one the title of chapter one is everyday living and that really um it really collects everything what this chapter is about it's about our daily life as Christians and how God wishes for us to live as Christians in our everyday life how we act as Christians in where we are in school in work like how we act how it reflects on other people and how uh we we are expected to experience the grace of God for us to be able to reflect it to other people and understand other situations and um there are several themes throughout the whole chapter uh which really have a lot and we'll have time to go through all of it but um I'll just do a short summary on it and I'll I'll read the one of the things that really points out the whole chapter just a few lines so there's an eloquence far more powerful than the eloquence of words in the quiet consistent life of a pure true Christian what a man is has more influence than what he says and that's basically it honestly for this chapter what you are as a Christian how you act in front of people that's a lot more than what you tell people it's like the same um actions are speak louder speak louder than than words and that's what God expects from us he expects us to to act more than we speak so people should know we are children of God by how we act and not how we speak in our daily lives so we'll I'll just uh go straight to S and ask um uh if you could answer first uh the first question and the First theme the power of the word of God yeah how does LG white emphasize the role of the word of God in guiding a person's thoughts actions and decisions throughout the day absolutely first of all thank you so much for taking us to the summary chapter 1 everyday living and so the question is dealing with how the word of God can guide our personal thoughts see I would like to think of the Bible as the foundation for our moral and spiritual life it really offers wisdom for us to use in our daily living and Ellen G white says that the Bible is this guide book right for the Christian and if its precepts are obeyed indeed there would be no occasion for heartb burning or Strife but we also see this in Psalms 119 ver 5 that your word is a lamp unto my feet and a light unto my path we see that in fact the word of God is enlightening us right but also it grants us Clarity okay the idea of sin right sin comes in our thoughts and our thoughts lead to an action our action leads to a habit and eventually that forms our character but the same is true for the word of God if we have the word ingrained into our thoughts that would produce word filled actions and that would produce word filled habits and eventually forming our Christian character I think a ton of Our Generation would know um every single lyric of like rap songs or all these secular music in the same way I think memorizing the scripture allows us to internalize it right and so once we have it in our hearts our actions are going to be inspired by that word and so ultimately the word should guide our thoughts because from our thoughts comes every single part of our being thank you so much that I really agree with you and I wanted to add another verse um just to bring out that of how uh the scriptures offer wisdom to us and God wants us to go to the scriptures look for that wisdom um I'll just read Proverbs 3:5-6 which encourages us the Believers to trust in God's guidance and um to look for direction in the decisions we make in our day-to-day lives I'll just read it really quick Proverbs chapter 3 verse um 5 to6 trust in the Lord with all your heart and lean not on your own understanding in all your ways acknowledge Him and He Shall direct your path if we do as the word says our thoughts our actions they will all be aligned with God's will that's just one thing I I noticed as subira was speaking MH um I'll go straight to question to which is Amy M uh what does uh L white um let me just read it again what does alen White say about the um sorry I just lost it for a minute give me a minute yes it's about prayer yeah that's a question it's about prayer mhm Amy if you could just answer that question um question two on the on the second theme which is uh theme number two pray and communication with God yeah I I can help with a question yeah so Ellen White stresses the importance of constant communication with God so how does prayer not only serve as a way of requesting for help but also as a means of cultivating a closer relationship with him in the daily moments of Life remember we're looking at every daily everyday living so how does prayer help with this okay um a lot of times uh we as Christians go through things that we never expected to go through and we may go through trials we may go through different kinds of problems and I think prayer is extremely important when it comes to essentially giving yourself to God and allowing God to take care of you um prayer is not just a request for help but as a means of um fostering a closed relationship with God and through prayer um believers share their hearts Express gratitude and align their sto and align their stories with or like their Wills with God's Will and then prayer helps us understand God's voice and receive his peace making it an essential part of daily living so um yeah like when we go through things as people um I think it's important to um put yourselves and allow God to guide you so that his plans and what he has in store for you can manifest as well yeah I think that's really really important as well yeah sorry just to add to Amy's point I think we see in James 4:8 that when we draw near to God draw near to us right and we can't deny in our Christian faith that player does prayer does lend causality the idea that if you pray to God in a moment of need and want then God will deliver I think when we're very intimate with weakness we tend to cling to the cross and prayer is an Avenue to share our vulnerability vulnerable moments and for God to actually intercede but an important thing to note that that communication can also cultivate relationship as Amy said yeah and viewing it more as a dialogue that we must read the word to hear what God has to say in response to our prayer thank you so much amen maybe just one more verse first Thessalonians 5:1 17 says you should pray without ceasing yes when you think about that it actually means that prayer should be something that is constant in our life and I normally look at it as communication when I talk to you respond and when you talk to me I respond back yeah so tying in the first and the second points we had the word of God is how God talks to us but through prayer we talk to God so we actually keep the conversation going on between us so it's not a monologue where God is telling us do this do this do this but it's more of a dialogue where God is talking to us as we talk back to him in prayer so that conversation keeps going on back to you br it is it is and honestly everything you've said has really just brought out how I felt about prayer and communication with God MH it's it's something that Christians take very lightly sadly cuz they think that um oh I've sinned too much I can't go before God and talk to him like a friend someone who actually understand me that's a big Mis misconception that God doesn't understand what we're going through that he's too far but he's not all we need to do is reach out he's always there he's in the same spot we the ones who drift away so if we make it a habit a habit sorry every day to reach out to him we would have to feel like we're too far that's something I saw mhm uh the next theme in the book that was personally one of my favorites one one of the hardest to SW for me but personally my favorite was um the choices in our life work God's choices in our life work and um this is something I feel like all Christians need to really really sit down and internalize because it's one thing we fight with God a lot we um from a young age you're like oh I want to be this when I grow up and then you enter High School subjects get harder and you're like do I really want to do that anymore and you really have a I'd like to call it an early life crisis yeah where you don't know what you want to do with your life and you're not sure if what you want to do is what God wants and in this book in this chapter specifically uh we're told how God already knows what is best for us he knows us better than we know ourselves so we need to live give it up to him and let him show us which direction to take sometimes we let life crowd our thoughts and it becomes too loud you can't hear what God is telling you to do with your life and because you believe God wants me to do this in my life like you believe this is my calling you would't you'll tone God out and instead of taking the path he wants for you you'll take the longer route which is usually more painful cuz you will end up on the roote God wants you to be on but usually after a long fight of pain so that was one thing I I really I really saw in this chapter if anyone has anything to add on that I think it is a really deep lesson that we have to let God show us the path we have to let him amen guide us that's one of the biggest things I saw and um in let me just uh in Ecclesiastes 9:10 it says whoever thy hand find whatever thy hand find it to do do it with all thy might for there is no work no device no knowledge no wisdom in the grave which thou goest mhm and this is also very important because usually Christians or people generally put in so much work in what they want to do and it's basic We are following what the Bible says the Bible says whatever your hands find to do do it with all your might all your strength and we do we do that a lot in our lives but without waiting for God's guidance so we put in energy we waste energy in something God has not blessed our hands to do them you see so I think that's a very big a big lesson we have to learn personally personally I have to learn that I have to wait for God to tell me yeah you can do this you can put your energy into this before I do it cuz most of the time I do stuff I put my mind on something and I know I it's I've not been led by the Holy Spirit to do this I'm like I just thought this is good for me instead of thinking what does God think is good for me that one thing I really saw um tiik i' like to just could you elaborate on um the I think the fth theme there's a question on the fifth theme um which I feel like I'd like you to just elaborate for us the question is uh on overcoming Temptations yeah Len G white describes the constant battle with temptation and and what Christians face in daily life and uh what are some of the most common Temptations we encounter in our daily routines and how can we prepare spiritually to overcome them yeah okay um yeah the Bible says in the book of First Peter 5:8 that we need to be sober and be vigilant because our adversary the devil is actually walking about seeking someone whom he may devour if you think about a lion uh if you saw a lion walking I know we' probably panic and try running and Scatter towards every other side because that's actually something that we know may cause us har and in our everyday lives we need to have the recognition that there's another lion a spiritual lion because we wrestle not against flesh and blood like human beings yeah but the principalities and Powers so we have to realize that the devil is constantly seeking to draw us into temptation and I could put it in this way if you look at the story of Job the devil boasts to God about how many Christians he causes to fall so every day he's actually looking for someone who he may lead into sin then say God is that the person who is a Christian is that the person who is going to church every Sabbath is that the person who is a leader in church that is falling there yeah and you know he has this as something to present to God as the people who are not on the right path yeah so temptation is something that we have to accept will have to come to our lives but through reading the word the Bible says in Psalm 19 18:1 Thy word have i hidden in my heart that I may not sin against thee so God expects us to be constantly on watch knowing that the devil seeks to guide us into temptation so tying in the prayer and reading of the word then now we have to also be vigilant because when we don't watch out then we fall into temptation so if you want to overcome then we need to really stick close to God and be prepared for attack don't don't take it as an attack on you but know that it's the circumstance of living in the world actually uh as you were speaking um the story of Jesus being tempted in the wilderness came into mind and actually the first verse of chapter 4 of Matthew says then Jesus was led up by the spirit Into the Wilderness to be tempted by the devil and I feel like Christians take this out of context I love that like oh he was led into temptation like it's not me who took myself there I was led into it I've heard that a lot from a lot of people and I think think it's it's something that we we really need to talk about in uh in the Christian spaces of how yes we can be we can found find ourselves in areas where we can be tempted but sometimes God has to take us through that to strengthen our spirit or like it's like putting um refining glass of refining gold in fire sometimes you have to go through the those fires to strengthen yourself spiritually and um uh we can it it really uh shows how Christians have have have it tough but in a good way cuz Paul um Paul talks about how he he's he's happy to be put in a in a time of of Temptation and to go through all that but that was basically chapter one of help in da daily living everyday living it has a lot we weren't able to cover everything but um I hope what we have gone through will really just motivate you to go and read it on your own do more deep study on it yeah amen amen yes as I've said please take a chance to actually go and read the first chapter of this book and you can follow the book along with us the next chapter we'll be covering is living with others chapter 2 living with others so please join us next time even as we cover chapter 2 I'd like to invite Brenda to give a closing prayer let's bow our heads for a word of prayer Our Father in heaven we come before you this this day we thank you for the breath of life and for your grace and mercy that you show of us every day Lord as we have just finished um this the Deep study we've done on chapter one of your uh of the book help in daily living Lord we want to thank you for the for the messages and for the lessons we have learned on how our lives should reflect yours to other people around us by how we live in our daily lives Lord help give us the strength and the and the and the

TIMESTAMPED TRANSCRIPT:
[0.4s] greetings to you

[4.8s] we'll be reviewing the book help in
[7.1s] daily living do you need help in your
[10.4s] life as we think through all the things
[13.0s] that we go through in our lives there
[14.3s] are many challenges that sometimes we
[16.6s] face and all of us at some point think
[19.2s] that we actually need help in our lives
[22.3s] so there's this Gem of a book written by
[24.6s] Ellen White a couple of years back and
[26.8s] they extracts from the book The Ministry
[29.0s] of healing and and there are four
[30.6s] specific chapters the first is everyday
[33.6s] living the second is living with others
[36.5s] the third is developing Christian
[38.6s] character and the fourth chapter is
[40.8s] pressing towards the mark now if we
[43.5s] cover these elements we surely will get
[46.0s] some help that is needed in our lives to
[49.9s] help me cover these chapters we have the
[53.2s] other panelists with me and I'll start
[55.4s] the introductions from my immediate
[57.1s] right going all the way to my extreme
[59.2s] right everyone can introduce themselves
[61.9s] hello my name is sair kundi and I'm
[64.4s] happy to be here hi my name is Amy
[67.6s] andalu hi everyone my name is Brenda
[69.9s] Maya thank you and my name is Nik opio
[72.8s] and I'll be moderating the discussion
[75.2s] for today so before we begin I'd like us
[77.8s] to Bow our heads for a word of
[80.1s] prayer Our Kind and loving father in
[83.0s] Heaven we pray that even as we learn
[86.0s] about the help that you're going to give
[88.0s] us in our lives I pray that that we may
[91.0s] get the help that we need I pray that
[93.9s] this message may be an inspiration to
[96.2s] any teen and anyone watching to actually
[99.4s] understand how we can get help from you
[102.4s] please guide us through the lesson for
[104.2s] we ask in Jesus name amen amen amen so
[109.0s] the first chapter is everyday living I'd
[111.8s] like to invite Brenda to actually give
[113.6s] us a summary of the chapter then we can
[116.5s] go through some of the points in finer
[119.1s] detail the brief summary thank you so
[121.5s] much ano um chapter one the title of
[125.7s] chapter one is everyday living and that
[128.4s] really um it really collects everything
[130.7s] what this chapter is about it's about
[132.6s] our daily life as Christians and how God
[136.8s] wishes for us to live as Christians in
[138.6s] our everyday life how we act as
[140.8s] Christians in where we are in school in
[143.4s] work like how we act how it reflects on
[146.5s] other people and how uh we we are
[150.3s] expected to experience the grace of God
[153.8s] for us to be able to reflect it to other
[155.9s] people and understand other situations
[159.0s] and um there are several themes
[160.6s] throughout the whole chapter uh which
[163.2s] really have a lot and we'll have time to
[164.6s] go through all of it but um I'll just do
[167.7s] a short summary on it and I'll I'll read
[170.0s] the one of the things that really points
[172.6s] out the whole chapter just a few lines
[175.2s] so there's an eloquence far more
[177.4s] powerful than the eloquence of words in
[179.3s] the quiet consistent life of a pure true
[182.1s] Christian what a man is has more
[184.9s] influence than what he says and that's
[187.4s] basically it honestly for this chapter
[189.7s] what you are as a Christian how you act
[192.2s] in front of people that's a lot more
[194.5s] than what you tell people it's like the
[196.8s] same um actions are speak louder speak
[199.9s] louder than than words and that's what
[202.2s] God expects from us he expects us to to
[204.8s] act more than we speak so people should
[208.0s] know we are children of God by how we
[209.9s] act and not how we speak in our daily
[212.2s] lives so we'll I'll just uh go straight
[214.6s] to S and ask
[216.6s] um uh if you could answer first uh the
[219.6s] first question and the First theme the
[221.1s] power of the word of God yeah how does
[224.4s] LG white emphasize the role of the word
[226.6s] of God in guiding a person's thoughts
[228.7s] actions and decisions throughout the day
[231.8s] absolutely first of all thank you so
[233.4s] much for taking us to the summary
[235.6s] chapter 1 everyday living and so the
[238.4s] question is dealing with how the word of
[240.8s] God can guide our personal thoughts see
[243.4s] I would like to think of the Bible as
[245.8s] the foundation for our moral and
[247.8s] spiritual life it really offers wisdom
[250.8s] for us to use in our daily living and
[254.0s] Ellen G white says that the Bible is
[256.0s] this guide book right for the Christian
[258.8s] and if its precepts are obeyed indeed
[262.4s] there would be no occasion for heartb
[264.3s] burning or Strife but we also see this
[267.6s] in Psalms 119 ver 5 that your word is a
[272.2s] lamp unto my feet and a light unto my
[274.9s] path we see that in fact the word of God
[277.6s] is enlightening us right but also it
[280.6s] grants us
[281.8s] Clarity okay the idea of sin right sin
[285.5s] comes in our thoughts and our thoughts
[287.5s] lead to an action our action leads to a
[290.2s] habit and eventually that forms our
[292.2s] character but the same is true for the
[294.8s] word of God if we have the word
[297.3s] ingrained into our thoughts that would
[299.9s] produce word filled actions and that
[304.0s] would produce word filled habits and
[306.0s] eventually forming our Christian
[308.6s] character I think a ton of Our
[310.5s] Generation would know um every single
[314.0s] lyric of like rap songs or all these
[316.8s] secular music in the same way I think
[319.3s] memorizing the scripture allows us to
[322.0s] internalize it right and so once we have
[324.4s] it in our hearts our actions are going
[327.8s] to be inspired by that word and so
[330.7s] ultimately the word should guide our
[332.9s] thoughts because from our thoughts comes
[335.0s] every single part of our being thank you
[337.7s] so much that I really agree with you and
[340.0s] I wanted to add another verse um just to
[342.3s] bring out that of how uh the scriptures
[346.1s] offer wisdom to us and God wants us to
[348.3s] go to the scriptures look for that
[350.4s] wisdom um I'll just read Proverbs 3:5-6
[353.4s] which encourages us the Believers to
[355.6s] trust in God's guidance and um to look
[359.7s] for direction in the decisions we make
[362.2s] in our day-to-day lives I'll just read
[363.8s] it really quick Proverbs chapter 3 verse
[367.1s] um 5 to6 trust in the Lord with all your
[369.8s] heart and lean not on your own
[371.5s] understanding in all your ways
[373.0s] acknowledge Him and He Shall direct your
[374.9s] path if we do as the word says our
[379.6s] thoughts our actions they will all be
[382.1s] aligned with God's will that's just one
[384.5s] thing I I noticed as subira was speaking
[387.2s] MH um I'll go straight to question to
[390.1s] which is Amy M
[392.7s] uh what does uh L white um let me just
[397.0s] read it again what does alen White say
[398.9s] about
[401.2s] the um sorry I just lost it for a minute
[404.6s] give me a
[405.7s] minute yes it's about prayer yeah that's
[408.5s] a question it's about prayer mhm Amy if
[410.9s] you could just answer that question um
[413.1s] question two on the on the second theme
[415.5s] which is
[417.4s] uh theme number two pray and
[419.6s] communication with God yeah I I can help
[422.5s] with a question yeah so Ellen White
[424.8s] stresses the importance of constant
[427.0s] communication with God so how does
[429.8s] prayer not only serve as a way of
[431.5s] requesting for help but also as a means
[434.2s] of cultivating a closer relationship
[437.0s] with him in the daily moments of Life
[439.6s] remember we're looking at every daily
[441.6s] everyday living so how does prayer help
[443.8s] with this okay
[446.0s] um a lot of times uh we as Christians go
[450.7s] through things that we never expected to
[453.0s] go through and we may go through trials
[457.0s] we may go through different kinds of
[459.1s] problems and I think prayer is extremely
[461.5s] important when it comes
[464.7s] to essentially giving yourself to God
[467.8s] and allowing God to take care of you um
[471.1s] prayer is not just a request for help
[473.2s] but as a means of um fostering a closed
[476.0s] relationship with God and through prayer
[478.7s] um believers share their hearts Express
[481.9s] gratitude and align their sto and align
[485.9s] their stories with or like their Wills
[488.5s] with God's Will and then prayer helps us
[492.7s] understand God's voice and receive his
[495.8s] peace making it an essential part of
[498.0s] daily living so
[501.0s] um yeah like when we go through things
[505.3s] as people um I think it's important to
[508.6s] um put yourselves
[510.0s] and allow God to guide you so that his
[513.3s] plans and what he has in store for you
[517.0s] can manifest as well yeah I think that's
[519.5s] really really important as well yeah
[521.9s] sorry just to add to Amy's point I think
[524.1s] we see in James 4:8 that when we draw
[526.6s] near to God draw near to us right and we
[531.0s] can't deny in our Christian faith that
[532.9s] player does prayer does lend causality
[536.8s] the idea that if you pray to God in a
[539.6s] moment of need and want then God will
[542.8s] deliver I think when we're very intimate
[545.4s] with weakness we tend to cling to the
[547.7s] cross and prayer is an Avenue to share
[551.1s] our vulnerability vulnerable moments and
[553.8s] for God to actually intercede but an
[556.6s] important thing to note that that
[558.5s] communication can also cultivate
[560.4s] relationship as Amy said yeah and
[562.4s] viewing it more as a dialogue that we
[565.1s] must read the word to hear what God has
[567.3s] to say in response to our prayer
[570.1s] thank you so much amen maybe just one
[571.9s] more verse first Thessalonians 5:1 17
[575.6s] says you should pray without ceasing yes
[578.8s] when you think about that it actually
[580.4s] means that prayer should be something
[582.2s] that is constant in our life and I
[584.7s] normally look at it as communication
[587.2s] when I talk to you respond and when you
[589.6s] talk to me I respond back yeah so tying
[592.0s] in the first and the second points we
[594.3s] had the word of God is how God talks to
[597.4s] us but through prayer we talk to God so
[600.8s] we actually keep the conversation going
[603.6s] on between us so it's not a monologue
[606.5s] where God is telling us do this do this
[608.8s] do this but it's more of a dialogue
[611.2s] where God is talking to us as we talk
[613.4s] back to him in prayer so that
[615.8s] conversation keeps going on back to you
[618.8s] br it is it is and honestly everything
[622.2s] you've said has really just brought out
[624.8s] how I felt about prayer and
[626.9s] communication with God MH it's
[629.9s] it's something that Christians take very
[631.6s] lightly sadly cuz they think that um oh
[635.6s] I've sinned too much I can't go before
[637.9s] God and talk to him like a friend
[639.9s] someone who actually understand me
[641.3s] that's a big Mis misconception that God
[644.0s] doesn't understand what we're going
[645.4s] through that he's too far but he's not
[648.0s] all we need to do is reach out he's
[650.8s] always there he's in the same spot we
[652.2s] the ones who drift away so if we make it
[655.6s] a habit a habit sorry every day to reach
[658.8s] out to him
[660.0s] we would have to feel like we're too far
[662.8s] that's something I saw mhm uh the next
[665.8s] theme in the book that was personally
[668.1s] one of my favorites one one of the
[669.3s] hardest to SW for me but personally my
[671.2s] favorite was um the choices in our life
[673.8s] work God's choices in our life work and
[677.2s] um this is something I feel like all
[679.5s] Christians need to really really sit
[682.4s] down and internalize because it's one
[684.7s] thing we fight with God a lot we um from
[689.4s] a young age you're like oh I want to be
[691.0s] this when I grow up and then you enter
[692.8s] High School subjects get harder and
[694.4s] you're like do I really want to do that
[695.9s] anymore and you really have a I'd like
[699.1s] to call it an early life crisis yeah
[702.0s] where you don't know what you want to do
[703.3s] with your life and you're not sure if
[706.1s] what you want to do is what God wants
[708.1s] and in this book in this chapter
[709.9s] specifically uh we're told how God
[713.4s] already knows what is best for us he
[716.5s] knows us better than we know ourselves
[718.4s] so we need to live give it up to him and
[721.4s] let him show us which direction to take
[723.7s] sometimes we let life crowd our thoughts
[725.9s] and it becomes too loud you can't hear
[727.3s] what God is telling you to do with your
[728.7s] life and because you believe God wants
[731.3s] me to do this in my life like you
[732.8s] believe this is my calling you would't
[735.1s] you'll tone God out and instead of
[737.3s] taking the path he wants for you you'll
[739.2s] take the longer route which is usually
[741.4s] more painful cuz you will end up on the
[743.4s] roote God wants you to be on but usually
[745.8s] after a long fight of pain so that was
[748.8s] one thing I I really I really saw in
[751.8s] this chapter if anyone has anything to
[753.2s] add on that I think it is a really deep
[755.3s] lesson that we have to let God show us
[757.7s] the path we have to let him amen guide
[760.5s] us that's one of the biggest things I
[762.3s] saw and um in let me just uh in
[766.1s] Ecclesiastes
[767.4s] 9:10 it says whoever thy hand find
[770.3s] whatever thy hand find it to do do it
[772.5s] with all thy might for there is no work
[774.6s] no device no knowledge no wisdom in the
[777.5s] grave which thou goest mhm and this is
[780.5s] also very important
[782.2s] because usually Christians or people
[785.2s] generally put in so much work in what
[788.0s] they want to do and it's basic We are
[790.7s] following what the Bible says the Bible
[792.3s] says whatever your hands find to do do
[794.0s] it with all your might all your strength
[796.2s] and we do we do that a lot in our lives
[798.8s] but without waiting for God's guidance
[801.6s] so we put in energy we waste energy in
[803.9s] something God has not blessed our hands
[806.0s] to do them you see so I think that's a
[808.3s] very big a big lesson we have to learn
[810.7s] personally personally I have to learn
[812.1s] that I have to wait for God to tell me
[814.7s] yeah you can do this you can put your
[815.9s] energy into this before I do it cuz most
[818.2s] of the time I do stuff I put my mind on
[820.9s] something and I know I it's I've not
[823.4s] been led by the Holy Spirit to do this
[825.4s] I'm like I just thought this is good for
[827.1s] me instead of thinking what does God
[828.8s] think is good for me that one thing I
[831.1s] really saw um tiik i' like to just could
[835.0s] you elaborate on um the I think the fth
[839.3s] theme there's a question on the fifth
[841.0s] theme um which I feel like I'd like you
[844.8s] to just elaborate for us the question is
[849.2s] uh on overcoming Temptations yeah Len G
[853.6s] white describes the constant battle with
[855.7s] temptation and and what Christians face
[858.3s] in daily life and uh what are some of
[860.8s] the most common Temptations we encounter
[862.7s] in our daily routines and how can we
[864.4s] prepare spiritually to overcome them
[867.0s] yeah okay um yeah the Bible says in the
[870.7s] book of First Peter
[872.7s] 5:8 that we need to be sober and be
[875.7s] vigilant because our adversary the devil
[878.7s] is actually walking about seeking
[881.5s] someone whom he may devour if you think
[884.2s] about a lion uh if you saw a lion
[887.3s] walking I know we' probably panic and
[889.7s] try running and Scatter towards every
[892.4s] other side because that's actually
[895.0s] something that we know may cause us har
[897.7s] and in our everyday lives we need to
[900.4s] have the recognition that there's
[902.6s] another lion a spiritual lion because we
[905.0s] wrestle not against flesh and blood like
[907.5s] human beings yeah but the principalities
[909.6s] and Powers so we have to realize that
[912.2s] the devil is constantly seeking to draw
[915.4s] us into temptation and I could put it in
[918.6s] this way if you look at the story of
[920.8s] Job the devil boasts to God about how
[925.5s] many Christians he causes to fall so
[929.0s] every day he's actually looking for
[930.9s] someone who he may lead into sin then
[933.8s] say God is that the person who is a
[936.6s] Christian is that the person who is
[938.5s] going to church every Sabbath is that
[940.9s] the person who is a leader in church
[942.8s] that is falling there yeah and you know
[944.8s] he has this as something to present to
[946.7s] God as the people who are not on the
[949.0s] right path yeah so temptation is
[951.1s] something that we have to accept will
[953.2s] have to come to our lives but through
[956.3s] reading the word the Bible says in Psalm
[958.7s] 19 18:1 Thy word have i hidden in my
[961.7s] heart that I may not sin against thee so
[965.5s] God expects us to be constantly on watch
[968.8s] knowing that the devil seeks to guide us
[970.8s] into temptation so tying in the prayer
[974.0s] and reading of the word then now we have
[976.7s] to also be vigilant because when we
[979.1s] don't watch out then we fall into
[981.8s] temptation so if you want to overcome
[984.2s] then we need to really stick close to
[986.8s] God and be prepared for attack don't
[988.9s] don't take it as an attack on you but
[991.1s] know that it's the circumstance of
[992.8s] living in the world actually uh as you
[995.3s] were speaking um the story of Jesus
[997.7s] being tempted in the wilderness came
[999.3s] into mind and actually the first verse
[1001.8s] of chapter 4 of Matthew says then Jesus
[1004.0s] was led up by the spirit Into the
[1005.4s] Wilderness to be tempted by the devil
[1008.1s] and I feel like Christians take this out
[1009.8s] of context I love that like oh he was
[1011.6s] led into temptation like it's not me who
[1014.5s] took myself there I was led into it I've
[1016.4s] heard that a lot from a lot of people
[1018.5s] and I think think it's it's something
[1020.0s] that we we really need to talk about in
[1022.7s] uh in the Christian spaces of how yes we
[1026.2s] can be we can found find ourselves in
[1028.6s] areas where we can be tempted but
[1030.4s] sometimes God has to take us through
[1032.6s] that to strengthen our spirit or like
[1034.7s] it's like putting um refining glass of
[1037.9s] refining gold in fire sometimes you have
[1040.0s] to go through the those fires to
[1041.8s] strengthen yourself spiritually and
[1045.5s] um uh we can it it really uh shows how
[1049.5s] Christians have have have it tough but
[1052.1s] in a good way cuz Paul um Paul talks
[1055.1s] about how he he's he's happy to be put
[1058.4s] in a in a time of of Temptation and to
[1061.2s] go through all that but that was
[1063.9s] basically chapter one of help in da
[1066.6s] daily living everyday living it has a
[1069.1s] lot we weren't able to cover everything
[1071.4s] but um I hope what we have gone through
