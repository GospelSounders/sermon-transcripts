FULL TRANSCRIPT:
praise the Lord Church um those of you seated in the Pew you should see what I'm seeing here that we are almost full even at the balcony glory to God may I ask you to wave to me please let's wave to each other glory to God am happy New Year happy New Year happy new 2025 thank you so much I as I stand here I've been moved by the testimonies that um have been shared by our sisters it's unfortunate that would not have a brother uh I recognize also that uh even those who gave their testimonies online unless I am corrected seemingly all ladies do we have some men how many one thank you for saving us uh from this Hallelujah um this is a new year ENT when we gather as we do it's actually a moment of reflection it's also a moment to look forward with hope and to commit uh the year that would not know what it holds for us in the hands of him who is able to keep us and give us Victory Allelujah and um just before we Dev into the message which has been shared widely um as I try and you know put together the three encounters from three different or maybe two mountains that are one we will go into that but actually it is it's it's my the thoughts that the Lord has placed in my heart as in my heart as I went through it I I just want to request us to just think through even as we prepare to ask the Lord to be with us through the prayer request that you are writing it because we'll have a moment of prayer I request that we read a few verses on prayer because we are here actually to pray and uh thank you so much asth and uh my mom and even uh sister Nora my mom uh Mrs Kenya thank you so much that those are beautiful wonderful uh testimonies Psalms 8 verse1 17 Psalms 63 verse1 and 2 in Psalms chapter 24 verse 5 and 6 if it is projected the better Psalms 8:17 uh communication if you can help project that it will be great I don't know where I missed this on in Psalms 8 it appears I I I missed writing something um let me see no I think it is not 817 let's let's do 63 verse1 and two Psalms 63 verse say 1 and two yes it says so God you are my God early will I Seek You My Soul thirst for you My Flesh Longs for you in a dry and thirsty land where there's no water so I have looked for you in the sanctuary to see your power and your glory Allelujah and so early in the year actually a few hours after the beginning of the day in the morning we are here and I believe the language of our hearts As We Gather is that we are seeking the Lord early early in the year we are thirsting for him our flesh is longing for for him and here as we read this is saying I am seeking you in the sanctuary and that is why we are here and those who are following this is our heart's desire maybe we are separated by distance uh by the fact that some of us traveled to various places for vacation and to be with family oh you are far from this Homeland you are in another country or knowing that we have this program at Nairobi Central every year you have chosen to be part of this worship let's join together with the psalmist to say Lord we are seeking you early early today early in the year so that we can witness God's glory glory and Power in the sanctuary and in our own secret places where we call upon him where we have a moment with him to ask him to intervene in whatever we ought or we need him to intervene in and Psalms 24 vers 5 uh to 6 this is an interesting chapter when you combine it with chapter 20 22 and 23 you will realize that this is a it it is an Ascension it is a stage Jesus of the Cross during crucifixion Jesus uh during burial and Resurrection in chapter 23 and Jesus in his Ascension and Resurrection this is an song of a send it brings the thoughts and lift us up and then here when the question and when when the Lord declares that the the the Earth is the Lord's and all its fullness the world and those who dwell therein and then as the question who may Ascend to the heel of the Lord who may stand in the Holy place then the answer comes and among the reason for those who will stand in the Holy place of the Lord those who are sent to the Holy Hill to Worship the Lord this is said of them he shall re receive a blessing from the Lord and righteousness from the god of his salvation and then this is the description of those who Ascend to the holy heill of the Lord those who will be translated and those who will be resurrected in the newness of the bodies in the twinkling of an eye this is what is saying that for this is Jacob the generation of those who seek Him who seek for your face friends I don't know why the psalmist uses the name Jacob when Jacob's name had been changed to Israel but you can tell from this that the Lord recognizes our struggle Even in our Jacob situations when we try to make things right by our own strength when we try to get the blessings of the Lord either by scheming or by trying to trick the Lord still recognizes that we are seeking His blessings and those who will Ascend on the Holy Mountain of the Lord although they retain their own characters and personalities yet when we seek the Lord in this genuiness of who we are and what we have done the Lord shall welcome us into his holy mountain may the Lord of Grace who has sin us through the various mistakes that we have made in his grace Crown us and give us his righteousness because it is only the Lord's righteousness that matters in our life may we yield to him and seek Him Al as we have come come this new year prayer time praise the Lord and so now my friend let me take your mind and thoughts to three mountain peaks and counters and I think there is suspense in all of these three encounters There's Hope and there's d Duty for us to engage in shall we pray Eternal gracious father I stand before your [Music] congregation your sons and daughters who are seeking your face early who am I to say anything unless it is that which you have put in my heart and that that which you continue to guide my thoughts to speak to your church to this Congregation of your servants Lord as imperfect as we are as weak and knowing that we are just but thst dust yet Lord come to you even in a year that might have proved difficult we turn to you and we know you will speak to our situations and when you speak your word creates and so Lord speak to us in these thoughts and let us indeed be at these Mountain pecks to view view where we have come from and to see forward Yonder to where you are leading us may your grace be sufficient touch my lips touch my brain cells let your word flow into the thoughts and the spirit of each and everyone who is listening and following this program bless us Lord in Jesus name we pray amen the three mountains my friend and none other than the mountain of Nabor which is bisa Mount camel and one of the mountains in Jerusalem which near Jerusalem where Jesus ascended with his disciples I request that we read together from Deuteronomy chapter 34 Deuteronomy chapter 34 if it can be projected the better in the new King James version you can open in your Bible so that we read together this story that is not quite so tastful to our ears as human beings but um it is indeed something that um we all know it can happen any time verse 1 to 4 then Moses went up to the plains of Moab to mount nebor to the top of pisca which is a cross from J Jericho the Lord showed him all the land of Gilead as far as Dan all naftali and the land of Ephraim and Manus all the land of Judah as far as the Western sea the South and the plain of the valley of Jericho the city of the palm trees as far as Zar then the Lord say to him this is the land of which I swore to give Abraham Isaac and Jacob saying I will give it to your descendants I have caused you to see it with your eyes eyes but you shall not cross over there it seems from a CL a glance that this is a sad ending for a giant for a man who would have died being killed in his birth for a man who all his life though living in a [Music] corrupt Palace where everything was free but is early upbringing by a mother whose sister as if she could get a maid to take care of this by Divine Arrangements this man has grown and his lowly status having been born to a slave couple growing up in that not quite certain of his identity having spent the least time with his mother and father he had to be taken away but although he lived in that corrupt Palace where all the idols were there and Sorcerers and all these magicians yet the few years with the mother prepared him to be a man of Faith this goes to tell us that it is not how long we spend with those we train but what quality and intensity we give and how much prayer we make for them that matters mothers in this Hall and those who are hoping to be mothers to keep the generations of those who trust in God here is the the secret and we see this man having spent his life now in his we hours of his life God is asking him to go to a mountain and he's telling him look at what I promised Abraham Isaac and Jacob look at this land and it is said it was in a clockwise view in this view from this pivotal area this man who had seen it all who had himself felt the guilt of killing a man who had himself run away for his life into the desert having to fight and to take care of damp animals as he stray from the palace he went L this man had seen it all and now the Lord is asking him to go to a mountain and upon that mountain the Lord is asking him to see but he will not cross over to enjoy the fruits for which he had encouraged so many pleaded with God even asking God if you are not going to forgive these people I'd rather die take my life as an intercessor this servant of the Lord was a representative of the people who had sin who had rebelled who had murmured yet he was not ready to give up on them this man of God this Moses stands High among Servants of the Lord as a prophet because he viewed what it would be if God God's people were to die all of them in the desert would it be anything and so he said God you cannot promise that you will make me a great name at the expense of the people you have you have called me to lead no I'm not ready answer this man who was called saved from real danger by miraculous ways this man who had the least time to spend with family who grew up in the most corrupt environment yet because of the lessons taught by the mother in his early years he did not forget his roots he stood up and he knew he had a duty to perform this man grew up and being moved by the prayers of his mother and the family he grew up to be the giant of faith in Israel men and women of the Lord as we seek the Lord early this year let us look at this story for what it is and know that Giants of Faith at times are given leave and it comes a moment when the failures and the mistakes of those giants of Faith have to be accounted for our God is a god of judgment but he's a God who is gracious and merciful he forgives our sins and he knows that we are but dust but he allows us to view the promises he has made for us even if we have in this Loft view to see what awaits those Sons and Daughters of faith when we have done our part we are asked to move on this year 2025 May Mark a new transition in your life a Servants of the Lord serving for the last two years it may mean handing over the mantle to another it may mean you are being transferred you are being moved from the place you had gotten used to to a new area area whatever it is you may view what you have walked for you may not be there to guide it but allow the Lord to give you that view all the same Hallelujah and so Mount neor which form part of the summit of several mountains several Hills that stood within a valley within the plains of Moab this Summit Rises up and there the sea there's there's Jordan River this man of God had brought the children of Israel to this point the Lord is asking him that go up to mount Nabor and there you'll not only view the promised land but you will also die look at chapter 3 to get how this remember rembrance reminders of what God had done to the children of Israel because Deuteronomy means repeating the commands of the Lord again as this man rehearsed as he had known that he would not cross over the entire book is a careful rehearsal of what God required of his people and so chapter 34 is a culmination of a story that began in chapter 3 and you can see this my friend that in chapter 3 vers 23 to 29 this is what we find in this place so that we can get the clear perspective and know how intense this was and yet this man of God by 34 chapter had already come to terms with the fact that he would not be crossing over listen it says then I pleaded with the Lord at that time saying oh Lord God you have begun to show your servant your greatness and your Mighty hand for what a God is there in heaven or on Earth who can do anything like your works and your Mighty Deeds I pray let me cross over and see the good land beyond the Jordan those pleasant mountains and Lebanon but the Lord was angry with me on your account and would not listen to me so the Lord said to me enough of that speak no more to me of this matter go up to the top of Pisa and lift your eyes toward the west the North and the South and the East behold it with your eyes for you shall not cross over this Jordan but command Joshua and encourage him and strengthen him for he shall go over before these people and he shall cause them to inherit the land which you will see so we stayed in the valley opposite Beth beor what a story think of all the thoughts that ran through Moses that for 31 verses or chapters he had to always come to terms with the fact that his duty was to prepare to hand over that his duty was to prepare the people whom he had been called to lead so that they would know how to go possess the promised land and live in that land with the blessings of the Lord oh how it would be important and what blessing it would be for each one of us to know that even if we may be having thoughts and hopes of living beyond 100 but our very important duty is to prepare to hand over that in this this giant of Faith himself knew that in as much as he had been granted the promises and the request that he made even to see the glory of the Lord this man who conversed with God from time to time those so honored his duty was not for him to complete the Journey of the children of Israel to Canaan but to prepare and write what he wrote so that we too knowing that at times we may not see our children marry and have children and raise grandchildren and great grandchildren yet the faithful Lord will give us a view of the Promised Land and so this great God whom we serve in 2024 and years that have gone by we have witnessed both this happening to us closely losing those whom we thought that would lead us morning to even see those our loved ones whom we thought we would do so much for them yet we had to bury them this is life and the early we come to terms with God's Authority his absolute wisdom and power the better for you to stand up and to be content with whatever he chooses to do with your life and how long he may keep you alive in this world it is important for us therefore to be on this mountain and like Moses to know Ally so that by the 31 chapters of our life we can prepare those who we need to prepare for eternity and prepare ourself to meet him and even to have a better view of Eternity this is Mount neor from this pick life in its reality confronts the man of faith and any Bible stud let it sober us so that in as much as we can make plans for a thousand years for the security of our family members Those whom we love let us first and foremost recount again the Comm Commandments of the Lord to them the next mountain is the summon of our youngsters and I thank the Lord for the Young Mat Toya thank you so much and the uh children teacher who prepared this praise the Lord what have we been told to do move go forward what was it just just keep going this Elijah man growing up in the northern kingdom 10 King 10 tribes of Israel who chose to Rebel who chose to follow an alternative leader and they went to the north and they did want they not want to have anything to do with the South not even to Worship in Jerusalem as they ought to have done they started their own Sanctuary place of worship in the northern part of this Kingdom 10 of them a great multitude of the children of Israel in fact they were called the Kingdom of Israel the southern one was called the kingdom of Judah in this division at this moment when jobah their King brought a new religion they who had been taken to go into the promised land in Canaan were taken back spiritually to Egypt by the king after finding the support of Egypt he was told the condition upon which we will support you is that you take with you and give your people our religion donations and support that you get may not be so free Hello be careful from whom you receive any help ladies and gentlemen I announce to you that if you don't stand and seek help in the house of the Lord and seek help individually that the Lord blesses you and whoever he brings he will not be an influence to lead you to Egypt then be careful what you receive and from whom you receive it it was Elijah who had to contend with a national a national religion that was supported by the mighty and the resources from the palace this man was the only one who endangered his life and confronted Jezebel at the night of this confusion he prayed to God that maybe because these people were eating to their fool maybe because these people were having it good Lord he prayed I pray that let no rain come for three and a half years so that they would be femine and so that the false prophets and magicians would fail to bring any prosperity and so that these people would seek the Lord again in the land of promise the land the beautiful land that that Moses pleaded that he would go those who went into this good goodly land this beautiful land flowing with milk and honey them themselves forgot the commands that Moses gave them they forgot their Duty they forgot that for them to enjoy God God's blessings they had to be true and faithful to God and so in our lives God may have to strike the land with famine in order for I Elijah to stand and say now before you receive the rain let us choose and see who among Bal and God is the true God and the second Mountain which is called camel the Lord asked the prophet to gather the entire nation they told them come and he said bring the leaders and don't come along bring the false prophets and the priests 850 of them well kept provided they were budging from the the the the palace Provisions that they were given they were stronger than this lone man who had to eat from a Widow's last meal this man who did not have proper water system he drank from the Brooks which dried and he had to be fed by Ravens for a whole year [Music] here this fugitive who was being followed yet at this pivotal moment the Lord asked him to come to the mountain and the Lord said yes I'm going to give rain but before rain comes reformation and repentance must be the beginning of the blessings of the Lord and so upon this mountain the prophet challenged and said come and we will meet and bring those prophets if that the Lord be B let him be B and if the Lord be the Lord God the creator of heaven then he will show by accepting the sin offering and consuming it hallelujah oh how beautiful it would be for us to be upon this mountain today so that whatever our life has been in the past we can come to this mountain and say yes let the Lord who forgive accept the sin offering our repentance and our desire for reformation so that we can have the reign of the Holy Spirit Hallelujah so this is the mountain where God called these people and I want you to look at the wording in this in chapter 18 of the First Kings let's read that that so that we conclude at the third mountain and you will see the connection very very soon are you there communication yes so after he had asked the false prophets and the priests to take hold of their bull slau tight and place it upon their Altar and then pray for fire to come down for from the entire morning all the way to 3 they had prayed they had cut themselves they had tried all sorts of magic but it didn't work let let us turn to God let us avoid any magic or anything that we have tried that it would work and which has not worked so far it is time to repent it is time to come to mount camel Hallelujah and so upon this mountain my brother we read this that and it came to pass at the time of the offering of the evening sacrifice that Elijah the prophet came near and said Lord God of Abraham Isaac and Israel let it be known this day that you are God in Israel and I am your servant and that I have done all these things at your word hear me oh Lord hear me that these people may know that you are the Lord God and that you have turned their hearts back to you again Hallelujah and so this second Mountain then encounter that was there was not only for the prophet but it was for the entire nation to be turned to God may we begin this year by reviewing what happened upon these mountains and from this mountain pics let us chart a away and the right way to leave our life preparing for eternity and prepar car in for enjoyment of the blessings of God hallelujah let me ask you a question between the sin sacrifice that was put at the altar and the children of Israel who had worshiped Idols who had turn their hearts to Egypt who was supposed to receive the fire from heaven the sacrifice the innocent animal the sin offering or was it the people hello answer me who were the who deserved the fire the consuming fire to fall on them the people but look at God's grace that after stopping the rains for three and a half years he was preparing these people for this moment this decisive moment but even in that decisive moment when they were standing before two decisions the Lord God had Grace and his fire fell not on the people but the fire fell on the sacrifice Christ has come as our sin sacrifice and the penalty of our sin has fell on him so that we can be turned to God and worship God in truth and spirit so that his holy spirit the reign of his holy spirit can fall on us oh that this year as you come to seek the Lord early you may know that even as you pray for all the the prayer request let the first prayer request be that the Lord would deal with your sin and that he would accept and strengthen you to reform where you need to reform and let the Showers of Blessings fall and so now quickly to our final Mountain in chapter 17 of Matthew Matthew 17 Matthew chapter 17 we will [Music] read vers 1 to8 I'll read quickly then make a few comments and then we conclude now after 6 days Jesus Took Peter James and John his brother LED them up on a high mountain by themselves and he was transfigured before them his face Shone like the sun and his clothes became as white as the light light and behold Moses and Elijah appeared to them talking with him then Peter answered and said to Jesus Lord it is good for us to be here if you wish let us make here three Tabernacles one for you one for Moses and one for Elijah while he was still speaking Behold a bright Cloud overshadowed them and suddenly a voice came out of the cloud saying this is my beloved Son in whom I am well pleased hear him and when he the disciples had it they fell on their faces and were greatly afraid but Jesus came and touched them and said arise and do not be afraid when they had lifted up their eyes they saw no one but Jesus only Hallelujah they saw no one but who Jesus only upon this man Mountain Jesus had asked them in chapter 16 which is the place where he had challenged them vers vers 14 to 16 Jesus actually 13- 16 Jesus had taken them to a place where demons or Spirits were sought in this place where it had been dedicated for people to go and find some power which was not according to the power of Heaven Jesus decided to take his disciples there and state whom do you think the Lord is personally in your life determine that this year even as you come to pray for the blessing of the year for the guidance of the Lord that you will declare the Lord to be the Son of God who came to take away our sins and to give us the good blessings of the reward and the blessing of the holy spirit in our life Hallelujah and so my friend Upon This Mountain after Jesus had challenged them and this is Peter who said you are the Son of God the Messiah and he said blessed are you Simon Peter upon this statement upon the fact that I have come to die for the sins of men I will build my church on this rock this rock of what God has done this rock with which for 40 years the children of Israel drank from this rock which because of the Temptation the the muring and the accusation of the children of Israel Moses failed to enter [Music] Canan this rock who had walked and the one who indeed turn the hearts of the entire 10 Nation 10 tribes back to God upon Mount camel this Jesus who became the rock Upon This Rock of him coming in humanity the church has been built so that we can witness the grace of God the Emmanuel of our life God With Us Upon This Mountain this doubting group had to behold the glory of God and Jesus was transfigured and when this happened praise God that Elijah who was ready to die out of disappointment because of Jezebel and said let me die was not left to die but he was translated thank God that Moses who was told enough of this don't talk to me on this matter of you Crossing to Jordan I have better plans for you that when he was denied to cross over to Jordan though he died for a short while he was resurrected and he was upon this mountain of transfiguration with Jesus and Elijah and thank God for the three Witnesses Peter John and James friends in as many as we have chosen to follow and love the Lord let us serve the Lord it doesn't matter how many relatives we have and what they do for the Lord so long as their hearts are right to God God does not mind about us all serving him there's no nepotism in serving the lord hello praise the Lord and so don't excuse yourself serve the Lord with all the dedication and let this year be the year where we in our families may be saved James and his John and his brother James were there to witness the Transfiguration of Christ Hallelujah this mountain is where we are all called to and thank the Lord that even Moses who was told you will not cross the suspense is fulfilled he did not lose anything in fact he gained more Hallelujah when we dedicate ourself to the Lord it is not how many accolades it is not whatever is said about what we do but it is with what SP rwe it he was humble he assigned himself to the will of God and the will of God was better than he had hoped for praise the Lord and so there's hope my brother there's joy for you that your loved one whom you buried because of Christ coming and building his church upon the rock of his coming as the sacrifice the sin offering we can look forward with hope to seeing not only Jesus transfigured but also our loved ones being transformed being chained in a twinkling of an eye so that the troubles we go through by faith in the Lord by standing upon these three mountain peaks we can have a complete view of life and we can Worship the Lord all the same whatever idolatry whatever corruption we may have to face stand firm like Elijah contend and challenge youever so that whatever Idols demons and false prophet may they fall upon the mountain of camel Hallelujah and whatever you have to face even if it is death even your wrong death by whatever may bring it be content that the Lord has led you so far Hallelujah and pass on the Baton of faith in your family friend we have come to the beginning of this year yes our life may be full of suspense as we pray as we ride our prayer request and as we hope all this that it will come to pass even in the suspense and in the hope that we have that the Lord will do this he may keep us in suspense but he's a true and faithful God he in all this is reminding us that we have a duty as we pray as we expect as we hope down the valley there's work for us and down the valley praise the Lord see the climax of this when Jesus after Transfiguration and coming down with the three they found the other disciples who had not ascended to the mountain discussing and giving giving reasons as to why the demon possessed boy may have had demons it could be the parents could be could be this and that because they tried to remove the demon and it was stubble it only took those who had been to the mountain peak and Jesus himself to cast The Demon with Jesus in The Vessel we can smile at the storm with Jesus in The Vessel and in the company of the one who has been transformed we can come down to the valley and do the duty and it will be done that is why my friend in chapter 17 Jesus concluded by saying this look at verse 17 and to 19 it says this that um 17 to19 then Jesus answered and said all faithless and perverse generation how long shall I be with you how long shall I bear with you bring him here to me and Jesus rebuked the demon and it came out of him and the child was was cured from that very hour then the disciples came to Jesus privately and said why couldn't we why could we not cast it out so Jesus said to them because of your unbelief for assuredly I say unto you if you have faith as small as the mustard seed you will say to this mountain move from here to there and it will move and nothing will be impossible for you however this kind does not go out except by prayer and fasting let's make this year year of prayer and fasting let's make this year year of repentance and Reformation let's make this year a year of Master seed size faith that moves mountain and from these mountain peaks may we go down to the valleys of our duties and cast out any demon that has been stubborn from this pivotal from this view let us go down and see the Lord work miracles the one who says nothing will be impossible is the author and finisher of our faith he calls you so that you can accept his righteousness he call calls you so that you can seek to worship Him in truth and in spirit he's calling us so that like the time of Mount camel when we see him consuming the sin offering we our hearts can be turned to him and we know that he loves us his grace is sufficient trust in the Lord commit Whoever has been stubborn in your life whatever family member you've been praying for it is the moment to bring those prayer requests and let us commit it to the Lord

[320.2s] glory
[321.5s] Allelujah and so early in the
[325.7s] year actually a few hours
[331.8s] after the beginning of the
[335.4s] day in the morning we are here and I
[340.5s] believe the language of our hearts As We
[345.3s] Gather is that we are seeking the Lord
[351.0s] early early in the year we are thirsting
[355.7s] for him our flesh is longing for for him
[361.5s] and here as we read this is saying I am
[368.5s] seeking you in the sanctuary and that is
[371.9s] why we are here and those who are
[374.6s] following this is our heart's desire
[377.6s] maybe we are separated by distance uh by
[382.2s] the fact that some of us traveled to
[385.2s] various places for vacation and to be
[388.4s] with family oh you are far from this
[392.5s] Homeland you are in another country or
[396.6s] knowing that we have this program at
[399.0s] Nairobi Central every year you have
[402.2s] chosen to be part of this worship let's
[406.7s] join together with the psalmist to say
[409.7s] Lord we are seeking you early early
[414.3s] today early in the year so that we can
[418.1s] witness God's glory glory and Power in
[421.6s] the sanctuary and in our own secret
[425.1s] places where we call upon him where we
[430.2s] have a moment with him to ask him to
[434.7s] intervene in whatever we ought or we
[438.4s] need him to intervene in and Psalms 24
[444.4s] vers 5 uh to
[448.5s] 6 this is an interesting chapter when
[451.9s] you combine it with chapter 20 22 and 23
[458.0s] you will realize that this is a it it is
[462.6s] an Ascension it is a stage Jesus of the
[467.5s] Cross during crucifixion Jesus uh during
[472.2s] burial and Resurrection in chapter 23
[476.2s] and Jesus in his Ascension and
[480.7s] Resurrection this is an song of a send
[486.9s] it brings the thoughts and lift us up
[490.6s] and then here when the question and when
[495.8s] when the Lord declares that the the the
[499.5s] Earth is the Lord's and all its fullness
[503.7s] the world and those who dwell
[507.8s] therein and then as the question who may
[510.9s] Ascend to the heel of the Lord who may
[517.0s] stand in the Holy place then the answer
[521.3s] comes and among the reason for those who
[526.3s] will stand in the Holy place of the Lord
[530.1s] those who are sent to the Holy Hill to
[534.0s] Worship the Lord this is said of them he
[539.0s] shall re receive a blessing from the
[541.6s] Lord and righteousness from the god of
[545.5s] his
[546.8s] salvation and then this is the
[549.8s] description of those who Ascend to the
[554.0s] holy heill of the Lord those who will be
[558.9s] translated and those who will be
[562.7s] resurrected in the newness of the bodies
[567.1s] in the twinkling of an eye
[570.0s] this is what is saying that for this is
[574.4s] Jacob the generation of those who seek
[579.2s] Him who
[581.8s] seek for your
[584.8s] face
[587.2s] friends I don't know why the psalmist
[591.4s] uses the name Jacob when Jacob's name
[595.5s] had been changed to Israel
[599.6s] but you can
[602.5s] tell from this that the
[606.2s] Lord recognizes our struggle Even in our
[610.8s] Jacob
[612.8s] situations when we try to make things
[616.3s] right by our own strength when we try to
[620.4s] get the blessings of the Lord either by
[624.5s] scheming or by trying to trick
[629.8s] the Lord still recognizes that we are
[633.1s] seeking His
[635.0s] blessings and those who will Ascend on
[638.2s] the Holy Mountain of the Lord although
[641.8s] they retain their own characters and
[646.4s] personalities yet when we seek the Lord
[649.6s] in this genuiness of who we are and what
[654.9s] we have done the Lord shall welcome us
[659.4s] into his holy
[661.5s] mountain may the Lord of
[664.3s] Grace who has sin us through the various
[669.1s] mistakes that we have made in his grace
[673.3s] Crown us and give us his
[677.2s] righteousness because it is only the
[680.2s] Lord's righteousness that matters in our
[684.0s] life may we yield to him and seek Him Al
[688.4s] as we have come come this new year
[693.4s] prayer time praise the
[697.2s] Lord and so now my friend let me take
[701.4s] your mind and thoughts to three mountain
[706.2s] peaks and
[708.3s] counters and I think there is suspense
[712.4s] in all of these three
[715.8s] encounters There's Hope and there's d
[719.4s] Duty for us to engage in shall we
[723.7s] pray Eternal gracious
[726.8s] father I stand before your
[730.5s] [Music]
[732.5s] congregation your sons and daughters who
[735.5s] are seeking your face
[738.5s] early who am I to say
[742.2s] anything unless it is that which you
[745.2s] have put in my
[747.9s] heart and that that which you continue
[750.8s] to guide my thoughts to
[754.7s] speak to your
[757.0s] church to this Congregation of your
[761.2s] servants
[763.0s] Lord as imperfect as we
[766.8s] are as
[768.8s] weak and knowing that we are just but
[772.2s] thst dust yet
[775.8s] Lord come to you
[780.1s] even in a year that might have proved
[784.6s] difficult we turn to you and we know you
[789.4s] will speak to our
[791.7s] situations and when you
[793.9s] speak your word
[797.1s] creates and so
[799.1s] Lord speak to us in these
[803.4s] thoughts and let us indeed be at these
[806.9s] Mountain pecks to view
[809.8s] view where we have come
[812.7s] from and to
[815.4s] see forward Yonder to where you are
[819.3s] leading
[820.8s] us may your grace be sufficient touch my
[824.2s] lips touch
[825.9s] my brain
[828.2s] cells let your word
[831.2s] flow into the thoughts and the spirit of
[836.1s] each and everyone who is listening and
[838.5s] following
[840.2s] this
[841.4s] program bless us Lord in Jesus name we
[846.4s] pray
[849.7s] amen the three
[852.2s] mountains my
[854.3s] friend and none other than the
[858.8s] mountain of
[861.2s] Nabor which is
[864.8s] bisa Mount
[867.6s] camel and one of the
[870.6s] mountains in
[873.4s] Jerusalem which near Jerusalem where
[877.9s] Jesus ascended with his
[883.0s] disciples I request that
[885.8s] we read
[888.2s] together from Deuteronomy chapter
[896.0s] 34 Deuteronomy chapter 34 if it can be
[900.1s] projected the better in the new King
[902.7s] James
[907.0s] version you can open in your Bible so
[911.4s] that we read
[914.5s] together this
[917.0s] story that is not quite so tastful to
[923.2s] our
[925.5s] ears as human beings but um
[929.9s] it is indeed something that um we all
[934.4s] know it can happen any
[937.3s] time verse 1 to
[940.9s] 4 then Moses went up to the plains of
[946.0s] Moab to mount
[949.0s] nebor to the top of
[952.5s] pisca which is a cross from J
[957.3s] Jericho the Lord showed him all the land
[962.4s] of
[963.3s] Gilead as far as Dan all
[968.0s] naftali and the land of
[971.0s] Ephraim and
[972.8s] Manus all the land of Judah as far as
[978.2s] the Western sea the South and the plain
[984.0s] of the valley of
[987.0s] Jericho the city
[989.6s] of the palm trees as far as
[993.6s] Zar then the Lord say to him this is the
[1000.0s] land of which I swore to give Abraham
[1005.3s] Isaac and Jacob saying I will give it to
[1010.3s] your
[1011.4s] descendants I have caused you to see
[1017.3s] it with your eyes
[1019.4s] eyes but you shall not cross over
[1026.9s] there it seems from a CL a glance
[1032.0s] that this is a
[1035.6s] sad
[1037.7s] ending for a
[1040.2s] giant for a man who would have died
[1045.3s] being killed in his birth
[1049.6s] for a man who all his life though living
[1055.1s] in a
[1056.0s] [Music]
[1058.0s] corrupt
[1059.9s] Palace where everything was
[1063.7s] free but is early upbringing by a mother
[1069.5s] whose
[1071.2s] sister as if she could get a maid to
[1075.6s] take care of this by Divine
[1080.4s] Arrangements this man has
[1084.5s] grown and his lowly
[1088.2s] status having been born to a
[1093.1s] slave
[1096.0s] couple growing up in that not
[1102.5s] quite certain of his
[1105.9s] identity having spent the least time
[1109.4s] with his mother and
[1112.1s] father he had to be taken
[1115.2s] away but although he lived in that
[1119.2s] corrupt
[1120.7s] Palace where all the idols were there
[1124.3s] and Sorcerers and all these
[1128.0s] magicians yet the few years with the
[1131.0s] mother prepared him to be a man of
[1136.8s] Faith this goes to tell us that it is
[1141.0s] not how long we spend with those we
[1145.9s] train but what quality and intensity we
[1150.4s] give and how much prayer we make for
[1154.0s] them that
[1156.2s] matters mothers in this Hall and those
[1160.2s] who are hoping to be mothers to keep the
[1164.4s] generations of those who trust in God
[1167.9s] here is the the secret and we see this
[1171.0s] man having spent his life now in his we
[1177.5s] hours of his life God is asking him to
[1182.0s] go to a
[1184.3s] mountain and he's telling him look at
[1188.8s] what I promised Abraham Isaac and
[1192.8s] Jacob look at this land and it is said
[1196.8s] it was in a
[1200.3s] clockwise
[1202.1s] view in this view from this pivotal
[1209.2s] area this
[1211.3s] man who had seen it
[1215.0s] all who had himself felt the guilt of
[1219.3s] killing a
[1220.4s] man who had himself run away for his
[1224.8s] life into the desert having to fight and
[1230.2s] to take care of damp animals as he stray
[1234.6s] from the palace he went L this man had
[1238.9s] seen it all and now the Lord is asking
[1243.2s] him to go to a
[1246.1s] mountain and upon that
[1249.8s] mountain the Lord is asking him to
[1254.4s] see but he will not cross
[1257.6s] over to enjoy the fruits for which he
[1262.5s] had encouraged so many pleaded with God
[1266.4s] even asking God if you are not going to
[1270.3s] forgive these people I'd rather die take
[1276.2s] my life as an
[1278.7s] intercessor this servant of the Lord was
[1282.7s] a
[1283.8s] representative of the people who had sin
[1287.4s] who had rebelled who had
[1290.4s] murmured yet he was not ready to give up
[1296.0s] on
[1297.0s] them this man of
[1301.9s] God this
[1303.8s] Moses stands
[1306.5s] High among Servants of the Lord as a
[1311.3s] prophet because he
[1315.1s] viewed what it would be if God God's
[1319.1s] people were to die all of them in the
[1323.2s] desert would it be anything and so he
[1327.7s] said God you cannot promise that you
[1331.7s] will make me a great
[1334.9s] name at the expense of the people you
[1338.7s] have you have called me to lead no I'm
[1343.8s] not ready answer this man who
[1349.6s] was called saved from real
[1353.7s] danger by miraculous ways this man who
[1359.3s] had the least time to spend with
[1363.6s] family who grew up in the most corrupt
[1369.1s] environment yet because of the lessons
[1373.3s] taught by the mother in his early years
[1377.7s] he did not forget his
[1380.0s] roots he stood up and he knew he had a
[1385.0s] duty to
[1387.6s] perform this man grew up and
[1392.8s] being
[1394.4s] moved by the prayers of his
[1397.8s] mother and the
[1399.9s] family he grew up to be the giant of
[1404.4s] faith in
[1406.6s] Israel men and women of the Lord as we
[1411.2s] seek the Lord early this
[1415.0s] year let us look at this story for what
[1418.4s] it
[1419.5s] is and know
[1423.1s] that Giants of Faith at times are given
[1429.1s] leave and it comes a
[1433.0s] moment when the failures and the
[1436.4s] mistakes of those giants of
[1441.0s] Faith have to be accounted
[1444.5s] for our God is a god of
[1449.2s] judgment but he's a God who is gracious
[1453.6s] and
[1454.9s] merciful he forgives our sins and he
[1460.1s] knows that we are but
[1464.8s] dust but he allows us to view
[1470.1s] the promises he has made for
[1473.2s] us even if we
[1476.0s] have in this Loft
[1479.0s] view to see what awaits those Sons and
[1483.4s] Daughters of faith when we have done our
[1488.8s] part we are asked to move
[1493.4s] on this year
[1496.9s] 2025 May
[1499.8s] Mark a new transition in your
[1505.1s] life a Servants of the
[1507.9s] Lord serving for the last two
[1511.4s] years it may mean handing over the
[1514.9s] mantle to
[1518.1s] another it may mean you are being
[1521.1s] transferred you are being moved from the
[1524.2s] place you had gotten used to to a new
[1528.0s] area
[1529.5s] area whatever it
[1532.3s] is you may view what you have walked
[1536.9s] for you may not be there to guide it but
[1543.0s] allow the Lord to give you that view all
[1546.6s] the
[1547.8s] same
[1550.9s] Hallelujah and so Mount neor which form
[1556.0s] part of the summit of several mountains
[1560.9s] several Hills that
[1564.4s] stood within a valley within the plains
[1570.4s] of
[1571.3s] Moab this Summit Rises up and there the
[1577.3s] sea there's there's Jordan
[1582.8s] River this man of God had brought the
[1586.6s] children of Israel to this
[1589.8s] point the Lord is asking him that go up
[1594.3s] to mount
[1595.8s] Nabor and there you'll not only
[1600.6s] view the promised land but you will
[1604.6s] also
[1606.8s] die look at chapter
[1609.8s] 3 to
[1612.1s] get how
[1616.8s] this remember rembrance reminders of
[1620.4s] what God had done to the children of
[1624.0s] Israel because
[1625.9s] Deuteronomy means repeating the commands
[1630.9s] of the Lord
[1634.0s] again as this man
[1638.6s] rehearsed as he had known that he would
[1643.5s] not cross
[1645.5s] over the entire book
[1648.9s] is a careful rehearsal of what God
[1653.9s] required of his
[1656.1s] people and so chapter 34 is a
[1659.9s] culmination of a story that began in
[1663.4s] chapter 3 and you can see this my
[1669.6s] friend that in chapter 3 vers 23 to 29
[1678.4s] this is what we find in this place so
[1683.5s] that we can get the clear perspective
[1687.6s] and know how intense this was and yet
[1692.1s] this man of God by 34 chapter had
[1696.4s] already come to terms with the fact that
[1699.8s] he would not be crossing over listen it
[1703.4s] says then I pleaded with the Lord at
[1707.5s] that time saying oh Lord God you have
[1711.2s] begun to show your servant your
[1714.4s] greatness and your Mighty hand for what
[1717.7s] a God is there in heaven or on Earth who
[1722.9s] can do anything like your works and your
[1726.8s] Mighty Deeds I pray let me cross over
[1731.4s] and see the good land beyond the Jordan
[1735.4s] those pleasant mountains and
[1739.7s] Lebanon but the Lord was angry with me
[1744.3s] on your account and would not listen to
[1747.9s] me so the Lord said to me enough of that
[1753.9s] speak no more to me of this
[1757.0s] matter go up to the top of Pisa and lift
[1761.4s] your eyes toward the west the North and
[1764.7s] the South and the East behold it with
[1769.0s] your eyes for you shall not cross over
[1772.9s] this
[1774.2s] Jordan but command Joshua and encourage
[1778.8s] him and strengthen him for he shall go
[1783.4s] over before these people and he shall
[1787.6s] cause them to inherit the land which you
[1792.6s] will see so we stayed in the valley
[1796.7s] opposite Beth
[1801.4s] beor what a
[1807.3s] story think of all the thoughts that ran
[1811.3s] through
[1815.0s] Moses
[1817.0s] that for
[1820.0s] 31
[1823.3s] verses or
[1826.6s] chapters he had to always come to terms
[1832.8s] with the fact that his duty was to
[1836.3s] prepare to hand
[1838.4s] over that his duty was to
[1844.8s] prepare the people whom he had been
[1848.3s] called to
[1850.2s] lead so that they would know how to go
[1856.5s] possess the promised land and live in
[1861.0s] that land with the blessings of the
[1866.6s] Lord oh how it would
[1872.7s] be important and what blessing it would
[1877.3s] be for each one of us to know that even
[1881.4s] if we may be having thoughts and hopes
[1885.0s] of living beyond 100
[1890.8s] but our very important duty is to
[1895.6s] prepare to hand
[1900.0s] over that in this this giant of
[1907.6s] Faith
[1909.5s] himself
[1911.6s] knew that in as much as he had been
[1916.0s] granted the promises and the request
[1918.9s] that he
[1920.2s] made even to see the glory of the
[1926.4s] Lord this man who conversed with God
[1931.7s] from time to
[1934.2s] time those so
[1937.5s] honored his
[1940.4s] duty was not for him to complete the
[1945.1s] Journey of the children of Israel to
[1947.2s] Canaan
[1950.2s] but to
[1951.4s] prepare and write what he wrote so that
[1955.3s] we too knowing that at times we may not
[1959.5s] see our children marry and have children
[1964.5s] and raise grandchildren and great
[1968.3s] grandchildren yet the faithful Lord will
[1972.4s] give us a view of the Promised Land
[1979.0s] and so this great
[1981.7s] God whom we serve in
[1986.9s] 2024
[1988.8s] and years that have gone
[1992.0s] by we have witnessed both this happening
[1998.0s] to us
[1999.5s] closely losing those whom we thought
[2002.5s] that would lead
[2006.1s] us morning
[2009.0s] to even see those our loved ones whom we
[2014.3s] thought we would do so much for
[2018.6s] them yet we had to bury
[2024.0s] them this is
[2027.7s] life and the early we come to terms with
[2032.8s] God's
[2034.6s] Authority his absolute wisdom and power
[2039.8s] the better for you to stand up and to be
[2044.4s] content with whatever he chooses to do
[2047.6s] with your life and how long he may keep
[2050.6s] you alive in this
[2055.5s] world it is important for us therefore
[2059.6s] to be on this
[2062.0s] mountain and like Moses to know Ally
[2068.4s] so that by the 31 chapters of our life
[2073.5s] we can prepare those who we need to
[2076.1s] prepare for eternity and prepare
[2080.0s] ourself to meet
[2083.6s] him and even to have a better view of
[2088.8s] Eternity this is Mount
[2091.4s] neor from this
[2094.7s] pick life in its reality
[2099.2s] confronts the man of faith and
[2104.0s] any Bible
[2107.0s] stud let it sober us so that in as much
[2112.6s] as we can make plans for a thousand
[2115.7s] years for the security of our family
[2118.9s] members Those whom we love let us first
[2123.0s] and foremost
[2125.6s] recount again the Comm Commandments of
[2129.0s] the Lord to
[2134.4s] them the next mountain is the summon of
[2138.6s] our youngsters and I thank the Lord for
[2143.0s] the Young Mat
[2145.1s] Toya thank you so
[2147.3s] much and
[2149.2s] the uh children teacher who prepared
[2155.4s] this praise the Lord
[2158.7s] what have we been told to
[2160.8s] do
[2163.7s] move go forward what was
[2168.8s] it
[2170.9s] just just keep
[2176.2s] going this Elijah
[2182.0s] man growing up in the northern kingdom
[2186.1s] 10 King 10 tribes of
[2189.9s] Israel who chose to
[2194.0s] Rebel who chose to follow an alternative
[2199.2s] leader and they went to the
[2202.2s] north and they did want they not want to
[2205.3s] have anything to do with the South not
[2209.2s] even to
[2210.8s] Worship in Jerusalem as they ought to
[2214.2s] have
[2215.2s] done they started their own Sanctuary
[2219.4s] place of worship in the
[2222.0s] northern part of this Kingdom 10 of
[2227.4s] them a great multitude of the children
[2231.6s] of Israel in fact they were called the
[2235.8s] Kingdom of
[2238.4s] Israel the southern one was called the
[2241.6s] kingdom of
[2245.5s] Judah in this division
[2249.2s] at this
[2250.9s] moment when
[2253.4s] jobah their King brought a new
[2259.6s] religion they who had been taken to go
[2263.8s] into the promised land in
[2267.2s] Canaan were taken back
[2272.0s] spiritually to
[2275.0s] Egypt by the king
[2280.9s] after finding the
[2283.5s] support of
[2286.8s] Egypt he was told the condition upon
[2290.3s] which we will support you is that you
[2293.6s] take with you and give your
[2297.9s] people our
[2302.9s] religion
[2305.1s] donations and support that you
[2310.1s] get may not be so
[2314.0s] free
[2317.3s] Hello be careful from whom you receive
[2320.9s] any
[2323.0s] help ladies and
[2326.2s] gentlemen I announce to you that if you
[2330.1s] don't stand and seek help in the house
[2334.6s] of the Lord and seek help individually
[2338.7s] that the Lord blesses you and whoever he
[2341.7s] brings he will not be an influence to
[2344.8s] lead you to
[2348.3s] Egypt then be careful what you receive
[2353.2s] and from whom you receive
[2363.4s] it it was Elijah
[2367.9s] who had to
[2370.2s] contend with a national a national
[2374.7s] religion that was supported by the
[2377.1s] mighty and the resources from the
[2381.4s] palace this
[2385.3s] man was the only one who endangered his
[2390.8s] life and confronted
[2395.8s] Jezebel at the night of this
[2400.8s] confusion he prayed to God that maybe
[2405.6s] because these people were eating to
[2408.3s] their
[2409.5s] fool maybe because these people were
[2413.9s] having it
[2416.0s] good Lord he
[2419.0s] prayed I
[2421.0s] pray that let no rain come for three and
[2426.2s] a half years
[2428.5s] so that they would be
[2432.4s] femine and so that the false prophets
[2436.8s] and
[2439.0s] magicians would fail to bring any
[2442.8s] prosperity and so that these people
[2445.5s] would seek the Lord
[2450.4s] again in the land of
[2453.9s] promise the land the beautiful land that
[2457.4s] that Moses pleaded that he would
[2461.8s] go those who went into this good goodly
[2466.1s] land this beautiful land flowing with
[2469.9s] milk and
[2472.8s] honey them themselves forgot the
[2476.0s] commands that Moses gave
[2478.8s] them they forgot their
[2482.4s] Duty they forgot that for them to enjoy
[2487.0s] God God's
[2488.9s] blessings they had to be true and
[2492.6s] faithful to
[2495.8s] God and so in our
[2499.4s] lives God may have to strike the land
[2504.2s] with famine in order for I
[2509.0s] Elijah to stand and say now before you
[2513.4s] receive the
[2515.2s] rain let us choose and see who among Bal
[2520.8s] and God is the true
[2524.2s] God and the second Mountain which is
[2528.1s] called
[2531.4s] camel the
[2533.3s] Lord
[2535.8s] asked the
[2537.6s] prophet to gather the
[2542.5s] entire nation they told them come
[2547.8s] and he said bring the
[2550.2s] leaders and don't come along bring the
[2555.2s] false prophets and the
[2559.1s] priests
[2560.7s] 850 of
[2564.4s] them well
[2567.6s] kept
[2569.5s] provided they were budging from the the
[2573.4s] the the palace Provisions that they were
[2576.6s] given
[2578.7s] they were stronger than this lone
[2582.3s] man who had to eat from a Widow's last
[2589.8s] meal this
[2592.2s] man who did not have proper water
[2598.0s] system he drank from the Brooks which
[2602.0s] dried and he had to be fed by
[2605.4s] Ravens for a whole year
[2607.5s] [Music]
[2608.6s] here this fugitive who was being
[2614.2s] followed
[2616.0s] yet at this pivotal moment the Lord
[2621.0s] asked him to come to the
[2624.9s] mountain and the Lord said yes I'm going
[2629.0s] to give rain but before rain comes
[2634.2s] reformation and repentance must be the
[2640.0s] beginning of the blessings of the
[2642.8s] Lord and so upon this
[2646.5s] mountain the prophet challenged and said
[2651.0s] come and we will meet and bring those
[2655.2s] prophets if that the Lord be B let him
[2659.1s] be B and if the Lord be the Lord God the
[2662.2s] creator of heaven then he will show by
[2667.6s] accepting the sin offering and consuming
[2672.0s] it
[2674.4s] hallelujah oh how beautiful it would be
[2677.6s] for us to be upon this mountain
[2681.8s] today so that whatever our life has been
[2687.1s] in the past we can come to this mountain
[2692.2s] and say yes let the Lord who forgive
[2698.0s] accept the sin offering our repentance
[2702.0s] and our desire for reformation so that
[2706.0s] we can have the reign of the Holy
[2709.2s] Spirit
[2711.8s] Hallelujah so this is the
[2714.3s] mountain where God called these people
[2717.4s] and I want you to look at the wording in
[2721.6s] this in chapter 18 of the First Kings
[2726.3s] let's read that that so that we conclude
[2729.6s] at the third mountain and you will see
[2732.4s] the connection very very
[2736.8s] soon are you there
[2745.6s] communication
[2749.0s] yes so after he
[2751.8s] had
[2753.4s] asked the false prophets and the priests
[2757.5s] to take hold of their bull slau tight
[2762.5s] and place it upon their Altar and then
[2766.1s] pray for fire to come down for from the
[2770.2s] entire morning all the way to
[2775.2s] 3 they had prayed they had cut
[2778.3s] themselves they had tried all sorts of
[2781.6s] magic but it didn't
[2785.6s] work let let us turn to
[2789.8s] God let us avoid any magic or anything
[2793.9s] that we have tried that it would work
[2797.1s] and which has not worked so far it is
[2800.6s] time to repent it is time to come to
[2804.6s] mount
[2806.1s] camel
[2810.2s] Hallelujah and so upon this mountain my
[2814.1s] brother we read this that
[2818.0s] and it came to pass at the time of the
[2821.6s] offering of the evening
[2823.9s] sacrifice that Elijah the prophet came
[2827.0s] near and said Lord God of Abraham Isaac
[2831.0s] and
[2832.3s] Israel let it be known this day that you
[2837.3s] are God in Israel and I am your servant
[2842.3s] and that I have done all these things at
[2846.3s] your word
[2848.0s] hear me oh Lord hear me that these
[2852.4s] people may know that you are the Lord
[2857.1s] God and that you have turned their
[2860.9s] hearts back to you
[2865.4s] again
[2867.6s] Hallelujah and so this second Mountain
[2870.6s] then encounter that was
[2874.1s] there was not only for the prophet but
[2878.2s] it was for the entire nation to be
[2881.4s] turned to
[2883.9s] God may we begin this
[2886.9s] year by reviewing what happened upon
[2890.2s] these mountains and from this mountain
[2894.3s] pics let us chart a away and the right
[2899.6s] way to leave our life preparing for
[2904.9s] eternity and prepar car in for enjoyment
[2908.6s] of the blessings of
[2910.8s] God
[2915.5s] hallelujah let me ask you a
[2920.4s] question between the sin sacrifice that
[2925.5s] was put at the
[2928.1s] altar and the children of Israel who had
[2932.3s] worshiped
[2934.0s] Idols who had turn
[2937.4s] their hearts to
[2943.8s] Egypt who was supposed to receive the
[2947.5s] fire from
[2950.1s] heaven the
[2952.4s] sacrifice the innocent animal the sin
[2956.6s] offering or was it the
[2959.8s] people
[2961.8s] hello answer
[2965.7s] me who were the who deserved the fire
[2971.4s] the consuming fire to fall on
[2977.0s] them the
[2980.0s] people but look at God's
[2984.5s] grace that after stopping the rains for
[2988.2s] three and a half years he was preparing
[2991.9s] these people for this moment this
[2995.1s] decisive moment
[2997.9s] but even in that decisive moment when
[3000.7s] they were standing before
[3004.3s] two
[3006.3s] decisions the Lord God had Grace and his
[3012.1s] fire fell not on the people but the fire
[3017.2s] fell on the
[3021.3s] sacrifice Christ has come as our sin
[3025.8s] sacrifice
[3027.2s] and the penalty of our sin has fell on
[3031.4s] him so that we can be turned to God and
[3035.6s] worship God in truth and spirit so that
[3038.8s] his holy spirit the reign of his holy
[3041.7s] spirit can fall on
[3044.0s] us oh that this
[3046.6s] year as you come to seek the Lord
[3050.5s] early you may know that even as you pray
[3056.0s] for all the the prayer request let the
[3059.2s] first prayer request be that the Lord
[3062.8s] would deal with your sin and that he
[3066.9s] would accept and strengthen you to
[3070.4s] reform where you need to reform and let
[3074.2s] the Showers of Blessings
[3081.0s] fall and so now
[3084.0s] quickly to our final Mountain
[3088.8s] in chapter
[3090.2s] 17 of
[3092.6s] Matthew Matthew
[3099.6s] 17 Matthew chapter
[3104.2s] 17 we will
[3106.0s] [Music]
[3108.3s] read vers 1
[3114.8s] to8 I'll read quickly then make a few
[3118.0s] comments and then we
[3120.9s] conclude now after 6 days Jesus Took
[3124.1s] Peter James and John his
[3127.6s] brother LED them up on a high
[3132.3s] mountain by
[3134.4s] themselves and he was transfigured
[3137.0s] before them his face Shone like the
[3142.0s] sun and his clothes became as white as
[3146.2s] the light
[3148.2s] light and behold Moses and
[3152.3s] Elijah appeared to
[3155.7s] them talking with
[3159.3s] him then Peter answered and said to
[3163.2s] Jesus Lord it is good for us to be here
[3168.4s] if you wish let us make here three
[3173.3s] Tabernacles one for you one for Moses
[3177.0s] and one for
[3178.4s] Elijah while he was still speaking
[3181.3s] Behold a bright Cloud overshadowed them
[3186.5s] and suddenly a voice came out of the
[3189.9s] cloud saying this is my beloved Son in
[3194.4s] whom I am well pleased hear
[3198.6s] him and when he the disciples had it
[3203.9s] they fell on their faces and were
[3207.2s] greatly afraid but Jesus came and
[3211.2s] touched them and said arise and do not
[3215.0s] be afraid when they had lifted up their
[3219.0s] eyes they saw no one but Jesus
[3225.0s] only
[3227.7s] Hallelujah they saw no one but
[3231.1s] who Jesus
[3234.7s] only upon this man
[3238.9s] Mountain Jesus had asked them in chapter
[3244.6s] 16
[3246.4s] which is the place where he had
[3251.3s] challenged them
[3253.9s] vers vers
[3256.4s] 14 to
[3258.3s] 16 Jesus actually 13-
[3262.3s] 16 Jesus had taken them to a place where
[3269.4s] demons or Spirits were
[3275.8s] sought in this place where it had been
[3279.9s] dedicated for people to go and find some
[3283.7s] power which was not according to the
[3288.5s] power of
[3290.8s] Heaven Jesus decided to take his
[3293.8s] disciples there
[3296.9s] and state whom do you think the Lord is
[3301.5s] personally in your
[3304.9s] life determine that this year even as
[3308.4s] you come to pray for the blessing of the
[3312.8s] year for the guidance of the Lord that
[3317.0s] you will declare the Lord to be the Son
[3321.5s] of God who came to take away our sins
[3326.4s] and to give us the good blessings of the
[3329.9s] reward and the blessing of the holy
[3332.3s] spirit in our
[3333.8s] life

[3488.0s] told enough of this don't talk to me on
[3491.9s] this matter of you Crossing to Jordan I

[3499.1s] was denied to cross over to Jordan

[3506.3s] resurrected and he was upon this
[3509.0s] mountain of

[3533.1s] many relatives we have and what they do
[3536.7s] for the Lord so long as their hearts are
[3539.7s] right to God God does not mind about us

[3582.2s] Christ
[3585.0s] Hallelujah this
[3587.4s] mountain is where we are all called
[3591.3s] to and thank the Lord that even Moses
[3594.3s] who was told you will not cross
[3598.4s] the
[3599.3s] suspense is
[3601.4s] fulfilled he did not lose anything in
[3606.2s] fact he gained
[3608.6s] more
[3611.5s] Hallelujah when we dedicate ourself to
[3614.6s] the
[3615.8s] Lord it is not how many accolades it is
[3619.3s] not whatever is said about what we do
[3623.8s] but it is with what SP rwe
[3628.3s] it he was humble he assigned himself to
[3633.1s] the will of God and the will of God was
[3635.6s] better than he had hoped
[3638.9s] for praise the
[3643.2s] Lord and so there's hope my
[3646.7s] brother there's joy for
[3649.7s] you that your loved one whom you
[3653.5s] buried because of Christ coming and
[3657.6s] building his church upon the rock of his
[3661.0s] coming as the sacrifice the sin
[3665.6s] offering we can look forward with hope
[3670.6s] to seeing not only Jesus transfigured
[3674.8s] but also our loved ones being
[3678.7s] transformed being chained in a twinkling
[3681.7s] of an
[3683.6s] eye so that the troubles we go through
[3687.9s] by faith in the Lord by standing upon
[3692.1s] these three mountain
[3694.0s] peaks we can have a complete view of
[3698.5s] life and we can Worship the Lord all the
[3704.2s] same
[3705.7s] whatever idolatry whatever corruption we
[3709.6s] may have to face stand firm like Elijah
[3714.0s] contend and challenge youever so that
[3717.9s] whatever Idols demons and false prophet
[3722.4s] may they fall upon the mountain of
[3726.2s] camel
[3729.1s] Hallelujah and whatever you have to face
[3732.8s] even if it is death even your wrong
[3736.4s] death by
[3738.7s] whatever may bring
[3741.0s] it be content that the Lord has led you
[3744.6s] so far
[3747.9s] Hallelujah and pass on the Baton of
[3751.1s] faith in your
[3754.3s] family
[3756.6s] friend we have come to the beginning of
[3760.2s] this
[3762.2s] year
[3763.8s] yes our life may be full of suspense as
[3768.6s] we pray as we ride our prayer request
[3772.2s] and as we hope all this that it will
[3775.9s] come to
[3777.3s] pass even in the suspense and in the
[3781.5s] hope that we have that the Lord will do
[3784.6s] this he may keep us in suspense but he's
[3788.1s] a true and faithful
[3791.0s] God
[3792.5s] he in all this is reminding us that we
[3796.3s] have a
[3798.5s] duty as we
[3801.2s] pray as we expect as we hope
[3807.2s] down the valley there's work for
[3811.2s] us and down the valley praise the Lord
[3815.1s] see the climax of this when Jesus after
[3819.5s] Transfiguration and coming down with the
[3823.6s] three they found the other disciples who
[3826.4s] had not ascended to the
[3831.0s] mountain
[3833.2s] discussing and giving giving reasons as
[3837.8s] to why the demon possessed boy may have
[3841.2s] had
[3842.8s] demons it could be the parents could be
[3846.1s] could be this and that because they
[3849.1s] tried
[3850.6s] to remove the demon and it was
[3855.1s] stubble it only took those who had been
[3858.0s] to the mountain
[3860.4s] peak and Jesus himself to cast The Demon
[3867.4s] with Jesus in The Vessel we can smile at
[3869.8s] the
[3872.2s] storm with Jesus in The Vessel and in
[3874.9s] the company of the one who has been
[3877.6s] transformed we can come down to the
[3881.2s] valley and do the
[3883.9s] duty and it will be
[3886.7s] done that is why my friend in chapter
[3890.2s] 17 Jesus concluded by saying
[3894.3s] this look at verse 17 and to
[3898.4s] 19 it says
[3901.0s] this that um 17 to19 then Jesus answered
[3905.8s] and said all faithless and perverse
[3909.9s] generation how long shall I be with you
[3913.6s] how long shall I bear with you bring him
[3917.5s] here to me and Jesus rebuked the demon
[3922.0s] and it came out of him and the child was
[3925.7s] was cured from that very
[3929.8s] hour then the disciples came to Jesus
[3932.9s] privately and said why couldn't
[3937.0s] we why could we not cast it out so Jesus
[3941.9s] said to them because of your unbelief
[3945.8s] for assuredly I say unto you if you have
[3949.6s] faith as small as the mustard
[3952.6s] seed you will say to this mountain
[3956.5s] move from here to there and it will move
[3960.8s] and nothing will be impossible for
[3965.1s] you however this
