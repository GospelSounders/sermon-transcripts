ended up on the campus of an Adventist University in South Korea's capital SE when accompanying a friend who had business at seuk University as he waited for his friend he wanted to smoke but smoking was prohibited at this University so he looked for a place where he could smoke without getting caught finding a remote parklike area with trees and bushes he sat down on a bench and lit up a cigarette as he smoked he looked around and saw a Bible verse engraved on a stone he suddenly realized that he was in the University's prayer Garden a flood of emotion filled his heart he had no memories of his father but he remember that Dad had studied at that same University to become a pastor dad had probably prayed in the same prayer Garden then Jin thoughts turned to his mother is he remembered hearing that Mom was very ill several people had told him that she will die soon grief filled his heart dad had died when he was two and now my mom was dying when he was 25 I can't live like this he explained now Gan began to feel sorry for his mother he thought Mom lost her husband she has two sons but she lost me too I'm breaking her heart and now she's going to die tears poured down his cheek in the University prayer garden with a lit cigarette between his fingers he spoke to God for the first time in years God if you exist please help me he said please help Mom if you do

evening good night wherever you're joining us from Welcome to our Bible study titled finding inner peace as you can see I'm not alone I'm here with my friends I'll ask each and everyone of them to introduce themselves starting with my extreme left hello my name is Ruby Mela hello my name is Michael a hi everyone my name is Nelson Nelson if you could kindly would you pray for us as you begin okay let's pray Almighty father we come before you today uh as we seek to learn more about in your word we ask that you guide us during this Bible study and let us take something from it in Jesus name we pray amen amen amen thank you so much Nelson again we are doing the lesson finding inner peace and I don't know about you guys but I Was preparing for this um Bible study a song came to my mind and I hope you can join me as we sing it what a friend we have in Jesus our sins and griefs to Bear what a privileg to car everything to God in pray oh what we of and for f oh what needless pain we bear oh because we do not car everything to God in pray amen finding inner peace oh what peace we forfeit or what needless pain we bear just because we do not carry Everything To God In Prayer our Bible study today will be coming from The Book of John chapter 14 John chapter 14 a bit of context in this this at this time Christ is having the last supper with his disciples he's is just about to be crucified and the first six words of the chapter say let not your heart be troubled let not your heart be troubled there is such a talous and Terri terrific and terrifying event that is coming and yet Christ is telling his disciples let not your heart be troubled Nelson yeah just using your holy Sanctified imagination how would you feel if you are a disciple and your master and your savior has just been crucified do you think you'll be at peace yeah it's it's hard because it's hard to be at peace because my leader of we followed this person for 3 years is going to leave us now uh we he says he's going to come back but we don't know for sure unless we have great faith so I think the only way you wouldn't be troubled is if you have a lot of faith in the words yeah so we can agree that it is almost quite a fit for Christ to for someone to be at peace when such an event is happening Michael just would you give us an example probably of something in your life or a time in your life when you had something that give you anxiety that made you anxious uh well of course there is the aspect of national examinations and by the teachers everyone around you would make it seem as though this one thing or this one examination yeah holds your life in its hands so in the sense of if you fail it there's no else you're going to go in your life so I was really anxious I was really I was so tensed up my hands would sweat I would be I'd be really scared you know having sleepless nights I'd be reading and reading and reading until I pass out falling asleep so that was the time I was really really anxious yes um Ruby um what about you would you share an instance in your life when you felt anxious when you had anxiety for me it's when I had just finished my high school examination and I was waiting to now proceed to University and I wasn't sure if I was going to be able to do my course because obviously I don't know if I'm going to get the gr the grades to do it I don't know if I even if I get the grades where will you know the money come from to you know pay for my fees and all and one thing that I really struggled with was having like I was I didn't have sleep at all I think it was like for two weeks because you hear their rumors the results are coming out but they don't come out the exact day you're just there wondering can it just come and be over but I think one thing that really helped was was praying as much as it was hard the first few days once I would pray and just tell God honestly I am so anxious and I'm very stressed I can't even eat just just take this this load of me yes um I think um you have uh partly answered the question Ruby cuz the next question is going to ask you Nelson and you can elaborate um if you want to is what can we do what can I do what can you do to make um anxiety go away to make you know the feeling of you know turbulence in your life based on certain circumstances what other ways can we make that go away I think for myself whenever I feel anxious I remember watching something actually the guy was talking about anytime you're feeling that that feeling in your stomach something uh for me it was I wanted to go to the toilet all the time yes when whenever like a football match I just going to the toilet so now this guy he explained that whenever you get that feeling whenever that happens it just means that this thing is really important to you and it's a good thing your body is trying to prepare you for it so that's one you you come to acceptance to it that it's always going to happen but then maybe something that can help you is prayer as Ruby said yes and also just maybe if it's an action practice that action or I don't know there are many things that you could do about that I could add yeah yes absolutely and and as you add um as as um Nelson has said right um some of the symptoms of anxiety you know migraines heart flatters or feeling a heavy weight in your stomach right it's good to to make definitions yes um go ahead um uh so from what we studied we can see even in John Chapter 14 verse 27 where Jesus says peace I give you um sorry says peace I give you my peace I give you not as the world gives do I give you so he's also encouraging us and telling us that you might be anxious May feeling anxious but he's he's there to provide us with peace also another part in the Bible ass is in Philippians 4 verse 6 which says be anxious for nothing but in everything by prayer and supplication with Thanksgiving let your request be made known to God so he saying like if you're anxious about something let go know about it pray about it you know and you'll be able to overcome you've made um some sorry you want to say something yes uh just to add on what we we shouldn't do and what rather what anxiety doesn't help with is it doesn't increase anything in us um in Luke 12 verse 25 and 26 it says and which of you You by worrying can add one cubit to his St if you then are not able to do the least why are you anxious for the rest so out of that we basically should not be worrying about anything because our father knows what he wants from us and he's not going to let anything bad happen to us because he wants the best for us so the fact that anxiety doesn't add anything to us but rather if you look at it drains us that basically shows that that's not something we should be actively pursuing in our lives amen amen and you you know you've made some two very important points that we'll um consider later in our lesson um one that uh there's a peace that God gives that that that is different from the peace that the world gives what does that mean and the other point that we brought out which we also consider later is that God cares when you're anxious God cares God wants you and die dear listener to have peace but moving on going back to John chapter 14 we have considered that was a t time Christ was on his way to the Cross he was just about to be um betrayed by his disciples he was about to be denied by another of his disciple and of course he was going to give his life on the cross yet he was encouraging despite all this he was encouraging his disciples to be peaceful how do you think Christ was able to comfort and this is for you Michael how do you think Christ was able to comfort his disciples when he himself was facing such turmoil in his life I feel like in the sense that we talked about faith when it comes to Faith and like see even what God has done he's brought people from the dead you know he's healed leprosy things people so impossible Christ has done and given a man doing that assures you that everything's going to be okay I believe that's how God gave them or rather Christ gave them an anchor like something to hold on to cuz I understand yes death is very sad death is very tragic and scary and I feel like in that way that God performed all those Miracles and show them that through God's power everything is possible I feel like that's how he both comforted them and gave them an anchor in that time of trouble yeah Ruby uh to add on what Mel said MH in John 16:33 it says these things I have spoken to you that in me you may have peace in the world you are the world you will have tribulations but of good cheer I have overcome the world so be the fact that Jesus had gone through this he knew that it is possible to go through these tribulations but only if you have the Peace of Christ in you amen amen um just something I would like to um and um there's some material here that I'm reading and it says the savior's life on this Earth though lived in the midst of conflict was a life of Peace while angry while angry enemies were constantly pursuing him he said he that sent me is with me the father has not left me alone for I do always those things that please him so Christ knew that the father was in him and he was doing the will of his father father and with that knowledge he could have peace in the midst of all this conflict um coming to you um Ruby why is Jesus asking his disciples to become in spite of what is to come upon him why is Christ asking his disciples to become um I personally think that he's asking them that so that they don't necess neily focus on what is going to happen but focus on now how they're going to now continue spreading the word of God and making new disciples even when he's not here because the fact that he will not be on Earth with them doesn't mean that the work of the Lord is going to stop so it's basically Jesus telling them that look at the bigger picture as much as I'm not going to be here I will still leave a helper I'll leave the helper with you who's the Holy Spirit and he's going to show you these things and remind you these things but this doesn't mean that now the work that we have begun together should end up stopping just because I'm not here amen amen actually yeah uh as Ruby read earlier yes she said the Bible is saying that the worry adds nothing to anything so you might as well just continue the work yes that's good logic you said something important um and it's found in John 14: 16 and I'll read and I will pray the father and he will give you another helper that he may abide in you forever verse 17 the spirit of Truth whom the world cannot receive because it neither sees him nor knows him but you know him for dwells in you and will be with you and will be in you so Christ was not going to leave the disciples alone so he tell them I leave you my peace and on top of that I do not leave you alone I leave you with a Helper and I go that he may come um and you say that very well um another reason why um maybe Mike read for us John 14:13 and uh 14 John 1413 and 14 says and whatever you ask in my name that I will do that the father may be glorified in the son if you ask anything in my name I will do it amen so another reason why Christ is encouraging his to have peace is because whatever you ask in my name I will do do for you so I will send you a Helper and on top of that I'm not just going to s in the Sky by and by to sit and wait but I'm going to intercede on your behalf with the with the father let's move on um so uh moving to the next question I think um this is for you um Nelson um Jesus promised peace to his disciples um John 14:27 um Michael you read that for us um Isaiah 9:6 also calls Christ The Prince of Peace yeah what does it mean to find peace in Christ and how do we find peace in Christ I think uh in the lesson there's a part on the Sunday section I can just read this uh it says mhm Christ words to Peter yes assur us that when our circumstances cause anxiety we can find peace in dwelling on what is God what God is doing for us this is transcending peace that comes through the falling the way the truth and the life depending on God through prayer and expressing love to God through obedience to his word so I think the peace in Christ is just following the way Jesus and being obedient to the world amen amen amen are very well put back to coming to you Michael the the the verse that you just read for us John 14 27 which says peace I live with you my peace I give to you not as the world gives do I give to you let not your heart be troubled neither Let It Be Afraid what is the difference in your opinion what is the difference between worldly peace and the peace that you get from Christ um okay when I was looking at this when I was looking at this study during the week I was thinking about whether like the difference here between peace from Jesus and worldly peace and for me what I got from it is that I would say worldly peace usually involves other people you know we talk about wars conflicts so worldly peace would involve you me Ruby Nelson all of us together but I think about the peace that Jesus gives you that is like one onone that's now between you and Jesus there's no one else involved in it so that's just between you and Jesus all your personal vendettas between you and Jesus you know worldly peace also other way another way people get worldly peace is like for example those who are trouble they seek professional help like two counselors yes they can involv other other people around you but for peace from Jesus that's always it between you and Jesus I like I really like what you say um not only involves other people but also circumstances circumstances so wild peace probably could also involve the absence of war or turmoil right like there's nothing happening around us so we are peaceful yeah but the peace from Christ you could say even in the midst of external turmoil we still have that peace like Christ was going to the Cross Christ was going to betrayed by disciples and and what not but he still had had the PE so that's that's very I say a difference you could say is that the worldly peace is always temporary but then the Peace of Jesus is eternal Yes actually one thing I that when we look at the lesson and uh understanding biblical peace one statement that stood out for me was it says Jesus offers a piece not tied to circumstances but rooted in the Assurance of Salvation In God's Presence amen amen amen I I will not add to that unless I spoil um Ruby um this is where you come in what gives Christ the authority to give peace why what what gives Christ authority to give peace um I think what gives him the authority to give pece is the fact that he went through should I say the hard thing that you could go through the people that you have come to save yeah basically did not want anything with you yes and he overcame that and he overcame that because he had God by him and because he is the Prince of Peace he's the one who is the Liberator of all this should I say this internal conflicts we have this external conflict that is what that's the power that gives him the the power that gives him the authority auth to to give peace no absolutely you're very right because in um John [Music] 16:33 it says these things I have spoken to you that in me you may have peace in the world you will have tribulation but be of good cheer I have what I have overcome the world so the fact that as we said the fact that he has overcome the world he has been there done that right he knows what it's about and he knows how to give peace now to the last question and um probably I'll throw it to each one of you to say even as you give the final remarks Isaiah calls Christ The Prince of Peace when Christ was born um the Angels announced glory to God in the highest peace on Earth and Good Will to men Christ continually spoke peace to his disciples and left them with the message of peace what does this tell us about God and His Thoughts towards us Nelson starting with you as you give your final remarks I think there's a there's a theme that we have peace peace always peace I think God just wants us to live in peace he doesn't want us to be worried troubled in peace or yeah because it's possible if we trust in God amen amen Michael uh um I picked out on reconciliation yes is you find that reconciliation occurs and people are you could say like have trouble between the two and you find that even before um before Christ coming there was a lot of trouble you'd see a lot of God's Wrath especially in Old Testament see a lot of God's Wrath but when it comes to new T New Testament yes you'd see now like a calm God you know a God who like who really cares and is at peace even like now we reconnected with God through Jesus Christ so yeah amen interesting uh perspective yes Ru uh what I pick from this is that Jesus knows that we have all these anxieties we have all these fears that's why throughout the Bible not even not only in the verses that we have been able to pick out he has continuously told us to not be afraid even in 2 Timothy 1:7 basically says that God gave us a spirit of power love and sound mind and not a spirit of fear so he knows that these things are not this fear anxiety are not of of God these are feelings that come from the devil and that's what he uses to corrupt our mind and the fact that Jesus I mean God has continually explain that throughout the Bible it means that he is there with us his word through that just reassures us that he's there with us even in our fears and anxieties when we believe and trust in him and have him by our side we'll be able to go through all this amen amen amen and so there we have it dear viewer We Begin where we started John 14:1 let not your heart be troubled you believe in God believe also in me in my father's house are many mansions if it were not so I would have told you I go and prepare a place for you and if I go and prepare a place for you I will come again and receive you unto myself that there where I am there you may be also therefore peace be still the word of the Lord speaks peace to you Michael close for us as we finish pray okay let's pray dear God we come before you thanking you for letting us learn about peace and how we can come to you in times of anxiety and destrction and confusion we ask that also the viewers May learn from this lesson and more from what we have discussed here it's in Jesus name I pray amen amen join us next time for another exciting lesson bye bye

[407.1s] coming from The Book of John chapter 14

[414.2s] this at this time Christ is having the
[417.4s] last supper with his disciples he's is
[419.7s] just about to be crucified and the first
[422.1s] six words of the chapter say let not
[425.8s] your heart be troubled let not your
[428.8s] heart be
[430.0s] troubled there is such a talous and

[437.3s] disciples let not your heart be troubled
[440.8s] Nelson yeah just using your holy
[444.0s] Sanctified imagination how would you

[451.2s] crucified do you think you'll be at

[466.4s] uh we he says he's going to come back
[469.5s] but we don't know for sure unless we
[472.1s] have great faith so I think the only way
[475.2s] you wouldn't be troubled is if you have
[477.2s] a lot of faith in the words yeah so we
[479.7s] can agree that it is almost quite a fit
[483.2s] for Christ to for someone to be at peace
[485.6s] when such an event is happening Michael
[488.2s] just would you give us an example
[489.8s] probably of something in your life or a
[492.2s] time in your life when you had something
[494.9s] that give you anxiety that made you
[498.4s] anxious uh well of course there is the
[501.0s] aspect of national
[502.8s] examinations and by the teachers
[506.6s] everyone around you would make it seem
[508.4s] as though this one thing or this one
[511.6s] examination yeah holds your life in its
[514.1s] hands so in the sense of if you fail it
[517.6s] there's no else you're going to go in
[518.8s] your life so I was really anxious I was
[521.7s] really I was so tensed up my hands would
[524.7s] sweat I would be I'd be really scared
[527.8s] you know having sleepless nights I'd be
[530.4s] reading and reading and reading until I
[532.4s] pass out falling asleep so that was the
[535.2s] time I was really really anxious yes um
[537.7s] Ruby um what about you would you share
[540.1s] an instance in your life when you felt
[542.6s] anxious when you had
[544.9s] anxiety for me it's when I had just
[548.7s] finished my high school examination and
[551.6s] I was waiting to now proceed to
[554.0s] University and I wasn't sure if I was
[556.9s] going to be able to do my course because
[558.9s] obviously I don't know if I'm going to
[561.0s] get the gr the grades to do it I don't
[564.6s] know if I even if I get the grades where
[567.0s] will you know the money come from to you
[569.5s] know pay for my fees and all and one
[572.1s] thing that I really struggled with was
[574.2s] having like I was I didn't have sleep at
[577.1s] all I think it was like for two weeks
[580.0s] because you hear their rumors the
[581.8s] results are coming out but they don't
[583.4s] come out the exact day you're just there
[585.8s] wondering can it just come and be over
[589.8s] but I think one thing that really helped
[592.4s] was was praying as much as it was hard
[595.4s] the first few days once I would pray and
[599.5s] just tell God honestly I am so anxious
[603.5s] and I'm very stressed I can't even eat
[606.3s] just just take this this load of
[609.6s] me yes um I think um you have uh partly
[613.2s] answered the question Ruby cuz the next
[616.2s] question is going to ask you Nelson and
[618.6s] you can elaborate um if you want to
[622.8s] is what can we do what can I do what can
[626.2s] you do to make
[629.6s] um anxiety go away to make you know the
[631.9s] feeling of you know turbulence in your
[635.3s] life based on certain circumstances what
[637.6s] other ways can we make that go away I
[640.8s] think for myself whenever I feel anxious
[643.9s] I remember watching something actually
[645.5s] the guy was talking
[646.9s] about anytime you're feeling that that
[649.4s] feeling in your stomach something uh for
[653.1s] me it was I wanted to go to the toilet
[654.6s] all the time yes when whenever like a
[658.1s] football match I just going to the
[659.8s] toilet so now this guy he explained
[663.2s] that whenever you get that feeling
[665.4s] whenever that happens it just means that
[668.0s] this thing is really important to you
[670.2s] and it's a good thing your body is
[671.4s] trying to prepare you for it so that's
[673.9s] one you you come to acceptance to it
[676.1s] that it's always going to
[677.6s] happen but then maybe something that can
[680.6s] help you is prayer as Ruby said yes and
[683.4s] also just maybe if it's an action
[685.4s] practice that action or I don't know
[688.0s] there are many things that you could do
[689.7s] about that I could add yeah yes
[692.4s] absolutely and and as you add um as as
[695.4s] um Nelson has said right um some of the
[697.9s] symptoms of anxiety you know migraines
[700.3s] heart flatters or feeling a heavy weight
[704.0s] in your stomach right it's good to to
[707.1s] make definitions yes um go ahead um uh
[710.1s] so from what we studied we can see even
[712.4s] in John Chapter 14 verse 27 where Jesus
[715.6s] says peace I give
[717.8s] you um sorry says peace I give you my
[721.4s] peace I give you not as the world gives
[724.5s] do I give you so he's also encouraging
[727.5s] us and telling us that you might be
[729.8s] anxious May feeling anxious but he's
[733.1s] he's there to provide us with peace also
[735.5s] another part in the Bible ass is in
[738.5s] Philippians 4 verse 6 which says be
[742.3s] anxious for nothing but in everything by
[744.9s] prayer and supplication with
[747.1s] Thanksgiving let your request be made
[749.7s] known to God so he saying like if you're
[751.7s] anxious about something let go know
[754.1s] about it pray about it you know and
[757.2s] you'll be able to overcome you've made
[759.3s] um some sorry you want to say something
[761.3s] yes uh just to add on what we we
[764.5s] shouldn't do and what rather what
[768.0s] anxiety doesn't help with is it doesn't
[770.8s] increase anything in us um in Luke 12
[775.4s] verse 25 and 26 it says and which of you
[779.3s] You by worrying can add one cubit to his
[782.0s] St if you then are not able to do the
[784.8s] least why are you anxious for the rest
[787.5s] so out of that we basically should not
[791.1s] be worrying about anything because our
[794.1s] father knows what he wants from us and
[797.6s] he's not going to let anything bad
[799.6s] happen to us because he wants the best
[801.2s] for us so the fact that anxiety doesn't
[804.3s] add anything to us but rather if you
[807.0s] look at it drains us that
[809.7s] basically shows that that's not
[811.0s] something we should be actively pursuing
[814.0s] in our lives amen amen and you you know
[816.1s] you've made some two very important
[817.4s] points that we'll um consider later in
[820.5s] our lesson um one
[822.9s] that uh there's a peace that God gives
[825.7s] that that that is different from the
[828.1s] peace that the world gives what does
[830.3s] that mean and the other point that we
[832.0s] brought out which we also consider later
[833.7s] is that God cares when you're anxious
[836.6s] God cares God wants you and die dear
[839.4s] listener to have peace but moving on
[841.6s] going back to John chapter
[844.4s] 14 we have considered that was a t time
[847.8s] Christ was on his way to the Cross he
[849.4s] was just about to be um betrayed by his
[852.4s] disciples he was about to be denied by
[854.6s] another of his disciple and of course he
[856.1s] was going to give his life on the
[858.1s] cross yet he was encouraging despite all
[860.7s] this he was encouraging his disciples to
[863.3s] be
[864.4s] peaceful how do you think Christ was
[866.6s] able to comfort and this is for you
[868.1s] Michael how do you think Christ was able
[870.0s] to comfort his disciples when he himself
[873.6s] was facing such turmoil in his
[878.0s] life I feel like in the sense that we
[881.4s] talked about faith when it comes to
[883.7s] Faith and like see even what God has
[886.3s] done he's brought people from the dead
[888.9s] you know he's healed leprosy things
[891.4s] people so impossible Christ has done and
[894.9s] given a man doing that assures you that
[897.3s] everything's going to be okay I believe
[899.7s] that's how God gave them or rather
[902.4s] Christ gave them an anchor like
[903.9s] something to hold on to cuz I understand
[906.6s] yes death is very sad death is very
[909.8s] tragic and scary and I feel like in that
[913.6s] way that God performed all those
[915.2s] Miracles and show them that through
[917.5s] God's power everything is possible I
[919.9s] feel like that's how he both comforted
[922.2s] them and gave them an
[923.8s] anchor in that time of trouble yeah Ruby
[927.6s] uh to add on what Mel said MH in John
[931.9s] 16:33 it says these things I have spoken
[935.0s] to you that in me you may have peace in
[937.4s] the world you are the world you will
[939.6s] have tribulations but of good cheer I
[942.8s] have overcome the world so be the fact
[945.7s] that Jesus had gone through this he knew
[949.0s] that it is possible to go through these
[951.4s] tribulations but only if you have the
[953.9s] Peace of Christ in you amen amen um just
[957.5s] something I would like to um
[959.5s] and
[961.5s] um there's some material here that I'm
[963.6s] reading and it says the savior's life on
[965.7s] this Earth though lived in the midst of
[967.3s] conflict was a life of Peace while angry
[971.1s] while angry enemies were constantly
[973.0s] pursuing him he said he that sent me is
[976.8s] with me the father has not left me alone
[979.3s] for I do always those things that please
[984.4s] him so Christ knew that the father was
[987.0s] in him and he was doing the will of his
[988.8s] father father and with that knowledge he
[991.4s] could have peace in the midst of all
[994.8s] this conflict um coming to you um
[1000.6s] Ruby why is Jesus asking his disciples
[1004.9s] to become in spite of what is to come
[1008.2s] upon him why is Christ asking his
[1010.4s] disciples to
[1012.4s] become um I personally think that he's
[1015.4s] asking them that so that they don't
[1018.5s] necess neily focus on what is going to
[1021.2s] happen but focus on now how they're
[1024.4s] going to now continue spreading the word
[1026.4s] of God and making new disciples even
[1029.2s] when he's not here because the fact that
[1031.5s] he will not be on Earth with them
[1033.5s] doesn't mean that the work of the Lord
[1035.3s] is going to stop so it's basically Jesus
[1039.0s] telling them that look at the bigger
[1040.8s] picture as much as I'm not going to be
[1042.6s] here I will still leave a helper I'll
[1045.6s] leave the helper with you who's the Holy
[1047.1s] Spirit and he's going to show you these
[1049.7s] things and remind you these things but
[1052.0s] this doesn't mean that now the work that
[1054.7s] we have begun together should end up
[1057.1s] stopping just because I'm not here amen
[1059.2s] amen actually yeah uh as Ruby read
[1062.7s] earlier yes she said the Bible is saying
[1065.5s] that the worry adds nothing to anything
[1068.6s] so you might as well just continue the
[1071.4s] work
[1073.3s] yes that's good
[1075.3s] logic you said something important um
[1078.8s] and it's found in John 14: 16 and I'll
[1081.4s] read and I will pray the father and he
[1083.8s] will give you another helper that he may
[1085.9s] abide in you forever verse 17 the spirit
[1089.4s] of Truth whom the world cannot receive
[1091.6s] because it neither sees him nor knows
[1093.2s] him but you know him for dwells in you
[1095.3s] and will be with you and will be in you
[1098.2s] so Christ was not going to leave the
[1100.4s] disciples alone so he tell them I leave
[1104.2s] you my
[1105.4s] peace and on top of that I do not leave
[1107.5s] you alone I leave you with a Helper and
[1111.0s] I go that he may come um and you say
[1114.7s] that very well um another reason why um
[1118.1s] maybe Mike read for us John 14:13 and uh
[1121.8s] 14 John 1413 and 14 says and whatever
[1126.6s] you ask in my name that I will do that
[1130.0s] the father may be glorified in the son
[1133.0s] if you ask anything in my name I will do
[1135.3s] it amen so another reason why Christ is
[1138.1s] encouraging his to have peace is
[1140.5s] because whatever you ask in my name I
[1143.3s] will do do for you so I will send you a
[1146.8s] Helper and on top of that I'm not just
[1148.8s] going to s in the Sky by and by to sit
[1151.4s] and wait but I'm going to intercede on
[1154.2s] your behalf with the with the father
[1157.4s] let's move on
[1159.4s] um so uh moving to the next question I
[1162.8s] think um this is for you um Nelson um
[1166.4s] Jesus promised peace to his disciples um
[1169.9s] John 14:27 um Michael you read that for
[1173.1s] us um Isaiah 9:6 also calls Christ The
[1178.6s] Prince of Peace yeah what does it mean
[1181.8s] to find peace in
[1183.2s] Christ and how do we find peace in
[1186.7s] Christ I think uh in the lesson there's
[1189.9s] a part on the Sunday section I can just
[1193.5s] read
[1196.4s] this uh it says mhm Christ words to
[1199.9s] Peter yes assur us that when our
[1202.5s] circumstances cause anxiety we can find
[1205.4s] peace in dwelling on what is God what
[1207.9s] God is doing for us this is transcending
[1211.1s] peace that comes through the falling the
[1213.0s] way the truth and the life depending on
[1215.8s] God through prayer and expressing love
[1218.3s] to God through obedience to his word so
[1221.3s] I think the peace in Christ is just
[1223.6s] following the way Jesus and being
[1226.1s] obedient to the world amen amen amen are
[1230.0s] very well
[1231.7s] put back to coming to you Michael the
[1234.5s] the the verse that you just read for us
[1236.1s] John 14 27 which says peace I live with
[1239.4s] you my peace I give to you not as the
[1241.5s] world gives do I give to you let not
[1243.8s] your heart be troubled neither Let It Be
[1248.4s] Afraid what is the difference in your
[1250.8s] opinion what is the difference between
[1253.2s] worldly peace and the peace that you get
[1255.8s] from
[1256.7s] Christ um okay when I was looking at
[1259.4s] this when I was looking at this study
[1262.4s] during the week I was thinking about
[1265.7s] whether like the difference here between
[1268.6s] peace from Jesus and worldly peace and
[1271.3s] for me what I got from it is that I
[1273.6s] would say worldly peace usually involves
[1275.9s] other people you know we talk about wars
[1278.5s] conflicts so worldly peace would involve
[1282.1s] you me Ruby Nelson all of us together
[1285.5s] but I think about the peace that Jesus
[1287.9s] gives you that is like one onone that's
[1290.5s] now between you and Jesus there's no one
[1293.2s] else involved in it so that's just
[1295.5s] between you and Jesus all your personal
[1298.4s] vendettas between you and Jesus you know
[1301.0s] worldly peace also other way another way
[1303.0s] people get worldly peace is like for
[1305.0s] example those who are trouble they seek
[1306.6s] professional help like two counselors
[1308.6s] yes they can involv other other people
[1312.3s] around you but for peace from Jesus
[1315.6s] that's always it between you and Jesus
[1319.0s] I like I really like what you say um not
[1323.3s] only involves other people but also
[1325.7s] circumstances circumstances so wild
[1328.8s] peace probably could also
[1331.2s] involve the absence of war or turmoil
[1334.6s] right like there's nothing happening
[1336.0s] around us so we are peaceful yeah but
[1338.2s] the peace from Christ you could say even
[1340.0s] in the midst of external turmoil we
[1343.2s] still have that peace like Christ was
[1345.5s] going to the Cross Christ was going to
[1347.1s] betrayed by disciples and and what not
[1349.3s] but he still had had the PE so that's
[1352.4s] that's very I say a difference you could
[1354.5s] say is that the worldly peace is always
[1358.3s] temporary but then the Peace of Jesus is
[1361.1s] eternal
[1362.6s] Yes actually one thing I that when we
[1365.8s] look at the lesson and uh understanding
[1369.8s] biblical peace one statement that stood
[1372.1s] out for me was it says Jesus offers a
[1375.5s] piece not tied to circumstances but
[1378.0s] rooted in the Assurance of Salvation In
[1380.8s] God's Presence amen amen amen I I will
[1384.3s] not add to that unless I spoil um Ruby
[1388.6s] um this is where you come
[1390.3s] in what gives Christ the
[1393.1s] authority to give peace why what what
[1397.0s] gives Christ authority to give peace um
[1400.2s] I think what gives him the authority to
[1402.3s] give pece is the fact that he went
[1406.0s] through should I say the hard thing that
[1409.1s] you could go through the people that you
[1411.4s] have come to save yeah basically did not
[1415.6s] want anything with you yes and he
[1418.0s] overcame that and he overcame that
[1420.9s] because he had God by him and because he
[1423.9s] is the Prince of Peace he's the one who
[1427.4s] is the Liberator of all this should I
[1430.6s] say this internal conflicts we have this
[1432.9s] external conflict that is what that's
[1435.8s] the power that gives him the the power
[1438.8s] that gives him the authority auth to to
[1441.4s] give peace no absolutely you're very
[1443.3s] right because in um John
[1445.2s] [Music]
[1446.4s] 16:33 it says these things I have spoken
[1449.8s] to you that in me you may have peace in
[1453.6s] the world you will have tribulation but
[1456.1s] be of good cheer I have what I have
[1459.0s] overcome the world so the fact that as
[1461.7s] we said the fact that he has overcome
[1463.6s] the world he has been there done that
[1466.4s] right he knows what it's about
[1468.9s] and he knows how to give peace now to
[1472.3s] the last question and um probably I'll
[1475.4s] throw it to each one of you to say even
[1478.0s] as you give the final
[1480.1s] remarks Isaiah calls Christ The Prince
[1483.4s] of Peace when Christ was born um the
[1486.6s] Angels announced glory to God in the
[1489.6s] highest peace on Earth and Good Will to
[1492.3s] men Christ continually spoke peace to
[1495.4s] his disciples and left them with the
[1497.3s] message of
[1498.9s] peace what does this tell us about God
[1503.0s] and His Thoughts towards us Nelson
[1506.4s] starting with you as you give your final
[1507.9s] remarks I think there's a there's a
[1510.8s] theme that we have peace peace always
[1513.1s] peace I think God just wants us to live
[1516.4s] in peace he doesn't want us to be
[1518.8s] worried
[1519.8s] troubled in peace or yeah because it's
[1523.4s] possible if we trust in God amen amen
[1527.2s] Michael uh
[1528.9s] um I picked out on reconciliation yes is
[1532.8s] you find that reconciliation occurs and
[1535.3s] people are you could say like have
[1537.3s] trouble between the two and you find
[1539.6s] that even
[1541.5s] before um before Christ coming there was
[1544.6s] a lot of trouble you'd see a lot of
[1546.9s] God's Wrath especially in Old Testament
[1548.9s] see a lot of God's Wrath but when it
[1551.1s] comes to new T New Testament yes you'd
[1554.6s] see now like a calm God you know a God
[1557.8s] who like
[1559.0s] who really cares and is at peace even
[1562.0s] like now we reconnected with God through
[1564.1s] Jesus Christ so yeah amen interesting uh
[1568.2s] perspective yes Ru uh what I pick from
[1571.4s] this is that Jesus knows that we have
[1577.2s] all these anxieties we have all these
[1579.1s] fears that's why throughout the Bible
[1581.4s] not even not only in the verses that we
[1583.8s] have been able to pick out he has
[1586.0s] continuously told us to not be afraid
[1588.0s] even in 2 Timothy 1:7 basically says
[1592.4s] that God gave us a spirit of power love
[1594.8s] and sound mind and not a spirit of fear
[1597.2s] so he knows that these things are not
[1599.5s] this fear anxiety are not of of God
[1602.8s] these are feelings that come from the
[1606.3s] devil and that's what he uses to corrupt
[1608.7s] our mind and the fact that Jesus I mean
[1611.7s] God has continually explain that
[1614.5s] throughout the Bible it means that he is
[1617.6s] there with us
[1618.8s] his word through that just reassures us
[1622.3s] that he's there with us even in our
[1625.0s] fears and anxieties when we believe and
[1627.5s] trust in him and have him by our side
[1630.0s] we'll be able to go through all this
[1632.2s] amen amen amen and so there we have it
[1635.5s] dear viewer We Begin where we
[1637.7s] started John 14:1 let not your heart be
[1640.9s] troubled you believe in God believe also
[1643.6s] in me in my father's house are many
[1646.0s] mansions if it were not so I would have
[1648.4s] told you I go and prepare a place for
[1650.9s] you and if I go and prepare a place for
[1653.0s] you I will come again and receive you
[1655.4s] unto myself that there where I am there
