FULL TRANSCRIPT:
good morning good evening good afternoon from wherever you're joining us kibana and welcome uh my name is bism lumba and I'll be and welcome to the Teens book club uh today we are going to be discussing the book uh When God Says remember but before we get into it uh let's say a prayer dear father in Heaven oh Lord God we come before you father at this time we'd like to thank you so much oh Father for an opportunity to come here and to read the a word now father please be with us in Jesus name I pray amen amen well ladies and gentlemen today we'll be discussing chapter five an advance on eternity and with me here I have SOA to help me SOA say hi hello my name is sair and I'm a teen I'm so excited to dive into this chapter M fantastic so I'll just proceed by giving a short introduction on uh chapter 5 and Advance on eternity so mark fley first of all introduces us to the concept that we are one that every single person in this world was created by God and that essentially we are from one family and he quotes a wonderful verse in the book of Acts chapter 17 which says and I'll read it acts 17: 24-26 it says God who made the world and everything in it since he's Lord of Heaven and Earth uh does not dwell in the temples made with hands nor is he worshiped with men hands as though he needed anything since he gives life to all breath and to all things verse 26 note he says and he has made made from one blood every nation of men to dwell on the face of the Earth and has determined their pre-appointment so despite the differences that we might see uh uh in regard to who we are you know day to day the differences that we might see in each other God has made each and one of us from one blood and essentially the true sense of selfworth the true identity of all human beings stems from creation m you know indeed it's pointed out that creation provides us with a sense of being you know creation provides us with our origin story the greatest origin story ever told that we are created by one God and that he has placed us here on us uh intentionally right he contrasts that with the story of evolution you know and he says that Evolution provides no moral ethic for our being yes Evolution provides no origin for us in fact if anything it says that our being is all an accident right and so just to bring in saira uh shortly I just had a question for you uh saira um you know now having seen that God has provided us uh uh with this ethic of creation uh and and particularly with the Sabbath how does the Sabbath come in as a as a symbol of God's eternal power and creative power as well and his authority over us okay first of all this is an amazing chapter an advance on eternity and so I would like to think that we have this Advance on eternity when we are connected to Christ eternity is now see Mark Finley state that eternity is not just a future promise but a present reality and that comes with the transformative power we are transformed when we're living connected to Christ and there's a hope and Assurance so our concept of God's grace and God's love gives us an advance on Eternal joy and eternal peace but to really address your question and how the Sabbath acts not only as a symbol of God's eternal power but also of Salvation see I'd like to think that the Sabbath invites Believers to rest in the Assurance of the complete and eternal power power of God to save and that's directly connected to Salvation see Mark Finley states that it is a meaningful symbol of righteousness by faith and not legalism and salvation is stemmed purely from our faith from the grace of God because of our faith and so as we are in the weak we are seizing we're constantly working on our Salvation that's our efforts but the Sabbath gives us a pause so we are seizing to create our own salvation based on our own efforts it's a really deep reminder that we rest in him for our Salvation God has the power to send his loving son to die for our sins and that salvation is brought to us because of his love that's a very interesting point that you bring out there uh and I think I do agree with it you know the the the fourth Commandment essentially tells us that uh we ought to remember the Sabbath day to keep it holy and that you know we're given the six days but the reasoning behind it is that God rested on the Sabbath day yes uh and then he blessed it and then he Sanctified it you know and that essentially the Sabbath day is uh inherently etched uh inherently uh etched with creation uh I just wanted to ask uh uh you know is it a reassuring message to us uh that we have that we have the Sabbath to remember uh God's creation you know uh the the consistency of it all and you know just week on a week by week basis that we are called to remember the Sabbath day and God's creative activity on it is it reassuring yeah how reassuring do you think that is for us I think it's absolutely reassuring in the sense of God has been steadfast his consistency has been demonstrated To Us by his love his care his grace his judgment as well but now now he's calling for our consistency and our consistency requires Allegiance and so that weekly reminder of his relationship with us of his Redemption is amazing and reassuring of our actual salvation um we talked you look you talked about how it is both the memorial of a the creation but also of our Salvation to have the Sabbath day is to break and pause to stand in awe of God God's care and empathy for Humanity yeah that's a very good now just turning back uh to the chapter that you know the the the the the the title of the chapter is an advance on eternity yeah uh and just looking at at now uh The Book of Revelation 6:7 and this is you know the Three Angels message uh the first Angel message I'll just read it for you uh it says then I saw another Angel flying in the midst of Heaven having the Everlasting gospel to preach to those who dwell on the earth to Every Nation tribe and tongue and people saying with a loud voice fear God and give glory to him for the hour of his judgment has come and worship him who made Heaven and Earth the Sea and the Springs of water so ideally you know even in that last message still proclaiming God as the Creator uh proclaiming that we ought to worship him because of his creative power uh and and and and and and essentially that uh his his ability to create his his creative work has necessitated us to worship Him and and that now we are we are his and we ought to worship him because of that particular aspect but uh turning back to S I don't know if you had a question on that but I just wanted to bring now um another aspect of of of the Sabbath and salvation you know um now ideally I know that you've spoken about uh the Sabbath and salvation being uh the Sabbath being a symbol of Salvation um but particularly I just wanted to ask you know um looking at even uh in the Book of Revelation chapter 22 when God promises that even in the new Earth we'll keep the Sabbath um uh not only is it is it is it a part of God's Own ability to to to create but also a part of God's Own ability to save yes and I don't know if you had any insight on that or made any addition to that as well right um I think it's well said absolutely and so as we are keeping the Sabbath day what is happening is that we're not just engaging in this you know this mundane activity of going to church and saying hello to people and fellow Believers Fellowship is necessary but it's also resting in God's power to save resting in the fact that we are without and God can actually transform us and and renew us and rejuvenate this relationship and so church is always always described I think in teens's class as well as the sick as a hospital MH um where patients are here we are patients we are people who need care who need attention um and so God is really going through the surgical process of you are granted a free consultation if you will every single week and that consultation can consist of confession of repentance but most L renewal and so God's power to save allows us to depend more deeply on him he is the great physician and he can renew our hearts because our hearts are in it are in their true Wicked condition but I'd also like to touch on something in the fact that who are we to not keep the Sabbath and yet God is the Lord Jesus is the lord of the Sabbath and he too kept the Sabbath MH we look at Hebrews chapter 4 vers 9 to1 and it says there remains then a Sabbath rest for the people of God for anyone who enters God's rest also rests from their works just as God did from his MH and this is coming from a chapter of a Sabbath rest for the people of God God rested and created this rest for us for physical mental spiritual renewal and that was extremely intentional and so as we progress in the chapters and see um why the Sabbath is necessary let us not take man's word for it to change a day to change a purpose but recognize that God has the ultimate Authority yeah to implement rest in our lives but most importantly to save us yeah yeah great I think I think that's very insightful um as we come to the close of just analyzing this chapter I think there's a point there that uh I just like us to touch on a chip or a snippet of Eternity the Sabbath just being a moment of Eternity you know God calls us to his rest uh as you have so rightly said uh but that's also just a a a sort of a taste of how eternal life is going to be um particularly uh looking at at at at what has been said in in Isaiah chapter 66 verse 23 and I'll just read it um and it says that you know from New Moon to New Moon if I can just paraphrase as I as I as I open it um Isaiah 66:23 and it says it and it shall come to pass that from one new moon to another and from one Sabbath to another All Flesh shall come to worship me says the Lord and so S I just wanted to ask and just to bring you in as we as we as we look to close um how does the Sabbath play into eternity uh how is the Sabbath now here on Earth where we are at tast of Eternity yes and so back to even her childhood like Sabbath school have a little Heaven down here mhm and I really want to paint this picture of how heaven will look like we are not quite sure on the details but we do know it is a great place and most importantly that dwelling in the presence of God is a greatest joy and so God does never never want his people to lack the opportunity to be in his presence and you see this is the is Israelites um in Exile even coming from the Persian Empire God offered religious liberty he allowed them to rebuild the Temple he allowed them to rebuild these walls to ensure that they have a place to convene with him indeed and so what eternity looks like is being in the presence of God fulf mhm that experience is magnificent if I would put a word yeah and this glimpse of Eternity the Sabbath is offering us a hint of what God's presence in in its in its real true form looks like but it is our choice to make as we choose goded let us be aware of the Everlasting promises that he has provided for us indeed indeed and so ladies and gentlemen as you know we look to close the Sabbath is a sort of Advance on eternity you know when you go to your boss and you ask for an advance on your salary that's what God has really done with the Sabbath you know he has called us apart just uh within a moment in time here on Earth to help us experience his rest and to help us remember his creative power and who he is to us right and so I just want to uh uh ask you and to really encourage you to pick up this book and read uh When God Says remember uh and and and and just dive in and look at some of the insight that are there I'm sure you'll enjoy it yes yeah s do you have any closing remarks um nothing much I think I pray that the rest of the Holy Spirit Will engulf every single person here everyone who's watching um and you as well me as well also but just for us to reflect on what eternity looks like and what God presents because God has presented his case in such a beautiful manner but there is a devil too who seeks to deceive us mhm but there's a great great hope that we can equally receive God's rest amen amen and with that let's say a prayer dear father in Heaven oh Lord God we come before you thank you so much oh Father for an advance on eternity now father as we part be with us keep us and protect us in Jesus name I I pray amen join us again for chapter 6 for Bible answers to your questions amen

TIMESTAMPED TRANSCRIPT:
[0.2s] good morning good evening good afternoon
[1.8s] from wherever you're joining us kibana
[4.0s] and welcome uh my name is bism lumba and
[7.4s] I'll be and welcome to the Teens book
[9.1s] club uh today we are going to be
[11.0s] discussing the book uh When God Says
[13.5s] remember but before we get into it uh
[15.9s] let's say a prayer dear father in Heaven
[18.0s] oh Lord God we come before you father at
[20.2s] this time we'd like to thank you so much
[22.0s] oh Father for an opportunity to come
[23.6s] here and to read the a word now father
[25.9s] please be with us in Jesus name I pray
[28.8s] amen amen well ladies and gentlemen
[31.0s] today we'll be discussing chapter five
[33.2s] an advance on eternity and with me here
[36.4s] I have SOA to help me SOA say hi hello
[39.2s] my name is sair and I'm a teen I'm so
[41.9s] excited to dive into this chapter M
[44.9s] fantastic so I'll just proceed by giving
[46.9s] a short introduction on uh chapter 5 and
[50.5s] Advance on eternity so mark fley first
[53.3s] of all introduces us to the concept that
[55.4s] we are one that every single person in
[58.2s] this world was created by God and that
[60.8s] essentially we are from one family and
[63.4s] he quotes a wonderful verse in the book
[65.1s] of Acts chapter 17 which says and I'll
[68.3s] read it acts 17: 24-26 it says God who
[72.4s] made the world and everything in it
[74.2s] since he's Lord of Heaven and Earth uh
[76.6s] does not dwell in the temples made with
[78.5s] hands nor is he worshiped with men hands
[80.8s] as though he needed anything since he
[82.8s] gives life to all breath and to all
[86.4s] things verse 26 note he says and he has
[89.7s] made made from one blood every nation of
[92.4s] men to dwell on the face of the Earth
[94.6s] and has determined their pre-appointment
[98.9s] so despite the differences that we might
[101.4s] see uh uh in regard to who we are you
[104.7s] know day to day the differences that we
[106.5s] might see in each other God has made
[109.0s] each and one of us from one blood and
[112.0s] essentially the true sense of selfworth
[114.7s] the true identity of all human beings
[117.6s] stems from creation m you know indeed
[121.4s] it's pointed out that creation provides
[123.5s] us with a sense of being you know
[125.8s] creation provides us with our origin
[129.1s] story the greatest origin story ever
[131.6s] told that we are created by one God and
[134.6s] that he has placed us here on us uh
[137.6s] intentionally right he contrasts that
[140.8s] with the story of evolution you know and
[143.1s] he says that Evolution provides no moral
[145.6s] ethic for our being yes Evolution
[148.2s] provides no
[150.6s] origin for us in fact if anything it
[152.7s] says that our being is all an accident
[155.8s] right and so just to bring in saira uh
[158.9s] shortly I just had a question for you uh
[161.5s] saira um you know now having seen that
[166.3s] God has provided us uh uh with this
[169.1s] ethic of creation uh and and
[172.5s] particularly with the Sabbath how does
[174.6s] the Sabbath come in as a as a symbol of
[178.1s] God's eternal power and creative power
[180.0s] as well and his authority over us okay
[183.7s] first of all this is an amazing chapter
[186.2s] an advance on eternity and so I would
[189.1s] like to think that we have this Advance
[191.4s] on eternity when we are connected to
[193.9s] Christ eternity is now see Mark Finley
[197.4s] state that eternity is not just a future
[200.6s] promise but a present reality and that
[203.6s] comes with the transformative power we
[205.8s] are transformed when we're living
[207.6s] connected to Christ and there's a hope
[210.6s] and Assurance so our concept of God's
[214.0s] grace and God's
[215.8s] love gives us an advance on Eternal joy
[219.4s] and eternal peace but to really address
[222.1s] your question and how the Sabbath acts
[224.8s] not only as a symbol of God's eternal
[227.8s] power but also of Salvation see I'd like
[231.5s] to think that the Sabbath invites
[233.8s] Believers to rest in the Assurance of
[237.2s] the complete and eternal power power of
[240.7s] God to save and that's directly
[244.0s] connected to Salvation see Mark Finley
[246.8s] states that it is a meaningful symbol of
[250.0s] righteousness by faith and not legalism
[254.4s] and salvation is stemmed purely from our
[257.0s] faith from the grace of God because of
[260.3s] our faith and so as we are in the weak
[263.2s] we are seizing we're constantly working
[265.8s] on our Salvation that's our efforts but
[268.3s] the Sabbath gives us a pause so we are
[270.5s] seizing to create our own salvation
[273.8s] based on our own efforts it's a really
[276.7s] deep reminder that we rest in him for
[279.4s] our Salvation God has the power to send
[283.3s] his loving son to die for our sins and
[286.6s] that salvation is brought to us because
[290.2s] of his love that's a very interesting
[292.3s] point that you bring out there uh and I
[294.7s] think I do agree with it you know the
[296.7s] the the fourth Commandment essentially
[298.5s] tells us that uh we ought to remember
[301.2s] the Sabbath day to keep it holy and that
[303.3s] you know we're given the six days but
[305.0s] the reasoning behind it is that God
[306.9s] rested on the Sabbath day yes uh and
[309.2s] then he blessed it and then he
[310.8s] Sanctified it you know and that
[313.0s] essentially the Sabbath day is uh
[315.7s] inherently etched uh inherently uh
[318.5s] etched with creation uh I just wanted to
[321.0s] ask uh uh you know is it a reassuring
[325.2s] message to us uh that we have that we
[328.5s] have the Sabbath to remember uh God's
[331.5s] creation you know uh the the consistency
[334.2s] of it all and you know just week on a
[336.2s] week by week basis that we are called to
[338.3s] remember the Sabbath day and God's
[340.2s] creative activity on it is it reassuring
[342.8s] yeah how reassuring do you think that is
[344.4s] for us I think it's absolutely
[346.5s] reassuring in the sense
[348.8s] of God has been steadfast his
[352.0s] consistency has been demonstrated To Us
[354.4s] by his love his care his grace his
[357.3s] judgment as well but now now he's
[360.2s] calling for our consistency and our
[362.8s] consistency requires Allegiance and so
[365.7s] that weekly reminder of his relationship
[369.2s] with us of his
[371.2s] Redemption is amazing and reassuring of
[374.6s] our actual salvation um we talked you
[377.6s] look you talked about how it is both the
[379.4s] memorial of a the creation but also of
[383.1s] our Salvation to have the Sabbath day is
[386.2s] to break and pause to stand in awe of
[389.4s] God God's care and empathy for Humanity
[393.2s] yeah that's a very good now just turning
[395.2s] back uh to the chapter that you know the
[397.5s] the the the the the title of the chapter
[400.3s] is an advance on eternity yeah uh and
[402.6s] just looking at at now uh The Book of
[405.3s] Revelation 6:7 and this is you know the
[407.9s] Three Angels message uh the first Angel
[410.1s] message I'll just read it for you uh it
[412.0s] says then I saw another Angel flying in
[413.8s] the midst of Heaven having the
[415.2s] Everlasting gospel to preach to those
[417.0s] who dwell on the earth to Every Nation
[418.8s] tribe and tongue and people saying with
[421.2s] a loud voice fear God and give glory to
[424.0s] him for the hour of his judgment has
[425.8s] come and worship him who made Heaven and
[428.5s] Earth the Sea and the Springs of water
[431.5s] so ideally you know even in that last
[433.1s] message still proclaiming God as the
[435.6s] Creator uh proclaiming that we ought to
[438.0s] worship him because of his creative
[439.9s] power uh and and and and and and
[442.8s] essentially that uh his his ability to
[446.4s] create his his creative work has
[450.2s] necessitated us to worship Him and and
[452.6s] that now we are we are his and we ought
[454.6s] to worship him because of that
[455.9s] particular aspect but uh turning back to
[458.8s] S I don't know if you had a question on
[460.3s] that but I just wanted to bring now um
[462.7s] another aspect of of of the Sabbath and
[465.2s] salvation you know um now ideally I know
[468.6s] that you've spoken about uh the Sabbath
[470.3s] and salvation being uh the Sabbath being
[472.5s] a symbol of Salvation um but
[474.8s] particularly I just wanted to ask you
[476.5s] know um looking at even uh in the Book
[480.0s] of Revelation chapter 22 when God
[482.2s] promises that even in the new Earth
[483.6s] we'll keep the Sabbath
[486.9s] um uh not only is it is it is it a part
[490.2s] of God's Own ability to to to create but
[494.8s] also a part of God's Own ability to save
[497.4s] yes and I don't know if you had any
[498.8s] insight on that or made any addition to
[501.0s] that as well right um I think it's well
[505.6s] said absolutely and so as we are keeping
[508.8s] the Sabbath day
[510.2s] what is happening is that we're not just
[512.8s] engaging in this you know this mundane
[515.7s] activity of going to church and saying
[518.0s] hello to people and fellow Believers
[519.9s] Fellowship is necessary but it's also
[523.6s] resting in God's power to save resting
[527.8s] in the fact that we are without and God
[530.9s] can actually transform us and and renew
[534.4s] us and rejuvenate this relationship and
[537.8s] so church is always always described I
[540.4s] think in teens's class as well as the
[542.2s] sick as a hospital MH um where patients
[545.6s] are here we are patients we are people
[548.6s] who need care who need
[552.5s] attention um and so God is really going
[556.0s] through the surgical
[557.9s] process of you are granted a free
[560.6s] consultation if you will every single
[563.0s] week and that consultation can consist
[566.0s] of confession of repentance but most L
[570.2s] renewal and so God's power to save
[573.8s] allows us to depend more deeply on him
[576.7s] he is the great physician and he can
[578.8s] renew our hearts because our hearts are
[581.4s] in it are in their true Wicked condition
[585.2s] but I'd also like to touch on something
[586.9s] in the fact that who are we to not keep
[589.8s] the Sabbath and yet God is the Lord
[593.5s] Jesus is the lord of the Sabbath and he
[595.7s] too kept the Sabbath MH we look at
[598.4s] Hebrews chapter 4 vers 9 to1 and it says
[602.7s] there remains then a Sabbath rest for
[606.3s] the people of God for anyone who
[610.1s] enters God's rest also rests from their
[613.5s] works just as God did from his MH and
[619.1s] this is coming from a chapter of a
[620.4s] Sabbath rest for the people of God God
[623.6s] rested and created this rest for us for
[626.9s] physical mental spiritual renewal
[630.2s] and that was extremely intentional and
[632.6s] so as we progress in the chapters and
[635.2s] see um why the Sabbath is necessary let
[639.0s] us not take man's word for it to change
[642.1s] a day to change a purpose but recognize
[645.5s] that God has the ultimate
[648.0s] Authority yeah to implement rest in our
[650.5s] lives but most importantly to save us
[653.2s] yeah yeah great I think I think that's
[655.4s] very insightful um as we come to the
[657.4s] close of just analyzing this chapter I
[659.1s] think there's a point there that uh I
[660.9s] just like us to touch on a chip or a
[663.4s] snippet of Eternity the Sabbath just
[665.7s] being a moment of Eternity you know God
[668.2s] calls us to his rest uh as you have so
[670.6s] rightly said uh but that's also just a a
[674.0s] a sort of a taste of how eternal life is
[676.4s] going to be um particularly uh looking
[679.9s] at at at at what has been said in in
[682.2s] Isaiah chapter 66 verse 23 and I'll just
[684.9s] read it um and it says that you know
[687.5s] from New Moon to New Moon if I can just
[689.6s] paraphrase as I as I as I open it um
[693.7s] Isaiah 66:23 and it says it and it shall
[696.9s] come to pass that from one new moon to
[699.0s] another and from one Sabbath to another
[701.6s] All Flesh shall come to worship me says
[704.6s] the Lord and so S I just wanted to ask
[706.9s] and just to bring you in as we as we as
[708.7s] we look to close um how does the Sabbath
[713.0s] play into eternity uh how is the Sabbath
[716.2s] now here on Earth where we are at tast
[719.7s] of Eternity yes and so back to even her
[723.7s] childhood like Sabbath school have a
[726.9s] little Heaven down here mhm and I really
[730.7s] want to paint this picture of how heaven
[734.1s] will look like we are not quite sure on
[736.7s] the details but we do know it is a great
[740.3s] place and most importantly that dwelling
[742.9s] in the presence of God is a greatest joy
[746.4s] and so God does never never want his
[749.5s] people to lack the opportunity to be in
[752.5s] his presence and you see this is the is
[754.5s] Israelites um in Exile even coming from
[758.3s] the Persian Empire God offered religious
[761.4s] liberty he allowed them to rebuild the
[763.6s] Temple he allowed them to rebuild these
[765.9s] walls to ensure that they have a place
[768.2s] to convene with him indeed and so what
[770.7s] eternity looks like is being in the
[773.8s] presence of God fulf mhm that experience
[777.6s] is magnificent if I would put a word
[780.2s] yeah and this glimpse of
[783.1s] Eternity the Sabbath is offering us a
[787.0s] hint of what God's presence in in its in
[789.5s] its real true form looks like but it is
[793.5s] our choice to make as we choose goded
[796.6s] let us be aware of the Everlasting
[799.3s] promises that he has provided for us
[801.3s] indeed indeed and so ladies and
[802.8s] gentlemen as you know we look to close
[805.0s] the Sabbath is a sort of Advance on
[807.8s] eternity you know when you go to your
[809.8s] boss and you ask for an advance on your
[811.4s] salary that's what God has really done
[813.2s] with the Sabbath you know he has called
[814.8s] us apart just uh within a moment in time
[818.2s] here on Earth to help us experience his
[820.9s] rest and to help us remember his
[823.0s] creative power and who he is to us right
[826.6s] and so I just want to uh uh ask you and
[829.9s] to really encourage you to pick up this
[832.0s] book and read uh When God Says remember
[835.3s] uh and and and and just dive in and look
[838.3s] at some of the insight that are there
[839.7s] I'm sure you'll enjoy it yes yeah s do
[843.2s] you have any closing remarks um nothing
[845.5s] much I think I pray that the rest of the
[848.7s] Holy Spirit Will engulf every single
[851.6s] person here everyone who's watching um
[854.3s] and you as well me as well also but just
[858.0s] for us to reflect on what eternity looks
[861.2s] like and what God presents because God
[864.1s] has presented his case in such a
[865.6s] beautiful manner but there is a devil
[868.0s] too who seeks to deceive us mhm but
[870.8s] there's a great great hope that we can
[873.6s] equally receive God's rest amen amen and
[878.2s] with that let's say a prayer dear father
[880.5s] in Heaven oh Lord God we come before you
[882.6s] thank you so much oh Father for an
[884.4s] advance on eternity now father as we
[887.7s] part be with us keep us and protect us
[890.2s] in Jesus name I I pray amen join us
[893.2s] again for chapter 6 for Bible answers to
[896.1s] your questions amen
