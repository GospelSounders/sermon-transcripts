FULL TRANSCRIPT:
planted in Christ planted is in Christ is a sub theme of our overarching uh uh strategic Focus theme rooted and growing and because you cannot root until you are planted we can only be planted and so uh flourish continue to grow root and grow when we are planted in Christ praise the Lord and so I am taking uh I'm requesting that we take a moment so that we look at the aspects that are there in a successful planting let's pray heavenly father and before your congregation as we take this brief moment to look at scripture Lord may you speak through me may you impress your word and touch my lips so that Lord you can be seen you can be heard may your name be glorified as you draw close as you uh draw Us close to you and as you reflect in our life may Glory and Honor be yours in Jesus name we pray amen uh the scripture as uh we have been read is in Ephesians chapter 3 verse 17 Ephesians 3:1 17 it can be projected by our able communication team thank you so much my name is Pastor Steven tro and my colleague are around and what do we say to our pastors amen uh that Christ May dwell in your hearts by faith that you being rooted and grounded in love may understand that is verse 18 the depth the length the height the width of God's love which is beyond understanding which canot be con conceptualized fully we can only touch and have uh that expansive but we cannot completely exhaust the understanding of God's love and so I invite you friend so that with this rooting with this grounding with this growth that comes by the living seed you and I can understand the specific function which God plays and which we as the ones who are planted ought to play as we have heard the song the young people sang and said whatever situations we may be in we need to be there help our neighbors be kind to them speak a word of kindness to them a story is told of Mel Gibson Mel Gibson is the one who directed in the whole Hollywood the passion um film The Passion movie where Jesus reenacting of the passion what happened in that moment towards Christ being crucified the Judgment Hall and the carrying of the Cross and even the crucifixion so Mel Gibson was sited in a restaurant just outside and as he had ordered his cup of coffee he sat there and sipped it peacefully but you know when you think that you are resting quickly you are surprised by something this is the nature of Life peace is always interrupted by something our life of tranquil can be trouble we may not have it fully because there are things that interrupt this Blissful moment and so as he was there a barefooted homeless child a girl of about 13 years came by and asked a very important question innocently he approached him and with fear she asked do you know a man known as Jesus who he is and this very celebrated man wondered what to say looking at this girl he realized that this girl really needed to know about this Jesus and so he said yeah I know something about him so she asked how is he I would like to know more about him and then this man said what I know about Jesus is that he forgives and give men second CH John says over and over again he helps people to start over again and this girl in her innocence looked at this man and asked even starting again even for someone like me I think I have made so many mistakes and I've done stuff and I'm not fit Mel Gibson told this girl you are wrong s asked you don't know what I'm going through how do you know and Gibson said he himself had hit the rock bottom bottom his family was disrupted because of his own wrong choices he had done very hurtful things to the people he loved and she said when he had hit the rock bottom the only thing that he could do in that pit is to look up and God helped him come up and God used a friend and that friend did not give up on him he helped him and God used that friend and he was able to discover the loving gracious father and so this girl looked up and there she was and she wondered how she was going to start and she asked Gibson do you know that it is difficult to find the way have you ever been lost so that you don't even know whether there's a way not even finding that way and Gibson told him I've been there and I know I know how it feels to be so lost to appear as if people do not care whether you find that way but I'm here and you can start from where you have started even by asking a question and with this Gibson told this girl you can start there and and I can help you he took a paper wrote the address of a children's home and at the back of the paper he wrote his own uh telephone number and told the girl go to the Children's Home and while there you can call me wherever you need help that was a touching moment the people who were passing by wondered and they stop to listen to the conversation as they listen some were encouraged and they were touched and one woman said are you talking about faith and Gibson said yes we are talking about faith and how we can find Hope and this woman said with tears I needed to hear this friend we too need to hear this as we are in a world that is corrupted as we are in this life that has no certainty as like this girl who was barefooted maybe often that is why she was homeless she yearn to find the way to God and today I want us to know that we too have been found there's someone who has sought after us and even our question our desires we can find answers by looking into scripture as pastorate and as the leadership of this church we have approved the Strategic focus and every Wednesday we have this program where we shall be elating on these topics that form the Strategic Focus theme rooted and growing but as I have said we can only be rooted and grow because we have been planted and so I want us to look at these four areas and then we will be done very quickly because time is not with us we in planting we know because most of us live in The Villages and we have grown or planted something before in our life we need the farmer for any planting to happen we need the seed we need the soil where this can be planted in and we need a conducive environment or the climate these are the four conditions that are needed so that any plant can be nourished my friend my brother I need you to know that this gracious father who loves us just as we have not found ourselves alive on our own as he created all things and placed it where it is you are not an accident he caed that in time like this you would be born that in times like this you can find yourself listening to this Gospel wherever you are even if you're following in our national television KBC and we thank God for them our following through our social Media Forum I want you to know that the Lord has a plan for you you are here because he chose that you would be alive and you're not just a statistics you are part of his great plan Hallelujah and so my friend scripture points to God being the farmer right from Genesis chapter 1 ver 11-13 says God commanded that grass and plants would grow and so it happened he is the one who designed Ed and is the one who commanded every plant to come so God is the farmer nature as it is came from his own plan he designed the conditions where this Earth oscillates and moves around the the around in the universe is the one who designed the sun to be where it is and every position is perfect because he is a deci this planet this Earth the soil as it is is the one who made sure that in the Strutter the Richer part of the soil with all the elements and the condition that can sustain plants are where they are is the one who played the Seas and the lakes and the rivers and the fountains of waters where they are so that life can be supported God is the farmer God is the Ser you read in Isaiah 51 and vers uh 5: 1 to7 and God is the one who says I made my people to be like a garden God is the farmer when you read in Matthew 13 where we find some examples in this Parable that Jesus told he told this Parable and then he made it clear in vers 37 and 39 in Matthew 13 what do we read in Matthew 13: 37 and 39 my Bible says this that he answered and said to them he who SWS The Good Seed is the Son of God the field is the world the good seeds are the sons of the Kingdom but the tears are the sons of the wicked one the enemy who s them is the devil the Harvest is the End of the Age and the reapers are the Angels friends before the reaping before the Harvest whereby you and I when we are planted as good seed We join in the Harvest and we are asked to pray to the Lord of the Harvest to send the Reapers into his harvest my friend I want to invite you to think through this so that we may understand our place in this Garden in the kingdom of God hallelujah and so as we have seen that God is both the so is the one who created the seed is the one who created the conditions for the seed to be able to grow to be able to take root by germinating in rich soil that can support life so these seed are in various are various kinds we have crops that we propagate through Vines like potatoes sweet potatoes for instance we have graps which we can propagate through Vines proceeds and so here Jesus says in John 15 that he is the vine and we Believers are the branches if we abide in him and he in us then we can be assured of bearing fruit my friend be whether you are propagated by Vine or by by seed which is the word of God that is preached when you take root in Christ you take the Life of Christ himself that is why he says you abide in me and I in you and you shall bear much fruit it's only by abiding in Christ it is only by understanding that whether it is the seed of Vine we find our true meaning and place when we seek our way and yield and surrender to the Lord to rule over our life Hallelujah and so this planting and being planted in Christ is a theme that the gospel presents to us in various aspects this is a theme that we get to know that all by believing in the word of God that seed that is planted in our thoughts takes shape and makes us live a holy life in James 1 verse 18 it tells us by his own good will he gave us birth through the word of Truth and in Romans 10 verse 17 it says therefore faith comes by hearing the gospel which is the seed and when we hear the gospel which is the seed when we believe in this gospel then that gospel transform forms us into sons and daughters and therefore this seed become the sons of the Kingdom so the planting with the word of God the gospel by Jesus coming taking humanity and by preaching this and for anyone who listens struggling with various issues of this life like this girl who came to male Gibson we have questions on how we can live a meaningful life a life that has purpose a life that we can look at and be satisfied and the only secret is by listening to the word of God how can a young man make his way perfect how can an old man live and bear fruit in his old age by trusting in the Lord we can be like a plant planted by the water front where we have all the resources and we can flourish and bear fruit in All Seasons Hallelujah and so how can a young man live his life perfectly It Is by reading by hearing Ing and following the word of God as we are here young people in schools and in various circumstances it is time in this Dark World in this dark moment in these uncertain days to return to the seed to be planted and become the Sons and Daughters of the king of King and become the princes and the prince of the holy loving God hallelujah let's listen to God let us know that as Believers this seed changes our status it changes who we are naturally because the devil planted seed by preaching the false gospel that you will not die but by obedience to God and his word we are planted I just want to read the last portion as we put together that we have good soil and that good soil are conditions we ourself can generate the book of the letter second 1 Corinthians sorry Chapter 1: 30 and 31 I will read and then summarize and say say that the soil and the climate are the climate comes from God as in Matthew 13:1 18-23 the soil is our own Hearts how we listen and pay attention what is it that we do and so if we listen and pay attention we shall be save in 1 Corinthians 3 verse No 1 verse 30 and 31 it says but as of him but of him sorry but of him you are in Christ Jesus who became for us wisdom from God and righteousness and sanctification and Redemption that as it is written he who glories let him glory in the Lord hallelujah so that friend our status our strength our hope our joy in the Lord is not because of our own effort when we listen to the gospel when we invite and take time to read as the adventurers or the young uh teachers were saying Jesus is the bread of life but if we don't eat bread we are going to be weak therefore if we don't read the word of God we will not H be be strong this word that was brought to us by the H the the the medium of angels through the Holy Spirit and the prophets it has a divine origin when we believe live we will live a Divine Life let us accept this seed to be in us and it is not in us but by believing then we are planted in Christ Jesus and in Christ Jesus we can bear fruit how many with me are saying Lord I want to be the good soil plant your word in my life let me bear fruit because I'll take root in Christ and I will bear much fruit for you if you are there you can stand on your feet as we seek the Lord in prayer as the Chesters are singing listen to this song about growing strong and being a good harvest

[28.8s] continue to grow root and grow when we
[35.1s] are planted in Christ praise the Lord
[39.0s] and so I am taking uh I'm requesting
[43.8s] that we take a moment so that we look at
[47.2s] the aspects that are there in a
[51.3s] successful planting let's pray heavenly
[55.5s] father and before your congregation as
[58.6s] we take this brief moment
[60.6s] to look at scripture Lord may you speak

[83.5s] in our life may Glory and Honor be yours
[86.7s] in Jesus name we pray amen
[91.0s] uh the scripture as uh we have been read
[95.8s] is in Ephesians chapter 3 verse
[104.8s] 17
[106.6s] Ephesians 3:1 17 it can be projected by
[112.0s] our able communication team thank you so
[115.2s] much my name is Pastor Steven tro and my
[119.4s] colleague
[120.7s] are around and what do we say to our
[125.0s] pastors
[128.6s] amen uh that
[132.0s] Christ May dwell in your hearts by faith
[136.8s] that you being rooted and grounded in
[141.6s] love may understand that is verse 18 the
[146.9s] depth the length the height the width of
[150.6s] God's love which is beyond understanding
[156.4s] which canot be con conceptualized fully
[161.8s] we can only touch and have uh that
[166.7s] expansive but we cannot completely
[170.3s] exhaust the understanding of God's love
[174.0s] and so I invite you friend so that with
[178.0s] this rooting
[180.3s] with this
[181.9s] grounding with this growth that comes by
[186.3s] the living seed you and I can understand
[191.9s] the
[193.1s] specific function which God plays and
[198.3s] which we as the ones who are
[202.5s] planted ought to
[206.6s] play as
[210.0s] we have heard the
[212.1s] song the young people sang and said
[216.3s] whatever situations we may be in we need
[220.7s] to be there help our neighbors be kind
[224.4s] to
[225.4s] them speak a word of kindness to
[230.3s] them a story is told of Mel
[234.8s] Gibson Mel Gibson is the one who
[238.2s] directed in the whole Hollywood the
[241.8s] passion um film The Passion
[245.5s] movie where
[247.8s] Jesus reenacting of the passion what
[251.5s] happened in that moment towards Christ
[256.2s] being
[257.6s] crucified the Judgment Hall and the
[261.9s] carrying of the Cross and even the
[265.5s] crucifixion so Mel
[268.4s] Gibson was sited in a
[272.0s] restaurant just
[274.0s] outside and as he had ordered his cup of
[277.8s] coffee he sat there and sipped it
[282.6s] peacefully but you
[285.2s] know when you think that you are
[288.5s] resting quickly you are surprised by
[291.5s] something this is the nature of Life
[294.7s] peace is always interrupted by something
[298.2s] our life of tranquil can be trouble we
[303.0s] may not have it fully because there are
[306.8s] things that interrupt this Blissful
[310.6s] moment and so as he was
[313.9s] there a barefooted homeless child a girl
[318.4s] of about 13 years came by and asked a
[323.3s] very important
[325.7s] question
[327.3s] innocently he approached him and with
[330.5s] fear she
[332.5s] asked do you
[335.4s] know a man known as Jesus who he
[343.2s] is and
[345.1s] this very celebrated
[349.1s] man wondered what to say looking at this
[353.9s] girl he realized that this girl really
[357.9s] needed to know about this Jesus and so
[361.8s] he said yeah I know something about him
[366.1s] so
[367.0s] she asked how is
[370.4s] he I would like to know more about
[373.9s] him and then this man said what I know
[378.9s] about
[380.0s] Jesus is that he forgives and give men
[385.7s] second CH John says over and over
[390.9s] again he helps people to start
[396.7s] over
[398.6s] again and this girl in her innocence
[402.5s] looked at this man and
[406.3s] asked even starting again even for
[410.5s] someone like
[412.8s] me I think I have made so many mistakes
[418.0s] and I've done stuff and I'm not
[423.6s] fit Mel Gibson told this girl you are
[428.7s] wrong s asked you don't know what I'm
[432.2s] going
[433.1s] through how do you know and Gibson said
[437.2s] he himself had hit the rock bottom
[440.6s] bottom his family was disrupted because
[444.8s] of his own wrong choices he had done
[449.6s] very hurtful things to the people he
[451.8s] loved and she said when he had hit the
[455.9s] rock bottom the only thing that he could
[459.0s] do in that pit is to look up and God
[463.4s] helped him come up and God used a friend
[468.2s] and that friend did not give up on him
[472.1s] he helped him and God used that friend
[475.8s] and he was able to discover the loving
[480.1s] gracious father and so this girl looked
[485.1s] up and there she was and she wondered
[490.5s] how she was going to start and she asked
[493.3s] Gibson do you know that it is difficult
[497.2s] to find the way have you ever been lost
[500.2s] so that you don't even know whether
[502.8s] there's a way not even finding that way
[507.4s] and Gibson told him I've been there and
[511.0s] I know I know how it feels to be so lost
[515.8s] to appear as if people do not care
[518.6s] whether you find that
[520.6s] way
[522.1s] but I'm here and you can start from
[526.1s] where you have started even by asking a
[530.8s] question and with this Gibson told this
[536.5s] girl you can start there and and I can
[540.0s] help you he took a paper wrote the
[544.7s] address of a children's home and at the
[549.0s] back of the paper he wrote his own uh
[553.3s] telephone number and told the girl go to
[556.4s] the Children's Home and while there you
[559.6s] can call me wherever you need help that
[563.2s] was a touching moment the people who
[566.6s] were passing by wondered and they stop
[569.7s] to listen to the conversation as they
[572.6s] listen some were encouraged and they
[575.7s] were touched and one woman said are you
[579.3s] talking about faith and Gibson said yes
[583.4s] we are talking about faith and how we
[586.5s] can find Hope and this woman said with
[591.6s] tears I needed to hear this friend we
[596.8s] too need to hear this as we are in a
[600.5s] world that is corrupted as we are in
[604.6s] this life that has no
[607.3s] certainty as like this girl who was
[611.4s] barefooted maybe often that is why she
[615.0s] was homeless she yearn to find the way
[619.1s] to God and today I want us to know that
[624.0s] we too have been found there's someone
[627.1s] who has sought after us and even our
[629.8s] question our desires we can find answers
[634.4s] by looking into scripture as pastorate
[639.6s] and as the leadership of this church we
[642.4s] have approved the Strategic focus and
[645.9s] every
[646.9s] Wednesday we have this program where we
[650.8s] shall be elating on these topics that
[655.6s] form the Strategic Focus theme rooted
[660.5s] and
[661.8s] growing but as I have said we can only
[665.5s] be rooted and grow because we have been
[669.8s] planted and so I want us to look at
[673.9s] these four areas and then we will be
[677.2s] done very quickly because time is not
[680.5s] with
[681.4s] us we in planting we know because most
[686.3s] of us live in The Villages and we have
[690.2s] grown or planted
[692.4s] something before in our life we need the
[696.8s] farmer for any planting to happen we
[700.4s] need the seed we need the soil where
[704.2s] this can be planted in and we need a
[708.7s] conducive environment or the climate
[712.4s] these are the four conditions that are
[715.3s] needed so that any plant can be
[718.6s] nourished
[719.9s] my friend my brother I need you to know
[725.0s] that this gracious father who loves us
[728.4s] just as we have not found ourselves
[731.6s] alive on our own as he created all
[735.9s] things and placed it where it is you are
[739.1s] not an accident he caed that in time
[743.9s] like this you would be born that in
[746.6s] times like this you can find yourself
[749.9s] listening to this Gospel wherever you
[752.8s] are even if you're following in our
[756.4s] national television KBC and we thank God
[759.4s] for them our following through our
[762.8s] social Media Forum I want you to know
[766.8s] that the Lord has a plan for you you are
[771.6s] here because he chose that you would be
[776.1s] alive and you're not just a statistics
[779.6s] you are part of his great plan
[783.6s] Hallelujah and so my
[786.6s] friend scripture points to God being the
[792.4s] farmer right from Genesis chapter 1 ver
[797.6s] 11-13 says God commanded that grass and
[802.3s] plants would grow and so it happened he
[807.1s] is the one who designed Ed and is the
[810.7s] one who commanded every plant to come so
[814.6s] God is the farmer nature as it is came
[819.2s] from his own plan he designed the
[824.2s] conditions where this
[826.4s] Earth oscillates and moves around the
[832.1s] the around in the universe is the one
[835.0s] who designed the sun to be where it is
[837.9s] and every position is perfect because he
[841.8s] is a
[843.4s] deci this planet this Earth the soil as
[847.2s] it is is the one who made sure that in
[851.9s] the Strutter the Richer part of the soil
[855.6s] with all the elements and the condition
[858.3s] that can sustain plants are where they
[862.0s] are is the one who played the Seas and
[865.6s] the lakes and the rivers and the
[868.1s] fountains of waters where they are so
[872.8s] that life can be
[875.1s] supported God is the farmer God is the
[880.0s] Ser you read in Isaiah
[884.2s] 51 and vers uh 5: 1 to7 and God is the
[890.6s] one who says I made my people to be like
[894.5s] a
[896.0s] garden God is the farmer
[900.2s] when you read in Matthew 13 where we
[904.7s] find some examples in this Parable that
[908.3s] Jesus told he told this Parable and then
[911.7s] he made it clear in vers
[915.9s] 37 and 39 in Matthew 13 what do we read
[922.2s] in Matthew
[924.7s] 13: 37 and 39
[929.4s] my Bible says this that he answered and
[933.3s] said to them he who SWS The Good Seed is
[937.6s] the Son of God the field is the world
[942.4s] the good seeds are the sons of the
[946.1s] Kingdom but the tears are the sons of
[950.8s] the wicked
[952.4s] one the enemy who s them is the devil
[957.4s] the Harvest is the End of the Age and
[961.2s] the reapers are the Angels friends
[965.7s] before the reaping before the Harvest
[970.7s] whereby you and I when we are planted as
[974.3s] good seed We join in the Harvest and we
[978.5s] are asked to pray to the Lord of the
[981.2s] Harvest to send the Reapers into his
[985.0s] harvest my friend I want to invite you
[988.4s] to think through this so that we may
[992.4s] understand our place in this Garden in
[996.6s] the kingdom of God
[999.6s] hallelujah and
[1001.3s] so as we have seen that God is both the
[1006.0s] so is the one who created the seed is
[1010.4s] the one who created the conditions for
[1013.2s] the seed to be able to grow to be able
[1017.6s] to take root
[1019.6s] by germinating in rich soil that can
[1023.7s] support
[1025.2s] life so these seed are in various are
[1030.8s] various
[1032.1s] kinds we have crops that we propagate
[1036.8s] through
[1038.2s] Vines like potatoes sweet potatoes for
[1041.8s] instance we have
[1044.3s] graps which we can propagate through
[1047.8s] Vines
[1049.8s] proceeds and so here Jesus says in John
[1055.4s] 15 that he is the
[1059.3s] vine and we Believers are the branches
[1063.4s] if we abide in him and he in us then we
[1068.8s] can be assured of bearing
[1071.4s] fruit my friend be whether you are
[1076.1s] propagated by Vine or by by seed which
[1080.7s] is the word of God that is
[1083.0s] preached when you take root in Christ
[1086.9s] you take the Life of Christ
[1089.4s] himself that is why he
[1092.0s] says you abide in me and I in you and
[1098.1s] you shall bear much fruit it's only by
[1103.6s] abiding in Christ it is only by
[1107.1s] understanding that whether it is the
[1109.7s] seed of
[1111.6s] Vine we find our true meaning and place
[1116.0s] when we seek our way and yield and
[1121.0s] surrender to the Lord to rule over our
[1123.8s] life
[1125.1s] Hallelujah and so this planting and
[1128.2s] being planted in
[1130.3s] Christ is a theme that the gospel
[1134.9s] presents to us in various aspects this
[1139.2s] is a theme that we get to know that all
[1146.4s] by believing in the word of
[1150.0s] God that seed that is planted in our
[1154.0s] thoughts takes shape and makes us live a
[1160.1s] holy
[1162.0s] life in James 1 verse
[1166.5s] 18 it tells us by his own good will he
[1170.7s] gave us birth through the word of
[1174.7s] Truth and in Romans 10 verse 17 it says
[1180.6s] therefore faith comes by hearing the
[1184.0s] gospel which is the
[1186.5s] seed and when we hear the gospel which
[1190.3s] is the seed when we believe in this
[1194.9s] gospel then that gospel transform forms
[1200.4s] us into sons and daughters and
[1206.9s] therefore this
[1208.8s] seed become the sons of the
[1212.7s] Kingdom
[1214.6s] so the
[1217.6s] planting with the word of God the gospel
[1221.6s] by Jesus coming taking humanity and by
[1225.8s] preaching this and for anyone who
[1229.0s] listens struggling with various issues
[1233.1s] of this life like this girl who came to
[1236.2s] male
[1237.4s] Gibson we have questions on how we can
[1241.3s] live a meaningful life a life that has
[1244.3s] purpose a life that we can look at and
[1247.2s] be
[1248.2s] satisfied and the only secret is by
[1252.7s] listening to the word of God how can a
[1256.2s] young man make his way perfect
[1259.3s] how can an old man live and bear fruit
[1262.5s] in his old age by trusting in the Lord
[1266.5s] we can be like a plant planted by the
[1270.5s] water front where we have all the
[1274.8s] resources and we can flourish and bear
[1277.5s] fruit in All Seasons Hallelujah and so
[1281.6s] how can a young man live his life
[1285.6s] perfectly It Is by reading by hearing
[1288.8s] Ing and following the word of God as we
[1291.8s] are here young
[1293.8s] people in schools and in various
[1297.5s] circumstances it is time in this Dark
[1300.4s] World in this dark moment in these
[1303.0s] uncertain days to return to the seed to
[1308.5s] be planted and become the Sons and
[1312.6s] Daughters of the king of King and become
[1315.7s] the princes and the prince of the holy
[1320.0s] loving God hallelujah let's listen to
[1324.0s] God let us know that as
[1329.3s] Believers this seed changes our status
[1333.6s] it changes who we are naturally because
[1338.7s] the devil planted seed by preaching the
[1341.9s] false gospel that you will not die but
[1345.2s] by obedience to God and his word we are
[1349.5s] planted I just want to read the last
[1352.5s] portion as we put together that we have
[1356.0s] good soil and that good soil are
[1359.0s] conditions we ourself can generate the
[1362.4s] book
[1363.3s] of the letter second 1 Corinthians sorry
[1367.6s] Chapter
[1368.7s] 1:
[1370.6s] 30 and
[1372.7s] 31 I will read and then summarize and
[1378.1s] say say that the
[1380.7s] soil and the
[1384.4s] climate are the climate comes from
[1389.0s] God as in Matthew 13:1
[1393.1s] 18-23 the soil
[1396.5s] is our own Hearts how we listen and pay
[1401.1s] attention what is it that we do and so
[1405.0s] if we listen and pay attention we shall
[1408.2s] be save in 1 Corinthians 3 verse No 1
[1415.3s] verse 30 and 31 it says but as of
[1419.6s] him but of him
[1422.4s] sorry but of him you are in Christ Jesus
[1427.1s] who became for us wisdom from God and
[1431.9s] righteousness and
[1433.7s] sanctification and Redemption that as it
[1436.8s] is written he who glories let him glory
[1442.2s] in the Lord
[1443.9s] hallelujah so that friend our status our
[1449.9s] strength our hope our joy in the Lord is
[1455.3s] not because of our own effort when we
[1459.8s] listen to the gospel when we invite and
[1463.1s] take time to read as the adventurers or
[1466.6s] the young uh teachers were
[1469.3s] saying Jesus is the bread of life but if
[1473.5s] we don't eat bread we are going to be
[1476.8s] weak therefore if we don't read the word
[1479.7s] of God we will not H be be strong this
[1484.6s] word that was brought to us by the H the
[1489.0s] the the medium of angels through the
[1492.1s] Holy Spirit and the prophets it has a
[1496.2s] divine origin when we believe live we
[1499.7s] will live a Divine Life let us accept
[1503.6s] this seed to be in us and it is not in
[1507.6s] us but by believing then we are planted
[1512.6s] in Christ Jesus and in Christ Jesus we
[1516.0s] can bear fruit how many with me are
[1519.2s] saying Lord I want to be the good
[1522.5s] soil plant your word in my
[1525.6s] life let me bear fruit because
[1529.1s] I'll take root in Christ and I will bear
[1533.4s] much fruit for you if you are there you
[1537.0s] can stand on your feet as we seek the
[1541.7s] Lord in
[1543.5s] prayer as the Chesters are
[1546.8s] singing listen to this
[1549.5s] song about
[1552.5s] growing strong and being a good harvest
