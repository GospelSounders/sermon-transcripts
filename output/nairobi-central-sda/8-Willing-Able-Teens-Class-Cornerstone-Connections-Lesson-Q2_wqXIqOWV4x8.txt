FULL TRANSCRIPT:
Welcome to the mission reading for today. My name is Ariana Kima and I'll be taking you through the story. Our story comes from Thailand and the title is Distance, Acceleration, and Velocity. And the main character's name is Naomi. 13-year-old Naomi thought that she was going to fail her science test at her school in Thailand. She looked at her notes on her tablet at home. Nothing made sense. She saw words like distance, acceleration, and velocity. She felt worries growing inside of her. She just had to get a good grade on the test. Her future depended on it. She wanted to grow up to become a scientist. But how could she become a scientist if she failed the science test? Naomi looked at the clock. It was late. She needed to go to bed. But the test was the next day. She looked back at her tablet again. She saw only confusing words like distance, acceleration, and velocity. Ah, she exclaimed in despair. She felt desperate. What could she do? Her parents were asleep and she couldn't ask them for help. Even her own friends wouldn't understand the terms distant acceleration and velocity. The idea popped in her mind that she should pray. Naomi had learned at school to pray in the morning and at night. Now it was night, so why not worry? Why not pray about her science test? Naomi closed her eyes and folded her hands. Dear God, she said, please help me pass this test. Then she explained to God that she wanted to pass the test so that she could become a scientist in future. When she finished talking to God, she felt better. She was still a little worried, but she was glad that she had been able to tell God about her worries. She studied a few more minutes and went to bed. She felt peaceful after praying and fell asleep quickly. In the morning, Naomi felt peaceful, but she also felt a little worried. Dad reassured her that everything would be fine. "It's okay," he said. "It's just a grade, and grades don't matter in the real world." But Nomi still wanted to get a good grade on the test. After breakfast, she quickly reviewed her notes one last time on her tablet, and she went to school. When it came for time for the test, something seemed different. Nomi understood the meaning of the words like distance, acceleration, and velocity. The test wasn't easy, but she felt comfortable as she took it. When she received her grade, she saw that she had passed with flying colors. She was shocked and very happy. That night, before going to bed, she prayed gratefully in her bed. "Thank you for helping me get a good grade," she said. These days, Nomi love loves to pray to God about everything. She has found that praying is much more fun than worrying. Don't worry about anything, but pray for everything, she said. Nomi is right. After all, the Bible says in Philippians 4:6, "Be anxious for nothing, but in everything by prayer and supplication with thanksgiving, let your requests be made known to God, and the peace of God which surpasses all understanding will guard your hearts and minds through Christ Jesus." Naomi studies at Korat Adventist International School in Thailand where many children come from families who have never heard about God. Part of the 13th Sabbath offering several years ago helped to build the school. Thank you for your 13th Sabbath offering this quarter that will help other children in Asia also learn more about God. Let's pray. Our kind and heavenly father, we thank you for this day. Thank you for the gift of life. Thank you for helping us to see the story about Naomi and how when she was worrying she turned to you. Oh Lord, help us to always turn to you even when we are worrying and when we are not. For I pray in Jesus name. Amen. Okay. So we'll sing song number 183 in our SDA him now. I will sing of Jesus love. Sing of him who first loved me for he left. Bright was above and died on Calary. I will sing of Jesus love. Sing of him who first loved me. He has died that I might live. I will sing his love to me. Oh, the depths of love divine earth or heaven can never know how that sins as dark as mine can be made as white as snow. I will sing of Jesus love endless praise. My heart shall give. He has died that I might live. I will sing his love to me. Nothing good for him have done. How could he such love bestow? Lord I own my heart is one. Help me now my love to show. I will sing of Jesus love endless praise. My heart shall give. He has died that I might live. I will sing his love to me. Hello from wherever you're watching us from. Welcome to Cornerstone Connections lesson number eight, willing and able. Um before we begin, um I'd like my fellow panelists to introduce themselves from my left. My name is Leroy Buyer. I am Christoel Fanuela. And I am Salmon Safari. And I'll be your teacher. Um Kelvin Yagancha. So as we begin, uh Fanuela, please pray with us. Let us bow our heads for a word of prayer. Dear God, we come before your presence this time to thank you for the life that you have granted unto us. Even as you're about to start our lesson discussion, may you kindly be with us and may you guide us in our endeavors. And it is in Jesus name I pray trusting and believing. Amen. Amen. So our title is um willing and able. Um I don't know what you guys think when you when you hear about the title but um as we have read um into the story we see um Aleppa who approached Christ and um he was healed and uh following this healing he went out um telling people how how Christ um had healed him. And uh and for us um we we see this and how it relates to our lives is that um Christ offers um willingly and is also able um to assist us even in our salvation the same way he did um heal this leper. Now I'd like to just pose a quick question to you guys willing and able in relation to the story. What comes to your mind when you when you first read at least this topic and when you read what was happening in the story? Salmon, I think uh willing and able basically means having the power to do something which is being able and willing is having the drive or determination to do it. So I think mostly people have one of the two but having two is a big blessing because it really helps you and also others. Yeah. So in other words, you can be able but not willing and you can also be willing but but not able. So it's a combination of the two. Thank you very much Almon. Um what do you what do you think about the the title? Um when I came across the title willing and able um the first thing that came to my mind is um willing is um being wanting to do something and able is having the ability to do something. Yeah. Thank you. Thank you very much. Um Leroy, now um I want us to ask ourselves quick questions here in the what do you think section. Um, and I think Fanola, um, you will lead us in that. Um, I want you guys to rank the following choices in order of what, um, you think God wants the most, um, and be ready to explain your answer. Okay. The first one is um to serve others with a humble heart. To become a wise and proficient uh people. To have a clear sense of purpose about your career. To live in harmony with his commands. To receive with certainty the gift of salvation. To be generous with your time and talents. And um I think that's the final one. So of of the listed above um Fenola maybe you can guide us. what do you think is the most important and why? Okay, so um in ranking I would say the first one would be to receive with certainity the gift of salvation because uh salvation is basically the foundation of our relationship with God. So when you have salvation the rest will follow. And then also without salvation none of your goals really matter. Mhm. Then the second one, I will choose to live in harmony with his commands because when you're saved, your natural response is to love and to obey. Therefore, you'll just result in harmony because you'll be obeying his commands. Then the third will be to serve others with a humble heart. So when you serve others with a humble heart, this just shows that that's the heart of Jesus in action after you've been saved. Then uh to be generous with your time and talent. So of course after that uh you will always spare some time to um to just use your talent and time to serve God. Then uh at the fifth position I would say to become a wise and proficient people. Well uh wisdom and proficiency is well it is important but then it would serve God better if you are if your if your heart is aligned with God. M then lastly I would have to say to have a clear sense of purpose about your career. Well, they are not that least important but in this case they are the least important because first of all you have to have a good relationship with God then uh the successful career and purpose will naturally follow. Amen. Amen. Yeah. Yeah. Thank you very much for that. Um I think I I pretty much agree with that. Um, Salmon, you have something to say? No, actually, uh, when I saw it first, I had a different idea, but as she said, like once you It's It's uh I think it's something that just falls in line once you have it's like uh a pyramid. It's one of the top going down. M but you see like uh as you said to receive the certainty to receive with certainty the gift of salvation once you have that the rest will just fall in line naturally. Amen. Amen. Yeah. Thank you very much for that. So at least we can agree that um the most important um is to receive with certainty the gift of salvation and and I think that's the burden of of um of the topic today that uh Christ is willing to offer. Remember our our headline is willing and able. So he's able. Therefore, he is willing to offer unto us that gift of salvation. The same way he offered um um healing to the leper, he's also willing to um give us the gift um of salvation with certainty. Okay. Now, um Mero, I just want you to uh quickly take us into the story. We are eager to see what is happening into the story and what we will get out of out of this story. Okay. So into the story uh the story for this topic will is Jesus heals a man with leprosy and we are given three perspectives of the same event which is a Matthew 8:1-4 Mark 1:4-4 and Luke 5:12-6 so um I'll just take the perspective from Matthew 8:1-4. Um, and J Jesus came from the mountain side and large crowds started following him. Uh, a man with leprosy came and knelt before him before Jesus and asked him, "If you are willing, you can make me clean." Jesus reached out out his hand and said, "I am willing, be clean." And immediately the leprosy left the lep and the leper became clean. And Jesus said to him, "Uh, don't tell anyone, but show but go show yourself to the priests and offer sacrifices that Moses had commanded to um to serve as a testimony to them." So basically um in a nutshell um when the man heard about Jesus came and knelt before him and asked if you are willing can make me clean. Jesus hearing this said I am willing and he made him clean. Now, but now Jesus told him, don't tell anyone, but go show yourself to the priest and offer sacrifices that Moses had commanded. But now if you look in the perspective of Mark chapter 1 verse 40-45 after Jesus told this to the man what the man did instead went and told everyone about Jesus or Jesus healing him and that made Jesus um longer uh Jesus wasn't able to enter into a town without large crowds following him and yeah that's basically the uh short summary of the story. Thank you very much for that. Now guys what do we generally get um out of this story? We we have um a key player here who's a leper and he goes to Christ and asks if you're willing make me clean. And Christ responds and says I am willing be thou clean. What what do we get from from this instance? Um Leroy, what what what do you get from out of this story and and the account you said um there are three different accounts. What what differentiates this accounts and and what do we take what's our take away from this key text? Um um if you look the first account of Matthew um he just after the leper told said to Jesus if you are willing make me clean. Jesus it just says Jesus reached out out his his hand and touched the man and said I am willing be clean. But however, in the account of Mark, we see after the man said this um the Bible says Jesus was indignant, then he reached out his hand and touched the man and said, "I am willing. Be clean." And for the perspective of Luke um just the same as the first account of Matthew, Jesus reached out his hand and touched the man. Yeah. Yeah. Thank you very much. Now there's a key question here and uh we are asked the question here is how is the disease of leprosy likened to to sin? Um maybe I can give you my perspective. Um from what I gathered from the story um leprosy attacked the central nervous system. Okay. So it was something that was coming from within. Um and how does that relate to sin? What do you guys think? Leprosy attack the central nervous system to without in fact what that basically that means is by the time you're seeing it on the skin it means inside things are bad so how does that relate to sin what do you guys think uh I think like as we are born sinners so Bible says we are born sinners so sometimes we don't realize that we are in sin before we get to realize it has already eaten us up and that relate to the relates to the story of the lost coin. So the lost coin was lost in the woman's house and the woman in the story sign basically signified God. The coin didn't it was lost. That's us. We don't know we are lost. We don't know we're in sin, but God has to go to his way to find us using a lamp which says the the lamp is uh your your light is a lamp to my feet and light. Yeah. So I think most of the times they don't know that we're in sin. By the time it starts showing it has already eaten us up to Yeah. Okay. So in other words, you're saying um at the central quote unquote nervous system of our hearts, we we are sinners by by nature. And by the times you by the time you're seeing um some of these um maybe defects, it's a it's a bit not too late, but it it just shows what goes on into the internal system. Okay. Um Leroy, what do you think? Um uh I totally agree with Sman and also from what I understood from this question um during those times when you had leprosy used to be separated from society. Mhm. So just like leprosy separated you from others, sin separates us from God. Yeah. Yeah. Thank you very much Leroy for that perspective. Vanuela, what what do you think? Uh well uh because you're we're relating it to the fact that uh literacy eats us from the inside. So most of the time you'll find it that uh when someone actually decides to sin, it's usually a decision that you that you make. So yeah, I can relate it to that. In other words, many people fall before they fall. That's that's what you mean. In other words, it's a it's normally preconceived. Okay. Excellent. Thank you very much for that. Now, the other thing I got when when Leroy was um was taking us through um into the story was this part that say that said that uh Lord, if you're willing, that's that's a leper saying, "Lord, if you're willing, what what what do you think that signifies?" And and I think it's a question later in the lesson. What do you think that signifies? What what were the thought processes of the leper when he was asking Christ that that question? What do you guys think? I I found that very interesting when when I read that lesson. What do you guys What What do you guys Leroy? What What do you think? What what what did the leper really what was the burden of the leper when he asked Christ that question? When if I mean relate it to yourself. If someone comes with a problem and says Salmon Man um this problem is too huge but Salmon if you're willing just help me. What what do you think Leroy? Um what I think when the leper said if you're willing um it they okay when they ask Jesus if you're willing because the leper knew if Jesus was willing he will be healed he will be healed. Yeah. In other words he knew that Christ had the capacity to to heal them. Yeah. I think as you said it first of all it shows that Jesus had the power he was able to heal him. Also I think uh you know God's will has to be done. So probably saying if possibly it wasn't God's will for him to be healed. He was at peace with it. That's why he said if you are willing if if it is your will because he already knows that he has the ability. Yeah. So he was recognizing God's authority. Yeah. as much as he desired to be to be healed, he recognizes God's authority as the as the determiner of of that particular circumstance. Yeah. Yeah. So what I think is uh when the leper approached Jesus and he asked him if you're willing well uh the leper was really unsure like if someone as important as Jesus is actually caring about someone like me because the lepers were being treated very harshly as if they were cast as if they were sinners. So it was very it was very odd for him. So he he was asking himself what are the odds and he also knew that the way Jesus had a very huge rank. M. So he he actually had to ask him if you're willing. If you're willing. Yeah. Yeah. If I if I could just combine all your responses, um I think I think the leper foraw this as too huge a favor um to be granted. Uh seeing what leprosy was in in those days, this will be too huge um a favor to get because again if you if you had leprosy um the next thing is is death. I mean we read into the lesson that um if you if you read more into leprosy actually you know you are actually excommunicated even out of the city um the other instances in the Bible where people were actually chased out of the gates of the city and uh your your names were removed from the church register um so for him to actually ask for for healing it was too huge a favor something that he didn't expect and that's So probably when he approached Christ, he was like, "Hey, if you if you're willing because I don't wish to burden you with this because this means so much um to the society and all. So if you're willing, please do what? Please heal me." Yeah. So I found I found that um very very interesting and and intriguing. So FDA, I'd like you to read for us the the key text. So our key text comes from the book of Mark 1:41 and 42. And it says, "Jesus was indignant. He reached out his hand and touched the man. I am willing, he said, be clean. Immediately the leprosy left him and he was clean, cleansed." What's the meaning of the word indignant? Well, in this in this situation, I'm going to associate it. Okay. In normal sense we always say that it's some sort of anger but then when you actually come to this well yeah it will be considered as anger but then I would say that it's somehow holy anger because that uh when Jesus saw the leper he was he was filled with compassion and holy anger because of how the the sin had turned the society evil because they were now casting out the uh the lepers. They were treating them like outcast those people who are cast and something like that. So I would say holy anger something of a sort. Okay. Salmon. Um Leroy, you want to add anything in regards to that key text? Okay. So Christ had as said um holy anger and uh he still went ahead and did what? And and healed this man. Then what happened next? Um Christ told this guy um please don't publish um this information abroad but the guy went ahead and did what and published the information abroad and as we could see to the other text that um in fact it made it even difficult for Christ to to to even intermingle freely because he had to u set himself apart because now you see there was some level of good news and and people wanted to actually find out um what was actually happening here. So um hers just to go straight into the flashlight um Salmon um what what uh does uh desire ves have to say about this particular instance? So desire ves page 271 says leprosy and pulsy were not so terrible as botry and unbelief. Mhm. So I think leprosy is a killer disease. If you're not Jesus didn't save you, you are going to die. So if this is a killer disease that we're being told is as it was not even as terrible as pyot and unbelief. M so in other words there are some sins that are more dangerous than even labor. Yeah. There are some sins that are more dangerous. M than these diseases that we think are bad, you can treat it to our day. Like if someone gets cancer, some people maybe go through chemo and they they're okay, but some people die, which is unfortunate, but you're being told these diseases are worse than unbelief. You know, uh many people what's unbelief? I think I relate it to unbelief in God saying maybe saying God is not there. People sometimes they think they learned enough to outweigh God's presence. So they say God cannot leave like I've achieved this. So yeah, I think we should be careful with what we believe in. Should believe in the right code. Yeah. So, bigotry and unbelief. So, we've said um unbelief is just technically um showing a lackluster attitude towards salvation and and and such like things. Um what is bigotry? Manuela Leroy, what do you think bigotry is? And these are things that are classified as worse than leprosy. What what is bigotry? anyone to anyone anyone. So from what I know um bigotry is basically just you know hating someone of something for no reason whatsoever. You just you just look at someone and say I just I just don't like I just I just hate you. Okay. So that's that's that's bigotry because it's it's baseless. But it's it's deep having deep hatred for something or someone with with no reason. That's that's basically bigotry. Now um um in the flashlight section we saw um um in the deserve ages page uh 266 if if you guys will allow me to read it. It says that in some instances of healing Jesus did not at once grant the blessing sought. But in the case of leprosy no sooner was the appeal made than it was granted. Now when we pray for earthly blessings, the answer to our prayer may be delayed or God may give us something other than we ask. But not so when we ask for deliverance from sin. It is his will to cleanse us from sin, to make us his children, and to enable us to live a holy life. What do you guys get from this flashlight? For me, what I get from this flashlight is that we may ask God for certain things. His answer may be no. He may give us something other than what we expect. But when we ask for deliverance from sin, Christ responds almost immediately. Okay? And and and that is why probably maybe this lesson was titled willing and able. he is able to attend to any and every emergency. Then then what do you guys get from this uh flashlight? I think it goes on to show what uh the magnitude of sin because uh most of the times as a student you'd pray to get a to do well in your exams to understand stuff but you don't realize that sin consumes you too much that you can't even sit in your life to pray for deliverance from sin. So I think this just goes on to show that sin is something that we should really uh key in our minds to we should be careful. Yeah. It also shows that it's a main agenda. It's a it's a need that Christ wants to meet the most. Yeah. Yeah. And it is comparable to to leprosy comes from within. Yeah. Okay. Any any other additions to the flashlight? Maybe um for me uh what I can add to Salman's statement is some of our prayers we ask are just what us humans want. And sometimes God Yeah. He he answers prayers with either yes or no. M but when it comes to when it comes to sin sin is such a big I can maybe I can say a big problem that God wants to help us resolve. Yeah. Amen. Amen. Um, anything maybe? Yeah. So, from the key text, we also need to understand about uh God's willingness. I mean Jesus willingness because when we understand uh Jesus willingness well we'll be able to trust and uh have confidence which will encourage us to approach him boldly knowing that um his love to us is not based on how worthy we are but rather uh his mercies and his graces. Yes. Amen. Amen. Now thank you very much guys for your for your answer. Now um when I was reading the story um when Christ gave this guy instructions, he said after he was healed, he was told go show yourself to the to the priest to perform a certain a certain rituals. Um if you guys were keen in the story, what what did that signify? uh when Jesus healed the man and told him to go and show himself to the priest. Yeah. I think Jesus was kind of uh restoring this person's dignity in the society. Mhm. Because uh uh when the person had leprosy, well, they were basically well it it was like their dignity was was done for. It's no one could value them anymore. But then when they showed themselves to the uh to the priests, their dignity was restored. And like you said, uh maybe their names would be returned to the community. Okay. Uh that's that's um that's that's quite interesting actually. Um because um if you read into the story and the culture then when you had leprosy first you were excommunicated which means your names were removed from the church register. So if you're healed it means uh it's like some level of rebaptism. So you have to go back uh to the priest for you to be assimilated back um into the church and into into the society at large. Now what other reason what other reason was there? Um in your own time you guys can read uh Leviticus 14 1-9. Salmon maybe you can. Yeah. Yeah. I think so. Uh from the fall of man. M the lamp has been representing the crucifixion of Jesus, right? So the priest represents God, right? So I think when a leper was healed, he was supposed to go and show himself to the priest. When we have been forgiven of our sins, we're supposed to uh tune our lives to God. M we we can't be we can't be forgiven yet we continue doing the sins that we're forgiven of. We need to keen need to tune our lives to God so that God can help us on our journey. Yeah. Okay. So Christ insisted that this guy should show himself to the priest. Uh the first reason was to restore as Fola said to restore the name back to the church register. Now the other reason was there was a ritual that was to be performed. Okay. Now and according to uh Leviticus 14:1-9 um there was a ritual that was normally performed and um people gathered outside the city um you gather two doves okay um one is killed okay uh then the blood is sprinkled on running water uh the the lever used to call it living water okay then the other one is immersed in the the running water that has the blood then it is set free. Okay. Then it flaps his wings with the bloody water to be to be set free. Now this was symbolic in that when you do this ritual, you will never forget the element of your of your salvation. Okay. So that is why Christ insisted that this guy should actually show himself to the to the priest for those two sole reasons to be restored to the register and number two to perform the ritual that was to imprint the cause of of his um his salvation. Okay. Now um as we conclude we can see that um this was a a meaningful and um and uh very uh interesting lesson and um the key question that I'd like to ask you guys is um how does this apply in our life today? Um we we saw that uh the leper approached Christ. The guy was healed. a guy goes um he's restored to the register and he performs this ritual. When you when you give a summary of what's happening here, what do you guys get? Maybe you can start with Leroy, how would you summarize this beautiful story in regards to our salvation? Um uh the well summarized this story um uh according to the story the leper approached Christ. Christ healed him and Christ told him to go to the go and show himself to the priest and offer and offer sacrifices. Mhm. As Moses commanded. If we relate this to our salvation um uh yeah most of the times we fall into sin hence but God is is faithful and just to forgive us. Mhm. So if you compare to the story the leper a leper approached the man and asked to be like if you relate it to us let's say we are the leper we have sinned we approached Christ and ask him to forgive us he's faithful and just to forgive us then he'll tell us uh be clean and we'll be forgiven and cleansed. from all unrighteousness. Amen. Amen. Yeah. So in other words, what um Leroy has said is we ought to approach God boldly. Okay. And he will cleanse us from all unrighteousness. Um so I I guess this is pretty much um the summary of of what we've learned this week. Um, and I pray um that we may learn to to apply this um into our lives. As we conclude, I'd like um Salmon to to pray uh with us. Let's pray. Loving father, thank you for being with us as we go through the lesson. Please guide us and protect us. In Jesus name we pray and believe. Amen. Amen. 

==================================================

TIMESTAMPED TRANSCRIPT:
[0.2s] Welcome to the mission reading for
[1.8s] today. My name is Ariana Kima and I'll
[4.1s] be taking you through the
[5.6s] story. Our story comes from Thailand and
[9.0s] the title is Distance, Acceleration, and
[12.6s] Velocity. And the main character's name
[14.9s] is Naomi. 13-year-old Naomi thought that
[17.8s] she was going to fail her science test
[19.7s] at her school in Thailand. She looked at
[21.8s] her notes on her tablet at home. Nothing
[24.2s] made sense. She saw words like distance,
[27.0s] acceleration, and velocity. She felt
[29.4s] worries growing inside of her. She just
[31.9s] had to get a good grade on the test. Her
[35.0s] future depended on it. She wanted to
[37.0s] grow up to become a scientist. But how
[39.2s] could she become a scientist if she
[41.0s] failed the science test? Naomi looked at
[43.9s] the clock. It was late. She needed to go
[46.4s] to bed. But the test was the next day.
[49.2s] She looked back at her tablet again. She
[52.2s] saw only confusing words like distance,
[54.6s] acceleration, and velocity. Ah, she
[57.6s] exclaimed in despair. She felt
[59.7s] desperate. What could she do? Her
[61.8s] parents were asleep and she couldn't ask
[63.8s] them for help. Even her own friends
[66.4s] wouldn't understand the terms distant
[69.4s] acceleration and velocity. The idea
[72.0s] popped in her mind that she should pray.
[74.8s] Naomi had learned at school to pray in
[77.0s] the morning and at night. Now it was
[79.6s] night, so why not worry? Why not pray
[82.7s] about her science test? Naomi closed her
[85.6s] eyes and folded her hands. Dear God, she
[88.0s] said, please help me pass this test.
[90.7s] Then she explained to God that she
[92.3s] wanted to pass the test so that she
[93.9s] could become a scientist in future. When
[96.4s] she finished talking to God, she felt
[98.5s] better. She was still a little worried,
[101.0s] but she was glad that she had been able
[103.0s] to tell God about her worries. She
[105.4s] studied a few more minutes and went to
[107.7s] bed. She felt peaceful after praying and
[110.2s] fell asleep quickly. In the morning,
[112.6s] Naomi felt peaceful, but she also felt a
[115.2s] little worried. Dad reassured her that
[117.4s] everything would be fine. "It's okay,"
[119.1s] he said. "It's just a grade, and grades
[121.7s] don't matter in the real world." But
[123.4s] Nomi still wanted to get a good grade on
[126.3s] the test. After breakfast, she quickly
[129.2s] reviewed her notes one last time on her
[131.4s] tablet, and she went to school. When it
[134.3s] came for time for the test, something
[136.2s] seemed different. Nomi understood the
[138.8s] meaning of the words like distance,
[140.4s] acceleration, and velocity. The test
[143.0s] wasn't easy, but she felt comfortable as
[145.3s] she took it. When she received her
[147.4s] grade, she saw that she had passed with
[149.5s] flying colors. She was shocked and very
[152.0s] happy. That night, before going to bed,
[154.8s] she prayed gratefully in her bed. "Thank
[157.4s] you for helping me get a good grade,"
[159.3s] she said. These days, Nomi love loves to
[162.2s] pray to God about everything. She has
[164.6s] found that praying is much more fun than
[166.8s] worrying. Don't worry about anything,
[169.2s] but pray for everything, she said. Nomi
[171.7s] is right. After all, the Bible says in
[174.2s] Philippians 4:6, "Be anxious for
[177.3s] nothing, but in everything by prayer and
[179.4s] supplication with thanksgiving, let your
[182.0s] requests be made known to God, and the
[183.9s] peace of God which surpasses all
[185.9s] understanding will guard your hearts and
[188.2s] minds through Christ Jesus." Naomi
[190.9s] studies at Korat Adventist International
[193.3s] School in Thailand where many children
[195.5s] come from families who have never heard
[197.4s] about God. Part of the 13th Sabbath
[200.0s] offering several years ago helped to
[202.7s] build the school. Thank you for your
[204.4s] 13th Sabbath offering this quarter that
[206.8s] will help other children in Asia also
[209.3s] learn more about God. Let's pray. Our
[212.3s] kind and heavenly father, we thank you
[213.7s] for this day. Thank you for the gift of
[215.2s] life. Thank you for helping us to see
[217.4s] the story about Naomi and how when she
[220.5s] was worrying she turned to you. Oh Lord,
[223.7s] help us to always turn to you even when
[225.7s] we are worrying and when we are not. For
[227.2s] I pray in Jesus name. Amen. Okay. So
[229.7s] we'll sing song number 183 in our SDA
[233.0s] him
[234.0s] now. I will
[237.2s] sing of Jesus love. Sing of
[242.8s] him who first loved me for he
[248.5s] left. Bright was
[252.9s] above and died on
[258.3s] Calary. I will
[261.2s] sing of Jesus love. Sing of
[266.8s] him who first loved me. He has
[272.5s] died that I might live. I will sing his
[278.6s] love to me.
[282.2s] Oh, the
[284.0s] depths of love divine earth or
[289.5s] heaven can never know how that
[295.2s] sins as dark as
[299.1s] mine can be made as white as
[304.6s] snow. I will
[307.6s] sing of Jesus love endless
[313.2s] praise. My heart shall give. He has
[318.9s] died that I might live. I will sing his
[325.0s] love to
[327.6s] me. Nothing
[330.2s] good for him have done. How could
[335.9s] he such love bestow? Lord I
[341.4s] own my heart is
[345.6s] one. Help me now my love to
[351.3s] show. I will
[354.3s] sing of Jesus love endless
[360.0s] praise. My heart shall give. He has
[365.6s] died that I might live. I will sing his
[372.3s] love to me.
[376.4s] Hello from wherever you're watching us
[378.4s] from. Welcome to Cornerstone Connections
[381.4s] lesson number eight, willing and able.
[385.1s] Um before we begin, um I'd like my
[388.0s] fellow panelists to introduce themselves
[390.0s] from my left.
[392.2s] My name is Leroy Buyer.
[394.9s] I am Christoel Fanuela.
[397.8s] And I am Salmon Safari. And I'll be your
[401.2s] teacher. Um Kelvin Yagancha. So as we
[403.8s] begin, uh Fanuela, please pray with us.
[406.6s] Let us bow our heads for a word of
[408.3s] prayer. Dear God, we come before your
[410.6s] presence this time to thank you for the
[413.4s] life that you have granted unto us. Even
[415.6s] as you're about to start our lesson
[417.4s] discussion, may you kindly be with us
[419.3s] and may you guide us in our endeavors.
[421.4s] And it is in Jesus name I pray trusting
[423.4s] and believing. Amen. Amen. So our title
[427.0s] is um willing and able. Um I don't know
[430.8s] what you guys think when you when you
[432.7s] hear about the title but um as we have
[436.0s] read um into the story we see um Aleppa
[439.4s] who approached Christ and um he was
[442.8s] healed and uh following this healing he
[446.6s] went out um telling people how how
[450.0s] Christ um had healed him. And uh and for
[454.2s] us um we we see this and how it relates
[458.3s] to our lives is that um Christ offers um
[463.4s] willingly and is also able um to assist
[467.7s] us even in our salvation the same way he
[470.7s] did um heal this leper. Now I'd like to
[474.7s] just pose a quick question to you guys
[476.7s] willing and able in relation to the
[478.6s] story. What comes to your mind when you
[481.7s] when you first read at least this topic
[484.2s] and when you read what was happening in
[486.2s] the story? Salmon,
[491.1s] I think uh willing and able
[494.4s] basically
[496.0s] means having the power to do something
[498.5s] which is being able and willing is
[501.7s] having the drive or determination to do
[504.2s] it. So I
[506.8s] think mostly people have one of the two
[511.0s] but having two is a big blessing because
[514.0s] it really helps you and also others.
[517.0s] Yeah. So in other words, you can be able
[519.4s] but not willing and you can also be
[521.5s] willing but but not able. So it's a
[524.0s] combination of the two. Thank you very
[525.7s] much Almon. Um what do you what do you
[528.3s] think about the the title? Um when I
[532.0s] came across the title willing and able
[535.5s] um the first thing that came to my mind
[537.4s] is
[539.1s] um willing is
[542.2s] um being wanting to do something and
[546.5s] able is having the ability to do
[549.1s] something. Yeah. Thank you. Thank you
[551.8s] very much. Um Leroy, now um I want us to
[555.9s] ask ourselves quick questions here in
[557.8s] the what do you think section. Um, and I
[559.9s] think Fanola, um, you will lead us in
[562.0s] that. Um, I want you guys to rank the
[564.3s] following choices in order of what, um,
[568.3s] you think God wants the most, um, and be
[572.2s] ready to explain your answer. Okay. The
[575.4s] first one is um to serve others with a
[578.2s] humble heart. To become a wise and
[581.3s] proficient uh people. To have a clear
[584.6s] sense of purpose about your career. To
[587.0s] live in harmony with his commands. To
[589.5s] receive with certainty the gift of
[591.5s] salvation. To be generous with your time
[593.8s] and talents. And um I think that's the
[597.0s] final one. So of of the listed above um
[600.3s] Fenola maybe you can guide us. what do
[602.1s] you think is the most important and why?
[605.8s] Okay, so um in ranking I would say the
[609.1s] first one would be to receive with
[611.0s] certainity the gift of salvation because
[614.4s] uh salvation is basically the foundation
[616.2s] of our relationship with God. So when
[618.8s] you have salvation the rest will follow.
[621.5s] And then also without salvation none of
[623.4s] your goals really matter. Mhm. Then the
[625.9s] second one, I will choose to live in
[627.8s] harmony with his commands because when
[629.9s] you're saved, your natural response is
[632.0s] to love and to obey. Therefore, you'll
[634.2s] just result in harmony because you'll be
[636.6s] obeying his commands. Then the third
[639.1s] will be to serve others with a humble
[640.9s] heart. So when you serve others with a
[642.9s] humble heart, this just shows that
[644.4s] that's the heart of Jesus in action
[646.6s] after you've been saved. Then uh to be
[649.7s] generous with your time and talent. So
[652.1s] of course after that uh you will always
[654.9s] spare some time to um to just use your
[657.9s] talent and time to serve God. Then uh at
[662.0s] the fifth position I would say to become
[664.1s] a wise and proficient people. Well uh
[667.9s] wisdom and proficiency is well it is
[671.0s] important but then it would serve God
[673.3s] better if you are if your if your heart
[676.2s] is aligned with God. M then lastly I
[679.9s] would have to say to have a clear sense
[682.3s] of purpose about your
[684.5s] career. Well, they are not that least
[688.3s] important but in this case they are the
[690.5s] least important because first of all you
[692.8s] have to have a good relationship with
[694.3s] God then uh the successful career and
[697.4s] purpose will naturally follow. Amen.
[699.8s] Amen. Yeah. Yeah. Thank you very much
[701.8s] for that. Um I think I I pretty much
[704.3s] agree with that. Um, Salmon, you have
[706.8s] something to say? No, actually, uh, when
[710.1s] I saw it first, I had a different idea,
[712.1s] but as she said, like once you It's It's
[717.7s] uh I think it's something that just
[719.9s] falls in line once you have it's like uh
[723.6s] a pyramid. It's one of the top going
[726.7s] down. M but you see like uh as you said
[730.2s] to receive the certainty to receive with
[732.9s] certainty the gift of salvation once you
[735.1s] have that the rest will just fall in
[737.0s] line naturally. Amen. Amen. Yeah. Thank
[740.2s] you very much for that. So at least we
[742.2s] can agree that um the most important um
[745.4s] is to receive with certainty the gift of
[748.2s] salvation and and I think that's the
[750.5s] burden of of um of the topic today that
[753.8s] uh Christ is willing to offer. Remember
[757.0s] our our headline is willing and able. So
[760.1s] he's able. Therefore, he is willing to
[762.6s] offer unto us that gift of salvation.
[765.0s] The same way he offered um um healing to
[768.6s] the leper, he's also willing to um give
[771.4s] us the gift um of salvation with
[774.0s] certainty. Okay. Now, um Mero, I just
[777.3s] want you to uh quickly take us into the
[779.8s] story. We are eager to see what is
[782.2s] happening into the story and what we
[784.1s] will get out of out of this story.
[787.8s] Okay. So into the story
[791.5s] uh the story for this topic will is
[795.3s] Jesus heals a man with
[797.3s] leprosy and we are given three
[800.2s] perspectives of the same event which is
[804.1s] a Matthew
[806.3s] 8:1-4 Mark
[809.0s] 1:4-4 and Luke
[813.4s] 5:12-6 so um I'll just take the
[817.4s] perspective from Matthew
[820.7s] 8:1-4. Um, and J Jesus came from the
[823.8s] mountain side and large crowds started
[827.1s] following him. Uh, a man with
[830.8s] leprosy came and knelt before him before
[835.0s] Jesus and asked him, "If you are
[836.9s] willing, you can make me clean." Jesus
[839.5s] reached out out his hand and said, "I am
[842.4s] willing, be clean." And immediately the
[845.5s] leprosy left the lep and the leper
[849.7s] became clean. And Jesus said to him,
[854.5s] "Uh, don't tell anyone, but show but go
[858.0s] show yourself to the priests and offer
[860.7s] sacrifices that Moses had
[864.0s] commanded to um to serve as a testimony
[867.8s] to them."
[869.4s] So
[870.4s] basically um in a nutshell um when the
[874.8s] man heard about
[876.7s] Jesus came and knelt before him and
[880.0s] asked if you are willing can make me
[882.9s] clean. Jesus hearing this said I am
[887.3s] willing and he made him clean.
[891.8s] Now, but now Jesus told
[894.6s] him, don't tell anyone, but go show
[898.2s] yourself to the priest and offer
[900.4s] sacrifices that Moses had commanded. But
[903.5s] now if you look in the perspective of
[906.7s] Mark chapter 1 verse
[909.8s] 40-45 after Jesus told this to the man
[913.4s] what the man did instead went and told
[916.6s] everyone about Jesus or Jesus healing
[920.0s] him and that made Jesus
[924.6s] um longer uh Jesus wasn't able to enter
[930.0s] into a town without large crowds
[932.4s] following him and yeah that's basically
[937.2s] the uh short summary of the story. Thank
[940.0s] you very much for that. Now guys what do
[942.4s] we generally get um out of this story?
[945.0s] We we have um a key player here who's a
[948.0s] leper and he goes to Christ and asks if
[950.7s] you're willing make me clean. And Christ
[953.7s] responds and says I am willing be thou
[956.8s] clean. What what do we get from from
[959.4s] this instance? Um Leroy, what what what
[962.1s] do you get from out of this story and
[964.0s] and the account you said um there are
[966.0s] three different accounts. What what
[968.2s] differentiates this accounts and and
[970.2s] what do we take what's our take away
[972.0s] from this key text?
[974.8s] Um um if you look the first account of
[979.6s] Matthew
[982.1s] um he just after the leper told said to
[987.2s] Jesus if you are willing make me clean.
[991.7s] Jesus it just says Jesus reached out out
[995.5s] his his hand and touched the man and
[998.4s] said I am willing be clean.
[1001.9s] But however, in the account of Mark, we
[1004.7s] see after the man said this
[1008.1s] um the Bible says Jesus was
[1013.2s] indignant, then he reached out his hand
[1016.2s] and touched the man and said, "I am
[1018.6s] willing. Be clean."
[1021.7s] And for the perspective of Luke
[1025.4s] um just the same as the first account of
[1029.4s] Matthew, Jesus reached out his hand and
[1031.7s] touched the man. Yeah. Yeah. Thank you
[1034.5s] very much. Now there's a key question
[1036.6s] here and uh we are asked the question
[1038.6s] here is how is the disease of leprosy
[1041.6s] likened to to sin? Um maybe I can give
[1045.2s] you my perspective. Um from what I
[1047.6s] gathered from the story um leprosy
[1050.7s] attacked the central nervous system.
[1053.8s] Okay. So it was something that was
[1055.5s] coming from
[1056.9s] within. Um and how does that relate to
[1061.1s] sin? What do you guys think?
[1064.2s] Leprosy attack the central nervous
[1066.4s] system to without in fact what that
[1069.8s] basically that means is by the time
[1071.8s] you're seeing it on the skin it means
[1074.7s] inside things are bad so how does that
[1078.6s] relate to sin what do you guys think
[1083.3s] uh I think like as we are born sinners
[1087.1s] so Bible says we are born sinners
[1090.0s] so sometimes we
[1093.7s] don't realize that we are in sin
[1098.1s] before we get to realize it has already
[1100.5s] eaten us up and that relate to the
[1103.4s] relates to the story of the lost coin.
[1106.8s] So the lost coin was lost in the woman's
[1109.8s] house and the woman in the story sign
[1112.1s] basically signified God. The coin didn't
[1114.9s] it was lost. That's us. We don't know we
[1117.8s] are lost. We don't know we're in sin,
[1119.8s] but God has to go to his way to find us
[1124.5s] using a lamp which says the the lamp is
[1128.5s] uh your your light is a lamp to my feet
[1131.4s] and
[1133.3s] light. Yeah. So I think most of the
[1137.0s] times they don't know that we're in sin.
[1139.8s] By the time it starts showing it has
[1141.7s] already eaten us up to Yeah. Okay. So in
[1146.1s] other words, you're saying um at the
[1148.3s] central quote unquote nervous system of
[1150.6s] our hearts, we we are sinners by by
[1153.0s] nature. And by the times you by the time
[1155.2s] you're seeing um some of these um maybe
[1157.8s] defects, it's a it's a bit not too late,
[1160.6s] but it it just shows what goes on into
[1163.6s] the internal system. Okay. Um Leroy,
[1166.1s] what do you think?
[1168.8s] Um uh I totally agree with Sman and also
[1173.4s] from what I understood from this
[1176.0s] question
[1177.7s] um during those times when you had
[1180.2s] leprosy used to be separated from
[1182.6s] society. Mhm. So just like leprosy
[1185.9s] separated you from others, sin separates
[1189.6s] us from God. Yeah. Yeah. Thank you very
[1192.6s] much Leroy for that perspective.
[1194.3s] Vanuela, what what do you think?
[1197.4s] Uh well uh because you're we're relating
[1200.7s] it to the fact that uh literacy eats us
[1203.4s] from the inside. So most of the time
[1205.4s] you'll find it that uh when someone
[1207.8s] actually decides to sin, it's usually a
[1210.4s] decision that you that you make. So
[1213.6s] yeah, I can relate it to that. In other
[1215.8s] words, many people fall before they
[1218.1s] fall. That's that's what you mean. In
[1219.4s] other words, it's a it's normally
[1221.2s] preconceived.
[1223.0s] Okay. Excellent. Thank you very much for
[1225.1s] that. Now, the other thing I got when
[1227.1s] when Leroy was um was taking us through
[1230.6s] um into the story was this part that say
[1233.4s] that said that uh Lord, if you're
[1236.0s] willing, that's that's a leper saying,
[1238.6s] "Lord, if you're willing, what what what
[1241.7s] do you think that signifies?" And and I
[1244.1s] think it's a question later in the
[1245.4s] lesson. What do you think that
[1246.9s] signifies? What what were the thought
[1249.1s] processes of the leper when he was
[1251.0s] asking Christ that that question? What
[1254.5s] do you guys think? I I found that very
[1256.5s] interesting when when I read that
[1257.8s] lesson. What do you guys What What do
[1260.8s] you guys Leroy? What What do you think?
[1262.3s] What what what did the leper really what
[1264.6s] was the burden of the leper when he
[1266.9s] asked Christ that
[1268.4s] question? When if I mean relate it to
[1271.0s] yourself. If someone comes with a
[1273.1s] problem and says Salmon Man
[1277.5s] um this problem is too huge but Salmon
[1279.9s] if you're willing just help me. What
[1282.6s] what do you think Leroy? Um what I think
[1287.8s] when the leper said if you're willing
[1292.3s] um it they
[1295.9s] okay when they ask Jesus if you're
[1297.7s] willing
[1299.8s] because the leper knew if Jesus was
[1304.8s] willing he will be healed he will be
[1307.4s] healed. Yeah. In other words he knew
[1309.7s] that Christ had the capacity to to heal
[1312.2s] them. Yeah. I think as you said it first
[1315.7s] of all it shows that Jesus had the power
[1318.5s] he was able to heal him. Also I think uh
[1322.3s] you know God's will has to be done. So
[1325.8s] probably saying if possibly it wasn't
[1329.5s] God's will for him to be healed. He was
[1332.1s] at peace with it. That's why he said if
[1334.3s] you are willing if if it is your will
[1336.6s] because he already knows that he has the
[1338.1s] ability. Yeah. So he was recognizing
[1340.6s] God's authority. Yeah. as much as he
[1342.8s] desired to be to be healed, he
[1344.9s] recognizes God's authority as the as the
[1347.7s] determiner of of that particular
[1349.8s] circumstance. Yeah. Yeah. So what I
[1352.9s] think is uh when the leper approached
[1355.0s] Jesus and he asked him if you're willing
[1358.5s] well uh the leper was really unsure like
[1362.2s] if someone as important as Jesus is
[1364.7s] actually caring about someone like me
[1367.0s] because the lepers were being treated
[1368.6s] very harshly as if they were cast as if
[1370.6s] they were sinners. So it was very it was
[1373.4s] very odd for him. So he he was asking
[1375.6s] himself what are the odds and he also
[1377.6s] knew that the way Jesus had a very huge
[1379.7s] rank. M. So he he actually had to ask
[1382.4s] him if you're willing. If you're
[1383.9s] willing. Yeah. Yeah. If I if I could
[1386.6s] just combine all your responses, um I
[1389.6s] think I think the leper foraw this as
[1392.8s] too huge a favor
[1395.3s] um to be granted. Uh seeing what leprosy
[1398.2s] was in in those days, this will be too
[1401.0s] huge um a favor to get because again if
[1404.2s] you if you had leprosy um the next thing
[1407.1s] is is death. I mean we read into the
[1409.4s] lesson that um if you if you read more
[1411.6s] into leprosy actually you know you are
[1414.0s] actually excommunicated even out of the
[1416.2s] city um the other instances in the Bible
[1418.6s] where people were actually chased out of
[1420.7s] the gates of the city and uh your your
[1424.1s] names were removed from the church
[1426.2s] register um so for him to actually ask
[1430.3s] for for healing it was too huge a favor
[1434.6s] something that he didn't expect and
[1437.2s] that's So probably when he approached
[1438.9s] Christ, he was like, "Hey, if you if
[1441.5s] you're willing because I don't wish to
[1443.5s] burden you with this because this means
[1445.8s] so much um to the society and all. So if
[1449.4s] you're willing, please do what? Please
[1451.6s] heal me." Yeah. So I found I found that
[1454.4s] um very very interesting and and
[1457.3s] intriguing. So FDA, I'd like you to read
[1459.7s] for us the the key text.
[1462.9s] So our key text comes from the book of
[1465.4s] Mark 1:41 and 42. And it says, "Jesus
[1470.4s] was indignant. He reached out his hand
[1472.5s] and touched the man. I am willing, he
[1475.1s] said, be clean. Immediately the leprosy
[1477.8s] left him and he was clean, cleansed."
[1481.4s] What's the meaning of the word
[1482.6s] indignant?
[1484.6s] Well, in this in this situation, I'm
[1487.4s] going to associate it. Okay. In normal
[1489.4s] sense we always say that it's some sort
[1491.0s] of anger but then when you actually come
[1493.7s] to this well yeah it will be considered
[1496.4s] as anger but then I would say that it's
[1498.2s] somehow holy anger because that uh when
[1501.1s] Jesus saw the leper he was he was filled
[1503.7s] with compassion and holy anger because
[1506.2s] of how the the sin had turned the
[1508.4s] society evil because they were now
[1510.6s] casting out the uh the lepers. They were
[1513.7s] treating them like outcast those people
[1515.4s] who are cast and something like that. So
[1518.0s] I would say holy anger something of a
[1520.5s] sort. Okay. Salmon. Um Leroy, you want
[1524.6s] to add anything in regards to that key
[1528.8s] text? Okay. So Christ had as said um
[1534.6s] holy anger and uh he still went ahead
[1537.0s] and did what? And and healed this man.
[1540.0s] Then what happened next? Um Christ told
[1543.0s] this guy um please don't publish um this
[1548.0s] information
[1549.0s] abroad but the guy went ahead and did
[1551.4s] what and published the information
[1553.7s] abroad and as we could see to the other
[1555.8s] text that um in fact it made it even
[1558.6s] difficult for Christ to to to even
[1561.6s] intermingle freely because he had to u
[1564.9s] set himself apart because now you see
[1567.7s] there was some level of good news and
[1569.8s] and people wanted to actually find out
[1572.1s] um what was actually happening here. So
[1574.7s] um hers just to go straight into the
[1577.6s] flashlight um Salmon um what what uh
[1581.3s] does uh desire ves have to say about
[1583.3s] this particular instance? So desire ves
[1586.8s] page 271 says leprosy and pulsy were not
[1591.7s] so terrible as botry and unbelief. Mhm.
[1596.3s] So I think leprosy is a killer disease.
[1601.6s] If you're not Jesus didn't save you, you
[1604.0s] are going to die. So if this is a killer
[1608.2s] disease that we're being told is as it
[1612.7s] was not even as terrible as pyot and
[1616.0s] unbelief. M so in other words there are
[1619.1s] some sins that are more dangerous than
[1621.1s] even labor. Yeah. There are some sins
[1623.3s] that are more dangerous. M than these
[1626.7s] diseases that we think are bad, you can
[1629.4s] treat it to our day. Like if someone
[1631.4s] gets cancer, some people maybe go
[1634.2s] through chemo and they they're okay, but
[1637.0s] some people die, which is unfortunate,
[1640.6s] but you're being told
[1643.0s] these diseases are worse than unbelief.
[1646.7s] You know,
[1648.7s] uh many people what's unbelief? I think
[1652.1s] I relate it to unbelief in God saying
[1655.9s] maybe saying God is not there.
[1659.2s] People
[1660.8s] sometimes they think they learned enough
[1665.9s] to outweigh God's presence. So they say
[1669.1s] God cannot leave like I've achieved
[1672.1s] this. So yeah, I think we
[1676.0s] should be careful with what we believe
[1678.8s] in. Should believe in the right code.
[1681.6s] Yeah. So, bigotry and unbelief. So,
[1684.8s] we've said um unbelief is just
[1688.0s] technically um showing a lackluster
[1691.0s] attitude towards salvation and and and
[1693.5s] such like things. Um what is
[1697.0s] bigotry? Manuela Leroy, what do you
[1699.7s] think bigotry is? And these are things
[1702.0s] that are classified as worse than
[1706.1s] leprosy. What what is bigotry?
[1709.8s] anyone
[1710.8s] to
[1712.4s] anyone anyone. So from what I know um
[1716.4s] bigotry is basically just you know
[1719.3s] hating someone of something for no
[1722.4s] reason
[1724.3s] whatsoever. You just you just look at
[1726.4s] someone and say I just I just don't like
[1728.9s] I just I just hate you. Okay. So that's
[1731.9s] that's that's bigotry because it's it's
[1734.0s] baseless. But it's it's deep having deep
[1737.0s] hatred for something or someone with
[1738.8s] with no reason. That's that's basically
[1741.0s] bigotry. Now um um in the flashlight
[1743.7s] section we saw um um in the deserve ages
[1747.8s] page uh 266 if if you guys will allow me
[1750.6s] to read it. It says that in some
[1752.5s] instances of healing Jesus did not at
[1755.0s] once grant the blessing sought. But in
[1758.1s] the case of leprosy no sooner was the
[1760.3s] appeal made than it was granted. Now
[1763.8s] when we pray for earthly blessings, the
[1765.9s] answer to our prayer may be delayed or
[1768.4s] God may give us something other than we
[1771.2s] ask. But not so when we ask for
[1775.5s] deliverance from sin. It is his will to
[1779.4s] cleanse us from sin, to make us his
[1781.8s] children, and to enable us to live a
[1784.7s] holy life. What do you guys get from
[1787.2s] this flashlight? For me, what I get from
[1789.0s] this flashlight is that we may ask God
[1792.4s] for certain things. His answer may be
[1795.2s] no. He may give us something other than
[1797.0s] what we expect. But when we ask for
[1801.0s] deliverance from
[1802.4s] sin, Christ responds almost immediately.
[1807.5s] Okay? And and and that is why probably
[1809.8s] maybe this lesson was titled willing and
[1812.6s] able. he is able to attend to any and
[1818.2s] every emergency. Then then what do you
[1821.4s] guys get from this uh flashlight?
[1826.0s] I think it goes on to show what uh the
[1831.0s] magnitude of sin because
[1834.6s] uh most of the times as a student you'd
[1838.4s] pray to get a to do well in your
[1841.6s] exams to understand stuff but you don't
[1845.8s] realize that sin consumes you too much
[1848.6s] that you can't even sit in your life to
[1851.0s] pray for deliverance from sin. So I
[1853.5s] think this just goes on to show that sin
[1857.0s] is something that we should really
[1860.1s] uh key in our minds to we should be
[1863.8s] careful. Yeah. It also shows that it's a
[1867.0s] main agenda. It's a it's a need that
[1869.0s] Christ wants to meet the most. Yeah.
[1871.3s] Yeah. And it is comparable to to leprosy
[1874.6s] comes from within. Yeah. Okay. Any any
[1877.6s] other additions to the
[1880.0s] flashlight? Maybe
[1885.7s] um for me
[1888.6s] uh what I can add to Salman's statement
[1891.2s] is some of our prayers we ask are just
[1897.0s] what us humans want. And sometimes God
[1902.9s] Yeah. He he answers prayers with either
[1905.4s] yes or no. M but when it comes to when
[1908.1s] it comes to sin
[1910.4s] sin is such a
[1913.2s] big I can maybe I can say a big problem
[1917.5s] that God wants to help us resolve.
[1921.4s] Yeah. Amen. Amen.
[1924.2s] Um, anything maybe? Yeah. So, from the
[1927.5s] key text, we also need to understand
[1929.5s] about uh God's willingness. I mean Jesus
[1932.8s] willingness because when we understand
[1935.4s] uh Jesus willingness well we'll be able
[1938.3s] to trust and uh have confidence which
[1942.1s] will encourage us to approach him boldly
[1944.6s] knowing that um his love to us is not
[1948.1s] based on how worthy we are but rather uh
[1951.1s] his mercies and his graces. Yes. Amen.
[1954.4s] Amen. Now thank you very much guys for
[1956.7s] your for your answer. Now um when I was
[1959.8s] reading the story um when Christ gave
[1962.5s] this guy instructions, he said after he
[1965.1s] was healed, he was told go show yourself
[1969.3s] to the to the priest to perform a
[1972.6s] certain a certain rituals. Um if you
[1977.1s] guys were keen in the story, what what
[1981.0s] did that signify? uh when Jesus healed
[1984.2s] the man and told him to go and show
[1986.0s] himself to the priest. Yeah. I think
[1988.8s] Jesus was kind of uh restoring this
[1991.0s] person's dignity in the society. Mhm.
[1993.7s] Because uh uh when the person had
[1996.5s] leprosy, well, they were basically well
[2000.2s] it it was like their dignity was was
[2002.1s] done for. It's no one could value them
[2004.4s] anymore. But then when they showed
[2006.3s] themselves to the uh to the priests,
[2009.4s] their dignity was restored. And like you
[2011.8s] said, uh maybe their names would be
[2013.6s] returned to the community.
[2016.6s] Okay. Uh that's that's um that's that's
[2019.5s] quite interesting actually. Um because
[2022.4s] um if you read into the story and the
[2024.6s] culture then when you had leprosy first
[2027.8s] you were excommunicated which means your
[2030.2s] names were removed from the church
[2032.0s] register. So if you're healed it means
[2035.3s] uh it's like some level of rebaptism. So
[2037.4s] you have to go back uh to the priest for
[2040.5s] you to be assimilated back um into the
[2043.4s] church and into into the society at
[2046.0s] large. Now what other
[2049.0s] reason what other reason was
[2052.0s] there?
[2054.0s] Um in your own time you guys can read uh
[2057.7s] Leviticus 14 1-9. Salmon maybe you can.
[2061.4s] Yeah. Yeah. I think so. Uh from the fall
[2066.0s] of man. M the lamp has been representing
[2071.6s] the crucifixion of Jesus, right? So the
[2076.5s] priest represents God, right? So I think
[2081.4s] when a leper was healed, he was supposed
[2084.0s] to go and show himself to the priest.
[2086.6s] When we have been forgiven of our sins,
[2089.8s] we're supposed
[2091.0s] to uh tune our lives to God. M we we
[2095.9s] can't be we can't be forgiven yet we
[2099.4s] continue doing the sins that we're
[2100.8s] forgiven of. We need to keen need to
[2103.6s] tune our lives to God so that God can
[2107.2s] help us on our journey. Yeah. Okay. So
[2111.2s] Christ insisted that this guy should
[2112.9s] show himself to the priest. Uh the first
[2115.1s] reason was to restore as Fola said to
[2117.4s] restore the name back to the church
[2118.9s] register. Now the other reason was there
[2121.0s] was a ritual that was to be performed.
[2122.9s] Okay. Now and according to uh Leviticus
[2125.4s] 14:1-9
[2127.1s] um there was a ritual that was normally
[2128.9s] performed and um people gathered outside
[2132.3s] the city um you gather two doves okay um
[2136.2s] one is killed okay uh then the blood is
[2139.8s] sprinkled on running water uh the the
[2142.7s] lever used to call it living water okay
[2145.4s] then the other one is immersed in the
[2149.0s] the running water that has the blood
[2151.1s] then it is set free. Okay. Then it flaps
[2155.1s] his wings with the bloody water to be to
[2158.3s] be set free. Now this was symbolic in
[2162.4s] that when you do this ritual, you will
[2165.8s] never forget the element of your of your
[2169.4s] salvation. Okay. So that is why Christ
[2172.4s] insisted that this guy should actually
[2175.4s] show himself to the to the priest for
[2178.6s] those two sole reasons to be restored to
[2181.8s] the register and number two to perform
[2183.8s] the ritual that was to imprint the cause
[2186.7s] of of his um his salvation. Okay. Now um
[2191.9s] as we conclude we can see that um this
[2194.6s] was a a meaningful and um and uh very uh
[2199.7s] interesting lesson and um the key
[2203.3s] question that I'd like to ask you guys
[2205.1s] is um how does this apply in our life
[2209.9s] today? Um we we saw that uh the leper
[2214.2s] approached Christ. The guy was healed. a
[2217.3s] guy goes um he's restored to the
[2219.8s] register and he performs this ritual.
[2222.4s] When you when you give a summary of
[2226.2s] what's happening here, what do you guys
[2228.5s] get? Maybe you can start with
[2230.5s] Leroy, how would you summarize this
[2233.3s] beautiful story in regards to our
[2235.7s] salvation?
[2240.0s] Um uh the well summarized this story
[2244.5s] um uh according to the story the leper
[2247.9s] approached Christ. Christ healed him and
[2250.7s] Christ told him to go to the go and show
[2253.0s] himself to the priest and offer and
[2256.3s] offer sacrifices. Mhm. As Moses
[2260.8s] commanded. If we relate this to our
[2263.9s] salvation
[2266.7s] um
[2268.4s] uh
[2269.9s] yeah most of the times we fall into sin
[2275.3s] hence but God
[2278.5s] is is faithful and just to forgive us.
[2282.6s] Mhm. So if you compare to the story the
[2286.7s] leper a leper approached the
[2289.2s] man and asked to be like if you relate
[2292.9s] it to
[2293.7s] us let's say we are the leper
[2297.4s] we have sinned we approached Christ and
[2300.8s] ask him to forgive us he's faithful and
[2303.4s] just to forgive us then he'll tell us uh
[2308.6s] be clean and we'll be forgiven and
[2311.8s] cleansed. from all unrighteousness.
[2314.0s] Amen. Amen. Yeah. So in other words,
[2316.6s] what
[2317.6s] um Leroy has said is we ought to
[2320.6s] approach God boldly. Okay. And he will
[2325.8s] cleanse us from all
[2329.2s] unrighteousness. Um so I I guess this is
[2332.7s] pretty much um the summary of of what
[2335.6s] we've learned this week. Um, and I pray
[2338.9s] um that we may learn to to apply this um
[2342.6s] into our lives. As we conclude, I'd like
[2345.5s] um Salmon to to pray uh with us. Let's
[2350.9s] pray. Loving father, thank you for being
[2353.2s] with us as we go through the lesson.
[2355.5s] Please guide us and protect us. In Jesus
[2358.2s] name we pray and believe. Amen. Amen.
