FULL TRANSCRIPT:
hello once again this is the Teens book club and we've been reviewing the book help in daily living we covered chapter 1 chapter 2 and chapter 3 and now we'll be doing chapter 4 which is pressing towards the Mark I hope you've been enjoying the conversation so far so before we begin I'd like to introduce the panelists then we'll go ahead and pray and we can delve right into the chapter so I'll start with uh the introductions from my left please introduce yourself hi my name is Amy andalu hello my name is sair kundi I'm a member of teens class and I'm happy to be here yes hi everyone my name is Brenda Maya hi everyone my name is Silas thank you and I'm Niko opio and I'm the moderator for this discussion Today Chapter 4 is titled pressing toward the mark we'll delve into what this actually means so as we begin I'd like to invite Silas to give us a word of prayer okay let's pray our kind and loving father thank you for this day thank you for this opportunity to discuss this chapter of the book help in daily living we pray for understanding and guidance in Jesus name I pray amen amen amen amen so pressing toward the mark this is actually a verse in the Bible that explains to us how we should always keep the goal in focus on what we actually want to do with our lives and to start us off in this discussion I'd like Amy to give us a summary of what it means to press towards the mark what are some of the themes captured in this chapter and what are some of the things that we can take home and then we can discuss this together pressing towards the mark for many people to accomplish a go they have to have a drive or a motive to achieve whatever they want and some even face trials before they actually accomplish what they want to accomplish I think this title explains to us and um Second Timothy 4:7 I have fought the good fight I have finished the race I have kept the faith this is something that we as Christians want to see once um Christ comes back again this chapter talks about about prayer faith and essentially being in commune with God and allowing God to be our divine counselor in whatever we choose to do in life now it also talks about the future and how to Value things um and essentially yeah value things in time so silus what is the significance of keeping the prize of eternal life in View and how can this influence a believer's daily decisions and actions okay I think that when uh we have the eternal life in view on our daily life sometimes we tend to be more careful and on how we make our daily decisions but I think we should should be more prayerful instead of the avoiding risking like a decision you're very careful before making it you should be careful yes but you should more you should be more prayerful about it yeah okay I I really like to also chip into this one um and how viewing the prize of Eternity is really helpful I think we in the last book we looked at when God said remember and I think Mark Finley described it as as not viewing eternity as a future promise but a present reality and so eternity is now and understanding that I think when we are connected and living with Christ we can have a clear view of Eternity sometimes as Christians our view of the end goal is quite vague right the idea of this Mark is a specific scope something that we have to attain and sometimes that becomes foggy because of different things in this world but eternity can become a now and a present thought when we are connected to Christ back to you Amy yeah okay um okay so in the book it's written they shall hunger no more neither shall they um neither shall the sun know any other or feel any other heat for the lamb which is the which is the which is in the midst of the throne shall feed them and shall lead them and shall um unto the living Fountains of waters and God shall wipe the tears from their eyes so I think when we're making certain decisions in life we also have to look at the kind of things we're looking forward to in future um whatever we are experiencing or we deem to find wonderful here on Earth essentially will not compare to what um is in store for us in heaven okay um subir in what ways does LG white explain the balance between human effort and divine assistance in the process of spiritual growth thank you so much for the question and I think it's a great chapter I think she really emphasizes that while individuals indeed must put forth um their efforts into living according to God's will we also find that true growth comes from the power power and the guidance of the Holy Spirit and so human effort alone is insufficient we need God's strength to not only enable us but to sustain us in our spiritual progress I would like someone to read Philippians chapter 2 verse 12-13 phili Philippi Philippians chapter 2: 12-13 and it says therefore my beloved as you have always obeyed not as in my presence only but now much more in my absence work out your own salvation with fear and trembling for it is God who walks in you in you both to Will and to do for his good pleasure absolutely and so I think our view of Salvation is it does transcend legalism it is not just purely by our works but most definitely by our faith and even in the Sabbath day we rest in God's power to save us but here it's really reminding us that Believers ought to work out their salvation while acknowledging that it is God who works in them to accomplish his purpose amen amen okay um okay this this question is for Brenda what are some of the common distractions or hindrances that prevent Believers from pressing toward the mark uh this is this is something I feel like uh it's a question that applies to everyone you know like what other like it doesn't have to be something very complicated it's what are the common things in everyone's life that distract you from focusing on Jesus from focusing on the goal that we have which is um reaching our final home our final destination and um I'm going to use the analogy of I'm going to use two analogies yeah excuse me uh the moth when a moth sees light it goes towards it right and even if you distract it with okay I can't distract something with Darkness but like even though there's Darkness all around it it will only focus on the light which is something as Christians we need to learn how to do to focus only on the light and um another knowy I I thought of while thinking about this was the wise men who went to see Jesus when he was born and we told how they were studying the the word and the history books and they saw these prophecies about a star and they were like what what is this and they followed the star but unlike the Shepherds who knew the location they got instructed in this case they went to King Herod to ask where is this s who is born right and in the Christian Life that can be seen as a destru a destruction in our journey that we have we can get false false paths from the right path cuz we walk a narrow path and we can be distracted by other paths that seem similar but easier to walk and those are the destructions we have that distract us from reaching that goal that we have from pressing onto the mark but we as Christians are given the hope that we will come back to the right path yeah there's something you said about the wise men I think it's very true that they had to study they had to be students of the word they had to meditate on that in order to know no this star is of importance this is leading us to the birth of the Messiah I mean other people would look at the stars and say wow nice outside you they wouldn't reflect and see that this is a important thing and so I think the clarity of the mark that we're finding is brought through the word being intentional about reading that word uh thank you sair but there's also I forgot to add something um communication and prayer this this is something it's not a distraction but uh not having communication and constant prayer with God can also be a form of distraction because when you are not in constant connection to what is our guide to the goal that we have you will lose sight of where you're going so when we don't have that communication and prayer with God we lose we lose um the path we're following and we get distracted cuz when you're not looking at the goal where you're going you will look elsewhere right my mom likes saying I have the attention span of a fly oh cuz um when I'm doing something and I see a fly pass I'll just follow it so like as Christians we shouldn't be like that yeah and pray prayer and faith will do what no powers on Earth can do for us so by prayer and faith we can have the we can have the concentration we need to press on the goal yeah to add on to that um even though we pray to not get distracted I think we should also view prayer as something that we used to like essentially rely on God essent I don't know how to word it but you know rely on God as you go through trials um and challenges so we cannot solely rely on previous experiences when we go through something and I think we can go through it again we constantly have to be in communication with God if we want to you know better ourselves yeah amen um okay so my final question goes to teacher Nik how does the analogy of a race as used by the Apostle Paul help us illustrate the Christians striving toward spiritual maturity yeah it's an interesting question I'd just like to answer it with a personal experience I have run a marathon marathons a number of times when I've gone for the marathon I've never done a 42 kilm but I've done 21 km a couple of times and I think about how it feels when you reach the 15th or the 17th kilm you just want it to finish already because it's quite tiring you need to have that endurance to actually push through and so when we talk about pressing towards the mark it means that we need to have resilience as Christians because in the world there's temptations there all these things that will actually happen to us but we really need to push through and it doesn't start with the marathon it actually starts with the training for the marathon so you invest normally in shoes you'll invest a number of hours trying to train every morning before you actually run the race if you have some weight you need to Shadow some weight if you want want to improve your time so all those are the things that go into preparing for a race and I think in Christianity there are some friends that we might have to let go there are some habits and practices that we might need to let go of if we expect to win in the Christian race so I believe that the Christian race uh is the the Journey of Christianity is liken to race in that man yeah I think that really speaks to there's is a need for action and sometimes that as Christians we can fall in this deadly state of inaction where the idea of pressing forward requires pressure right there is something that is you need to break through and as Christians we must really awaken the spiritual because as we awaken the spiritual we begin to exercise our faith and exercising that Faith needs action and so I think there needs to be an understanding yes you are on this race and there is help in that race but requires efforts as well yeah amen amen amen I think Philippians 4:13 is also a really good verse um I can do all things through Christ who strengthens me yeah so as we walk through this journey of life and pressing towards the Mark it's important to remember that Christ is with us and we just have to submit to him in order for us to press towards the mark yes amen if I could add just another verse on top of what Amy just said uh 2 Timothy 4 verse uh verse 7 it's a very popular verse when it comes to going fighting the good fight yeah so Paul says I fought the good fight I have finished the race I have kept the faith and it just basically points out what everyone has said today on how it's a race where we're we're walking we're not even walking we're running a race and everyone has a different pace but the greatest um achievement we could have as Christians is reach the end and said I have fought the good fight I reached the goal so that that's just something we could take home today yeah amen amen so thank you all panelists Brenda saira uh Silas and Amy even as we've covered the whole book help in daily living as we said in chapter one we spoke about living with others chapter I mean yeah chapter one was everyday living then chapter two was living with others chapter three was uh building Christian yeah developing Christian character and chapter 4 finally is pressing toward the mark so it is my prayer that you may go and read this chapter yourself and also just go through all the lessons that we've shared from this book just to understand how God can help you in your daily life so it might be that you need to develop your own character it might be you need to learn how to live better with others it might be you haven't been pressing toward the mark and it's my prayer that the lessons we've shared may be a blessing to you thank you so much for joining us even as we've re reviewed this book and I pray that it will be a blessing in your life as it has been to us and if you don't have the physical book help in daily living these are the last four chapters of the book the ministry of healing like us to Bow our heads for a word of prayer loving father in Heaven thank you so much for guiding us I pray that you may give us the help that we desperately need from you pray that we press toward the mark of the high calling in Christ Jesus and I pray that you may guide us in all our lives we ask this in Jesus name amen amen amen

TIMESTAMPED TRANSCRIPT:
[0.2s] hello once again this is the Teens book
[2.9s] club and we've been reviewing the book
[5.3s] help in daily living we covered chapter
[8.3s] 1 chapter 2 and chapter 3 and now we'll
[10.7s] be doing chapter 4 which is pressing
[12.6s] towards the Mark I hope you've been
[14.6s] enjoying the conversation so far so
[17.9s] before we begin I'd like to introduce
[21.1s] the panelists then we'll go ahead and
[23.8s] pray and we can delve right into the
[26.6s] chapter so I'll start with uh the
[28.9s] introductions from my left please
[30.3s] introduce yourself hi my name is Amy
[33.0s] andalu hello my name is sair kundi I'm a
[35.9s] member of teens class and I'm happy to
[37.6s] be here yes hi everyone my name is
[40.0s] Brenda Maya hi everyone my name is Silas
[44.6s] thank you and I'm Niko opio and I'm the
[47.4s] moderator for this discussion Today
[50.0s] Chapter 4 is titled pressing toward the
[53.6s] mark we'll delve into what this actually
[57.4s] means so as we begin I'd like to invite
[60.7s] Silas to give us a word of prayer okay
[64.2s] let's pray our kind and loving father
[66.9s] thank you for this day thank you for
[69.0s] this opportunity to discuss this chapter
[72.6s] of the book help in daily living we pray
[75.4s] for understanding and guidance in Jesus
[77.7s] name I pray amen amen amen
[81.0s] amen so pressing toward the
[85.5s] mark this is actually a verse in the
[89.0s] Bible
[90.5s] that explains to us how we should always
[93.3s] keep the goal in focus on what we
[96.4s] actually want to do with our lives and
[98.8s] to start us off in this discussion I'd
[101.6s] like Amy to give us a summary of what it
[104.7s] means to press towards the mark what are
[107.3s] some of the themes captured in this
[109.5s] chapter and what are some of the things
[111.4s] that we can take home and then we can
[113.3s] discuss this together pressing towards
[117.0s] the mark for many people to accomplish a
[119.7s] go they have to have a drive or a motive
[123.4s] to achieve whatever they want and some
[126.1s] even face trials before they actually
[128.3s] accomplish what they want to accomplish
[131.0s] I think this title explains to us and um
[135.2s] Second Timothy
[136.6s] 4:7 I have fought the good fight I have
[139.7s] finished the race I have kept the faith
[142.4s] this is something that we as Christians
[144.6s] want to see once um Christ comes back
[147.8s] again this chapter talks about about
[150.4s] prayer faith and essentially being in
[155.2s] commune with
[156.7s] God and allowing God to be our divine
[159.9s] counselor in whatever we choose to do in
[164.8s] life now it also talks about the future
[168.5s] and how to Value things um and
[172.9s] essentially yeah value things in time so
[176.4s] silus what is the significance of
[179.1s] keeping
[180.6s] the prize of eternal life in View and
[183.3s] how can this influence a believer's
[185.5s] daily decisions and
[187.6s] actions okay I think that when uh we
[191.9s] have
[193.1s] the eternal life in
[195.7s] view on our daily life sometimes we tend
[199.6s] to be more careful and on how we make
[202.7s] our daily
[204.2s] decisions but I think we should should
[208.3s] be more prayerful instead of the
[212.7s] avoiding risking like a decision you're
[216.2s] very careful before making it you should
[218.4s] be careful yes but you should more you
[220.8s] should be more prayerful about it
[225.8s] yeah okay I I really like to also chip
[228.8s] into this one um and how viewing the
[232.5s] prize of Eternity is really helpful I
[234.7s] think we in the last book we looked at
[236.5s] when God said remember and I think Mark
[238.7s] Finley described it as as not viewing
[241.2s] eternity as a future promise but a
[243.5s] present reality and so eternity is now
[247.8s] and understanding that I think when we
[250.6s] are connected and living with Christ we
[253.8s] can have a clear view of Eternity
[256.6s] sometimes as Christians our view of the
[259.1s] end goal is quite vague right the idea
[262.7s] of this Mark is a specific scope
[265.8s] something that we have to attain and
[267.9s] sometimes that becomes foggy because of
[269.9s] different things in this world but
[271.6s] eternity can become a now and a present
[274.4s] thought when we are connected to Christ
[277.0s] back to you Amy yeah okay um okay so in
[281.3s] the book it's written they shall hunger
[283.5s] no more neither shall they um neither
[286.7s] shall the sun know any other or feel any
[290.0s] other heat for the lamb which is
[295.2s] the which is the which is in the midst
[299.0s] of the throne shall feed them and shall
[301.8s] lead them and shall um unto the living
[304.7s] Fountains of waters and God shall wipe
[307.1s] the tears from their eyes so I think
[309.0s] when we're making certain decisions in
[310.6s] life we also have to look at the kind of
[314.4s] things we're looking forward to in
[315.9s] future um whatever we are experiencing
[318.8s] or we deem to find wonderful here on
[321.8s] Earth essentially will not compare to
[325.0s] what um is in store for us in heaven
[328.3s] okay
[330.1s] um
[332.5s] subir in what ways does LG white explain
[336.2s] the balance between human effort and
[338.7s] divine assistance in the process of
[340.6s] spiritual growth thank you so much for
[343.0s] the question and I think it's a great
[345.2s] chapter I think she really emphasizes
[348.0s] that while individuals indeed must put
[351.1s] forth um their efforts into living
[353.7s] according to God's will we also find
[357.0s] that true growth comes from the power
[359.6s] power and the guidance of the Holy
[361.8s] Spirit and so human effort alone is
[364.8s] insufficient we need God's strength to
[367.8s] not only enable us but to sustain us in
[371.3s] our spiritual progress I would like
[373.4s] someone to read Philippians chapter 2
[375.8s] verse
[380.5s] 12-13 phili Philippi Philippians chapter
[383.8s] 2:
[387.0s] 12-13 and it says therefore my beloved
[390.9s] as you have always obeyed not as in my
[393.4s] presence only but now much more in my
[395.7s] absence work out your own salvation with
[398.6s] fear and trembling for it is God who
[401.2s] walks in you in you both to Will and to
[404.2s] do for his good
[405.7s] pleasure absolutely and so I think our
[408.5s] view of Salvation is it does transcend
[411.6s] legalism it is not just purely by our
[414.1s] works but most definitely by our faith
[417.2s] and even in the Sabbath day we rest in
[419.2s] God's power to save us but here it's
[421.9s] really reminding us that Believers ought
[423.6s] to work out their salvation while
[425.9s] acknowledging that it is God who works
[429.0s] in them to accomplish his
[432.3s] purpose amen amen
[436.4s] okay um okay this this question is for
[440.1s] Brenda what are some of the common
[442.6s] distractions or hindrances that prevent
[445.2s] Believers from pressing toward the
[447.8s] mark uh
[450.1s] this is this is something I feel like uh
[452.8s] it's a question that applies to everyone
[456.0s] you know like what other like it doesn't
[458.7s] have to be something very complicated
[460.8s] it's what are the common things in
[463.7s] everyone's life that distract you from
[466.5s] focusing on Jesus from focusing on the
[469.8s] goal that we have which is um reaching
[472.4s] our final home our final destination and
[475.6s] um I'm going to use the analogy of I'm
[478.2s] going to use two analogies yeah
[480.2s] excuse me uh the moth when a moth sees
[484.5s] light it goes towards it right and even
[488.8s] if you distract it with okay I can't
[490.3s] distract something with Darkness but
[491.7s] like even though there's Darkness all
[493.0s] around it it will only focus on the
[495.3s] light which is something as Christians
[497.3s] we need to learn how to do to focus only
[499.6s] on the light and
[501.9s] um another knowy I I thought of while
[505.5s] thinking about this was the wise men who
[508.1s] went to see Jesus when he was born
[510.4s] and we told how they were studying the
[512.8s] the word and the history books and they
[514.7s] saw these prophecies about a star and
[517.8s] they were like what what is this and
[519.7s] they followed the star but unlike the
[522.5s] Shepherds who knew the location they got
[525.3s] instructed in this case they went to
[527.5s] King Herod to ask where is this s who is
[530.2s] born right and in the Christian Life
[532.7s] that can be seen as a destru a
[534.2s] destruction in our journey that we have
[536.5s] we can get false false paths from the
[540.4s] right path cuz we walk a narrow path and
[543.0s] we can be distracted by other paths that
[544.9s] seem similar but easier to walk and
[549.0s] those are the destructions we have that
[551.7s] distract us from reaching that goal that
[555.1s] we have from pressing onto the mark but
[557.6s] we as Christians are given the hope that
[560.1s] we will come back to the right path yeah
[563.4s] there's something you said about the
[565.0s] wise men I think it's very true that
[567.8s] they had to study they had to be
[569.5s] students of the word they had to
[571.6s] meditate on that in order to know no
[573.6s] this star is of importance this is
[575.6s] leading us to the birth of the Messiah I
[578.6s] mean other people would look at the
[579.8s] stars and say wow nice outside you they
[583.9s] wouldn't reflect and see that this is a
[586.8s] important thing and so I think the
[589.0s] clarity of the mark that we're finding
[592.5s] is brought through the word being
[594.7s] intentional about reading that
[598.2s] word uh thank you sair but there's also
[601.2s] I forgot to add something um
[603.5s] communication and prayer this this is
[606.4s] something it's not a distraction but uh
[609.2s] not having communication and constant
[610.9s] prayer with God can also be a form of
[612.8s] distraction because when you are not in
[615.5s] constant connection to what is our guide
[619.5s] to the goal that we have you will lose
[621.8s] sight of where you're going so when we
[623.9s] don't have that communication and prayer
[625.4s] with God we lose we lose um the path
[628.8s] we're following and we get distracted
[630.8s] cuz when you're not looking at the goal
[632.2s] where you're going you will look
[633.4s] elsewhere right my mom likes saying I
[635.0s] have the attention span of a fly oh cuz
[638.1s] um when I'm doing something and I see a
[640.2s] fly pass I'll just follow it so like as
[642.4s] Christians we shouldn't be like that
[643.9s] yeah and pray prayer and faith will do
[647.4s] what no powers on Earth can do for us so
[651.1s] by prayer and faith we can have the we
[654.6s] can have the concentration we need to
[656.9s] press on the goal yeah to add on to that
[661.3s] um even though we pray to not get
[665.0s] distracted I think we should also view
[667.2s] prayer as something that we used to like
[673.0s] essentially rely on God essent I don't
[675.7s] know how to word it but you know rely on
[678.8s] God as you go through trials um and
[682.3s] challenges so we cannot solely rely on
[685.2s] previous experiences when we go through
[687.9s] something and I think we can go through
[690.4s] it again we constantly have to be in
[691.8s] communication with God if we want to you
[694.5s] know better ourselves yeah
[697.4s] amen um okay so my final question goes
[701.0s] to teacher Nik how does the analogy of a
[704.4s] race as used by the Apostle Paul help us
[707.2s] illustrate the Christians striving
[709.6s] toward spiritual
[712.4s] maturity yeah it's an interesting
[714.4s] question I'd just like to answer it with
[716.6s] a personal experience I have run a
[720.2s] marathon marathons a number of times
[723.7s] when I've gone for the marathon I've
[725.4s] never done a 42 kilm but I've done 21 km
[728.7s] a couple of times and I think about how
[732.6s] it feels when you reach the 15th or the
[734.9s] 17th kilm you just want it to finish
[739.1s] already because it's quite tiring you
[742.1s] need to have that endurance to actually
[744.3s] push through and so when we talk about
[747.2s] pressing towards the mark it means that
[749.9s] we need to have resilience as Christians
[753.6s] because in the world there's temptations
[755.4s] there all these things that will
[757.0s] actually happen to us but we really need
[760.1s] to push through and it doesn't start
[763.6s] with the marathon it actually starts
[766.1s] with the training for the marathon so
[768.8s] you invest normally in shoes you'll
[771.2s] invest a number of hours trying to train
[773.9s] every morning before you actually run
[775.5s] the race if you have some weight you
[777.5s] need to Shadow some weight if you want
[779.2s] want to improve your time so all those
[781.8s] are the things that go into preparing
[784.2s] for a race and I think in Christianity
[787.5s] there are some friends that we might
[789.0s] have to let go there are some habits and
[791.2s] practices that we might need to let go
[793.4s] of if we expect to win in the Christian
[796.3s] race so I believe that the Christian
[799.0s] race uh is the the Journey of
[802.8s] Christianity is liken to race in that
[805.2s] man yeah I think that really speaks to
[808.7s] there's is a need for action and
[811.3s] sometimes that as Christians we can fall
[813.4s] in this deadly state of inaction where
[817.7s] the idea of pressing forward requires
[820.2s] pressure right there is something that
[822.2s] is you need to break through and as
[825.6s] Christians we must really awaken the
[827.6s] spiritual because as we awaken the
[831.4s] spiritual we begin to exercise our faith
[835.4s] and exercising that Faith needs action
[838.8s] and so I think there needs to be an
[841.3s] understanding yes you are on this race
[843.6s] and there is help in that race but
[845.8s] requires efforts as well yeah amen amen
[850.4s] amen I think Philippians 4:13 is also a
[853.9s] really good verse um I can do all things
[856.9s] through Christ who strengthens me yeah
[860.9s] so as we walk through this journey of
[864.5s] life and pressing towards the Mark it's
[866.4s] important to remember that Christ is
[868.6s] with us and we just have to submit to
[870.6s] him in order for us to press towards the
[874.2s] mark yes amen if I could add just
[876.9s] another verse on top of what Amy just
[879.3s] said uh 2 Timothy 4 verse uh verse 7
[885.1s] it's a very popular verse when it comes
[887.1s] to going fighting the good fight yeah so
[891.6s] Paul says I fought the good fight I have
[893.3s] finished the race I have kept the faith
[895.4s] and it just basically points out what
[897.4s] everyone has said today on how
[899.9s] it's a race where we're we're walking
[902.3s] we're not even walking we're running a
[903.6s] race and everyone has a different pace
[906.2s] but the greatest um achievement we could
[909.5s] have as Christians is reach the end and
[911.2s] said I have fought the good fight I
[913.1s] reached the goal so that that's just
[915.6s] something we could take home today yeah
[918.2s] amen amen so thank you all panelists
[922.3s] Brenda saira uh Silas and Amy even as
[926.9s] we've covered the whole book help in
[930.0s] daily living as we said in chapter one
[932.4s] we spoke about living with others
[934.9s] chapter I mean yeah chapter one was
[937.0s] everyday living then chapter two was
[938.7s] living with others chapter three was uh
[942.1s] building Christian yeah developing
[944.3s] Christian character and chapter 4
