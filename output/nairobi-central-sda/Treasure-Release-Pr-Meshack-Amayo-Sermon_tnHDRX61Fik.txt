Before we go into the sermon, a wise man once said that a virtuous wife who can find she is worth more than many rubies. By the way, that was a very precious metal and very costly in the olden times. And therefore he says that if you find such a one the husband's heart trusts in her that is none other than I want to bring to you a virtuous woman so that you can be able to see one and at least strive to be like her. Please rise and greet the congregation. Her name is Sweetheart. That is her name. May God bless you so much. Our title for the sermon is treasure release. Treasure release. Let us humble ourselves and seek the divine power. Mighty God in heaven, your name is powerful, your words are sweet, and you are our comfort. This is why we have come before you this morning that you may be able to give to us the treasures of heaven. As you open to us the words, holy words from the Bible, may you take our hearts captive that we may listen. I am a human being not worthy to talk of these beautiful words. May you use me. Let me run and hide away that you may be able to shine. In Jesus name we pray. Amen. The book of 2 Chronicles. Open chapter 17 and just rest there. The book of Chronicles both first and second. The major theme of the book of Chronicles that is first and second is the temple. You will see there the reign of the first king Saul and then King Solomon coming to the sta king king David coming to the stage. And when King David comes to the stage, it is the defeat of the Philistines and then bringing the ark of God to the seat of David. And the first time he tried to bring the ark was on a wrong way because he didn't know that he needed to have brought in the Levites to carry the ark to the to the land of Israel back to the land of Israel because it was captured by the Philistines during King Saul. But when he brings back the the the ark, he tries to bring it back in chapter 13 of 1 Chronicles. Usuza dies on the way because he did not take counel from the Lord, but he wants to bring it again in a better way in chapter 15. Then after bringing it back in a better way in chapter 15 of 1 Chronicles, then it came and it was brought to the land of Israel to the city of David and the king is very happy. Now the ark is resting with the Israelites. Now he starts to question in chapter 17. Come to me in verse 17, sorry, chapter 17 of 1 Chronicles. 1st Chronicles 17:1, the Bible is saying, "Now it came to pass when David was dwelling in his house that David said to Nathan the prophet, "See now, I dwell in a house of ceda, but the ark of covenant of the Lord is under tent in the curtains." He has called the prophet of the lord and he's telling the prophet of the lord is telling telling him servant of the lord look at me I brought the ark of the covenant the holy symbol of god and it is dwelling in the tents but I am living in one of the best houses of the time it is shameful to me Then Nathan, a man of God, told him, "The king, you have thought it well. You need to build the house for the Lord." Then Nathan goes home, but the Lord calls him and the Lord is telling him in the same chapter, "Go and tell David that he will not bring build for me the temple." And there God is saying in verse 4 of chapter 17, go and tell my servant David, thus says the Lord, you shall not build me a house to dwell here to dwell in. Not that God is not needing a house, but for some other reasons. And you jump to verse 11. God is making a covenant with David. Verse 11. And this we can call it Davididic covenant. Davidic covenant. And you can find it also some parts of it in Psalms. And it says, "And it shall be when your days are fulfilled, when you must go to be with your fathers, that I will set up set up your seed after you, who will be of your sons, and I will establish his kingdom. He shall build me a house and I will establish his throne forever. I will be his father and he shall be my son and I will not take my mercy away from him. You see some promises when God gives you some promises you feel very happy. God is telling David I have seen your heart. You wanted to build for me a to build for me a house. But because of shedding a lot of blood, your reign has been to capture and bring to us peace in Jerusalem. I will now give your son the baton. He will be able to build build for me the temple and I will give him peace and my mercy shall not depart from him. Do you know how David was happy when he heard that God is going to give him a dynasty that will last forever? David is known as the king who really loved to hear from the Lord. What is the Lord saying? And he is the one the king who loved the temple of the Lord always. He wanted the work of the Lord to be done to standard. And what a blessing if you have such a king on the throne. A king who first wants to consult the Lord. Since he made the first mistake, David never wanted again to make any other mistake. This first mistake I I mean when he tried to bring the ark not following the instructions of the Lord. Then any other time when David was going before the Lord, he would ask ask the Lord for his counsel. One time he felt that his army has been has become so big. So what he did he said to Joab the army man, army commander that I want you to number all the people, do the counting. Then they did the counting but the the job before doing the counting told him that is good my lord all these are your servants but king why do you want to to number the people but all in all it was done because the king said then after numbering they realized that the lord was not happy with them. Then the prophet of the Lord Nathan comes to David and tells him why did you do such a great sin? Because it was out of self to know how great you are. How you have the great number of h of the army. So David said, "I have done this great sin before the Lord." Then Nathan told him that the Lord has said, "Choose three things. You must be punished. either famine for three years or you will be chased by your enemies or choose whether the Lord will be able to make you suffer for a period of time. David said, "I have sinned greatly before the Lord. Let me not fall in the hands of men, but let me fall in the hand of the Lord. I know I have done sin, but let not man punish me. If it must be a punishment, let God himself bring me a punishment because of he is full of mercy. Because he will punish me, but he will mix his wrath with mercy. David is a king who loved the Lord. Therefore, he has been told your son. We are just jumping straight to chapter 29. That story I've said, you can see it in chapter 21 and 22 about about the the the counting. But now chapter 29, David has been told that your son Solomon will be able to be a king and is the one who is going to build the temple. Now from verse one, let's read it slowly. Furthermore, King David said to all the assembly, this is assembly of the leaders that were called. They were in a meeting of leaders of Israel. You can read that in the previous chapter 28. Then we continue to read. My son Solomon, whom alone God has chosen, is young and inexperienced. The work is great because the temple is not for man but for the Lord. We pause. We will do one to three slowly. David is telling the leaders of Israel in the presence of Israelites that my son Solomon whom alone God has chosen is young and inexperienced and the work is great. Why is it great? Because it is to build not a palace of man but the temple of God. Now what that statement means is that David is saying that Solomon is very young by the way very inexperienced but him alone has been chosen by God to build. Do you know that one tells me that first thing is bringing recognition of the choice of God to build the temple and who to do it. There is a weakness of the one who is going to build the temple. The one who is going to build the temple is young and inexperienced. Many of our leaders who are promoting the giving this time by the way they may be inexperienced. They may be we may see them as old but they may be inexperienced. The pastor who is promoting the giving may be young and inexperienced. But God is saying here David is saying that him alone, it is him who the Lord has chosen to build the temple and the temple must be built. them alone. They are the people that the Lord has chosen to build the temple. I know we have a committee that is working on this. They may be inexperienced. They may not have done the best that best brands can do, but they are the ones that the Lord has chosen to build for him a temple. So he's saying my son Solomon whom alone God has chosen is young and inexperienced. We may be inexperienced but the Lord has chosen us. He will be able to use us in the work in his temple. Then it proceeds to say that the work is great because the temple is not for man but for the Lord. So that text is saying the reason why David is saying the work is great is that that house that is being built is not for our residential uh purpose but it is the temple of the Lord. The fact that it is the temple of the Lord being built, the work is great. That work becomes holy. The work becomes great. And therefore, a plea that everyone should lend a hand in building the temple. The work is great. The work is too big for few people to do. It is only when all of us we may come together and lend a hand and do this great work of the Lord. Why am I emphasizing that this one I may say without [Music] fearing because I have seen it in all churches there is a section of us when we go to church oh elders those people will give oh those people will give then you sit back you don't want to What do I mean? You say, you know me, I don't have. There are people who have. In the church of God, there is no one who is having. The work is great. Until all of us lend a hand, we will not be able to build. That is why David is pleading with the congregation of Israel that my son is an is inexperienced. Please let us all rise up and build the temple. That is what David is pleading with us today. That you people who love the work of God. This work is great but God has chosen people to do it. And in verse two, verse two of the same chapter, now for the house of my God, I have prepared with all my might gold for things to be made of gold. Silver for things to be made of silver. Bronze for things of bronze. Wood for things of wood. Onic stones. Stones to be set. Glittering stones of various colors. all kinds of precious stones and marble slabs in abundance. Here he is saying I love you have gotten all the statement because it is powerful but the first statement is saying just that first part is saying now for the house of my God I have prepared with all my might. What could David be meaning by saying that for building the temple of God? I have taken all my energy to do the preparation. The word that has been translated that he has been he has prepared with all his might can be translated power energy. He has put all his power. He is still the king. So may maybe has put the energy of the kingship. He has put all his mind on it. He has put all his strength in it, physical physical energy that he can put on it so that it can succeed. Can you confirm that from the scriptures? From verses 22 through verse 27, David has prepared several committees to prepare the building of this temple. He has prepared the Levites. He has prepared the musicians. He has prepared the soldiers to give security. He has prepared for the collections. So all the things are prepared ready for building. So he's saying for the house of my God I have put in all the energy. I don't know what kind of energy you always put when you are building your personal house. Do you know all the energy that you always put in? And when you go through that experience, you find that there comes a time that you want to go into phases and these phases sometimes stall and then you realize that where it has stalled, dangers will come unless you work on it so that you save it. Maybe you have done the walls that have been there for many years without the roof and then you are saying it will be damaged by the weather conditions. So I have to put more energy so that I can be able to bring in the next step so that I succeed. David is saying that kind of energy instead of putting in my own house I put it in the house of the Lord. And in verse three, verse three, David is saying, let me look at it there. Moreover, because I have set my affection on the house of my God, I have given to the house of my God over and above all that I have prepared for the holy house, my own special treasure of gold and silver. I want you to reread some statements there. David is saying, "I have set my affection on the house of God. My love has been drawn to the house of God. I have set all my heart to the house of my God." Then he says, I have prepared things for the holy house. The last statement is saying, I have given my own special treasure. Why would he say my own? Other versions would tell you I have given my personal treasure. What does it mean? Why would he insert the word personal? Why would he say my own treasure? My thinking could be so that you can differentiate that he has not taken these things from his office. meaning that they are private things that he has taken out to give to his god. You know sometimes when it is from your house you had settled it. You had made it to be the things for the house at home you don't want to release them to go away from your house. So David is saying I have removed my own personal treasure to the house of my God. So what David is saying is [Music] that I have things in my house. I cherished them but I have given them out for the house of my God. What is a treasure? Just think of the meaning of a treasure. What is a treasure? I think it could mean many things. It could mean personal [Music] possession but above that precious possession. Something you value so much. Am I still on track? You know, it can just be a ring, but you value it so much. It was given to you by your your grandpa. Something you value so much. And by the way, it is something you would want to keep safe for prosperity for for for for for eternity. You would want to keep it safe. A treasure is something you would never want to part with. It is something you love. It is something valuable. So therefore, he's saying in this verse three that um let me see it. Moreover, because I have set my affection on the house of my God, because I have put all my love in the house of my God, I have given my personal treasure. Because I have loved God, I have given out my treasure. And which treasure is this? What kind of thing has he given? He is saying in verse four, in verse four he says that there I have given 3,000 talents of gold of the gold of oil and 7,000 talents of refined silver to overlay the walls of the house. the gold for things of gold and silver for the things of silver and all kinds of work to be done by the hands of craft craftsmen. When I wanted to translate this talents to a language we may understand today this talents when I look at my good news in this verse for it is saying I have given more than 100 tons of pure gold. more than 100 tons of pure gold and I have given almost 240 tons of pure silver and he enumerates others for the house of my God. Then he comes to verse five and he says, he comes to verse five and he says, he turns to the assembly and he tells the assembly, who then is willing to consecrate himself this day to the Lord. I've just taken the last part. Who then is willing to consecrate himself this day to the house? Okay. To the Lord. Please don't remove it. I want people to get a statement from there. From verse 5 to 17, the word willing has been used seven times. Meaning that giving is through a will. But the correct uh the literal translation of the three words willing to consecrate himself, the four words willing to consecrate himself could be who is willing to fill his hand to the Lord. Understand? Understand the four words. Who is willing to consecrate himself? Literal translation means who is willing to fill his heart to the Lord. That is a saying of the the it is a Hebrew saying which meant like they were consecrating the priests. When a priest is being ordained, you are saying they are filling their hands to the Lord. I want you to understand that one. When a a priest is being ordained, the word that they will use, the saying would be they are filling their hands to the Lord. And another meaning of it would be when you are saying they are filling their hands could be it meant that the land would be filled with the presence of the Lord. So this question is being asked to us today. Who is willing to fill his hand to the Lord? Who is willing that your hand may be filled so that you can work for the Lord? Who is willing that the presence of the Lord can be able to fill your land? Who is willing that the presence of the Lord could be able to fill all that you have? And that is why the call is made. Who then is willing to consecrate himself this day to the Lord? You know they are building they're building and and is collecting for the building of the church and he's asking the leaders of of Israel and is asking all Israelites who among you is feel willing to fill his hand for the Lord. Do you want your hand to be full because of the temple of the Lord? Let me read very quickly so that I end it. After making that call, then the leaders verse six. Then the leaders houses leaders of the tribes of Israel and captains of the thousand and hundreds with officers over the king's work offered willingly. They gave for the work of the house of the Lord 5,000 talents. I was being told that this f 5,000 talents and 10,000 talents of direct of gold would be about 170 tons of gold. They gave more again. 170 tons of gold, then about 340 tons of silver and they gave willingly to finalize. Let's come back to verse three. Give me verse three. Then we we we we finalize. Verse three saying, "Moreover, because I have set my affection on the house of my God, I have given to the house of my God over and above all that I prepared. I prepared to give God something. But because I felt much love for God, I gave above over and above all that I prepared for the house. Uh it it meant that I had to release my own special treasure of gold and silver. I want to read you read that verse in good news. My good news is saying over and above all this that I have provided I have given silver and gold from my personal property because the reason of giving my personal property. What is the reason? The reason is because of my love for God's temple. Because of my love for God's temple, I release my treasure. Here is where now we make a call. David is saying because of my love I give out my personal treasure. The sermon title is saying treasure release because of your great love for your God. You want to release something you would have never wanted to release to move away from you. But you will joyously do it with lots of love and with lots of desire. You will take it rejoicing that you are building the work the temple of your Lord. Joyous release of your t treasure. It is something you never wanted to part with. Pastor came here and he was asking what kind of treasure do you think you have in your life? What thing is it that you think you have in your life? What is this thing that you think you love so much? Can you release it to the Lord? who is willing to make his hands full for the Lord. Can you release something precious to you? To the Lord. A call has been made for 3 million families who are willing to pledge 3 million. By the way, it is a treasure. A call has been made for families who are willing to release 1 million to the Lord. for a period of time so that the work of the Lord is not in shame. A call has been made for those who can make a pledge for 100. Can you release such a treasure to the Lord? A call has been made for those who are willing to be consecrated to the Lord. as we will be singing song 551 but after my prayer I will be praying is when I make a call I will pray before I make a call then we will sing a song which is 6 561 I think it is telling us that all that we have comes from the Lord we need to thank the Lord just look at your seats inside the sitting room look at them and say that they are blessings from the Lord. Look at your your seat in the office where you are seated. Look at it and say that this is a blessing from the Lord. Those who are online, please sign online forms. They are there at the YouTube. Also, you can find ways to reach us through our website. You can give. We had a collection and our target is 3 million for online. We need communication systems for those who are hearing us online. Please, if you are hearing me online, you can be typing, God bless you. God bless you. I will release blessings, my treasures to the Lord. Say, I will release my treasures to the Lord. You can do it through empessor. You can do it through a card. I request that those who are willing, please just rise up. I want to offer prayer before I make a call. Those who are willing, just rise up. I want to make a prayer for each one of us. I'm saying all of us, we just rise for a word of [Music] prayer. Let us pray. Dear loving Lord, thank you for speaking to us that we need to love your temple. This place is a holy place and any work that is being done inside here is so great. You are calling upon each and every heart here that Lord we may be blessed and we may be able to bless the work in the church. A call has been made for those who are willing to give their pledges. Even those who will be able to give cash today. Lord, may you talk to our hearts that we will be willing to give. Mighty God in heaven, we praise you because of your power. We praise you because of your glory. It is because of you that we have the things that we have in the house, the jobs that we have, the businesses that we have. Your house should not lie in ruins. May you talk to our hearts that your house will be blessed forever more. In Jesus name we pray.

[66.7s] Tuesday as we would be coming to praise
[70.2s] the Lord with all that he has given unto
[73.1s] us, giving back willingly what the Lord
[77.0s] has given unto us. Before we go into the
[82.5s] sermon, a wise man once said
[86.3s] that a virtuous wife who can
[90.7s] find she is worth more than many
[95.6s] rubies. By the way, that was a very
[99.4s] precious metal and very
[102.6s] costly in the olden times.
[106.0s] And therefore he says that if you find
[108.4s] such a
[109.6s] one the husband's heart trusts in
[114.7s] her that is none other
[119.0s] than I want to bring to you a virtuous

[154.0s] release.
[155.7s] Treasure release. Let us humble
[159.6s] ourselves and seek the divine power.

[182.6s] This is why we have come before you this
[185.2s] morning that you may be able to give to
[191.1s] us the treasures of
[194.1s] heaven. As you open to us the
[198.8s] words, holy words from the
[201.7s] Bible, may you take our hearts captive
[206.8s] that we may listen.
[209.7s] I am a human
[212.1s] being not worthy to talk of these
[215.1s] beautiful words. May you use
[218.5s] me. Let me run and hide away that you
[222.8s] may be able to shine. In Jesus name we
[225.9s] pray.
[229.0s] Amen. The book of 2 Chronicles.
[236.7s] Open chapter 17 and just rest
[240.7s] there. The book of
[244.0s] Chronicles both first and second. The
[247.1s] major theme of the book of
[250.4s] Chronicles that is first and second is
[253.7s] the temple.
[255.8s] You will see there the reign of the
[258.7s] first king Saul and then King Solomon
[262.2s] coming to the sta king king David coming
[265.7s] to the stage. And when King David comes
[268.2s] to the stage, it is the defeat of the
[271.0s] Philistines and then bringing the ark of
[275.0s] God to the seat of David.
[279.8s] And the first time he tried to bring the
[283.1s] ark was on a wrong way because he didn't
[286.8s] know that he needed to have brought in
[290.2s] the Levites to carry the ark to the to
[294.2s] the land of Israel back to the land of
[296.5s] Israel because it was captured by the
[298.7s] Philistines during King Saul. But when
[302.2s] he brings back the the
[307.6s] the ark, he tries to bring it back in
[311.2s] chapter 13 of 1
[313.9s] Chronicles. Usuza dies on the way
[317.8s] because he did not take counel from the
[320.2s] Lord, but he wants to bring it again in
[323.8s] a better way in chapter 15. Then after
[326.9s] bringing it back in a better way in
[328.9s] chapter 15 of 1 Chronicles, then it came
[333.7s] and it was brought to the land of Israel
[337.2s] to the city of David and the king is
[340.2s] very happy. Now the ark is resting with
[344.6s] the Israelites. Now he starts to
[347.8s] question in chapter 17. Come to me in
[351.6s] verse 17, sorry, chapter 17 of 1
[356.1s] Chronicles.
[359.2s] 1st Chronicles 17:1, the Bible is
[362.2s] saying, "Now it came to pass when David
[366.3s] was dwelling in his
[368.7s] house that David said to Nathan the
[372.5s] prophet, "See now, I
[376.8s] dwell in a house of
[379.5s] ceda, but the ark of covenant of the
[383.6s] Lord is under tent in the curtains."
[388.6s] He has called the prophet of the lord
[391.5s] and he's telling the prophet of the lord
[393.7s] is telling telling him servant of the
[397.0s] lord look at me I brought the ark of the
[401.7s] covenant the holy symbol of
[404.8s] god and it is dwelling in the tents but
[409.2s] I am living in one of the best houses of
[412.5s] the
[413.2s] time it is shameful to
[416.6s] me Then Nathan, a man of God, told
[421.2s] him, "The king, you have thought it
[424.5s] well. You need to build the house for
[427.9s] the
[429.6s] Lord." Then Nathan goes home, but the
[433.5s] Lord calls him and the Lord is telling
[436.4s] him in the same chapter, "Go and tell
[438.9s] David that he will not bring build for
[442.5s] me the temple."
[446.2s] And there God is saying in verse
[450.8s] 4 of chapter 17, go and tell my servant
[455.8s] David, thus says the Lord, you shall not
[460.1s] build me a house to dwell here to dwell
[463.7s] in. Not that God is not needing a house,
[466.6s] but for some other
[469.2s] reasons. And you jump to verse 11.
[473.4s] God is making a covenant with David.
[476.9s] Verse
[477.8s] 11. And this we can call it Davididic
[482.4s] covenant. Davidic covenant.
[486.1s] And you can find it also some parts of
[489.3s] it in Psalms. And it
[493.1s] says, "And it shall
[495.5s] be when your days are
[498.6s] fulfilled, when you must
[502.0s] go to be with your fathers, that I will
[505.8s] set up set up your seed after you, who
[511.6s] will be of your sons, and I will
[515.1s] establish his kingdom.
[517.6s] He shall build me a house and I will
[521.3s] establish his throne
[523.5s] forever. I will be his father and
[527.9s] he shall be my son and I will not take
[532.8s] my
[533.7s] mercy away from him. You see some
[537.9s] promises when God gives you some
[539.5s] promises you feel very happy. God is
[542.1s] telling
[543.6s] David I have seen your heart. You wanted
[546.4s] to build for me a to build for me a
[548.8s] house. But because
[551.4s] of shedding a lot of blood, your reign
[554.2s] has been to capture and bring to us
[557.9s] peace in
[559.7s] Jerusalem. I will now give your son the
[563.0s] baton.
[564.6s] He will be able to build build for me
[568.2s] the
[569.0s] temple and I will give him
[572.4s] peace and my mercy shall not depart from
[578.0s] him. Do you know how David was happy
[581.4s] when he heard that God is going to give
[584.5s] him a dynasty that will last forever?
[589.9s] David is known as the king who really
[594.3s] loved to hear from the Lord. What is the
[598.0s] Lord
[599.1s] saying? And he is the one the king who
[603.4s] loved the temple of the Lord always. He
[607.6s] wanted the work of the Lord to be done
[611.4s] to standard.
[614.6s] And what a blessing if you have such a
[617.4s] king on the throne. A king who first
[621.1s] wants to consult the Lord. Since he made
[624.3s] the first mistake, David never wanted
[627.0s] again to make any other mistake. This
[629.6s] first mistake I I mean when he tried to
[633.1s] bring the
[634.3s] ark not following the instructions of
[637.0s] the Lord. Then any other time when David
[641.0s] was going before the Lord, he would ask
[644.1s] ask the Lord for his counsel. One
[647.7s] time he felt that his army has been has
[651.7s] become so big. So what he
[654.9s] did he said to Joab the army man, army
[660.4s] commander that I want you to number all
[664.5s] the people, do the counting.
[667.5s] Then they did the counting but the the
[670.7s] job before doing the counting told him
[673.8s] that is good my lord all these are your
[676.1s] servants but king why do you want to to
[679.8s] number the
[684.4s] people but all in all it was done
[687.0s] because the king
[688.8s] said
[691.6s] then after numbering they realized that
[694.8s] the lord was not happy with
[697.1s] them. Then the prophet of the Lord
[699.9s] Nathan comes to David and tells him why
[703.8s] did you do such a great
[706.0s] sin? Because it was out of self to know
[710.0s] how great you are. How you have the
[714.2s] great number of h of the army.
[718.4s] So David
[720.6s] said, "I have done this great sin before
[724.2s] the
[725.2s] Lord."
[727.6s] Then Nathan told him that the Lord has
[730.5s] said, "Choose three things. You must be
[733.5s] punished. either famine for three years
[737.8s] or you will be chased by your enemies or
[741.1s] choose whether the Lord will be able to
[743.8s] make you suffer
[747.1s] for a period of time. David said, "I
[752.2s] have sinned greatly before the
[754.9s] Lord. Let me not fall in the hands of
[758.6s] men, but let me fall in the hand of the
[762.6s] Lord. I know I have done sin, but let
[766.8s] not man punish me. If it must be a
[771.2s] punishment, let God himself bring me a
[774.5s] punishment because of he is full of
[778.5s] mercy. Because he will punish me, but he
[781.5s] will mix his wrath with
[784.4s] mercy. David is a king who loved the
[787.9s] Lord. Therefore, he has been told your
[791.7s] son. We are just jumping straight to
[794.2s] chapter
[798.1s] 29. That story I've said, you can see it
[800.9s] in chapter 21 and 22 about about the the
[805.1s] the counting.
[808.0s] But
[809.6s] now chapter
[813.8s] 29, David has been told that your son
[817.0s] Solomon will be able to be a king and is
[821.0s] the one who is going to build the
[825.4s] temple. Now from verse
[829.1s] one, let's read
[831.7s] it slowly.
[838.7s] Furthermore, King David said to all the
[844.0s] assembly, this is assembly of the
[846.6s] leaders that were called. They were in a
[849.4s] meeting of leaders of
[851.6s] Israel. You can read that in the
[854.0s] previous chapter
[856.0s] 28. Then we continue to read.
[860.4s] My son Solomon, whom alone God has
[864.4s] chosen, is young and
[868.8s] inexperienced. The work is
[872.0s] great because the temple is not for
[876.0s] man but for the
[878.6s] Lord. We pause. We will do one to three
[882.5s] slowly.
[887.2s] David is telling the leaders of Israel
[891.4s] in the presence of
[894.2s] Israelites that my son
[897.6s] Solomon whom
[900.1s] alone God has
[902.9s] chosen is young and
[907.2s] inexperienced and the work is great.
[914.6s] Why is it great? Because it is to
[918.9s] build not a palace of man but the temple
[924.2s] of God.
[926.0s] Now what that statement means is that
[930.6s] David is
[932.3s] saying
[934.3s] that Solomon is very young by the way
[938.8s] very
[942.4s] inexperienced but him alone has been
[945.6s] chosen by God to
[952.4s] build. Do you know that one tells
[955.4s] me that first thing is bringing
[959.9s] recognition of the choice of
[963.3s] God to build the temple and who to do
[972.5s] it. There is a weakness of the one who
[976.9s] is going to build the temple.
[979.5s] The one who is going to build the temple
[983.0s] is
[984.4s] young and
[989.1s] inexperienced. Many of our leaders who
[991.6s] are promoting the giving this time by
[995.1s] the way they may be
[998.2s] inexperienced. They may be we may see
[1000.8s] them as old but they may be
[1003.0s] inexperienced.
[1010.4s] The pastor who is promoting the
[1013.0s] giving may be
[1016.2s] young and
[1021.8s] inexperienced. But God is saying here
[1025.7s] David is
[1026.9s] saying that him
[1031.2s] alone, it is
[1033.6s] him who the Lord has chosen to build the
[1038.7s] temple and the temple must be built.
[1046.4s] them alone. They are the people that the
[1049.0s] Lord has chosen to build the
[1052.1s] temple. I know we have a committee that
[1054.8s] is working on this. They may be
[1058.9s] inexperienced. They may not have done
[1062.6s] the best
[1064.0s] that best brands can
[1067.3s] do, but they are the ones that the Lord
[1071.5s] has chosen to build for him a temple.
[1076.6s] So he's saying my son Solomon whom alone
[1082.3s] God has chosen is young and
[1088.0s] inexperienced. We may be
[1091.2s] inexperienced but the Lord has chosen
[1095.6s] us. He will be able to use
[1098.8s] us in the
[1102.1s] work in his temple.
[1111.2s] Then it proceeds to
[1114.9s] say that the work is
[1119.0s] great because the temple is not for
[1123.2s] man but for the Lord.
[1126.5s] So that text is
[1128.6s] saying the reason why David is saying
[1131.3s] the work is great is that that house
[1134.7s] that is being
[1136.5s] built is not for
[1139.2s] our residential
[1142.7s] uh
[1143.7s] purpose but it is the temple of the
[1147.4s] Lord.
[1149.0s] The fact that it is the temple of the
[1151.8s] Lord being built, the work is
[1156.8s] great. That work becomes
[1159.9s] holy. The work becomes
[1165.0s] great. And
[1167.2s] therefore, a plea that everyone should
[1172.0s] lend a hand in building the
[1175.2s] temple. The work is great.
[1179.4s] The work
[1183.1s] is too big for few people to
[1187.5s] do. It is only when all of us we may
[1192.1s] come together and lend a hand and do
[1194.7s] this great work of the Lord.
[1197.3s] Why am I emphasizing
[1200.4s] that this one I may
[1203.9s] say without
[1205.6s] [Music]
[1206.9s] fearing because I have seen it in all
[1212.0s] churches there is a section of us when
[1216.0s] we go to church oh elders those people
[1219.1s] will
[1220.0s] give oh those people will give then you
[1223.8s] sit back you don't want to
[1226.9s] What do I mean? You say, you know me, I
[1229.6s] don't have. There are people who
[1232.8s] have. In the church of God, there is no
[1236.4s] one who is
[1237.9s] having. The work is great. Until all of
[1242.6s] us lend a hand, we will not be able to
[1246.2s] build.
[1248.1s] That is why David is pleading with the
[1251.2s] congregation of Israel that my son is an
[1255.0s] is
[1256.2s] inexperienced. Please let us all rise up
[1260.0s] and build the temple.
[1262.6s] That is what David is pleading with us
[1266.8s] today. That you people who love the work
[1270.2s] of
[1271.2s] God. This work is
[1274.4s] great but God has chosen people to do
[1278.0s] it. And in verse
[1281.2s] two, verse
[1283.2s] two of the same
[1287.6s] chapter,
[1290.1s] now for the house of my
[1294.4s] God, I have
[1297.1s] prepared with all my
[1301.2s] might
[1303.6s] gold for things to be made of gold.
[1309.6s] Silver for things to be made of
[1314.2s] silver. Bronze for
[1317.3s] things of
[1319.5s] bronze. Wood for things of
[1324.0s] wood. Onic stones. Stones to be set.
[1329.0s] Glittering stones of various colors.
[1333.1s] all kinds of precious stones and marble
[1336.9s] slabs in
[1341.6s] abundance. Here he is saying I love you
[1346.4s] have gotten all the statement because it
[1348.6s] is powerful but the first statement is
[1351.5s] saying just that first part is
[1355.0s] saying now for the house of my God I
[1359.9s] have
[1361.2s] prepared with all my might.
[1367.7s] What could David be meaning by saying
[1372.2s] that for building the temple of
[1376.7s] God? I have taken all my
[1380.2s] energy to do the preparation.
[1384.2s] The word that has been translated that
[1386.7s] he has been he has prepared with all his
[1391.2s] might can be
[1393.6s] translated
[1395.5s] power
[1397.6s] energy. He has put all his
[1400.8s] power. He is still the king. So may
[1403.7s] maybe has put the energy of the
[1406.8s] kingship. He has put all
[1409.8s] his mind on it. He has put all his
[1415.0s] strength in
[1416.3s] it, physical physical energy that he can
[1419.5s] put on it so that it can
[1424.3s] succeed. Can you confirm that from the
[1428.1s] scriptures? From verses
[1431.5s] 22 through verse
[1435.7s] 27, David has prepared several
[1439.6s] committees to prepare the building of
[1442.1s] this
[1442.8s] temple. He has prepared the Levites. He
[1446.4s] has
[1447.8s] prepared
[1449.7s] the
[1451.2s] musicians. He has prepared the soldiers
[1454.1s] to give security. He has prepared for
[1457.4s] the collections. So all the things are
[1460.9s] prepared ready for building. So he's
[1464.0s] saying for the house of my God I have
[1467.8s] put in all the
[1470.0s] energy. I don't know what kind of energy
[1473.0s] you always put when you are building
[1474.7s] your personal
[1476.7s] house. Do you know all the energy that
[1479.0s] you always put in?
[1481.8s] And when you go through that experience,
[1484.8s] you find that there comes a time that
[1488.2s] you want to go into phases and these
[1490.6s] phases sometimes stall and then you
[1494.5s] realize that where it has
[1498.2s] stalled, dangers will come unless you
[1502.3s] work on it so that you save it. Maybe
[1505.4s] you have done the walls that have been
[1507.4s] there for many years without the roof
[1511.0s] and then you are saying it will be
[1513.0s] damaged by the weather
[1515.1s] conditions. So I have to put more energy
[1519.0s] so that I can be able to bring in the
[1523.7s] next step so that I succeed.
[1526.9s] David is saying that kind of energy
[1529.4s] instead of putting in my own house I put
[1533.0s] it in the house of the
[1535.9s] Lord. And in verse
[1541.1s] three, verse
[1547.4s] three, David is
[1561.4s] saying, let me look at it there.
[1564.6s] Moreover, because I have set my
[1567.3s] affection on the house of my
[1571.0s] God, I have given to the house of my
[1575.0s] God over and above all that I have
[1579.9s] prepared for the holy
[1582.4s] house, my own
[1585.6s] special
[1587.7s] treasure of gold and silver. I want you
[1592.5s] to reread some statements
[1594.8s] there. David is
[1597.5s] saying, "I have set my affection on the
[1601.8s] house of
[1603.5s] God. My love has been drawn to the house
[1608.1s] of
[1609.2s] God. I have set all my heart to the
[1613.8s] house of my God."
[1617.1s] Then he
[1619.6s] says, I have prepared things for the
[1624.1s] holy house. The last statement is
[1626.5s] saying, I have given my
[1630.3s] own special
[1638.0s] treasure. Why would he say my
[1641.9s] own? Other versions would tell you I
[1645.4s] have given my personal
[1648.4s] treasure. What does it
[1650.9s] mean? Why would he insert the word
[1655.9s] personal? Why would he say my own
[1660.9s] treasure? My thinking could be so that
[1664.5s] you can differentiate that he has not
[1666.8s] taken these
[1668.0s] things from his office.
[1675.9s] meaning that they are private things
[1680.1s] that he has taken out to give to his
[1683.0s] god.
[1684.6s] You know sometimes when it is from your
[1687.0s] house you had settled it. You had made
[1690.2s] it to be the things for the house at
[1693.5s] home you don't want to release them to
[1697.4s] go away from your
[1700.3s] house. So David is saying I have removed
[1705.2s] my own personal
[1708.8s] treasure to the house of my God. So what
[1713.0s] David is
[1714.2s] saying is
[1715.8s] [Music]
[1718.6s] that I have things in my
[1722.0s] house. I cherished
[1727.3s] them but I have given them
[1730.4s] out for the house of my God.
[1739.8s] What is a
[1744.6s] treasure? Just think of the meaning of a
[1748.0s] treasure. What is a
[1750.5s] treasure? I think it could mean many
[1753.4s] things.
[1755.7s] It could mean personal
[1759.4s] [Music]
[1760.9s] possession but above
[1763.6s] that
[1765.2s] precious
[1768.4s] possession. Something you value so
[1774.4s] much. Am I still on
[1777.1s] track? You know, it can just be a ring,
[1779.8s] but you value it so much. It was given
[1781.8s] to you by your your
[1784.4s] grandpa. Something you
[1787.0s] value so
[1790.3s] much. And by the way, it is something
[1793.4s] you would want to keep
[1796.8s] safe for prosperity for for for for for
[1803.5s] eternity. You would want to keep it
[1805.9s] safe.
[1807.5s] A treasure is something you would never
[1809.7s] want to part
[1811.4s] with. It is something you love. It is
[1815.3s] something
[1817.0s] valuable. So therefore, he's
[1820.1s] saying in this verse
[1822.8s] three that
[1829.2s] um let me see it.
[1832.4s] Moreover, because I have set my
[1835.6s] affection on the house of my God,
[1840.2s] because I have put all my love in the
[1843.6s] house of my God, I have given my
[1846.6s] personal
[1849.1s] treasure. Because I have loved God, I
[1852.4s] have given out my
[1854.0s] treasure. And which treasure is
[1857.2s] this? What kind of thing has he given?
[1861.2s] He is saying in verse
[1863.6s] four, in verse four he
[1868.4s] says
[1871.3s] that there I have given 3,000 talents of
[1878.3s] gold of the gold of oil and 7,000
[1883.2s] talents of refined
[1885.9s] silver to overlay the walls of the
[1889.0s] house. the gold for things of gold and
[1892.3s] silver for the things of silver and all
[1895.0s] kinds of work to be done by the hands of
[1899.0s] craft craftsmen. When I wanted to
[1902.8s] translate this
[1904.5s] talents to a language we may understand
[1908.2s] today this
[1910.0s] talents when I look at my good news in
[1913.3s] this verse for it is saying I have given
[1918.3s] more than 100 tons of pure gold.
[1922.9s] more than 100 tons of pure
[1926.5s] gold and I have given almost 240 tons of
[1932.7s] pure
[1934.2s] silver and he enumerates others for the
[1938.6s] house of my God.
[1941.0s] Then he comes to verse five and he
[1944.5s] says, he comes to verse five and he
[1950.0s] says, he turns to the assembly and he
[1952.6s] tells the
[1953.8s] assembly, who
[1955.7s] then is
[1957.8s] willing to consecrate himself this day
[1961.9s] to the
[1964.5s] Lord. I've just taken the last part.
[1970.2s] Who then is willing to consecrate
[1973.0s] himself this
[1974.8s] day to the
[1980.2s] house? Okay. To the
[1983.6s] Lord. Please don't remove it. I want
[1986.3s] people to get a statement from
[1989.6s] there. From verse 5 to 17, the word
[1992.9s] willing has been used seven
[1994.9s] times. Meaning that giving is through a
[1998.0s] will.
[1999.5s] But the correct uh the literal
[2003.5s] translation of the three words willing
[2006.6s] to consecrate himself, the four words
[2009.2s] willing to consecrate himself could be
[2013.4s] who is willing to fill his hand to the
[2017.8s] Lord. Understand? Understand the four
[2021.8s] words. Who is willing to consecrate
[2024.6s] himself? Literal translation means who
[2028.1s] is willing to fill his heart to the
[2032.8s] Lord. That is a saying of the the it is
[2037.0s] a Hebrew saying which
[2041.4s] meant like they were consecrating the
[2046.0s] priests. When a priest is being
[2048.3s] ordained, you are saying they are
[2051.0s] filling their hands to the
[2054.0s] Lord. I want you to understand that one.
[2057.1s] When a a priest is being ordained, the
[2060.6s] word that they will use, the saying
[2062.7s] would be they are filling their hands to
[2065.8s] the Lord.
[2071.6s] And another meaning of it would
[2075.2s] be when you are saying they are filling
[2078.2s] their hands could be it meant that the
[2082.5s] land would be filled with the presence
[2086.2s] of the
[2087.4s] Lord. So this question is being asked to
[2090.8s] us today. Who is willing to fill his
[2094.5s] hand to the Lord?
[2097.7s] Who is willing that your hand may be
[2100.9s] filled so that you can work for the
[2103.7s] Lord? Who is willing that the presence
[2108.1s] of the Lord can be able to fill your
[2111.1s] land? Who is willing that the presence
[2114.2s] of the Lord could be able to fill all
[2117.0s] that you have? And that is why the call
[2120.1s] is made. Who then is willing to
[2123.8s] consecrate himself this day to the Lord?
[2128.1s] You know they are building they're
[2129.4s] building and and is collecting for the
[2131.8s] building of the church and he's asking
[2134.5s] the leaders of of Israel and is asking
[2138.0s] all Israelites who among you is feel
[2141.4s] willing to fill his hand for the
[2144.4s] Lord. Do you want your hand to be full
[2148.2s] because of the temple of the Lord?
[2152.6s] Let me read very quickly so that I end
[2156.4s] it. After making that call, then the
[2160.2s] leaders verse six. Then the leaders
[2163.2s] houses leaders of the tribes of Israel
