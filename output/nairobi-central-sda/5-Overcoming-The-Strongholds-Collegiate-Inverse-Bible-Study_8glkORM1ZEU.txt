from it in the Tibetan language no one understood what he said because no one spoke tiban but people left the house looking happy the teacher couldn't tell bold why his father had died but the boy was impressed by him and his sacred writings bold thought if I could help him I could spend more time with him it would be a good way to get out of going to school back at home he told Mom maybe I'll

space left if you come back next year we will take him first a turning point if boy could to become a teacher he wanted to go back to his mother and he said sister who was his twin he hadn't gone to school for two years and he was far behind in his former classmates but he wanted to study with them again mom spoke with the school principal and he agreed to allow B to study with his old classmates for two months if he could keep up with them he could stay in the class both sat in the front row and like before when he was 13 he was now eager to learn to his surprise the school work was easy and he quickly Rose to the top of his class his classmat couldn't understand why he was doing so well he had missed two years of school while they had been studying bold only realized later that two years of memorizing text had cleared his disciplined his mind enabling him to easily complete his school assignments after graduating from high school bold decided to learn English and become an English teacher he already spoke Mongolian and Rian and he thought that a third language wouldn't be too difficult but after a few days of University classes he was failing English was much harder than he expected Ed he wondered what to do his twin sister had an idea she had met some Americans and they were teaching her English come it to the Americans she said bold wasn't interested later his sister showed him a new testament to the Mongolian language the Americans are Christians she said they're talking about Christ bold is alarmed don't go to them anymore he said we have our own traditional religion in Mongolia but his sister wouldn't listen these people are really nice she said B continued to struggle with his English classes one day as he labored over his homework he remember the Americans he thought maybe they could help me with my English he promised himself that if the Americans spoke about Christianity he would show them that their religion was utterly unacceptable for Mongolians he asked his sister if he could meet them the sister told the Americans about her brother one of them replied bring him to our house Church the Sabbath pray for the people of Mongolia who like bold are looking for part of this quarter's 13th Sabbath offering we go help and open a children's Recreation Center to share the gospel in aatar Mongolia thank you for planning aa's offering on March 29th good morning bonju Morgan good afternoon good night good evening wherever you are joining us from whatever time you're joining us from we're glad to have you here thank you for joining us for our Bible study the title of our study is overcoming the strongholds which strongholds you ask join us as we answer this question we'll start with a round of introductions from our extreme left hi everyone my name is Ruby Mela hi everyone my name is m hi everyone my name is Michael I Amber Michael please pray for us let us pray dear God we come before you today about to do a lesson study a Bible study for our viewers and we ask that they may get a message from it and that they may impact it that it may impact them and that they use it in their lives it's in Jesus name I pray amen amen amen we want to start our study but before that what's better way to start our study than by singing we will be singing the himym Onward Christian Soldiers Onward Christian solders marching as to war with the cross of Jes going on before Christ the royal master leads against the forward into battle see his bers go Onward Christian solders Maring as to with the cross of Jesus going before amen as the song suggests We Are Soldiers Christian Soldiers what does that mean does that mean we fight with the swords and the knives and the guns and the bullets and the but what does it mean let's find out in our lesson as you have said our lesson the title of our Bible study today is overcoming the strongholds and we will start with a key text which Nelson will read for us in 2 Corinthians chap 10: 3-5 it says for though we walk in the flesh we do not walk according to the flesh for the weapons of our Warfare are not carnal But Mighty in God for pulling down strongholds casting down arguments and every High thing that exalts itself against the knowledge of God bringing every thought into captivity to The Obedience of Christ amen amen so um we want to do a bit of a de Deep dive in our key text what does it mean and I'll start with you Michael when you talk about for the for for though we walk in the flesh we do not war according to the flesh what does that mean to war or to not war according to the flesh oh what stood up for me was when he says we do not we walk with the flesh but we do not war like the flesh or with the flesh we know that there's been a great battle between you know m uh Christ God and Satan and between good and evil and we see that yes outside we see yeah people have nuclear bombs guns knives swords but every time we come to church we still always fight a war you know between good and evil and also it's highlighted in Ephesians chapter 6 verse 12 that says for we do not wrestle against flesh and blood but against principalities against powers against the rulers of the darkness of this age against spiritual hosts of wickedness in Heavenly places so we can see when the Bible tells us that right now for us even now in the future and for those to come that our war isn't physical but spiritual M yeah yes the war isn't spiritual it is not physical beg your pardon but spiritual and the Battleground is is the Mind mind yes right the mind and as we continue defining um 10 verse4 uh Nelson for the weapons of our Warfare are not carnal But Mighty in God for pulling down strongholds tell us a little bit about those strongholds what are the strongholds yeah so the strongholds it uh the way the word is used here just refers to a strong belief m strong commonly held belief and which is obviously because it's a belief it's not physical but in the mind yeah so so the the the the because the battlefield is in the mind and the is in the mind therefore the stronghold has to be a mental right a strongly held belief and throwing it to you Ruby why the word stronghold why the word why is the word stronghold um um um used and not maybe any other word what does that imply I think what it implies just from the meaning is that it's a strong commonly thought out belief that is in our in our minds and now in this context it is not it is necessarily um a belief that is not of the knowledge of God it doesn't align with the will of God and the word of God so the word stronghold is just to emphas iise that strong belief that isn't aligning with the will of God amen amen and that we find in verse five casting down arguments and every High thing that exalts itself against the knowledge of God and bringing every thought into captivity right to The Obedience of Christ and something that is strong often is built over over time you know if it's if it's let's say a tower it starts from the bottom and it it builds up so we find that it's something that probably we have done over and over again that it has become a habit in our minds and so God wants to give us the weapons and I come back to you again Michael when he talks about the weapons that God is giving us this is in verse four for the weapons of our Warfare just if you were to probably speculate what weapons do you think what are the kinds of weapons as you have said they are not um the guns and the bows and the arrows and the Spears and the Bazookas and the whatnot what weapons do you think they would be um I would say the word of God is the in the Bible the word of God is highlighted as our sword in Ephesians chapter 6 where see the arm of God and the sword is highlighted as our sword so that's one weapon that we can use against the strongholds amen amen amen uh coming to you um Nelson yes Paul is speaking to the Corinthians right we reading the book of 2 Corinthians and he was talking about you know trying to cast down the strongholds what are the examples now let's try and concretize what we are trying to develop a picture here what were some of the strongholds that Paul identified among the Corinthians yeah I think we can go we read uh 2 Corinthians is it yeah 2 Corinthians 12:20 let me just get it quickly or if you found it you can read yes uh I can read for you yes um it says for I fear lest when I come I shall not find you such as I wish and that I shall be found by you such as you do not wish lest there be and here are the strongholds contentions jealousies out bu of WRA selfish Ambitions back bitings whisperings conceits tals and tals think I'll um I'll end it there yeah uh for me it says uh towards that end part it says after jealousy ambition slander gossip arrogance and disorder yeah so I think even even how to if we to use this to identify the strongholds a lot of these things make people dislike you if you notice so yeah they're not they're not good things to to have and and and and and and if you look at them each of them we can probably say that they they they stand up or they set themselves up against the the knowledge of God right this are not things that You' want from from Christians Ruby are there of some which you've read and others that you've think thought about are there some that you feel maybe affect us even today or even affect you or maybe people you know people around you one of the strongholds that I think most if not all of us Rel to is when it comes to anger at the moment you may want certain things to go your way or you may want certain people to do certain things you know in a certain way but if they don't like go your way you end up resulting into anger of which anger can be very destructive be it you say something you don't mean or you do something and act out at someone and you don't necessarily mean it and once that anger enters you it's like you become someone totally different cuz once you have cooled down you end up sitting down and wondering what what was I doing and let's say if you have verbally out at someone and someone tells you you said this and this sometimes some people don't actually remember because it has taken over your mind taken over the spirit and the spirit is no longer with you so it I think one of them would be anger of which it is it's something that has been with us for long and we've seen its effect and also to just add on what Michael mentioned about how we fight the TOS spiritually apart from the word of God we have faith which is all highlighted under Ephesians chap 6: 10 to18 I'll just say it briefly there's Faith um there's peace yes so far just those two and the and also Salvation And also the word of God so that is how full of the spirit yeah we would fight our battles spiritually amen amen so the the the the weapons are not the normal weapons but they are spiritual weapons um are there others other strongholds that you think I'd like to say also when she started the statement at the moment when she was talking about anger at the moment something I was highlighted in the last one was that the strongholds Satan strongholds are easy for now but but later on they bring back things M yeah amen amen I mean things like um gossiping things like addictions right these are all strongholds that um in the lesson is being taught that God can actually give us weapons to bring down strongholds those strongholds um moving on how do we break down the strongholds that the devil has put in our minds Michael how we break down the strongholds that I'll just read that was said in the lesson this I found as like the perfect answer cuz you know it's uh 2 Corinthians 3:18 it says but we all with unve with unveiled face behold as in a mirror the glory of the Lord and being transformed into the same image from glory to glory just as by the spirit of the Lord so from what I get from this is like we're being asked to be Christlike to think Christlike you know to meditate upon what Christ did you know yeah cuz you find um like they say in like mirroring you know if you mirror someone it's like when you look in a miror you obviously just see yourself you don't see like now you have lost an arm you have lost your head you know you have everything it's just exactly the same so when we metor Christ cuz you know Christ said he overcame everything that we went through so when we mirror him meditate on what he teaches we're also able to overcome these strongholds amen amen amen so so beholding right um Nelson beholding the glory of God as in a mirror um Michael may have touched on it a little bit but um would you like to speak on it a bit to just flesh it out for us one a bit uh I think maybe there's a part in the laston mhm Monday at the bottom I could just read it mhm yeah it says um as Christ transforms Us by Spirit uh we become like him mhm being transformed in His image makes you into the authentic you a child of God As You Look to Him you can cultivate healthy thought and life patterns Christ in US is Christ Living his life through US Christ in US leads us to become a replica of him today accept this by faith and become your authentic self living with freedom and victory in Christ transformation is possible believe it and live it out in his strength amen you allow Christ to come into your life and live through you so yeah salvation is God created Man In His Image Satan came and disfigured that image and then God is now trying to come and restore that image in us and I think that's where you're you're coming from that when we Behold Him um there's a verse that says by beholding we become changed so God wants us to behold Christ through his word I think someone must have mentioned it here you know through prayer through communion with him so that we become like him and in advantage in by doing that we break down the stronghold remember the lesson is all about overcoming the strongholds um Ruby would you like to read for us Ephesians chapter 4 verse 24 Ephesians 4: 24 says and that you put on the new man which was created according to God in true righteousness and holiness you know um this verse reminds me of um Christ talking to was it uh was it no it wasn't Lazarus Nicodemus Nicodemus and Christ says You must be born again born again and Nicodemus asks how shall a man be born again shall I go back into my mother's womb and be born again and so with the same In The Same Spirit of Nicodemus the Pharisee I ask you how can I put on a new man I can put on a shirt I can put on a sweater I can even put on a heart I can put on the helmet a helmet now that we're talking about Warfare but what does it mean that the Bible says put on the new man um I want to throw this question to you Michael um okay for me the moment I had new man I would consider like Evan is there you know when a new year starts is there like yeah new me I'm going to change I'm going to do this I'm going to do that you know I'm going to get closer to God so like um when you talk about new man you talk about characterist I talk about characteristics you know like maybe someone used to be a profound liar they would lie all the time so like being a new man you know since God doesn't like lying being a new man is stop lying you start being honest you know being a new man is being more righteous being Holier you know m yeah changing for the better changing in a in a way and in a sense that you know you're going according to what God wants and what God's word is teaching you yeah amen amen uh I think one of the ways we could become new men is just the way and women yes sorry yes new men and women is by just acknowledging the fact the strongholds that we have acknowledging them and putting in measures change not just say by the way yes I'm a liar and not doing anything about it and also taking it to God to help you because if you to start and like start alone you reach a point and give up but if you're with him he will give you the strength to continue because it's not like it will get easier just because you've acknowledged and actually want to be better and I like what you've said because remember these are strongholds right a stronghold is you know if someone was to ask you know what is your stronghold it is what you're best at and even physically um if if let throwing our minds back to to to the times those times in the Fortress the strongholds were the strongest part of the of of of that area you know it was the most impregnable part so for you to say that I want to do this of My Own Strength you're literally fighting a losing battle and that's so as you have said you need the power of Christ and the weapons that he gives us to overcome the the stronghold I'm just to add on to what you've said a new man is the restoration I'm reading of God's image in us having him means we are a new creation in Christ with a new mind ready to think and act like Jesus as 2 Corinthians 5:17 says therefore if anyone is in Christ he is a new creation the old things have passed away behold all things have become new Let's uh move on as we uh come to the tail end of our of our of our discussion um it's not enough to buy a new car a new car has to be maintained right otherwise it will run down it's not enough to construct a lovely building you always have to do you know repairs and cleaning and whatnot and the same thing as you put on this new man this I ask you Nelson how do we maintain in quotes the new man yes I think uh it's well very well put in the lesson mhm uh it gives us two ways two two three yes let's say to it says first of all the mind can stay renewed as long as you remain in communion with God through constant prayer so number one is constant prayer uh then he goes on to say together with prayer memorizing the promises in scripture can repel the enemy's advances in difficult moments so number two is memorizing scripture so now when you find yourself in those difficult moments you just you can remember something that God has written in his word and message to us and it will help you overcome that bad time amen amen amen in the word of God there is power yes um Ruby one thing I've actually just thought about is guarding the Avenues to our minds there's a song that we would sing when we're younger oh be careful little child what you see it what you hear and that really affects how you the strongholds that you're trying to overcome because if you're actually actively trying to overcome these strongholds by God's side and you're continually let's say if it's okay you're just continually I don't know adding onto it through what you listen to or what you hear then it's like it's zero work cuz you're trying to fix it but you're still adding upon it so it would be also guarding the Avenues to our mind amen amen you want to say something no Oh I thought you wanted to say something now that you want to speak allegedly can you read for us 2 Corinthians CH 11 Corinthians vers 11:3 let me just get it really quickly 11:3 it uh hold on it says mhm but I am afraid I'm afraid that just as evil was deceived by the snakes canning your minds May somehow be led astray from your sincere and pure de Devotion to Christ amen my Bible says your minds may be corrupted from the Simplicity that is in Christ so the devil is seeking to corrupt the mind to create strongholds that stand in position to to to the knowledge of God as we have read to you Michael why does is the devil so interested in your mind um I would say when you look at things the the brain is your control center like to everything to your thoughts what you believe in even your actions cuz you think before you do you know you think before you speak you know it's like through your mind comes everything you do yeah so if I would say if he has it if you have those strongholds for the devil even if you come to church you'll be constantly think about something else you wouldn't be in charge You' be elsewhere your mind would be elsewhere yes physically you're here but your mind will be elsewhere know anything you want to speak you could say um you know you could be saying you're a Christian but you're going out there you're talking things that are not Christian like you're deceiving people you know based off what you think you know you say you're Christian your actions don't speak the same so you know everything comes from the mind when it comes to your actions your words what you think so by corrupting the mind he corrupts the whole body yeah he corrupts Us in Nelson let's end on on a more positive note does God also is God also interested in the mind yeah I think we get that clearly from when the Bible talks about the Seal of God yeah in the revelations it says that will seal the seal will be put on the on the forehead and as the Medics will tell you in the forehead is the they call it the frontal L which is the seat of decision and so God wants to put his seal on on our minds and of course on our right hands because of you know uh meaning also our actions when what we do amen amen and so dear view we'll end it at that God wants you God wants to control not to control but to free you from the strongholds of bad behavior that we've accumulated over time and he has given us the weapons to do that he's promised his word the promises that in his word have power remember Christ overcame the devil in the wilderness by the word of God through prayer communion with Christ and as the Bible says by beholding we will become changed we will end it at that with a prayer from Ruby please pray for us as we close let's pray thank you God for this day thank you for giving us the breath of life thank you for enabling us to have such a wonderful Bible study I pray that from whatever we have learned that we may be able to act on it and to identify these strongholds and to let you come into us and fight these battles and may we understand that the battles that we are fighting at the moment are not physical but rather against spiritual principalities and be with us and guide us through all this guide us and protect us in Jesus name we pray amen amen amen thank you join us next time for wonderful another wonderful Bible study but for now bye bye

[200.6s] before when he was 13 he was now eager
[202.9s] to learn to his surprise the school work
[205.4s] was easy and he quickly Rose to the top
[207.2s] of his class his classmat couldn't
[209.5s] understand why he was doing so well he
[211.5s] had missed two years of school while
[213.0s] they had been studying bold only
[215.3s] realized later that two years of
[217.0s] memorizing text had cleared his
[218.5s] disciplined his mind enabling him to
[221.4s] easily complete his school assignments
[224.0s] after graduating from high school bold
[226.6s] decided to learn English and become an
[228.7s] English teacher he already spoke
[230.6s] Mongolian and Rian and he thought that a
[232.6s] third language wouldn't be too difficult
[234.9s] but after a few days of University
[236.3s] classes he was failing English was much
[238.9s] harder than he expected Ed he wondered
[241.2s] what to do his twin sister had an idea
[244.9s] she had met some Americans and they were
[246.4s] teaching her English come it to the
[248.6s] Americans she said bold wasn't
[250.9s] interested later his sister showed him a
[253.7s] new testament to the Mongolian language
[256.0s] the Americans are Christians she said
[258.4s] they're talking about Christ bold is
[260.7s] alarmed don't go to them anymore he said
[263.8s] we have our own traditional religion in
[265.2s] Mongolia but his sister wouldn't listen
[268.0s] these people are really nice she said B
[270.1s] continued to struggle with his English
[271.4s] classes one day as he labored over his
[274.0s] homework he remember the Americans he
[276.4s] thought maybe they could help me with my
[278.6s] English he promised himself that if the
[280.8s] Americans spoke about Christianity he
[282.8s] would show them that their religion was
[284.3s] utterly unacceptable for Mongolians he
[286.8s] asked his sister if he could meet them
[288.7s] the sister told the Americans about her
[290.2s] brother one of them replied bring him to
[292.8s] our house Church the

[351.4s] Michael please pray for us let us pray
[354.1s] dear God we come before you today about
[356.8s] to do a lesson study a Bible study for
[359.6s] our viewers and we ask that they may get
[362.0s] a message from it and that they may
[364.4s] impact it that it may impact them and
[366.4s] that they use it in their lives it's in
[368.0s] Jesus name I pray amen amen amen we want
[371.2s] to start our study but before that
[373.0s] what's better way to start our study
[375.4s] than by singing we will be singing the
[377.4s] himym Onward Christian
[378.9s] Soldiers Onward Christian
[382.7s] solders marching as to
[386.4s] war with the cross of Jes
[390.8s] going on
[393.2s] before Christ the royal
[396.7s] master leads against
[400.2s] the forward into
[403.7s] battle see his bers
[407.3s] go Onward Christian
[410.7s] solders Maring as
[414.2s] to with the cross of
[417.7s] Jesus going
[421.3s] before amen as the song suggests We Are
[426.8s] Soldiers Christian Soldiers what does
[429.2s] that mean does that mean we fight with
[432.0s] the swords and the knives and the guns
[434.1s] and the bullets and the but what does it
[436.8s] mean let's find out in our
[439.2s] lesson as you have said our lesson the
[441.6s] title of our Bible study today is
[443.3s] overcoming the strongholds and we will
[445.5s] start with a key text which Nelson will
[447.9s] read for us in 2 Corinthians chap 10:
[452.0s] 3-5 it says for though we walk in the
[455.3s] flesh we do not walk according to the
[457.2s] flesh for the weapons of our Warfare are
[459.8s] not carnal But Mighty in God for pulling
[462.0s] down strongholds casting down arguments
[465.1s] and every High thing that exalts itself
[467.1s] against the knowledge of God bringing
[469.5s] every thought into captivity to The
[471.7s] Obedience of Christ amen amen so um we
[475.8s] want to do a bit of a de Deep dive in
[479.5s] our key text what does it mean and I'll
[482.4s] start with you Michael when you talk
[485.4s] about for the for for though we walk in
[489.7s] the flesh we do not war according to the
[493.0s] flesh what does that mean to war or to
[495.6s] not war according to the flesh oh what
[498.8s] stood up for me was when he says we do
[501.0s] not we walk with the flesh but we do not
[503.0s] war like the flesh or with the flesh we
[506.4s] know that there's been a great battle
[508.0s] between you know m uh Christ God and
[512.1s] Satan and between good and evil and we
[515.2s] see that yes outside we see yeah people
[518.8s] have nuclear bombs guns knives swords
[522.0s] but every time we come to church we
[524.6s] still always fight a war you know
[526.1s] between good and evil and also it's
[528.8s] highlighted in Ephesians chapter 6 verse
[532.4s] 12 that says for we do not wrestle
[535.1s] against flesh and blood but against
[537.7s] principalities against powers against
[540.0s] the rulers of the darkness of this age
[543.4s] against spiritual hosts of wickedness in
[546.3s] Heavenly places so we can see when the
[548.2s] Bible tells us that right now for us
[551.7s] even now in the future and for those to
[553.4s] come that our war isn't physical but
[557.4s] spiritual M yeah yes the war isn't
[562.5s] spiritual it is not physical beg your
[565.0s] pardon but spiritual and the
[568.1s] Battleground is is the Mind mind yes
[571.9s] right the mind and as we continue
[575.4s] defining um 10 verse4 uh Nelson for the
[580.1s] weapons of our Warfare are not carnal
[583.2s] But Mighty in God for pulling down
[588.2s] strongholds tell us a little bit about
[590.1s] those strongholds what are the
[591.8s] strongholds yeah so the strongholds it
[595.2s] uh the way the word is used here just
[597.7s] refers to a strong belief m strong
[600.0s] commonly held
[601.7s] belief and which is obviously because
[605.0s] it's a belief it's not physical but in
[608.3s] the mind yeah so so the the the the
[612.0s] because the battlefield is in the mind
[613.5s] and the is in the mind therefore the
[614.8s] stronghold has to be a mental right a
[618.0s] strongly held belief and throwing it to
[621.5s] you Ruby why the word stronghold why the
[625.5s] word why is the word stronghold um um um
[628.8s] used and not maybe any other word what
[630.8s] does that
[632.7s] imply I think what it implies just from
[636.0s] the meaning is that it's a strong
[639.3s] commonly thought out belief that is in
[643.2s] our in our minds and now in this context
[646.4s] it is not it is necessarily um a belief
[649.8s] that is not of the knowledge of God it
[652.6s] doesn't align with the will of God and
[655.9s] the word of God so the word stronghold
[658.2s] is just to emphas iise that strong
[661.5s] belief that isn't aligning with the will
[664.6s] of God amen amen and that we find in
[667.1s] verse five casting down arguments and
[669.9s] every High thing that exalts itself
[672.5s] against the knowledge of God and
[674.5s] bringing every thought into captivity
[677.6s] right to The Obedience of Christ and
[681.2s] something that is strong often is built
[683.9s] over over time you know if it's if it's
[687.3s] let's say a tower it starts from the
[688.9s] bottom and it it builds up so we find
[691.2s] that it's something that probably we
[692.8s] have done over and over again that it
[694.5s] has become a habit in our minds and so
[697.1s] God wants to give us the weapons and I
[699.7s] come back to you again Michael when he
[701.4s] talks about the weapons that God is
[703.6s] giving us this is in verse four for the
[705.5s] weapons of our Warfare just if you were
[709.4s] to probably speculate what weapons do
[713.1s] you think what are the kinds of weapons
[715.5s] as you have said they are not um the
[717.4s] guns and the bows and the arrows and the
[718.9s] Spears and the Bazookas and the whatnot
[721.9s] what weapons do you think they would
[724.1s] be um I would
[726.6s] say the word of God is the in the Bible
[730.4s] the word of God is highlighted as our
[732.1s] sword in Ephesians chapter 6 where see
[735.2s] the arm of God and the sword is
[737.0s] highlighted as our sword so that's one
[740.0s] weapon that we can use against the
[741.8s] strongholds amen amen
[744.4s] amen uh coming to you um
[749.5s] Nelson yes Paul is speaking to the
[752.6s] Corinthians right we reading the book of
[754.6s] 2 Corinthians and he was talking about
[757.0s] you know trying to cast down the
[759.0s] strongholds what are the examples now
[761.1s] let's try and concretize what we are
[763.7s] trying to develop a picture here what
[765.6s] were some of the strongholds that Paul
[767.7s] identified among the Corinthians yeah I
[771.4s] think we can go we read uh 2 Corinthians
[776.4s] is it yeah 2 Corinthians 12:20
[780.8s] let me just get it
[784.4s] quickly or if you found it you can read
[787.4s] yes uh I can read for you yes um it
[792.3s] says for I fear lest when I come I shall
[795.9s] not find you such as I wish and that I
[799.4s] shall be found by you such as you do not
[801.8s] wish lest there be and here are the
[804.6s] strongholds
[806.4s] contentions jealousies out bu of WRA
[810.9s] selfish Ambitions back bitings
[815.5s] whisperings conceits
[818.4s] tals and tals think I'll um I'll end it
[822.6s] there yeah
[824.6s] uh for me it
[827.4s] says uh towards that end part it says
[830.2s] after jealousy ambition slander gossip
[834.5s] arrogance and
[835.8s] disorder yeah so I think even even how
[839.5s] to if we to use this to identify the
[842.5s] strongholds a lot of these things make
[844.6s] people dislike you if you notice
[847.6s] so yeah they're not they're not good
[849.6s] things to to have and and and and and
[852.3s] and if you look at them each of them we
[855.1s] can probably say that they they they
[858.3s] stand up or they set themselves up
[860.2s] against the the knowledge of God right
[863.0s] this are not things that You' want from
[866.1s] from Christians Ruby are there of some
[868.4s] which you've read and others that you've
[869.8s] think thought about are there some that
[871.3s] you feel maybe affect us even today or
[874.8s] even affect you or maybe people you know
[876.8s] people around you one of the strongholds
[882.0s] that I think most if not all of us Rel
[885.2s] to is when it comes to
[888.2s] anger at the moment you may want certain
[891.1s] things to go your way or you may want
[894.1s] certain people to do certain things you
[896.1s] know in a certain way but if they don't
[899.2s] like go your way you end up resulting
[902.2s] into anger of which anger can be very
[905.0s] destructive be it you say something you
[907.6s] don't mean or you do something and act
[910.2s] out at someone and you don't necessarily
[912.6s] mean it and once that anger enters you
[916.0s] it's like you become someone totally
[918.4s] different cuz once you have cooled down
[921.3s] you end up sitting down and wondering
[923.6s] what what was I doing and let's say if
[926.4s] you have verbally
[929.2s] out at someone and someone tells you you
[932.0s] said this and this sometimes some people
[935.1s] don't actually remember because it has
[937.4s] taken over your mind taken over the
[940.4s] spirit and the spirit is no longer with
[942.8s] you so it I think one of them would be
[945.8s] anger of which it is it's something that
[948.8s] has been with us for long and we've seen
[951.3s] its effect and also to just add on what
[955.4s] Michael mentioned about how we fight the
[959.1s] TOS spiritually apart from the word of
[962.5s] God we have faith which is all
[965.4s] highlighted under Ephesians chap 6: 10
[968.4s] to18 I'll just say it briefly there's
[971.4s] Faith um there's peace yes so far just
[975.6s] those two and the and also Salvation And
[979.4s] also the word of God so that is how full
[981.4s] of the spirit yeah we would fight our
[984.0s] battles spiritually amen amen so the the
[987.2s] the the weapons are not the normal
[989.8s] weapons but they are spiritual weapons
[994.0s] um are there others other strongholds
[997.0s] that you think I'd like to say also when
[999.7s] she started the statement at the moment
[1001.9s] when she was talking about anger at the
[1003.6s] moment something I was highlighted in
[1005.6s] the last one was that the strongholds
[1009.0s] Satan strongholds are easy for now but
[1012.6s] but later on they bring back things M
[1015.1s] yeah amen amen I mean things like
[1019.6s] um gossiping things like addictions
[1023.5s] right these are all strongholds that um
[1026.2s] in the lesson is being taught that God
[1028.1s] can actually give us weapons to bring
[1030.8s] down strongholds those strongholds um
[1033.5s] moving
[1035.2s] on how do we break down the strongholds
[1039.2s] that the devil has put in our minds
[1042.4s] Michael how we break down the
[1044.6s] strongholds
[1046.4s] that I'll just read that was said in the
[1050.8s] lesson this I found as like the perfect
[1053.5s] answer cuz you know it's uh 2
[1057.9s] Corinthians 3:18 it says but we all with
[1062.9s] unve with unveiled face behold as in a
[1066.2s] mirror the glory of the Lord and being
[1068.9s] transformed into the same image from
[1071.2s] glory to glory just as by the spirit of
[1074.7s] the Lord so from what I get from this is
[1077.3s] like we're being asked to be Christlike
[1081.2s] to think Christlike you know to meditate
[1084.3s] upon what Christ did you know yeah cuz
[1088.0s] you find um like they say in like
[1091.4s] mirroring you know if you mirror someone
[1093.8s] it's like when you look in a miror you
[1095.5s] obviously just see yourself you don't
[1097.2s] see like now you have lost an arm you
[1099.7s] have lost your head you know you have
[1101.6s] everything it's just exactly the same so
[1104.2s] when we metor
[1105.6s] Christ cuz you know Christ said he
[1108.1s] overcame everything that we went through
[1110.0s] so when we mirror him meditate on what
[1112.0s] he teaches we're also able to overcome
[1114.9s] these strongholds amen amen amen so so
[1119.8s] beholding right um Nelson
[1124.5s] beholding the glory of God as in a
[1128.0s] mirror um Michael may have touched on it
[1131.3s] a little bit but um would you like to
[1133.9s] speak on it a bit to just flesh it out
[1135.7s] for us one a bit uh
[1139.4s] I think maybe there's a part in the
[1142.3s] laston mhm
[1144.8s] Monday at the bottom I could just read
[1147.5s] it mhm yeah it says um as Christ
[1151.6s] transforms Us by
[1153.4s] Spirit uh we become like him mhm being
[1156.7s] transformed in His image makes you into
[1158.9s] the authentic you a child of God As You
[1162.8s] Look to Him you can cultivate healthy
[1165.4s] thought and life patterns Christ in US
[1169.1s] is Christ Living his life through US
[1172.2s] Christ in US leads us to become a
[1173.8s] replica of him today accept this by
[1177.8s] faith and become your authentic self
[1179.9s] living with freedom and victory in
[1181.8s] Christ transformation is possible
[1184.9s] believe it and live it out in his
[1187.8s] strength amen you allow Christ to come
[1191.3s] into your life and live through you so
[1195.3s] yeah salvation is God created Man In His
[1200.4s] Image Satan came and disfigured that
[1205.2s] image and then God is now trying to come
[1207.8s] and
[1208.6s] restore that image in us and I think
[1211.7s] that's where you're you're coming from
[1213.7s] that when we Behold Him um there's a
[1215.7s] verse that says by beholding we become
[1218.8s] changed so God wants us to behold Christ
[1222.7s] through his word I think someone must
[1224.2s] have mentioned it here you know through
[1225.7s] prayer through communion with him so
[1227.6s] that we become like him and in advantage
[1230.9s] in by doing that we break down the
[1233.5s] stronghold remember the lesson is all
[1235.3s] about overcoming the strongholds
[1238.9s] um Ruby would you like to read for us
[1242.0s] Ephesians chapter 4 verse
[1246.1s] 24 Ephesians 4: 24 says and that you put
[1251.2s] on the new man which was created
[1253.6s] according to God in true righteousness
[1256.8s] and
[1257.6s] holiness you know um this verse reminds
[1260.6s] me of um Christ talking to was it uh was
[1266.0s] it no it wasn't Lazarus Nicodemus
[1269.1s] Nicodemus and Christ says You must be
[1271.7s] born again born again and Nicodemus asks
[1276.2s] how shall a man be born again shall I go
[1279.1s] back into my mother's womb and be born
[1281.9s] again and so with the same In The Same
[1285.5s] Spirit of Nicodemus the Pharisee I ask
[1288.3s] you
[1290.0s] how can I put on a new man I can put on
[1292.4s] a shirt I can put on a sweater I can
[1294.0s] even put on a heart I can put on the
[1295.9s] helmet a helmet now that we're talking
[1298.3s] about
[1299.4s] Warfare but what does it mean that the
[1301.4s] Bible says put on the new man um I want
[1306.6s] to throw this question to you
[1308.8s] Michael um okay for me the moment I had
[1312.3s] new man I would consider like Evan is
[1314.3s] there you know when a new year starts is
[1316.8s] there like yeah new me I'm going to
[1318.3s] change
[1320.2s] I'm going to do this I'm going to do
[1321.7s] that you know I'm going to get closer to
[1323.8s] God so
[1324.8s] like um when you talk about new man you
[1328.0s] talk about characterist I talk about
[1330.1s] characteristics you know like maybe
[1332.3s] someone used to be a profound liar they
[1335.0s] would lie all the time so like being a
[1337.2s] new man you know since God doesn't like
[1339.5s] lying being a new man is stop lying you
[1342.0s] start being honest you know being a new
[1344.3s] man is being more righteous being Holier
[1347.6s] you know m yeah changing for the better
[1350.6s] changing in a in a way and in a sense
[1354.0s] that you know you're going according to
[1356.0s] what God wants and what God's word is
[1358.9s] teaching you yeah amen amen uh I think
[1363.4s] one of the ways we could become new men
[1366.3s] is just the way and women yes
[1369.4s] sorry yes new men and women is by just
[1373.8s] acknowledging the fact the strongholds
[1376.3s] that we have acknowledging them and
[1379.7s] putting in measures change not just say
[1383.2s] by the way yes I'm a liar and not doing
[1386.4s] anything about it and also taking it to
[1389.2s] God to help you because if you to start
[1392.4s] and like start alone you reach a point
[1394.9s] and give up but if you're with him he
[1398.0s] will give you the strength to continue
[1399.9s] because it's not like it will get easier
[1402.4s] just because you've acknowledged and
[1403.8s] actually want to be better and I like
[1406.4s] what you've said because remember these
[1409.0s] are strongholds right a stronghold is
[1412.8s] you know if someone was to ask you know
[1414.5s] what is your stronghold it is what
[1415.8s] you're best at and even physically um if
[1419.8s] if let throwing our minds back to to to
[1422.6s] the times those times in the Fortress
[1425.1s] the strongholds were the strongest part
[1427.0s] of the of of of that area you know it
[1430.1s] was the most impregnable part so for you
[1432.4s] to say that I want to do this of My Own
[1435.0s] Strength you're literally fighting a
[1437.2s] losing battle and that's so as you have
[1439.1s] said you need the power of Christ and
[1441.5s] the weapons that he gives us to overcome
[1444.6s] the the stronghold I'm just to add on to
[1447.4s] what you've said a new man is the
[1449.0s] restoration I'm
[1450.5s] reading of God's image in us having him
[1454.6s] means we are a new creation in Christ
[1458.0s] with a new mind ready to think and act
[1461.2s] like
[1462.0s] Jesus as 2 Corinthians 5:17 says
[1465.3s] therefore if anyone is in Christ he is a
[1467.5s] new creation the old things have passed
[1469.5s] away behold all things have become
[1474.2s] new Let's uh move on as we uh come to
[1478.0s] the tail end of
[1479.6s] our of our of our discussion um it's not
[1484.2s] enough to buy a new car a new car has to
[1486.2s] be maintained right otherwise it will
[1488.8s] run down it's not enough to construct a
[1491.2s] lovely building you always have to do
[1492.9s] you know repairs and cleaning and
[1494.7s] whatnot and the same thing as you put on
[1497.1s] this new man this I ask you Nelson how
[1499.9s] do we
[1501.4s] maintain in
[1503.6s] quotes the new man yes I think uh it's
[1507.4s] well very well put in the lesson mhm uh
[1511.6s] it gives us two ways two two three yes
[1514.4s] let's say to it says first of all the
[1518.0s] mind can stay renewed as long as you
[1520.2s] remain in communion with God through
[1522.4s] constant prayer so number one is
[1524.6s] constant
[1525.7s] prayer uh then he goes on to say
[1528.7s] together with prayer memorizing the
[1530.9s] promises in scripture can repel the
[1533.2s] enemy's advances in difficult moments so
[1536.5s] number two is memorizing scripture so
[1539.2s] now when you find yourself in those
[1540.9s] difficult moments you just you can
[1543.2s] remember something that God has written
[1545.0s] in his word and message to us and it
[1547.6s] will help you overcome that bad time
[1550.5s] amen amen amen in the word of God there
[1553.3s] is power yes um Ruby one thing I've
[1555.6s] actually just thought about is guarding
[1557.8s] the Avenues to our minds there's a song
[1561.7s] that we would sing when we're younger oh
[1564.2s] be careful little child what you
[1566.8s] see it what you hear and that really
[1571.5s] affects how you the strongholds that
[1574.4s] you're trying to overcome because if
[1576.5s] you're actually actively trying to
[1579.0s] overcome these strongholds by God's side
[1581.4s] and you're continually let's say if
[1585.0s] it's okay you're just continually I
[1588.4s] don't know adding onto it through what
[1591.1s] you listen to or what you hear then it's
[1593.4s] like it's zero work cuz you're trying to
[1595.6s] fix it but you're still adding upon it
[1597.9s] so it would be also guarding the Avenues
[1600.5s] to our mind amen amen you want to say
[1603.0s] something no Oh I thought you wanted to
[1605.2s] say something now that you want to speak
[1608.0s] allegedly can you read for us 2
[1609.7s] Corinthians CH 11 Corinthians vers 11:3
[1613.9s] let me just get it really
[1616.2s] quickly 11:3 it uh hold on it says
[1623.9s] mhm but I am
[1626.2s] afraid I'm afraid that just as evil was
[1629.3s] deceived by the snakes canning your
[1631.8s] minds May somehow be led astray from
[1633.9s] your sincere and pure de Devotion to
[1637.0s] Christ amen my Bible says your minds may
[1639.6s] be corrupted from the Simplicity that is
[1641.8s] in Christ so the devil is seeking to
[1644.8s] corrupt the mind to create strongholds
[1649.0s] that stand in position to to to the
[1652.3s] knowledge of God as we have
[1655.2s] read to you Michael
[1658.6s] why does is the devil so interested in
[1663.5s] your
[1665.3s] mind um I would
[1667.6s] say when you look at things the the
[1670.6s] brain is your control center like to
[1672.8s] everything to your thoughts what you
[1674.8s] believe in even your actions cuz you
[1677.0s] think before you do you know you think
[1679.2s] before you speak you know it's like
[1682.7s] through your mind comes everything you
[1684.7s] do yeah so if I would say if he has it
[1689.6s] if you have those strongholds for the
[1691.2s] devil even if you come to church you'll
[1694.0s] be constantly think about something else
[1695.7s] you wouldn't be in charge You' be
[1696.8s] elsewhere your mind would be elsewhere
[1698.2s] yes physically you're here but your mind
[1699.6s] will be elsewhere know anything you want
[1701.8s] to speak you could say um you know you
[1704.9s] could be saying you're a Christian but
[1706.6s] you're going out there you're talking
[1708.4s] things that are not Christian like
[1709.7s] you're deceiving people you know based
[1712.4s] off what you think you know you say
[1714.0s] you're Christian your actions don't
[1716.2s] speak the same so you know everything
[1719.2s] comes from the mind when it comes to
[1721.1s] your actions your words what you think
[1723.7s] so by corrupting the mind he corrupts
[1725.4s] the whole body yeah he corrupts Us
[1729.0s] in Nelson let's end on on a more
[1732.6s] positive note does God also is God also
[1736.3s] interested in the mind
[1738.8s] yeah I think we get that clearly
[1742.2s] from when the Bible talks about the Seal
[1744.7s] of God yeah in the revelations it says
[1748.6s] that will seal the seal will be put on
[1751.8s] the on the forehead and as the Medics
[1755.2s] will tell you in the forehead is the
[1757.0s] they call it the frontal L which is the
[1758.9s] seat of decision and so God wants to put
[1762.1s] his seal on on our minds and of course
[1765.9s] on our right hands because of you know
[1768.9s] uh meaning also our actions when what we
[1771.9s] do amen amen and so dear view we'll end
[1775.2s] it at
[1776.2s] that God wants you God wants to control
[1781.2s] not to control but to free you from the
[1785.3s] strongholds of bad behavior that we've
[1788.3s] accumulated over time and he has given
[1790.0s] us the weapons to do that he's promised
[1793.6s] his word the promises that in his word
[1796.8s] have power remember Christ overcame the
[1799.9s] devil in the wilderness by the word of
[1803.2s] God through prayer communion with Christ
[1805.7s] and as the Bible says by beholding we
[1808.4s] will become changed we will end it at
[1811.3s] that with a prayer from Ruby please pray
[1814.0s] for us as we close let's pray thank you

[1834.0s] these battles and may we understand that
[1837.0s] the battles that we are fighting at the
[1838.3s] moment are not physical but rather
