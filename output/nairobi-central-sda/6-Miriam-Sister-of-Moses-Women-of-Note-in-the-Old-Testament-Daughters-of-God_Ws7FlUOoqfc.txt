serve in the women Ministries Department Mara NAA my name is Joan I am interest coordination Department thank you so much ladies so um Miriam in the previous episode uh last week we looked at the mother of Miriam who was JoBeth and we touched a bit concerning Miriam Miriam was a prophetes she was a leader yes how else can you describe Miriam oh I'd love to just say that Miriam loveed to sing when the Israelites crossed the the Red Sea when they got to the other side Miriam sang a a real song you know and the song part of it goes it says I will sing unto the Lord for he has trium gloriously the horse and it's R has thrown into the sea I will sing unto the Lord for he has triumphed gloriously the hor and ride are thrown into the sea I will sing unto the Lord for he has triumphed triumphed gloriously so that she was telling the Israelites my friend MH the horse and the Riders are H they are there in the sea amen the Lord has triumphed amen can someone read uh the book of Exodus 15:20 okay it talks about how Miriam sang with what with tremble with music instruments yes yes 15 reads yes then Miriam the prophetess the sister of Aaron took the timbrell in her hand and all the women went out after her with timbrels and with dances amen what happened all the women went out after her did you see that yeah all women went went out after her I mean someone who comes shouts and sings and people follow her she was powerful yeah so um she was a leader of the Israelites women and just a little story about um Miriam Miriam was a very bright girl at the age of 12 she helped her mom to um to decide she came up with an idea she was very bright and so at this age uh she was actually the Elder um child of jacobe she was the eldest of um a sister to Aaron and Moses and Miriam was god- gifted the way we've seen from How She Sang and then God also gave Miriam Authority a place of authority and for many years uh she was faithful Faithfully discharging that Ministry uh unfortunately she misused her position of leadership for a short time and was charged and actually she was punished by God what else can you say about Miriam aen uh I can say that um she she allowed uh the authority to get to to to her head and uh she became bigheaded MH so to speak and uh with this it led to to disloyalty so we see that um at some point they started speaking badly against their brother U both her and uh and Aaron they started um they had that jealousy in them they allowed it to grow and uh as a result they they started talking about their their brother in in a bad way and also disregarding that uh their brother had uh God speaks to to to Moses and then because now they were saying that God also speaks to us you know but you know we see that uh with with with Moses god uh used to speak to him directly but with uh with uh Miriam and Aaron it was through dreams and visions and the things like that then just to add sorry do you mind if I add that to that actually it says here Miriam had the spirit of Envy mhm and it said and this satisfaction MH and like us women even in the church you know as we are called to serve one of the things we cannot afford to have is Envy Envy because all of us have a gift special gift to do whatever we are supposed to do I cannot be morine I cannot be aen I cannot be Grace Norah even you Elizabeth as you serve nobody can be another Elizabeth exactly but it says here that Miriam um you know this Spirit Envy is one of the most satanic traits can never exist in the human heart yes and it is one of the most baleful in its effects it is envy that first caused Discord in heaven yeah and the Indulgence has rought Untold evil among men yes where envying and strife is there there is confusion M on and every evil work mhm so as Daughters of God we cannot afford to be envious yes to be jealous in other words yes and so we here we see that Miriam publicly publicly sought to undermine Moses yes Authority that was given to him by God God knew that Moses was weak Moses even said that really I'm a Stam how can I lead how can I even speak God knew that Moses was weak had a weakness and each one of us has a weakness we have different talents and we serve differently and so Miriam here tries to undermine Moses publicly how many times do you get undermined by people publicly yeah and actually the Bible tells us that that was jealousy Envy from the heart of Miriam and so we are encouraged to be a and that is actually punishable God punished Miriam with Leprosy m and it was so bad for for for for Moses for Miriam but later yes if I may add on what you're saying yes you know as women we should be really really you know this is something that I think all women are pretty much predisposed to but you should be really careful because as Ellen White says here but the same evil that first brought Discord in heaven sprang up in the heart of this woman woman of Israel and she did not fail to find a sympathizer in her dissatisfaction okay so to look back M what happened in Heaven There was Lucifer he be he became proud because he's like you know I am this great Angel like I have the greatest voice I am the highest Angel then jealousy why am I not then like Jesus then then dissatisfaction and getting people to join his plot like this is something that Satan started so we should really really be careful when such feelings start to arise in US Nora you want to say something yes um among other things that I found as you were looking into this earlier MH was how Miriam was dissatisfied even with the choice of of a wife yeah that that her brother had yeah like why should he choose a wife among the from among the Hebrews M yeah I mean he was she was taking offense so uh that was just among the many other uh complaints that they had so uh even even to us uh some times especially to us women or even men of the church how many times are we very dissatisfied with the the tribe yes the tribes especially yeah here in Africa or Kenya where we have many tribes like uh like now I will say um yeah why choose a woman from that tribe and we are very dissatisfied with that and we even getting fault with their leadership skills and and yeah so uh I think we should check ourselves if we see the the the Book of Proverbs chapter 6 verse 18 I think from Verse 18 to the end it talks about what God hates because he says there are six things God hates yes seven he detests so a hotty Spirit yeah you know when you start thinking you're better than someone else because here is Moses wife zipora aite like she's dark she's not as pretty you know and and and even that I you know I'm the women Ministry leader or I am the interest coordination or I'm the power leader and God has chosen me to do God hates that yeah and and Miriam did that and God hates Discord yes anyone who cause causes Discord which is what Miriam did thank you uhin maybe just a question to throw could it be a sense of entit entitlement that uh that uh Miriam had brought all this being a firstborn seeing literally he he she saw he so Moses growing up saved him and could could that one also interfere yes because most of the time we women are nurtures and and when we when we nurture sometimes we have entitlement on other things these have brought all this to us and what does this one call unto us humility humility humility thank you um so I just you want to say something yeah just one brief thing is that instead of us being being envious and trying to put down others when it comes to their weaknesses we should instead uplift them and tell them that you can do this just one step at a time because at the end of the day someone will end up having confidence in that and they'll say if it was not for encouragement I don't think I would have done that amen amen we are called upon as women as Daughters of God Amen to pray for each other those who are in leadership support them Moses was in leadership Miriam and Haron were their siblings they should have supported him and not condemned them publicly and so faithfulness has no time limit any position of leadership will have its moments of failure yes and Miriam let her jealousy destroy a lifetime of faithful service so when we are serving we should know that sometimes leadership and power and comes with pride and so we should pray to God every time to help us to be humble and to serve in humility and in love every day the the evil one tempts us to cut Corners uh to compromise our standards and even um to be dishonest let's pray to God to help us to give us the Holy Spirit to help us uh to give us knowledge and wisdom also check your motives before being critical Miriam here was H tried to critique Moses publicly what were her motives even as we mention anything about our leaders what are our motives so let's check our motives before criticizing others check your motives ask yourself why am I being critical about this or that about this person why constructive criticism is very important let's support our leaders let's pray for them where we see a weakness let's pray for them can I Comm mes for praying for Miriam even after she came after him and she told God wait please spare her don't destroy her then don't let her die then God said okay she gets out of the camp for seven days yeah but as imagine if someone comes after you as the women Ministry leader you know sometimes you you pray the prayers for that David prays arise oh God and Scatter my enemies you also pray those prayers finish them scatter them but Moses was like don't scatter her please restore her yeah restore her health and actually she got well because of the prayers of Moses so Moses was indeed a leader of course he also had his own failures and we've been told that uh leadership can have failures but let's support them pray for them and encourage them each and every time amen um so um I just want to conclude by saying that let's continue studying this book Daughters of God it's available in our local stores Adventist Book Center and also you can SC scan the QR code below the screen and read study with us may the Lord bless you as you serve amen let's have a final prayer from uh Morin let's pray our heavenly father we thank you so much for giving us the gift and the talent of leadership and governance oh Lord and sometimes Lord you've put it you've put us ahead to be to to be mentors to other people who are coming after us and sometimes Lord this gets into our heads and we forget that everything comes from you forgive us as ladies anytime we've gone astray in matters like that oh Lord and give us a humble spirit in us so that we'll guide others who are also coming after us so that they can do the work that you have called us unto thank you so much for this our prayer in Jesus name amen

[134.9s] um Miriam in the previous episode uh
[139.1s] last week we looked at the mother of
[142.3s] Miriam who was JoBeth and we touched a
[145.5s] bit concerning Miriam Miriam was a
[148.9s] prophetes she was a leader yes how else
[152.9s] can you describe Miriam oh I'd love to
[155.8s] just say that Miriam loveed to
[158.0s] sing when the Israelites crossed the the
[161.6s] Red Sea when they got to the other side
[164.5s] Miriam sang a a real song you know and
[167.8s] the song part of it goes it
[169.9s] says I will sing unto the Lord for he
[173.3s] has trium gloriously the horse and it's
[175.8s] R has thrown into the
[178.6s] sea I will sing unto the Lord for he has
[182.2s] triumphed gloriously the hor and ride
[184.4s] are thrown into the
[186.8s] sea I will sing unto the Lord for he has
[191.9s] triumphed triumphed gloriously so that
[195.2s] she was telling the Israelites my friend
[197.2s] MH the horse and the Riders are H they
[200.5s] are there in the sea amen the Lord has
[203.2s] triumphed
[204.8s] amen can someone read uh the book of
[207.7s] Exodus 15:20 okay
[210.7s] it talks about how Miriam sang with what
[215.5s] with tremble with music instruments yes
[219.5s] yes 15 reads yes then Miriam the
[224.1s] prophetess the sister of Aaron took the
[226.5s] timbrell in her hand and all the women
[228.6s] went out after her with timbrels and
[230.6s] with dances amen what happened all the
[233.6s] women went out after her did you see
[238.0s] that yeah all women went went out after
[241.2s] her I mean someone who comes shouts and
[245.6s] sings and people follow her she was
[249.5s] powerful yeah so um she was a leader of
[254.2s] the Israelites
[255.7s] women and just a little story about um
[259.7s] Miriam Miriam was a very bright girl at
[263.8s] the age of
[265.0s] 12 she helped her mom to um to decide
[271.4s] she came up with an idea she was very
[273.9s] bright and so at this age uh she was
[277.9s] actually the
[279.6s] Elder um child of jacobe she was the
[283.8s] eldest of um a sister to Aaron and Moses
[288.5s] and Miriam was god- gifted the way we've
[291.0s] seen from How She Sang and
[294.4s] then God also gave Miriam Authority a
[297.6s] place of authority and for many years
[300.4s] uh she was faithful Faithfully
[302.7s] discharging that
[304.2s] Ministry uh unfortunately she misused
[307.1s] her position of leadership for a short
[309.6s] time and was charged and actually she
[312.5s] was punished by God what else can you
[315.3s] say about Miriam aen uh I can say that
[319.3s] um she she allowed uh the authority to
[324.9s] get to to to her head and uh she became
[330.2s] bigheaded MH so to speak and uh with
[333.9s] this it led to to disloyalty so we see
[337.2s] that um at some point they started
[339.5s] speaking badly against their brother U
[343.5s] both her and uh and Aaron they started
[347.4s] um they had that jealousy in them they
[350.2s] allowed it to grow and uh as a result
[353.0s] they they started talking about their
[354.6s] their brother in in a bad way and also
[357.4s] disregarding that uh their brother had
[360.0s] uh God speaks to to to Moses and then
[363.8s] because now they were saying that God
[365.2s] also speaks to us you know but you know
[368.1s] we see that uh with with with Moses god
[371.6s] uh used to speak to him directly but
[374.6s] with uh with uh Miriam and Aaron it was
[378.0s] through dreams and visions and the
[380.0s] things like that then just to add sorry
[382.5s] do you mind if I add that to that
[384.7s] actually it says here Miriam had the
[386.6s] spirit of Envy mhm and it said and this
[389.6s] satisfaction MH and like us women even
[393.0s] in the church you know as we are called
[394.8s] to serve one of the things we cannot
[396.6s] afford to have is Envy Envy because all
[399.5s] of us have a gift special gift to do
[402.1s] whatever we are supposed to do I cannot
[404.0s] be morine I cannot be aen I cannot be
[406.6s] Grace Norah even you Elizabeth as you
[409.2s] serve nobody can be another Elizabeth
[412.4s] exactly but it says here that Miriam um
[415.3s] you know this Spirit Envy is one of the
[417.8s] most satanic traits can never exist in
[420.3s] the human heart yes and it is one of the
[422.6s] most baleful in its effects it is envy
[425.8s] that first caused Discord in heaven yeah
[430.6s] and the Indulgence has rought Untold
[433.7s] evil among men yes where envying and
[437.7s] strife is there there is confusion M on
[441.9s] and every evil work mhm so as Daughters
[445.5s] of God we cannot afford to be envious
[448.4s] yes to be jealous
[450.2s] in other words yes and so we here we see
[454.0s] that Miriam
[456.9s] publicly publicly sought to undermine
[460.2s] Moses yes Authority that was given to
[463.6s] him by God God knew that Moses was weak
[468.5s] Moses even said that really I'm a Stam
[472.2s] how can I lead how can I even
[474.8s] speak God knew that Moses was weak had a
[478.4s] weakness and each one of us has a
[480.6s] weakness we have different talents and
[483.4s] we serve differently and so Miriam here
[486.7s] tries to undermine Moses publicly how
[489.3s] many times do you get undermined by
[491.6s] people
[492.8s] publicly yeah and actually the Bible
[495.6s] tells us that that was jealousy Envy
[498.8s] from the heart of Miriam and so we are
[502.5s] encouraged to be a and that is actually
[504.8s] punishable God punished Miriam with
[508.2s] Leprosy m and it was so bad for for for
[512.3s] for Moses for Miriam but later yes if I
[516.8s] may add on what you're saying yes you
[519.0s] know as women we should be really really
[521.2s] you know this is something that I think
[523.1s] all women are pretty much predisposed to
[525.6s] but you should be really careful because
[528.0s] as Ellen White says here but the same
[530.2s] evil that first brought Discord in
[532.0s] heaven sprang up in the heart of this
[533.5s] woman woman of Israel and she did not
[535.6s] fail to find a sympathizer in her
[537.2s] dissatisfaction okay so to look back M
[539.7s] what happened in Heaven There was
[541.1s] Lucifer he be he became proud because
[544.3s] he's like you know I am this great Angel
[546.7s] like I have the greatest voice I am the
[548.6s] highest Angel then jealousy why am I not
[550.9s] then like Jesus then then
[552.4s] dissatisfaction and getting people to
[554.0s] join his plot like this is something
[557.1s] that Satan started so we should really
[560.2s] really be careful when such feelings
[562.2s] start to arise in US Nora you want to
[565.1s] say something yes um among other things
[567.6s] that I found as you were looking into
[569.8s] this earlier MH was how Miriam was
[573.1s] dissatisfied even with the choice of of
[576.2s] a wife yeah that that her brother had
[580.8s] yeah like why should he choose a wife
[584.2s] among the from among the Hebrews M yeah
[588.1s] I mean he was she was taking offense so
[591.3s] uh that was just among the many other uh
[594.4s] complaints that they had so uh even even
[597.8s] to us uh some times especially to us
[600.8s] women or even men of the church how many
[603.5s] times are we very dissatisfied with the
[605.8s] the tribe yes the tribes especially yeah
[609.0s] here in Africa or Kenya where we have
[611.2s] many tribes like uh like now I will say
[615.3s] um yeah why choose a woman from that
[618.4s] tribe and we are very dissatisfied with
[620.4s] that and we even getting fault with
[622.6s] their leadership skills and and yeah so
[626.9s] uh I think we should check ourselves
[630.8s] if we see the the the Book of Proverbs
[633.5s] chapter 6 verse 18 I think from Verse 18
[637.6s] to the end it talks about what God hates
[640.4s] because he says there are six things God
[642.7s] hates yes seven he
[645.4s] detests so a hotty Spirit yeah you know
[650.1s] when you start thinking you're better
[651.4s] than someone else because here is Moses
[653.3s] wife zipora aite like she's dark she's
[656.3s] not as pretty you know and and and even
[659.6s] that I you know I'm the women Ministry
[661.3s] leader or I am the interest coordination
[663.6s] or I'm the power leader and God has
[665.6s] chosen me to do God hates that yeah and
[668.6s] and Miriam did that and God hates
[670.3s] Discord yes anyone who cause causes
[672.7s] Discord which is what Miriam did thank
[674.7s] you uhin maybe just a question to throw
[678.2s] could it be a sense of entit entitlement
[681.0s] that uh that uh Miriam had brought all
[685.1s] this being a firstborn seeing literally
[688.1s] he he she saw
[690.2s] he so Moses growing up saved him and
[693.6s] could could that one also interfere yes
[696.1s] because most of the time we women are
[698.1s] nurtures and and when we when we nurture
[701.4s] sometimes we have entitlement on other
[703.3s] things these have brought all this to us
[705.2s] and what does this one call unto us
[708.4s] humility humility humility thank you um
[712.8s] so I just you want to say something yeah
[715.0s] just one brief thing is that instead of
[718.8s] us being being envious and trying to put
[721.8s] down others when it comes to their
[723.3s] weaknesses we should instead uplift them
[726.6s] and tell them that you can do this just
[728.9s] one step at a time because at the end of
[731.4s] the day someone will end up having
[733.2s] confidence in that and they'll say if it
[736.3s] was not for encouragement I don't think
[738.7s] I would have done that amen amen we are
[741.7s] called upon as women as Daughters of God
[745.5s] Amen to pray for each other those who
[748.3s] are in leadership support them Moses was
[751.3s] in leadership Miriam and Haron were
[754.6s] their siblings they should have
[757.2s] supported him and not condemned them
[760.4s] publicly and so faithfulness has no time
[763.5s] limit any position of leadership will
[766.9s] have its moments of failure yes and
[770.2s] Miriam let her jealousy destroy a
[773.2s] lifetime of faithful service so when we
[777.0s] are serving we should know that
[778.9s] sometimes
[780.2s] leadership and power and comes with
[783.5s] pride and so we should pray to God every
[786.2s] time to help us to be humble and to
[789.0s] serve in humility and in love every day
[793.0s] the the evil one tempts us to cut
[795.7s] Corners uh to compromise our standards
[798.9s] and even um to be dishonest let's pray
[802.9s] to God to help us to give us the Holy
[805.2s] Spirit to help us uh to give us
[808.0s] knowledge and wisdom
[809.9s] also check your motives before being
[812.8s] critical Miriam here was H tried to
[816.6s] critique Moses publicly what were her
[819.3s] motives even as we mention anything
[822.5s] about our leaders what are our motives
[825.3s] so let's check our motives before
[827.0s] criticizing others check your motives
[829.6s] ask yourself why am I being critical
[832.8s] about this or that about this person why
[836.9s] constructive criticism is very important
[840.1s] let's support our leaders let's pray for
[842.6s] them where we see a weakness let's pray
[845.6s] for them can I Comm mes for praying for
[849.0s] Miriam even after she came after him and
[852.5s] she told God wait please spare her don't
[855.4s] destroy her then don't let her die then
[858.4s] God said okay she gets out of the camp
[859.8s] for seven days yeah but as imagine if
[862.7s] someone comes after you as the women
[864.5s] Ministry leader you know sometimes you
[866.4s] you pray the prayers for that David
[868.0s] prays arise oh God and Scatter my
[870.0s] enemies you also pray those prayers
[872.6s] finish them scatter them but Moses was
[876.2s] like don't scatter her please restore
[878.8s] her yeah restore her health and actually
[882.0s] she got well because of the prayers of
[885.1s] Moses so Moses was indeed a leader of
[888.2s] course he also had his own failures and
[890.1s] we've been told that uh leadership can
