FULL TRANSCRIPT:
It is a privilege to say that among the greatest blessings that God can give to a man is a blessing of a wonderful wife. Mine is wonderful, beautiful, precious, and I know she's somewhere. Can I be able to be strengthened by her wonderful? Okay, she is somewhere. Thanks to God. Okay, please uh welcome. Our topic for the day is saying family in Christ. family in Christ. I want to remind you that our theme for the the our theme for this quarter is saying grounded and growing. Sorry, rooted and growing. That is our theme. Rooted and growing. But this month we are saying you cannot be rooted and be growing without having faith in Christ. We are strengthened by faith. And our verse that is guiding us is first Corinthians 15 verse 58. So the title of the sermon is saying family in Christ. Let us pray. Wonderful God, precious savior, Lord in heaven. Weak human being, I am standing before your holy people to speak to them. let me run and hide away that you may be able to shine forth in Jesus name we pray. Amen. Paul is pushed to write the book of first Corinthians obviously because of challenges that are in Corinth. The first thing that we can think of is what he starts with by saying that I have realized that there are divisions among you. Those ones you will find them when you are reading the book. There are divisions among you and this were reported to me by one of you who came to visit me. So I have known that there is that problem. Another problem that I have seen is that there is immorality among you, sexual immorality. Another thing is that there are commotions in the church. Commotions like you are having challenges what to eat and what not to eat. uh you have commotions about how people should speak in church, orderliness in church and also there are doctrinal challenges. Doctrinal challenges are like speaking in tongues and spiritual gifts. And another one which concludes the book is the one of second resurrection. Some people came that were teaching that there will be no second resurrection. How can it be possible that somebody can rise up with a physical body? So they said in conclusion there is no no resurrection. But before I talk about the resurrection, two big problems that I want to at least touch this morning are one is the problem of sexual immorality. He has a burden to write to the Corinthians about their purity when they are in Christ. Why is the burden seriously there and he feels that it is something that he must attend to. Corinth was uh a coastal city, a place that had different ethnic communities, a very good business capital of of a Greece country. So there was wealth, there was a good trade, there were there were different kinds of people and there was a lot a lot of idol worship. There were temples that were dedicated to idols. And in those temples, there were prostitutes that used to be in those temples. And there are people who used to go there. They are members of the church, but they still go to commit prostitution. So it was a burden to Paul hearing that a church that he had started about 2 or 3 years earlier when he was in Corinth now when he is in a faces he gets the message that the church is rotten. People are immoral but they are still coming to church. And those doctrines are coming to church. They want to make it legal that you can come to church, you still go to do this bad things. and chapter 5 verse 1 of 1 Corinthians. Chapter 5 verse one of first Corinthians Paul I thought it could come up the Paul is saying that it is actually reported that there is sexual immorality among you and such sexual immorality as is not even named among the Gentiles. He is saying that what I have heard among you, even those who don't go to church, we don't hear such things among them. I don't have time to overemphasize. But you know when he goes to chapter 6 and verse and verse 9, Paul says, "Do you not know that the unrighteous will not inherit the kingdom of God? Do not be deceived. neither fornicators nor idolattors nor adulterers nor sexual nor homosexuals nor sodomites. I don't want to finish but he concludes by saying they will not inherit the kingdom of God. And then do you know in verse 18 uh same chapter Paul is saying in 1 Corinthians 6:18 he says my dear brethren flee sexual immorality. Every sin that a man does is outside the body. But he who commits sexual immorality sins against his own body. Or do you not know that your body is the temple of the Holy Spirit who is in you whom you have from God and you are not your own. For you were bought at a price. [Music] Therefore glorify God in your body and in your spirit which is God's. Just a little explanation very little that Paul is saying the church of God needs to be pure. Every sin that you commit in a family, your family may struggle and come out of it. But sexual immorality must finish your family. Every sin that you commit may find some easier way of escape. But this sin as a youth will finish your future. This one will finish your family. And Paul is telling the church, please accept purity. Then he goes again to go to this the the third the the the other doctrine that is people are despising second resurrection or resurrection chapter 15 verse one we will read verse 1-4 verse 1-4 1 Corinthians Paul is concluding building this powerful thing by saying, "Moreover, brethren, I declare to you the gospel which I preached to you, which also you received and in which you stand be by which also you are saved. if you hold fast that word which I preached to you unless you believed in vain. For I delivered to you first of all that which I also received that Christ died for our sins according to the scriptures. And verse four and that he was buried. I want you to underline he died according to the scriptures and he was buried and that he rose again the third day according to scriptures. We pause as we started Paul is saying this thing that I am writing to you is the good news. This thing that I am writing is the gospel and this gospel you did one thing you accepted it. I preached it to you. That is verse one. I preached this gospel to you and you accepted it. And therefore in that you stand. The truth that I spoke to you is the right one and it is the thing that you are standing on. And then he says hold it fast. That is verse two. Hold it fast unless you want your belief your what you believed to be in vain. Then verse three says he he says for I delivered to you first of all that which I also received that what I received is that Christ died for our sins and he was buried. Bario confirms that he died. But not only that, he rose again. When Paul is saying that this thing that I preach to you, stand on it. He's saying the gospel is that Christ died and Christ was buried and Christ resurrected. He is saying that is the gospel. If we lose it, we have no hope in the future. So he's saying that remember Christ died for our sins. They chose for him the kind of death that is a great punishment. Dying at the cross is the slowest, let me not say the slowest, but a slow kind of death while undergoing extreme pain. I want you to at least let that one sink. Christ died on the cross and being crucified on the cross is a slow kind of death while inflicting on you extremist pain possible. Meaning that when the vein here is pricricked, the vein will be very painful and it is holding you up just on the vein and your body is pushing your weight down. As the body is pushing the weight down, the nails at the feet are being pushed down because your body is pushing you down. The weight is pushing you down. So the way the pain is becoming extremely painful and you are dying so slowly feeling that pain for a long time. It reaches a point that the weight of the body has pushed you down until the breathing starts to become a problem. And therefore, Paul is saying, remember Christ went through pain that he may be able to die for your sins and he died and was buried. But he's saying the good news is that he rose again. The resurrection of Christ is something to grasp for the Christians. We can never have hope without resurrection. So therefore he is saying that I am writing to you because some of you are teaching that there is no resurrection. So we go to verse 12 and 13. 1 Corinthians 15 verse 12 and 14. The Bible is saying now if Christ is preached that he has been raised from the dead, how do some of some among you say that there is no resurrection of the dead? that verse 13 but if there is no resurrection of the dead then Christ is not risen. So what Paul is saying that some of you have gone to dispute the resurrection of Christ. If there is no resurrection, why are you a Christian if there is no resurrection? We are preaching that there is resurrection, that Christ resurrected. But why are some of you saying that there will be no resurrection? If there is no resurrection, then Christ is not risen. Because Christ cannot rise from the dead, then us who are following Christ, we fail to rise from the dead. And therefore, he continues in verse 17 to say, "And if Christ is not risen, your faith is futile. You are still in your sins." then also those who have fallen asleep in Christ have perished. So here Paul is saying if Christ is not risen then our faith is useless. Why do we believe if Christ did not rise up again? Why do we come to church if Christ did not rise? So he's saying if in case Christ did not rise then we will also not rise and if we will not rise then those who have slept they have perished. I have a very great fear of our members and many Christians who still say that somebody who has died the soul has gone to heaven. Some say dancing with angels. Somebody is saying pray for us. someone saying uh they say all sorts of things about someone who is dead. But if there is no resurrection, then everyone who has fallen as asleep is has perished. meaning that anyone who has fallen asleep knows nothing has not gone to heaven they are on the dust of in the dust of the ground and if Christ doesn't come back they have perished meaning that only in resurrection we have hope for the future because if they will rise up when we will rise up is when we will go with him to heaven and we will have life that is eternal. That is when the other life will start at the second coming at the resurrection. So with the resurrection of Christ we have hope. So he's saying I know some of you have been cheated by the Jews who dispute resurrection. Some of you have been taught by pagans that there is no resurrection and you follow the teachings of the pagans that there is no resurrection. I plead with you that there is resurrection and Christ will come again. That is what he's saying. And you know it that he is telling us that please turn away from your sins from the falsehood and follow what is right. So here Paul is saying that do you know some of these things you do you are being pushed by the people who are around you. If you want to confirm that he says so, he's saying in verse 33, before we go to 33 from verse 29, Paul is saying otherwise, what will they do who are baptized for the dead? If the dead do not rise at all, why then are they baptized for the dead? And why do we stand in geopodity every hour? The word I need starts from there. Paul is saying if there is no resurrection of the dead, why do we stand in geopoly every hour? Every hour there is a threat of perishing. If there is no hope for the future, why do I stand in? Then he says in verse 31, "Affirm by boasting. I affirm by boasting in you which I have in Christ Jesus our Lord. I die daily." That word I die daily, I repent because I think I misuse it very many times in my spiritual life. We always said if Romans 7 is saying you know what I want to do I don't do what I do that I do not want to do then I say Paul is saying I die daily I sin daily that is what we used to say but here in the context of this place Paul is saying we are always in geopad because of the second coming we are always through a threat we are always through going through danger. So he's saying in verse 31, I affirm by the boasting in you which I have in Christ Jesus our Lord, I die daily in the manner of men. I have fought with beasts in Ephesus. So he's saying okay one day we talked about the arena where they were being thrown into the arena to for the beast to kill them but here is we didn't see Paul being thrown into the arena with the beasts but he's saying I fought with beasts in Ephesus that one you may find it maybe in acts a acts which we are not reading acts chap chapter 19 from verse 21 where there was a great commotion that Paul is teaching people against our goddess Diana and our gods and they said great is our goddess Diana and they wanted to tear the apostles. Two of of the apostles were arrested by them and they were looking for Paul and Paul wanted to go and apostle said Paul you are not going to Ephesus. These people are going to tear you up and and and and Paul is saying in Ephesus I fought with beasts because of the second resurrection. I know there is a future. So even when I'm going through challenges, I will not be afraid because I know the future. That is why he's saying he's saying in that verse, I have fought with beasts at the faces. What advantage is it to me if I am through all these perils? What is it giving me as a prophet to fight all the this fight if there is no second resurrection? So Paul is saying that I am going through a lot. My life is threatened daily. So Paul is saying I die daily for the sake of Christ. I stand with Christ and because of that I go through challenges in life. One time 40 people decided that they are going to fast. They will not eat or drink anything until they shall have killed Paul. So Paul is saying my life is always in danger because of the second resurrection. So he says in verse 32, do not be deceived, evil company corrupts good habits. So he's saying my children in the Lord, don't be deceived. Evil company corrupts good habits. These things you have gotten them from pagans. Those are bad companies. They corrupt good habits. When you first had a family, your family was very joyous, very happy. But when you got into bad company, you corrupted your life, your moral life and your family is in danger. Sometime you were very moral but you decided to become very immoral and you are dying in it. So Paul is saying you have to change. One time you used to dress very nicely but when you went to the bad company the dressing style changed not for the better but for the worst. So Paul is saying do not be deceived. Evil company corrupts good habits. And then he says, "Awake to righteousness and do not sin, for some do not have the knowledge of God. I speak this to your shame. I am speaking this that you should be ashamed of what you're doing. Jump to verse 51. So Paul is saying, "Behold, I tell you the mystery. We shall not all sleep, but we shall all be changed. We shall not all sleep, but as who believe in Christ, we shall all be changed. In a moment, in the twinkle of an eye, at the last trumpet, for the trumpet will sound, and the dead will be raised to incorruptible, and we shall be changed. Paul is saying, the word of God is telling us, "Do not be deceived. We shall be changed. The best is coming. We shall win victory. Even though through challenges in life, but we shall win. We will go through tough moments in life but those who wait upon the Lord will be able to win. So he's saying behold I tell you the mystery. We shall not all sleep but we shall be changed. Those who will be alive will be changed. Those who will be dead will arise with a body that is incorruptible. There is physical resurrection of the saints for his glory. And therefore, because of those many challenges, Paul is encouraging the the Corinthians that things will be tough. But God has promised to bring the eternal hope, the hope of glory that will come with the resurrection. And before I read verse 15, I just want to read Hebrews 12:4. Hebrews 12:4. It says that okay, always we always feel that we are going through a lot and we are in perils. But here the writer of Hebrews is saying, "You have not yet resisted to bloodshed, striving against sin." We are always striving that we may see this glory. And for us to strive against sin, we have been feeling the weight. But the writer the book of Hebrews is telling us we are always resisting and we feel that we go through a lot of struggles to overcome sin. But is saying even though we are struggling we have not yet resisted till bloodshed. We must resist till bloodshed. And therefore verse 58 as we close is saying verse 58 is saying verse 58 is saying therefore my beloved brethren be steadfast be steadfast immovable always abounding in the work of the Lord. Steadfast and immovable time is not enough for me. Steadfast means seated properly. Be seated in Christ properly. Do not be shaken. Be movable. Then he says, "Knowing that your labor is not in vain, your toil is not in vain." As coristas are coming, he's saying your toil is not in vain. The faith that you have put in Christ is not in vain. This word for toil, you can say deep fatigue. You are in Christ, but you always find you are fatigued. Even in your giving offerings, you always give and you are faithful but you are finding even giving is in fatigue. Even as we are talking about the promotion of the the the the coming Arambee you feel it is fatigue but he's saying that that fatigue is not in vain. Therefore we are going to sing a song and this song is saying this song is saying it is number 610. This song is saying stand like the brave. Stand like the brave facing the fall. We must succeed. Let us rise for word for the

TIMESTAMPED TRANSCRIPT:
[0.4s] It is a privilege to say that among the
[5.3s] greatest blessings that God can give to
[7.9s] a
[9.0s] man is a blessing of a wonderful
[13.1s] wife. Mine is
[15.9s] wonderful,
[18.4s] beautiful, precious, and I know she's
[21.6s] somewhere. Can I be able to be
[23.8s] strengthened by her
[28.0s] wonderful? Okay, she is
[32.8s] somewhere. Thanks to
[34.9s] God. Okay, please uh welcome. Our topic
[39.7s] for the day is
[43.2s] saying family in Christ.
[48.0s] family in
[50.8s] Christ. I want to remind you that our
[55.0s] theme for the the our theme for this
[59.0s] quarter is
[61.6s] saying grounded and
[65.4s] growing. Sorry, rooted and growing. That
[68.6s] is our theme. Rooted and growing. But
[72.4s] this month we are saying you cannot be
[75.4s] rooted and be growing without having
[81.4s] faith in
[83.2s] Christ. We are strengthened by faith.
[87.9s] And our verse that is guiding us is
[92.0s] first Corinthians 15 verse 58. So the
[96.9s] title of the sermon is
[100.5s] saying
[102.3s] family in
[104.4s] Christ. Let us
[106.9s] pray. Wonderful God, precious savior,
[109.9s] Lord in
[113.6s] heaven. Weak human
[117.1s] being, I am standing before your holy
[120.8s] people to speak to them.
[123.6s] let me run and hide away that you may be
[127.6s] able to shine forth in Jesus name we
[131.3s] pray.
[136.2s] Amen. Paul is pushed to write the book
[140.6s] of first
[143.8s] Corinthians obviously because of
[146.1s] challenges that are in
[151.0s] Corinth.
[154.4s] The first thing that we can think of
[158.4s] is what he starts
[161.0s] with by saying that I have realized that
[164.6s] there are divisions among
[166.4s] you. Those ones you will find them when
[169.2s] you are reading the book. There are
[171.4s] divisions among you and this were
[174.5s] reported to me by one of you who came to
[176.9s] visit me. So I have known that there is
[179.8s] that problem. Another problem that I
[183.4s] have seen is that there is immorality
[186.2s] among you, sexual
[189.6s] immorality. Another thing is that there
[194.4s] are commotions in the church. Commotions
[199.2s] like you are having
[202.2s] challenges what to eat and what not to
[205.1s] eat.
[208.2s] uh you
[209.2s] have
[210.8s] commotions about how people should speak
[214.2s] in church, orderliness in
[216.4s] church and also there are doctrinal
[219.6s] challenges. Doctrinal challenges are
[223.0s] like speaking in tongues and spiritual
[228.9s] gifts. And another one which concludes
[232.9s] the book
[234.8s] is the one of second
[239.4s] resurrection. Some people came that were
[242.3s] teaching that there will be no second
[245.3s] resurrection. How can it be possible
[248.3s] that somebody can rise
[251.1s] up with a physical
[253.9s] body? So they said in conclusion there
[256.9s] is no no
[258.8s] resurrection. But before I talk about
[261.0s] the
[262.0s] resurrection, two big problems that I
[265.0s] want to at least touch this morning
[269.9s] are one is the problem of sexual
[274.2s] immorality. He has a burden to write to
[279.3s] the
[280.4s] Corinthians about their purity when they
[284.6s] are in
[287.0s] Christ. Why is the burden seriously
[290.5s] there and he feels that it is something
[293.3s] that he
[294.9s] must attend to.
[299.6s] Corinth was
[303.7s] uh a coastal
[306.3s] city, a place that had different ethnic
[311.5s] communities, a very good business
[314.0s] capital of of a Greece country. So there
[319.3s] was wealth, there was a good trade,
[321.9s] there were there were different kinds of
[324.1s] people and there was a lot a lot of idol
[327.8s] worship. There were temples that were
[330.9s] dedicated to
[332.4s] idols. And in those
[335.5s] temples, there were prostitutes that
[339.3s] used to be in those
[341.0s] temples. And there are people who used
[344.3s] to go there. They are members of the
[346.9s] church, but they still go to commit
[351.0s] prostitution.
[352.6s] So it was a burden to Paul hearing that
[356.2s] a church that he had started about 2 or
[359.3s] 3 years earlier when he was in Corinth
[362.5s] now when he is in a
[365.3s] faces he gets the message that the
[368.2s] church is rotten. People are immoral but
[372.2s] they are still coming to
[373.9s] church. And those doctrines are coming
[377.4s] to church. They want to make it legal
[380.2s] that you can come to church, you still
[382.5s] go to do this bad things. and chapter 5
[388.1s] verse 1 of 1 Corinthians. Chapter 5
[391.3s] verse one of first Corinthians Paul I
[395.2s] thought it could come up
[399.2s] the Paul is
[402.0s] saying
[404.1s] that it is actually
[407.2s] reported that there is sexual immorality
[411.2s] among
[413.1s] you and such sexual
[416.7s] immorality as is not even named
[420.7s] among the
[424.1s] Gentiles. He is
[426.2s] saying that what I have heard among
[430.8s] you, even those who don't go to church,
[434.8s] we don't hear such
[436.6s] things among
[439.3s] them. I don't have time to
[442.1s] overemphasize. But you know when he goes
[444.4s] to chapter 6 and verse
[452.8s] and verse
[455.7s] 9, Paul
[458.5s] says, "Do you not know that the
[462.0s] unrighteous will not inherit the kingdom
[464.8s] of
[465.5s] God? Do not be deceived. neither
[469.9s] fornicators nor
[472.4s] idolattors nor adulterers nor sexual nor
[477.7s] homosexuals nor sodomites. I don't want
[481.3s] to finish but he concludes by saying
[484.0s] they will not inherit the kingdom of
[487.8s] God. And then do you know in verse 18 uh
[491.4s] same chapter Paul is saying in 1
[495.6s] Corinthians 6:18 he says my dear
[500.2s] brethren flee sexual
[504.4s] immorality. Every sin that a man
[508.4s] does is outside the body.
[512.6s] But he who commits sexual
[515.3s] immorality sins against his own body. Or
[519.3s] do you not know that your body is the
[521.8s] temple of the Holy Spirit who is in you
[525.1s] whom you have from God and you are not
[528.9s] your own. For you were
[533.1s] bought at a price.
[536.1s] [Music]
[537.7s] Therefore glorify God in your body and
[541.6s] in your spirit which is God's. Just a
[545.4s] little explanation very little that Paul
[550.2s] is
[551.2s] saying the church of God needs to be
[555.1s] pure.
[559.3s] Every sin that you commit in a family,
[563.0s] your family may struggle and come out of
[565.5s] it. But sexual immorality must finish
[570.2s] your
[571.6s] family. Every sin that you
[576.0s] commit may find some easier way of
[579.2s] escape. But this sin as a youth will
[585.2s] finish your
[588.0s] future. This one will finish your
[592.1s] family. And Paul is telling the
[595.5s] church, please accept purity. Then he
[599.9s] goes again to go to this the the third
[602.7s] the the the other doctrine that is
[606.9s] people
[611.2s] are
[612.8s] despising second
[615.2s] resurrection or resurrection chapter 15
[618.7s] verse one we will read verse
[622.4s] 1-4 verse
[624.3s] 1-4 1 Corinthians Paul is concluding
[629.1s] building this powerful thing by
[634.0s] saying, "Moreover,
[636.8s] brethren, I declare to you the gospel
[641.0s] which I preached to you, which also you
[646.4s] received and in which you stand be by
[651.5s] which also you are saved.
[654.6s] if you hold fast that word which I
[658.6s] preached to you unless you believed in
[663.5s] vain. For I delivered to you first of
[666.7s] all that which I also received that
[670.6s] Christ died for our sins according to
[674.3s] the scriptures. And verse four and that
[677.9s] he was buried. I want you to underline
[682.0s] he died according to the scriptures and
[686.2s] he was
[687.9s] buried and that he rose again the third
[692.7s] day according to scriptures. We
[697.0s] pause as we started Paul is
[700.3s] saying this thing that I am writing to
[703.4s] you is the good news.
[706.7s] This thing that I am writing is the
[710.0s] gospel and this gospel you did one thing
[715.4s] you accepted
[716.9s] it. I preached it to you. That is verse
[719.8s] one. I preached this gospel to you and
[723.4s] you accepted
[724.8s] it. And
[727.6s] therefore in that you stand.
[733.0s] The truth that I spoke to you is the
[736.1s] right one and it is the thing that you
[739.7s] are standing on. And then he
[743.9s] says hold it fast. That is verse
[748.7s] two. Hold it fast unless you want your
[754.4s] belief your what you believed to be in
[757.9s] vain. Then verse three says he he says
[762.5s] for I delivered to you first of all that
[766.5s] which I also received that what I
[770.2s] received is that Christ
[773.6s] died for our
[777.2s] sins and he was buried. Bario confirms
[781.8s] that he
[783.1s] died. But not only
[785.5s] that, he rose
[790.4s] again. When Paul is saying that this
[793.5s] thing that I preach to you, stand on it.
[796.7s] He's saying the gospel is that Christ
[800.9s] died and Christ was
[804.0s] buried and Christ resurrected.
[809.2s] He is saying that is the
[811.4s] gospel. If we lose
[814.4s] it, we have no hope in the future. So
[818.6s] he's
[819.8s] saying that remember Christ died for our
[826.3s] sins. They chose for him the kind of
[831.2s] death that is a great
[834.0s] punishment. Dying at the
[837.6s] cross is the
[841.0s] slowest, let me not say the slowest, but
[844.4s] a slow kind of
[846.6s] death while undergoing extreme
[852.1s] pain. I want you to at least let that
[856.3s] one sink.
[858.3s] Christ died on the cross and being
[862.7s] crucified on the cross is a slow kind of
[867.1s] death while inflicting on
[870.3s] you
[871.9s] extremist pain
[874.6s] possible. Meaning that when the vein
[878.0s] here is
[880.7s] pricricked, the vein will be very
[883.8s] painful and it is holding
[886.4s] you up just on the
[890.3s] vein and your body is pushing your
[894.7s] weight down.
[897.2s] As the body is pushing the weight down,
[900.3s] the nails at the
[903.5s] feet are being pushed down because your
[908.0s] body is pushing you down. The weight is
[911.7s] pushing you down. So the way the pain is
[915.5s] becoming extremely
[918.8s] painful
[920.3s] and you are dying so
[923.6s] slowly feeling that pain for a long
[928.8s] time. It reaches a point that the weight
[931.9s] of the body has pushed you down until
[936.2s] the breathing starts to become a
[939.8s] problem.
[943.8s] And therefore, Paul is
[947.0s] saying, remember
[949.8s] Christ went through pain that he may be
[953.1s] able to die for your
[955.7s] sins and he
[959.5s] died and was buried.
[964.2s] But he's
[965.4s] saying the good news is that he rose
[971.5s] again. The resurrection of Christ is
[976.0s] something to grasp for the
[979.5s] Christians. We can never have hope
[983.0s] without resurrection. So therefore he is
[987.0s] saying that I am writing to you because
[990.4s] some of you are teaching that there is
[992.8s] no resurrection. So we go to verse 12
[996.6s] and
[997.6s] 13. 1 Corinthians 15 verse 12 and 14.
[1002.8s] The Bible is
[1008.3s] saying
[1010.0s] now if Christ is
[1012.8s] preached that he has been raised from
[1015.6s] the
[1017.1s] dead, how do some of some among you say
[1022.5s] that there is no resurrection of the
[1024.5s] dead?
[1029.6s] that verse 13 but if there is no
[1033.8s] resurrection of the
[1035.9s] dead then Christ is not
[1040.4s] risen. So what Paul is saying that some
[1045.9s] of you have
[1048.0s] gone to dispute the resurrection of
[1051.4s] Christ.
[1053.4s] If there is no
[1057.1s] resurrection, why are you a Christian if
[1059.9s] there is no resurrection? We are
[1062.4s] preaching that there is resurrection,
[1064.6s] that Christ
[1065.9s] resurrected. But why are some of you
[1069.8s] saying that there will be no
[1071.7s] resurrection? If there is no
[1074.0s] resurrection, then Christ is not risen.
[1079.0s] Because Christ cannot rise from the
[1081.0s] dead, then us who are following Christ,
[1085.6s] we fail to rise from the dead. And
[1089.2s] therefore, he continues in
[1092.2s] verse 17 to
[1095.9s] say, "And if Christ is not
[1099.9s] risen, your faith is
[1103.1s] futile. You are still in your sins."
[1108.1s] then also those who have fallen asleep
[1110.3s] in Christ have
[1117.3s] perished. So here Paul is
[1120.3s] saying if Christ is not
[1124.4s] risen then our faith is
[1128.4s] useless. Why do we believe if Christ did
[1132.0s] not rise up again?
[1134.1s] Why do we come to church if Christ did
[1136.6s] not
[1137.6s] rise? So he's
[1139.8s] saying if in case Christ did not
[1143.6s] rise then we will also not
[1146.9s] rise and if we will not rise then those
[1151.0s] who have
[1153.6s] slept they have perished.
[1158.2s] I
[1160.3s] have a very great fear of our members
[1165.8s] and many
[1167.3s] Christians who still say that somebody
[1171.9s] who has
[1173.3s] died the soul has gone to heaven. Some
[1176.7s] say dancing with angels. Somebody is
[1179.5s] saying pray for us. someone saying
[1187.7s] uh they say all sorts of things about
[1191.8s] someone who is
[1193.2s] dead. But if there is no
[1198.0s] resurrection, then everyone who has
[1200.6s] fallen as asleep is has perished.
[1204.5s] meaning that anyone who has fallen
[1206.6s] asleep knows nothing has not gone to
[1210.2s] heaven they are on the dust of in the
[1213.4s] dust of the ground and if Christ doesn't
[1216.2s] come back they have
[1220.2s] perished meaning
[1222.7s] that only in resurrection we have hope
[1225.9s] for the
[1227.2s] future because if they will rise up when
[1231.2s] we will rise up is when we will go with
[1234.1s] him to heaven and we will have life that
[1237.5s] is
[1238.3s] eternal. That is when the other life
[1242.1s] will start at the second coming at the
[1245.6s] resurrection. So with the resurrection
[1248.0s] of Christ we have hope. So he's saying I
[1252.9s] know some of you have been cheated by
[1255.4s] the Jews who dispute resurrection. Some
[1259.2s] of you have
[1262.0s] been taught by pagans that there is no
[1266.1s] resurrection and you follow the
[1268.6s] teachings of the pagans that there is no
[1271.6s] resurrection. I plead with you that
[1275.0s] there is resurrection and Christ will
[1278.2s] come again. That is what he's saying.
[1281.7s] And you know it that he is telling
[1284.4s] us
[1286.2s] that
[1288.5s] please turn away from your
[1292.8s] sins from the
[1295.2s] falsehood and follow what is right. So
[1298.9s] here Paul is
[1301.1s] saying that do you know some of these
[1303.7s] things you do you are being pushed by
[1306.8s] the people who are around you.
[1309.5s] If you want to confirm that he says
[1313.2s] so, he's saying in verse
[1319.2s] 33, before we go to 33 from verse 29,
[1323.6s] Paul is saying
[1325.2s] otherwise, what will they
[1327.9s] do who are baptized for the dead?
[1332.4s] If the dead do not rise at all, why then
[1336.4s] are they baptized for the dead? And why
[1340.0s] do we stand in geopodity every
[1343.9s] hour? The word I need starts from there.
[1347.3s] Paul is
[1348.8s] saying if there is no resurrection of
[1351.8s] the
[1352.7s] dead, why do
[1356.1s] we
[1357.6s] stand in
[1359.9s] geopoly every hour? Every hour there is
[1364.9s] a threat of
[1367.4s] perishing. If there is no hope for the
[1370.7s] future, why do I stand
[1375.2s] in? Then he says in verse
[1378.8s] 31, "Affirm by
[1383.1s] boasting. I affirm by boasting in you
[1387.4s] which I have in Christ Jesus our Lord. I
[1391.0s] die
[1392.9s] daily." That word I die daily, I repent
[1397.7s] because I think I misuse it very many
[1400.5s] times in my spiritual life. We always
[1403.7s] said if Romans 7 is saying you know what
[1406.5s] I want to do I don't do what I do that I
[1410.1s] do not want to do then I say Paul is
[1412.7s] saying I die daily I sin daily that is
[1415.5s] what we used to say but here in the
[1417.4s] context of this place Paul is
[1421.0s] saying we are always in
[1424.3s] geopad because of the second
[1427.3s] coming we are always through a threat we
[1431.9s] are always through going through
[1438.0s] danger. So he's saying in verse 31, I
[1442.0s] affirm by the boasting in you which I
[1445.6s] have in Christ Jesus our Lord, I die
[1451.7s] daily in the manner of men. I have
[1455.8s] fought with beasts in Ephesus. So he's
[1459.0s] saying okay one day we talked about the
[1461.4s] arena where they were being thrown into
[1463.2s] the arena to for the beast to kill them
[1466.0s] but here is we didn't see Paul being
[1469.0s] thrown into the arena with the beasts
[1471.5s] but he's saying I fought with beasts in
[1475.6s] Ephesus that one you may find it maybe
[1479.9s] in acts a acts which we are not reading
[1483.0s] acts chap chapter 19 from verse 21 where
[1486.8s] there was a great commotion
[1488.9s] that Paul is teaching people against our
[1491.9s] goddess Diana and our gods and they said
[1495.8s] great is our goddess Diana and they
[1499.0s] wanted to tear the apostles. Two of of
[1503.0s] the apostles were arrested by them and
[1505.6s] they were looking for Paul and Paul
[1507.4s] wanted to go and apostle said Paul you
[1509.9s] are not going to Ephesus. These people
[1511.9s] are going to tear you up and and and and
[1516.2s] Paul is saying in Ephesus I fought with
[1520.4s] beasts because of the second
[1523.1s] resurrection. I know there is a future.
[1526.5s] So even when I'm going through
[1528.2s] challenges, I will not be afraid because
[1531.8s] I know the
[1533.6s] future. That is why he's
[1537.5s] saying he's saying in that verse, I have
[1542.1s] fought with beasts at the faces. What
[1545.8s] advantage is it to me if I am through
[1549.9s] all these perils?
[1552.8s] What is it giving me as a prophet to
[1557.5s] fight all the this fight if there is no
[1560.3s] second resurrection? So Paul is
[1564.2s] saying
[1565.9s] that I am going through a lot. My life
[1571.4s] is threatened daily. So Paul is saying I
[1576.4s] die daily for the
[1579.6s] sake of Christ.
[1583.3s] I stand with Christ and because of that
[1587.4s] I go through challenges in life. One
[1590.9s] time 40 people decided that they are
[1594.8s] going to fast. They will not
[1597.6s] eat or drink anything until they shall
[1602.2s] have killed Paul. So Paul is saying my
[1605.5s] life is always in danger because of the
[1608.9s] second resurrection. So he says in verse
[1612.0s] 32, do not be
[1614.3s] deceived, evil
[1616.6s] company corrupts good habits. So he's
[1622.0s] saying my children in the Lord, don't be
[1628.0s] deceived. Evil company corrupts good
[1631.1s] habits. These things you have gotten
[1633.4s] them from
[1634.8s] pagans. Those are bad companies.
[1638.5s] They corrupt good
[1640.0s] habits. When you first had a family,
[1643.4s] your family was
[1646.2s] very joyous, very
[1648.8s] happy. But when you got
[1651.8s] into bad
[1654.2s] company, you corrupted your life, your
[1657.3s] moral life and your family is in danger.
[1663.4s] Sometime you were very moral but you
[1666.4s] decided to become very immoral and you
[1669.4s] are dying in
[1670.6s] it. So Paul is saying you have to
[1674.2s] change.
[1676.0s] One time you used to dress very
[1678.5s] nicely but when you went to
[1681.8s] the bad
[1684.7s] company the dressing style
[1689.5s] changed not for the better but for the
[1694.8s] worst. So Paul is
[1697.9s] saying do not be deceived.
[1701.4s] Evil
[1702.7s] company corrupts good
[1707.3s] habits. And then he
[1712.9s] says, "Awake to
[1715.9s] righteousness and do not sin, for some
[1719.6s] do not have the knowledge of
[1721.7s] God. I
[1723.8s] speak this to your shame.
[1728.2s] I am speaking this that you should be
[1730.8s] ashamed of what you're
[1733.1s] doing. Jump to verse 51. So Paul is
[1736.7s] saying, "Behold, I tell you the
[1740.4s] mystery. We shall not all
[1744.1s] sleep, but we shall
[1746.7s] all be changed.
[1749.8s] We shall not all
[1752.4s] sleep, but as who believe in Christ, we
[1757.0s] shall all be
[1761.6s] changed. In a moment, in the twinkle of
[1764.6s] an eye, at the last trumpet, for the
[1768.4s] trumpet will sound, and the dead will be
[1772.0s] raised to incorruptible, and we shall be
[1775.4s] changed.
[1777.5s] Paul is
[1779.2s] saying, the word of God is telling
[1783.2s] us, "Do not be
[1787.3s] deceived. We shall be
[1790.2s] changed. The best is
[1793.7s] coming. We shall win
[1797.2s] victory. Even though
[1799.6s] through challenges in life, but we shall
[1802.4s] win.
[1803.8s] We will go through tough moments in life
[1806.9s] but those who wait upon the Lord will be
[1810.2s] able to win. So he's saying behold I
[1814.1s] tell you the mystery. We shall not all
[1819.0s] sleep but we shall be
[1821.5s] changed. Those who will be alive will be
[1824.6s] changed. Those who will be dead will
[1830.0s] arise with a body that is
[1833.9s] incorruptible. There is physical
[1837.2s] resurrection of the saints for his
[1840.3s] glory. And
[1842.6s] therefore, because of those many
[1845.3s] challenges, Paul is encouraging the the
[1848.9s] Corinthians that things will be
[1853.4s] tough. But God has promised to bring the
[1858.8s] eternal hope, the hope of glory that
[1862.6s] will
[1864.1s] come with the resurrection.
[1867.9s] And before I read verse 15, I just want
[1870.8s] to read Hebrews
[1874.4s] 12:4. Hebrews
[1877.6s] 12:4. It
[1881.4s] says
[1884.4s] that okay, always we always feel that we
[1888.4s] are going through a lot and we are in
[1891.0s] perils. But here the writer of Hebrews
[1893.9s] is saying, "You have not yet resisted to
[1899.0s] bloodshed, striving against
[1902.2s] sin." We are always striving that we may
[1906.2s] see this glory. And for us to strive
[1909.5s] against sin, we have been feeling the
[1912.7s] weight. But the writer the book of
[1916.3s] Hebrews is telling us we are always
[1919.0s] resisting and we feel that we go through
[1921.4s] a lot of struggles to overcome sin. But
[1925.0s] is saying even though we are struggling
[1927.6s] we have not yet resisted till
[1931.9s] bloodshed. We must
[1934.1s] resist till bloodshed. And therefore
[1937.6s] verse 58 as we close is
[1941.6s] saying verse 58 is
[1951.4s] saying verse 58 is
[1954.2s] saying therefore my beloved
[1958.4s] brethren be
[1961.1s] steadfast be
[1963.2s] steadfast immovable
[1966.5s] always abounding in the work of the
[1970.8s] Lord. Steadfast and immovable time is
[1973.9s] not enough for me. Steadfast means
[1977.4s] seated
[1978.8s] properly. Be seated in Christ
[1981.9s] properly. Do not be shaken. Be movable.
[1986.4s] Then he
[1988.0s] says, "Knowing that your labor is not in
[1993.2s] vain, your toil is not in vain." As
[1996.5s] coristas are
[1997.8s] coming, he's saying your toil is not in
[2002.2s] vain. The faith that you have put in
[2005.4s] Christ is not in vain. This word for
[2008.3s] toil, you can say deep
[2011.2s] fatigue. You are in Christ, but you
[2013.4s] always find you are fatigued.
[2016.0s] Even in your giving offerings, you
[2018.1s] always give and you are faithful but you
[2020.3s] are finding even giving is in fatigue.
[2023.3s] Even as we are talking about the
[2025.4s] promotion of the the the the coming
[2027.8s] Arambee you feel it is fatigue but he's
[2031.3s] saying that that fatigue is not in vain.
[2037.6s] Therefore we are going to sing a song
[2040.1s] and this song is
[2043.1s] saying this
[2045.4s] song is saying it is number
[2049.3s] 610. This song is saying stand like the
[2054.1s] brave. Stand like the brave facing the
[2058.3s] fall. We must succeed. Let us rise for
[2064.3s] word for the
