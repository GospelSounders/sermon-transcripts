FULL TRANSCRIPT:
the Lord is good and all the time I want to thank God for his blessings the week that was and also for the blessing of the rest of the Sabbath the benefits of sacrifice we are here because we are beneficiaries of the greatest sacrifice that has ever been made God giving himself to die for our sins sacrifice is not easy to engage in yet it is the key that unlocks many gates to deliverance and even blessings it is one of the secrets of Supernatural breakthroughs may I now by the grace of God call upon us to explore the power of the blessing when we sacrifice or when we give sacrificially the text which was read the two verses Psalms 1265 and6 I repeat says Those Who s in tears shall reap in joy and he who continually goes for the Weeping be bearing seed for sewing shall doubtless come again with rejoicing bringing his sheaves with him sacrifice is done in tears and in pain but the person engaging in it reaps in joy and bountifully the returns are normally fearful because they are beyond what can be explained by the human language it is God's ordained gateway to a new dwn glorious beginnings and series of breakthroughs and this reminds me of our first Union Mega fundraiser which happened last year but one we all came and we want to thank each one of you for the sacrifice and what you gave in that fundraiser we were are targeting to raise 40 million so that some can go to the rehab you are able to raise 23 million and because of sacrificing as a conference for the lital we get we were able to acquire what we wanted to acquire a city scan for the Nairobi Adventist Hospital and later through sacrifice we have been able to equip the Hospital fully with other equipment and as we speak we have the best lab around there and uh hospitals even send their specimen to us and that is why we are calling upon each one of us once again to sacrifice for the second project which we are having the fundraiser tomorrow now what is sacrifice it is is giving out things that are precious and valuable to us it talks about the cost and not volume the quality and not quantity of what we are giving furthermore sacrifice is parting away with our Goods with whipping the process is painful as we shall see but gainful at the end you remember the story of Jesus in Luke 2313 the Bible says and he looked up and saw the rich putting their gifts their sacrifices into the treasury and he saw also a certain poor window putting in two mits so he said truly I say to you this poor window has put in more than all for all these out of their abidance have put in offerings or sacrifice for God but she out of her poverty put in all the livelihood livelihood that she had so sacrifice is like putting all whatever you had now what are the benefits of sacrifice there are a number of them now begin with the first one sacrifice reverses curses in the Book of Genesis 8 and verse 20 and 21 the Bible says and Noah made a not to the Lord and from every clean beast and bird he made Burn offerings on the altar or sacrifice and when the sweet smell came up to the Lord he said in his heart that is God I will not again put a curse on the earth because of man for the thoughts of man's for the thoughts of man's heart are evil from his earliest days never again will I and destruction on a living things as I have done so what made God to say he will never destroy Mankind and living things again it was because Noah sacrificed so sacrifice or offering when we do it from the heart it reverses curses Upon Our Lives we see what God did when Noah gave an offering number two it is the auar of enactment enactment of Covenant during the last days God or Christ will come and when he comes he will not look just for anybody he will look for people who through sacrifice made Covenant with him so and we get into this Covenant by accepting the sacrifice which God made for us in the Book of Psalms 50 and verse 5 the Bible says let my saints come together to me those who have made an agreement with me by offerings you read other translations it you say it it says gather all my Saints who made Covenant with me through sacrifice so how do we become uh beneficiaries of being gathered when Christ comes again it's because we made an agreement with God through offering or through sacrifice but how why do we do this we don't do this in order to bribe God no we do this because he's the one who sacrificed himself for us first so the moment we appreciate and recognize that God gave himself for us out of what he did our hearts are touched and we are also motivated to give offering to sacrifice for his cause yes sacrifice is a a place where diseases or plagues become terminated or their terminated let me remind you of what David did which was against the will of God David took a sensor of all the Israelites and after doing the sensor a plague came and people were dying left and right what stopped the plague or the disease the Bible says David did something in the book of 2 Samuel chapter 24 verse 22 all through to 25 we are told what he did what did he do the Bible says and ARA said to David let my Lord the king take whatever seems right to him and make an offering of it see here are the oxen of the burnt offering and the grein cleaning instruments and the ox yolks for wood all these does the servant of my Lord the King give to the king and ARA said may the Lord your God be pleased with your sacrifice and the King said to ARA no but I'll give you a price for it I will not give to the Lord my God B offerings or sacrifice for which I have given nothing so David got the green Flor and The Oxen for 50 shekel of silver and there David put up an not to the Lord making bur offerings and peace offerings so the lord gave here to his prayer for the land and the decease came to an end in Israel know there are people who are sick and there is a disease or sickness that can come into the land and all what we need to do is what sacrifice give an offering a specific offering because of that and this is exactly what David did when there was a plague and the people are dying left and right first of all when he was offered what to give by ARA he said I cannot give any sacrifice out of nothing so he paid for it in another word sacrifice is something that you make feel you have done you have done it it's not like just giving anything and when he did it the Bible says the disease the plagues came to an end in Israel so sacrifice ing brings termination of illnesses or plagues I know you may not agree with me but uh if one we can be opened our eyes we can also notice and be happy and thank God that the covid-19 did not come to an end because of vaccin ations and the cures it came to an end because people sacrificed it came to an end because people cried to God Amen because when we sacrifice you know an offering is another way of offering not only prayer but saying now I'm not only praying but I recognize God you are able to do what I'm not able to do and therefore when we sacrifice God brings to an end what affects the society and that is why we are calling upon ourselves tomorrow to do a small sacrifice that can go far in bringing to an end the plague or the sufferings of the drug addict the alcoholics we all know more than 3 million people dies yearly in the world because of alcohol not to to name the millions who dies because of drugs unless as a church as a people of God do a sacrifice this Menace will continue and I know we are where all of us if we are not affected directly we are affected in directly there is no home there is no family if it is not affected direct it is not affected indirectly and therefore we need to make a sacrifice David made a sacrifice and that brought to an end the plague we can also make a sacrifice and help these people why are we doing it because as much as there are so many places of that nature we as a church can do it in a special way in a unique way that is not done out there personally I'm a counselor and I take many people to those centers but uh the relapsing percentage is usually very high and I have been doing my own study to know why do people go finish even three months they come back and after a month or three months they get back to alcohol they get back to drugs and all these and I came to discover it's because of one missing element the most important and what is this element element the spiritual element the spiritual what you see no matter how much we detox people how much we talk to them about these things how much they are given drugs to stop these things without a divine intervention some things are not easy to quit am I speaking to somebody so the div element is very important when it comes to rehabilitating to restoring these people and this is the vision we have as a church a place where people will not only be restored mentally and physically and be detached from this addiction but a place where people will be restored even spiritually because it is through con connection with God we are able to quit all manner of addictions number four a sacrifice is a place of Supernatural turnaround when we sacrifice there are things which happen which could not happen and this reminds me of Elijah and the lady of the sarap sarapath and we all know this story it was a time of drought of famine and there was no food but Elijah comes to this lady and this lady had only one meal left and he she told if I do something with this we will just eat and whatever is remaining will eat and then die but Elijah told the lady you go ahead and make the bread for me hello go ahead and make what the bread the Bible says and Elijah said to her have no fear go and do as you have seen said but first make me a little cake of it and come and give it to me and then make something for yourself and your son yes what you have is enough for you to eat and die don't fear hello don't what when you are making a special sacrifice don't fear don't do what Elijah told this lady don't fear have no fear go and do it but you bring the cake the first one to me I eat then you do the other and you eat with your son for this is the word of the Lord the god of Israel the store of meal will not come to an end and the bottle will never be without oil till the day when the Lord sends rain on the earth so she went and did as Elijah said and she and he and her family had food for a long time the store of meal did not come to an end and the bottle was never without oil as the Elijah had said by the mouth as the Lord had said by the mouth of Elijah amen are you getting this do not fear to sacrifice do not fear to do what it is the beginning of Supernatural turnaround in your life for this lady because she did she not fear and she did what the man of God said the Bible says after they had eaten there was enough FL and enough oil till the famine was over so there are things which God will do and uh bring a turnaround in your life when you sacrifice number five it is the altar of God talking to us after Solomon sacrificed when he became a king God talked to him and asked him what do you want so the moment you sacrifice and you do it the way God wants the Bible says God can come and talk to you after Solomon sacrificed God talked to him and asked him what do you want and therefore the way God appeared to Solomon and talked to him and asked him what he wanted God speaks to us when we sacrifice but let me ask a question again when do we sacrifice three scenarios of when we sacrifice number one whenever things look tight are you in a fix you don't know what to do and things are so difficult that is a time to remind God you have made a sacrifice for me through your son and because of your sacrifice I will now sacrifice give so that you can do something of the situation that I am in and every time you find yourself in a tight Corner things are not working sacrifice and God will turn around whatever is there and this is what the sarapath lady or woman did by giving all that she had should have told Elijah no you are too selfish why should I give you if I you know do an economy maybe we can eat for two what but here you are you are telling me to give you number two we do so when God instruct us to do so we sacrifice when God has instructed remember the story of Abraham God told him take your only son and go and offer him as a a sacrifice God had spoken and because Abraham was a man of Faith or yes the father of Faith he never argued with God he took his only son and as they were walking and going to mount Maria the son would ask him father we have the firewood but we don't have the lamb for sacrifice and the father will say by faith the Lord will the Lord will provide so when God says sacrifice even if it is the most precious thing you have do it and I want to believe the Lord is talking to his chch church not only in central Kenya conference but in the whole Union because tomorrow it's not just a function of CKC it is a function of East Kenya Union conference all the fields all the conferences of the union and all the institutions of the Union will be there to make a sacrifice why because God has spoken that it is a time we have a place of our own where we can take our sons our daughters our fathers and even our relatives who are affected and when God speaks the best thing we can do like Abraham is to do it and if you are not having be sure to speak like Abraham the Lord will Hallelujah the Lord will provide so when God speaks even if you don't have believe like Abraham that the Lord will do what will provide yes we sacrifice when we are delighted to do so when God made Solomon King Solomon was very happy and out of his Joy he was delighted and he sacrificed and I usually see this happening many times I want to thank God for many of you when God has brought an occasion to celebrate we always give thanks that is why you call Pastor to say Pastor come and pray with me my son has gotten an admission to go to UK don't you do that do you usually give an offering for that I know you do it so when we are happy again those are moments to do what to sacrifice when God does something for you that makes your hearts to be joyful again that is the time to thank God and sacrifice Hallelujah Church yes then how then do we make this sacrifice or how do we sacrifice it's very simple but also not very simple we don't begin with things that is where we go wrong when we talk of sacrifice sacrifice is not about money cows like the way the Israelites used to do first no it's not about those things sacrifice it's about you and you alone Romans 121 says for this reason I make request to you other translation says I beseech you brothers and sisters by the mercies of God that you will give your bodies as a Living Sacrifice holy pleasing to God which is the worship and which is worship it is right for you to give him so when it comes to sacrifice what comes first is to present our bodies as a living what now you'll ask me why should we present our bodies as a living what sacrifice because God also gave himself he came in human flesh and he surrendered himself and therefore he wants us to surrender to present our bodies as a Living Sacrifice so that we can be moved from the bodies which are used to selfishness and all that and become what God wants us to be budhist or human beings who understands giving because God gave first and Paul says we do this give our bodies as a Living Sacrifice holy acceptable to God which is our spiritual worship and the moment we have done that then we go further and now I explain this what it all means it means the surrender of our spirits to become the dwelling place of the Holy Spirit through who God sacri I his son for us this will do away with a selfish spirit in us and therefore we are able now to give sacrificially this also means Allowing God to create a new heart in us where Christ will dwell the ultimate sacrifice to do a away with a selfish heart cu the Bible says the natural heart is selfish and the only way it can be done away is when we offer ourselves as a Living Sacrifice and the moment we do that the our hearts becomes the dwelling place of Christ and as he dwells in us he does away with selfishness and we become generous oh yes this means experiencing the transformation of our minds where the word of the Lord will now dwell making it possible for us to sacrifice painfully knowing that there is Joy at the end of it why should our minds be transformed because the canal mind is en enity to God it cannot obey God it cannot hear the voice of God that is why Paul will say now in Romans 12:2 do not or don't be conformed to this world but be transformed by the renewing of your mind so that you may prove what is a good well pleasing and and perfect will of God so as we give ourselves as a Living Sacrifice to God we are lifted from the Conformity of this world and we are transformed by the renewing of our mind so that we are able to prove what is good well pleasing and the perfect will of God and at that level we are able to give now the material things if you have not surrendered yourself as a Living Sacrifice note this even if you give as much you give it will not bring benefits to you God is not interested with what we have first God is interested with us first Hallelujah church he is interested with you and me first because what we give cannot make us to go to heaven but when we give ourselves to him he transforms our mind he creates in us a CLE a new heart and his Spirit draws in us we automatically become candidates of Heaven that is why he needs you and me first second we make the sacrifice out of love the Bible says for God so loved the world that he gave we tap on that love and as we tap on that love then we give out of love again in this giving number three we should not be pushed we do it willingly Abraham took his son and went with him willingly but it was not easy sacrifice has never been easy it was painful but he said so long as the Lord has said I will do it yes we give in worship of God giving is also another way of worshiping God but we also give expectantly in the book of Hebrews allow me to read this chapter 11 verse 17 and 18 the Bible says by faith Abraham being tested offered up up Isaac yes he who had gladly received the promises was offering up his one and only son Verse 18 even He To whom it was said in Isaac your seed Shall be Called accounting verse 19 accounting that God is able to raise up even from the dead figuratively speaking he also did receive him back from the dead you do it expecting Abraham did it expecting that Isaac will be alive again hello expecting the blessing so in another word as we give sacrificially let us do it expecting that God will fulfill his promise upon us and what has he promised he has said if you give sacrificially you make a covenant with me an agreement with me in giving I will surely bless you he blessed he blessed Abraham with a sacrifice he blessed the sarapath lady with the food all those years and he cannot fail to bless each one of us God sacrificed his only begotten son for the world for you and for me so that whoever believes in him will not perish but have everlasting life the almighty father sacrificed his best to reconcile the world to himself and today multitudes and multitudes are returning back to him they are sacrificing they are doing all they can for him therefore in conclusion sacrifice may be the answer to the challenge you are facing today there are numerous testimonies that emanated from the altar of sacrifice nobody gives an acceptable sacrifice and Remains the Same act on this truth share and do it and your life will never be the same when God gave His only begotten son our lives are never the same and therefore when we sacrifice for his cause our lives will never be the same it is my prayer this morning or this yes this morning that our God in heaven will motivate us will urge each one of us to sacrifice for this cause to the glory and honor of his name how many say God help me to sacrifice because you also sacrificed for me gracious and loving father we thank you so much because you sacrificed the best you have spoken to us may we also do the same for this cause which will rehabilitate people who are hopeless yes break the yolks of these who are yoked by the evil one so that together with us they can also become beneficiaries of this eternal life and when you come all of them and many of them who be helped through these programs will become hairs of your kingdom together with us bless us to this end for we pray in Jesus name amen

TIMESTAMPED TRANSCRIPT:
[0.2s] the Lord is
[1.6s] good and all the
[5.2s] time I want to thank God for his
[8.8s] blessings the week that was and also for
[13.4s] the blessing of the rest of the
[15.9s] Sabbath the benefits of
[20.6s] sacrifice we are here
[23.4s] because we are beneficiaries of the
[26.4s] greatest sacrifice that has ever been
[30.9s] made God giving himself to die for our
[37.4s] sins sacrifice is not easy to engage in
[43.4s] yet it is the key that unlocks many
[47.5s] gates to deliverance and even
[51.3s] blessings it is one of the secrets of
[55.0s] Supernatural
[56.8s] breakthroughs may I now by the grace of
[59.5s] God
[61.0s] call upon us to explore the power of the
[64.4s] blessing when we sacrifice or when we
[67.8s] give
[70.2s] sacrificially the text which was read
[72.9s] the two verses Psalms 1265 and6 I repeat
[77.9s] says Those Who s in tears shall reap in
[84.2s] joy and he who continually goes for the
[88.7s] Weeping be bearing seed for sewing shall
[92.4s] doubtless come again with rejoicing
[96.1s] bringing his sheaves with
[98.9s] him
[100.4s] sacrifice is done in tears and in pain
[105.2s] but the person engaging in it reaps in
[108.3s] joy and
[110.0s] bountifully the returns are normally
[113.0s] fearful because they are beyond what can
[116.4s] be explained by the human language
[120.0s] it is God's ordained gateway to a new
[123.2s] dwn glorious beginnings and series of
[128.4s] breakthroughs and this reminds me of our
[132.3s] first Union Mega fundraiser which
[136.6s] happened last year but one we all came
[140.8s] and we want to thank each one of you for
[143.4s] the sacrifice and what you
[147.2s] gave in that fundraiser we were are
[150.3s] targeting to raise 40 million so that
[153.4s] some can go to the rehab you are able to
[157.0s] raise 23 million and because of
[161.0s] sacrificing as a conference for the
[163.3s] lital we get we were able to acquire
[168.0s] what we wanted to acquire a city scan
[171.2s] for the Nairobi Adventist Hospital and
[175.4s] later through sacrifice we have been
[178.5s] able to equip the Hospital fully with
[181.0s] other equipment and as we speak we have
[185.2s] the best lab around there and uh
[189.3s] hospitals even send their specimen to us
[193.1s] and that is why we are calling upon each
[196.3s] one of us once again to sacrifice for
[201.4s] the second project which we are having
[204.6s] the fundraiser tomorrow now what is
[208.4s] sacrifice it is is giving out things
[212.4s] that are precious and valuable to us it
[217.2s] talks about the cost and not
[220.9s] volume the quality and not quantity of
[225.2s] what we are giving
[227.7s] furthermore sacrifice is parting away
[231.7s] with our Goods with whipping the process
[235.2s] is painful as we shall see but gainful
[240.1s] at the end you
[242.9s] remember the story of Jesus in Luke
[246.9s] 2313 the Bible says and he looked up and
[250.6s] saw the rich putting their gifts their
[254.0s] sacrifices into the
[256.0s] treasury and he saw also a certain poor
[260.1s] window putting in two mits so he
[265.0s] said truly I say to you this poor window
[270.7s] has put in more than all for all these
[276.6s] out of their abidance have put in
[280.1s] offerings or sacrifice for God but she
[285.4s] out of her poverty put in all the
[289.5s] livelihood livelihood that she had so
[293.8s] sacrifice is like putting all whatever
[298.0s] you had
[300.6s] now what are the benefits of
[304.0s] sacrifice there are a number of
[307.5s] them now begin with the first
[311.9s] one
[313.4s] sacrifice reverses
[317.8s] curses in the Book of Genesis 8 and
[322.5s] verse 20 and 21 the Bible says and Noah
[326.6s] made a not to the Lord and from every
[330.7s] clean beast and bird he made Burn
[333.8s] offerings on the altar or sacrifice and
[337.9s] when the sweet smell came up to the
[342.1s] Lord he said in his heart that is God I
[346.4s] will not again put a curse on the earth
[350.3s] because of man for the thoughts of
[354.0s] man's for the thoughts of man's heart
[356.6s] are evil from his earliest days never
[359.2s] again will I and destruction on a living
[362.5s] things as I have done so what made God
[367.8s] to say he will never destroy Mankind and
[371.4s] living things again it was
[374.7s] because Noah
[377.8s] sacrificed so sacrifice or
[381.6s] offering when we do it from the heart it
[386.5s] reverses curses Upon Our Lives we see
[391.2s] what God did when Noah gave an
[396.0s] offering number
[398.2s] two it is the auar of enactment
[402.3s] enactment of
[406.3s] Covenant during the last
[409.8s] days God or Christ will come and when he
[415.6s] comes he will not look just for anybody
[419.7s] he will look for people who through
[424.4s] sacrifice made Covenant with
[429.1s] him so and we get into this
[433.3s] Covenant by accepting the sacrifice
[437.8s] which God made for us in the Book of
[441.4s] Psalms 50 and verse 5 the Bible says let
[445.6s] my saints come together to
[448.1s] me those who have made an agreement with
[452.2s] me by
[454.0s] offerings you read other translations it
[457.5s] you
[458.4s] say it it says gather all my Saints who
[463.8s] made Covenant with me through sacrifice
[468.4s] so how do we become uh
[473.6s] beneficiaries of being gathered when
[476.5s] Christ comes again it's because we made
[481.4s] an agreement with God through offering
[485.4s] or through sacrifice but how why do we
[488.7s] do this we don't do this in order to
[493.2s] bribe God no we do this because he's the
[497.8s] one who sacrificed himself for us first
[502.7s] so the moment we appreciate and
[506.6s] recognize that God gave himself for us
[512.1s] out of what he did our hearts are
[516.6s] touched and we are also motivated to
[520.8s] give offering to sacrifice for his
[525.3s] cause
[526.8s] yes
[528.6s] sacrifice is a a place where diseases or
[535.7s] plagues become terminated or their
[540.1s] terminated let me remind you of what
[544.0s] David did which was against the will of
[546.8s] God David took a sensor of all the
[551.7s] Israelites and after doing the sensor a
[556.4s] plague came and people were dying left
[560.2s] and right what stopped the plague or the
[566.6s] disease the Bible says David did
[570.6s] something in the book of 2 Samuel
[574.0s] chapter
[575.0s] 24 verse 22 all through to 25 we are
[580.0s] told what he did what did he
[582.4s] do the Bible says and ARA said to David
[586.8s] let my Lord the king take whatever seems
[590.3s] right to him and make an offering of it
[593.9s] see here are the oxen of the burnt
[596.8s] offering and the grein cleaning
[599.6s] instruments and the ox yolks for wood
[603.1s] all these does the servant of my Lord
[606.3s] the King give to the king and ARA said
[609.5s] may the Lord your God be pleased with
[612.5s] your sacrifice and the King said to ARA
[616.7s] no but I'll give you a price for it I
[620.0s] will not give to the Lord my God B
[623.5s] offerings or sacrifice for which I have
[627.0s] given nothing so David
[629.9s] got the green Flor and The Oxen for 50
[634.0s] shekel of silver and there David put up
[637.6s] an not to the Lord making bur offerings
[640.8s] and peace offerings so the lord gave
[643.7s] here to his prayer for the land and the
[647.0s] decease came to an end in
[651.4s] Israel know there are people who are
[654.6s] sick and there is a disease or sickness
[659.0s] that can come into the land and all what
[662.6s] we need to do is what sacrifice give an
[668.1s] offering a specific offering because of
[672.5s] that and this is exactly what David did
[677.4s] when there was a plague and the people
[680.5s] are dying left and right first of all
[684.0s] when he was offered what to give by ARA
[687.1s] he said I cannot give any sacrifice out
[691.5s] of nothing so he paid for it in another
[694.6s] word sacrifice is something that you
[698.6s] make feel you have done you have done it
[702.3s] it's not like just giving
[705.5s] anything and when he did it the Bible
[709.8s] says the disease the plagues came to an
[715.0s] end in Israel so sacrifice ing brings
[721.4s] termination of illnesses or
[726.6s] plagues I know you may not agree with me
[731.7s] but uh if one we can be opened our eyes
[736.6s] we can also notice and be happy and
[740.1s] thank God that the
[744.0s] covid-19 did not come to an end because
[748.5s] of vaccin ations and the cures it came
[752.0s] to an end because people sacrificed it
[756.2s] came to an end because people cried to
[761.4s] God
[763.5s] Amen because when we sacrifice you know
[766.9s] an offering is another way of offering
[770.7s] not only prayer but saying now I'm not
[774.4s] only praying but I recognize God you are
[778.0s] able to do what I'm not able to do and
[781.6s] therefore when we sacrifice God brings
[785.8s] to an end what affects the society and
[790.5s] that is why we are calling upon
[794.1s] ourselves tomorrow to do a small
[798.4s] sacrifice that can go far in bringing to
[803.4s] an end the plague or the sufferings of
[807.4s] the drug addict the alcoholics we all
[810.7s] know more than 3 million people dies
[813.5s] yearly in the world because of alcohol
[816.4s] not to to name the millions who dies
[819.6s] because of drugs unless as a church as a
[823.5s] people of God do a sacrifice this Menace
[827.8s] will continue and I know we are where
[830.9s] all of us if we are not affected
[834.7s] directly we are affected in directly
[839.6s] there is no home there is no family if
[844.7s] it is not affected
[847.1s] direct it is not affected
[850.6s] indirectly and therefore we need to make
[853.7s] a
[854.7s] sacrifice David made a sacrifice and
[858.6s] that brought to an end the plague we can
[862.7s] also make a sacrifice and help these
[866.1s] people why are we doing it
[869.6s] because as much as there are so many
[873.9s] places of that nature we as a church can
[878.6s] do it in a special way in a unique way
[883.1s] that is not done out
[886.5s] there personally I'm a counselor and I
[889.5s] take many people to those centers but uh
[894.9s] the
[896.6s] relapsing percentage is usually very
[900.0s] high and I have been doing my own study
[904.2s] to know why do people go finish even
[908.4s] three months they come back and after a
[913.2s] month or three months they get back to
[915.6s] alcohol they get back to drugs and all
[918.3s] these and I came to discover it's
[921.4s] because of one missing
[924.4s] element the most important and what is
[928.3s] this element element the spiritual
[931.9s] element the spiritual what you see no
[936.3s] matter how much we detox people how much
[941.2s] we talk to them about these things how
[944.6s] much they are given drugs to stop these
[947.7s] things without a divine intervention
[952.2s] some things are not easy to
[955.6s] quit am I speaking to somebody so the
[958.7s] div
[959.4s] element is very important when it comes
[963.8s] to rehabilitating to restoring these
[966.7s] people and this is the vision we have as
[970.0s] a church a place where people will not
[973.8s] only be restored mentally and physically
[978.6s] and be detached from this addiction but
[981.7s] a place where people will be restored
[984.9s] even spiritually because it is through
[988.6s] con connection with God we are able to
[992.8s] quit all manner of
[997.4s] addictions number
[999.2s] four a sacrifice is a place of
[1003.3s] Supernatural
[1005.3s] turnaround when we sacrifice there are
[1008.7s] things which happen which could not
[1012.7s] happen and this reminds me of Elijah and
[1017.7s] the lady of the sarap
[1022.1s] sarapath and we all know this
[1026.6s] story it was a time of drought of famine
[1033.2s] and there was no food but Elijah comes
[1037.4s] to this lady and this lady had only one
[1043.6s] meal
[1045.8s] left and he she told
[1050.3s] if I do something with this we will just
[1054.7s] eat and whatever is remaining will eat
[1058.2s] and then die but Elijah told the lady
[1062.3s] you go ahead and make the bread for me
[1065.8s] hello go ahead and make what the bread
[1069.5s] the Bible says and Elijah said to her
[1073.7s] have no fear go and do as you have seen
[1078.9s] said but first make me a little cake of
[1081.8s] it and come and give it to me and then
[1085.4s] make something for yourself and your
[1088.7s] son yes what you have is enough for you
[1092.9s] to eat and die don't fear hello don't
[1098.6s] what when you are making a special
[1103.6s] sacrifice don't fear don't do
[1107.8s] what Elijah told this lady don't fear
[1112.4s] have no fear go and do it but you bring
[1115.6s] the cake the first one to me I eat then
[1119.1s] you do the other and you eat with your
[1120.9s] son for this is the word of the Lord the
[1123.8s] god of Israel the store of meal will not
[1127.7s] come to an end and the bottle will never
[1130.8s] be without oil till the day when the
[1133.7s] Lord sends rain on the earth so she went
[1138.0s] and did as Elijah said and
[1141.6s] she and he and her family had food for a
[1145.8s] long time the store of meal did not come
[1150.0s] to an end and the bottle was never
[1152.8s] without oil as the Elijah had said by
[1156.9s] the mouth as the Lord had said by the
[1159.6s] mouth of
[1162.7s] Elijah
[1164.6s] amen are you getting this do not fear to
[1169.0s] sacrifice do not fear to do what it is
[1174.0s] the beginning of
[1176.3s] Supernatural turnaround in your life for
[1180.2s] this lady because she did she not fear
[1185.8s] and she did what the man of God said the
[1191.6s] Bible says after they had eaten there
[1196.8s] was enough
[1199.3s] FL and enough oil till the famine was
[1205.3s] over so there are things which God will
[1209.5s] do and uh bring a turnaround in your
[1214.4s] life when you
[1221.3s] sacrifice number
[1223.4s] five it is the altar of God talking to
[1227.3s] us
[1231.3s] after Solomon
[1233.4s] sacrificed when he became a
[1236.0s] king God talked to him and asked him
[1240.7s] what do you want so the moment you
[1244.9s] sacrifice and you do it the way God
[1248.6s] wants the Bible says God can come and
[1253.1s] talk to you after Solomon
[1256.2s] sacrificed God talked to him
[1259.2s] and asked him what do you want and
[1262.5s] therefore the way God appeared to
[1264.8s] Solomon and talked to him and asked him
[1268.4s] what he wanted God speaks to us when we
[1275.1s] sacrifice but let me ask a question
[1278.3s] again when do we
[1282.1s] sacrifice three scenarios of when we
[1286.7s] sacrifice number one whenever things
[1290.4s] look tight are you in a fix you don't
[1295.7s] know what to do and things are so
[1300.1s] difficult that is a time to remind God
[1304.7s] you have made a sacrifice for me through
[1308.5s] your son and because of your sacrifice I
[1313.0s] will now sacrifice give so that you can
[1317.8s] do something
[1319.6s] of the situation that I am in and every
[1323.8s] time you find yourself in a tight Corner
[1327.0s] things are not working
[1330.0s] sacrifice and God will turn around
[1334.5s] whatever is there and this is what the
[1339.1s] sarapath lady or woman did by giving all
[1344.2s] that she had should have told Elijah no
[1347.4s] you are too selfish
[1349.2s] why should I give you if I you know do
[1353.3s] an economy maybe we can eat for two what
[1356.3s] but here you are you are telling me to
[1358.0s] give
[1359.0s] you number two we do so when God
[1364.1s] instruct us to do so we sacrifice when
[1368.5s] God has
[1369.8s] instructed remember the story of Abraham
[1373.6s] God told him take your only
[1376.3s] son and go and offer him as a a
[1380.6s] sacrifice God had spoken and because
[1384.6s] Abraham was a man of Faith or yes the
[1388.0s] father of Faith he never argued with God
[1393.1s] he took his only son and as they were
[1398.2s] walking and going to mount
[1401.0s] Maria the son would ask him
[1405.0s] father we have the firewood
[1409.4s] but we don't
[1411.3s] have the lamb for
[1414.0s] sacrifice and the father will say by
[1418.1s] faith the Lord will the Lord will
[1421.6s] provide so when God says
[1427.2s] sacrifice even if it is the most
[1430.2s] precious thing you
[1432.3s] have do it and I want to believe the
[1436.6s] Lord is talking to his chch church not
[1440.0s] only in central Kenya conference but in
[1443.2s] the whole Union because tomorrow it's
[1446.7s] not just a function of
[1449.2s] CKC it is a function of East Kenya Union
[1454.1s] conference all the fields all the
[1457.0s] conferences of the union and all the
[1459.9s] institutions of the Union will be there
[1463.4s] to make a sacrifice why because God has
[1468.0s] spoken
[1469.4s] that it is a time we have a place of our
[1472.9s] own where we can take our sons our
[1476.1s] daughters our fathers and even our
[1479.1s] relatives who are
[1481.0s] affected and when God
[1483.7s] speaks the best thing we can do like
[1486.7s] Abraham is to do it and if you are not
[1491.6s] having be sure to speak like Abraham the
[1495.6s] Lord
[1496.6s] will Hallelujah
[1499.2s] the Lord will provide so when God speaks
[1504.6s] even if you don't have believe like
[1507.7s] Abraham that the Lord will do what will
[1512.9s] provide yes we
[1516.0s] sacrifice when we are delighted to do so
[1521.5s] when God made Solomon King Solomon was
[1527.6s] very happy
[1528.9s] and out of his Joy he was delighted and
[1533.2s] he sacrificed and I usually see this
[1536.4s] happening many times I want to thank God
[1539.6s] for many of you when God has brought an
[1544.4s] occasion to celebrate we always give
[1547.7s] thanks that is why you call Pastor to
[1551.5s] say Pastor come and pray with me my son
[1554.6s] has gotten an admission to go to UK
[1557.5s] don't you do that
[1559.2s] do you usually give an offering for that
[1561.4s] I know you do it so when we are happy
[1565.3s] again those are moments to do what to
[1568.6s] sacrifice when God does something for
[1571.4s] you that makes your hearts to be joyful
[1575.6s] again that is the time to thank God and
[1579.3s] sacrifice Hallelujah Church yes then how
[1584.3s] then do we make this
[1589.0s] sacrifice or how do we
[1596.0s] sacrifice it's very simple but also not
[1599.7s] very
[1601.2s] simple we don't begin with
[1606.0s] things that is where we go wrong when we
[1609.2s] talk of
[1610.4s] sacrifice sacrifice is not about money
[1616.1s] cows like the way the Israelites used to
[1619.5s] do first no it's not about those things
[1624.5s] sacrifice it's about
[1628.6s] you and you
[1632.6s] alone Romans 121 says for this reason I
[1637.6s] make request to you other translation
[1640.2s] says I beseech you brothers and sisters
[1644.7s] by the mercies of God that you will give
[1648.7s] your bodies as a Living
[1652.6s] Sacrifice holy pleasing to God which is
[1657.2s] the
[1658.6s] worship and which is worship it is right
[1662.2s] for you to give him so when it comes to
[1667.6s] sacrifice what comes first is to present
[1673.2s] our bodies as a living
[1675.6s] what now you'll ask me why should we
[1680.5s] present our bodies as a living what
[1684.8s] sacrifice because God also gave himself
[1689.5s] he came in human flesh and he
[1692.7s] surrendered himself and therefore he
[1695.4s] wants us to surrender to present our
[1699.3s] bodies as a Living
[1702.8s] Sacrifice so that we can be moved
[1708.6s] from the
[1710.5s] bodies which are used to selfishness and
[1715.2s] all that and become what God wants us to
[1719.6s] be budhist or human beings who
[1724.2s] understands giving because God gave
[1728.5s] first and Paul says we do
[1733.7s] this give our bodies as a Living
[1736.6s] Sacrifice holy
[1738.7s] acceptable to God which is our spiritual
[1743.8s] worship and the moment we have done
[1748.9s] that then we go further and now I
[1753.4s] explain this what it all means it means
[1757.7s] the surrender of our spirits to become
[1762.3s] the dwelling place of the Holy Spirit
[1765.8s] through who God sacri I his son for us
[1770.8s] this will do away with a selfish spirit
[1775.7s] in us and therefore we are able now to
[1780.8s] give
[1782.3s] sacrificially this also means Allowing
[1786.1s] God to create a new heart in us where
[1791.7s] Christ will dwell the ultimate sacrifice
[1796.6s] to do a away with a selfish heart cu the
[1800.2s] Bible says the natural heart is selfish
[1804.8s] and the only way it can be done away is
[1808.4s] when we offer ourselves as a Living
[1811.8s] Sacrifice and the moment we do that the
[1816.0s] our hearts becomes the dwelling place of
[1820.0s] Christ and as he dwells in us he does
[1824.2s] away with selfishness and we become
[1828.7s] generous oh yes this means
[1833.0s] experiencing the
[1834.8s] transformation of our minds where the
[1838.3s] word of the Lord will now dwell making
[1841.4s] it possible for us to sacrifice
[1844.9s] painfully knowing that there is Joy at
[1849.0s] the end of it why should our minds be
[1854.0s] transformed because the canal mind
[1858.5s] is en enity to God it cannot obey God it
[1863.4s] cannot hear the voice of God that is why
[1867.0s] Paul will say now in Romans 12:2 do not
[1872.5s] or don't be conformed to this world but
[1876.3s] be transformed by the renewing of your
[1881.0s] mind so that you may prove what is a
[1884.7s] good well pleasing and and perfect will
[1889.1s] of God so as we give ourselves as a
[1893.6s] Living Sacrifice to God we are lifted
[1898.4s] from the Conformity of this world and we
[1902.2s] are transformed by the renewing of our
[1905.8s] mind so that we are able to prove what
[1909.1s] is good well pleasing and the perfect
[1912.4s] will of God and at that level we are
[1916.9s] able to give now the material
[1922.0s] things if you have not surrendered
[1925.4s] yourself as a Living Sacrifice note this
[1930.0s] even if you give as much you give it
[1933.4s] will not bring benefits to
[1936.1s] you God is not interested with what we
[1940.7s] have first God is interested with us
[1945.1s] first Hallelujah church he is interested
[1949.1s] with you and me first because what we
[1953.2s] give cannot make us to go to heaven but
[1957.1s] when we give ourselves to him he
[1960.1s] transforms our mind he creates in us a
[1963.9s] CLE a new heart and his Spirit draws in
[1967.3s] us we automatically become candidates of
[1971.4s] Heaven that is why he needs you and me
[1976.3s] first
[1978.5s] second we make the
[1981.6s] sacrifice out of love the Bible says for
[1986.9s] God so loved the world that he gave we
[1991.5s] tap on that love and as we tap on that
[1995.9s] love then we give out of
[2000.5s] love again in this giving number three
[2005.4s] we should not be pushed we do it
[2010.2s] willingly Abraham took his son and went
[2014.1s] with him willingly but it was not easy
[2018.8s] sacrifice has never been
[2021.2s] easy it was painful but he said so long
[2025.8s] as the Lord has said I will do it yes we
[2031.9s] give in worship of God giving is also
[2036.8s] another way
[2038.2s] of worshiping God but we also give
[2043.8s] expectantly in the book of Hebrews allow
[2047.4s] me to read this chapter
[2051.5s] 11 verse 17 and 18 the Bible
[2061.4s] says by
[2063.3s] faith Abraham being tested offered up up
[2068.8s] Isaac yes he who had gladly received the
[2074.1s] promises was offering up his one and
[2078.8s] only son Verse
[2081.4s] 18 even He To whom it was said in Isaac
[2087.4s] your
[2089.2s] seed Shall be Called accounting verse 19
[2094.6s] accounting that God is able to raise up
[2097.8s] even from the dead figuratively speaking
[2101.8s] he also did receive him back from the
[2106.4s] dead you do it expecting Abraham did it
[2112.4s] expecting that Isaac will be alive again
[2116.1s] hello expecting the blessing so in
[2119.8s] another word as we give
[2123.5s] sacrificially let us do it expecting
[2128.6s] that God will fulfill his promise upon
[2133.2s] us and what has he promised he has said
[2137.2s] if you give sacrificially you make a
[2141.1s] covenant with me an agreement with me in
[2145.8s] giving I will surely bless you he
[2149.8s] blessed he blessed Abraham with a
[2153.1s] sacrifice he blessed the sarapath lady
[2157.4s] with the food all those years and he
[2162.5s] cannot fail to bless each one of
[2167.1s] us God sacrificed his only begotten son
[2172.8s] for the world for you and for me so that
[2177.2s] whoever believes in him will not perish
[2180.9s] but have everlasting life the almighty
[2184.3s] father sacrificed his best to reconcile
[2188.8s] the world to himself and today
[2192.4s] multitudes and multitudes are returning
[2195.8s] back to him they are sacrificing they
[2198.6s] are doing all they can for him therefore
[2202.9s] in
[2203.8s] conclusion sacrifice may be the answer
[2207.8s] to the challenge you are facing today
[2211.2s] there are numerous testimonies that
[2214.2s] emanated from the altar of sacrifice
[2218.1s] nobody gives an acceptable sacrifice and
[2223.0s] Remains the
[2224.8s] Same
[2226.4s] act on this truth share and do it and
[2232.4s] your life will never be the same when
[2236.5s] God gave His only begotten son our lives
[2240.2s] are never the same and therefore when we
[2243.2s] sacrifice for his cause our lives will
[2247.1s] never
[2248.0s] be the same it is my prayer this morning
[2251.5s] or this yes this morning that our God in
[2256.2s] heaven will motivate us will urge each
[2260.4s] one of us to sacrifice for this cause to
[2265.0s] the glory and honor of his name how many
[2269.4s] say God help me to sacrifice because you
[2274.2s] also sacrificed for me
[2278.0s] gracious and loving father we thank you
[2282.0s] so much because you sacrificed the best
[2287.1s] you have spoken to
[2289.2s] us may we also do the same for this
[2293.6s] cause which will rehabilitate people who
[2297.2s] are
[2299.1s] hopeless
[2301.3s] yes break the yolks of these who are
[2306.5s] yoked by the evil one so that together
[2310.2s] with us they can also become
[2313.2s] beneficiaries of this eternal life and
[2315.6s] when you come all of them and many of
[2319.0s] them who be helped through these
[2322.9s] programs will become hairs of your
[2326.0s] kingdom together with us bless us to
[2328.8s] this end for we pray in Jesus name amen
