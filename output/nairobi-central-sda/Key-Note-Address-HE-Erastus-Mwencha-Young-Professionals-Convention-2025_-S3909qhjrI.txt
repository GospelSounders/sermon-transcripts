so happy to see you and uh um very humbled to be invited to come and share with this very uh energetic group and being a Sunday morning is a bit uh the weather is very nice and I hope that we'll warm up each other thank you for your kind remarks I am happy that you didn't uh try to uh crucify me I I I never like those moments um I was asked to speak about you know openly to share with you partly my life story but integrated with the current challenges that we see at the workplace the shifting uh you know workplace that we all face you can see the topic career and business shift in the 21st century navigating the new landscape I would try to weave through that the story so that I can bring out those elements in what I've seen as my own journey and I really don't know where to begin I I would like us to be very free with each other and uh be very flexible just feel free for this morning because I am here to share The Good the Bad and the Ugly and I I hope that at the end of the day you pick something from there avoid those mistakes but also take the ones that you may wish to take I must say I enjoyed the last session having been when he introduced me she by the way said career Diplomat I'm never career Diplomat by the way and I'll be saying something about that because then you will say how come you Your Excellence uh that is another story but I will say something about it I've never been a diplomat and so that somebody might a diplomat in the traditional sense I'm a diplomat by default and I'll explain that uh how many of you in this room are from the legal provision or aspiring to be lawyers how many are from the accounting provision all the branches of accounting I would say almost quarter of the room how many are from economics uh you know sector oh there's only one oh two okay three three okay and how many are from other professions like Engineers oh very many oh I'm happy to see that and uh doctors medicine oh thank you good to see oh thank you thank you to see that um and of you how many of you are married quite a number of you the reason I'm asking I'm trying to see how I can talk to each one of you particularly if you are going to get into you know your profession and career and and and also family how do you balance it so what I'm going to do a very quick overview of my journey and then at the end of it also touch do I have a pattern for changing or I I willax somebody will change it okay um and so I'll give you a quick overview of you know my academics and then professional journey and then of course now in corporate world as you heard I'm chairman Equity Bank and I hope I'll get one some of you also become uh equity alumin in one way or another I just open the room here there is one has been through Equity uh wings to fly anyone of you from Equity wings to fly oh there you are you can see a product from wings to fly from Equity I'm happy to see you I like to meet you at some stage and understand how that has transformed you [Music] um Can somebody guess my age I want you to relax yes how did you get to know that how did you know that you can somebody get my age how much 65 65 another one 77 how many of you think that I'm over 70 how many of you think I'm in the 60s majority of you think I'm in the 60s do I say the I cared take it yeah I will be 77 this year yeah I'll be 77 this year and so I want to start the journey because I started school before I'm sure even some of you your parents could even younger than me and I started school in the coronial area it was so difficult for me to start school in a family of nine and by the way I've done my manuals they are almost ready for printing and when it's ready I'll also share a copy here um my father was incarcerated by the colonial people and was at kicho as a tea worker I was forced as child labor to go and assist my uncle and and so I didn't start school on time I started school when I was 10 class in spite of the fact that I look old I started school when I was 10 and my first test of failure was in what we used to call common entrance exam competitive examination which was for standard 4 to standard 5 I sat for that examination in 1960 and I failed it was traumatizing for me because I had not prepared myself for that failure and so I was meant to go and repeat standard four and when I went to repeat in standard 4 my teacher was particularly harsh on me because there were very few people were repeating I met people had come from s three now I'm repeating so the teacher was very hard on me because we did an examination to graders either stream A or B we were about 70 80 and I was a number that would have pushed me to stream B and that offended the teacher the teacher was very hard on me but from there on that pressure changed me I don't know whether Pressure Works because thereafter my performance was much better and so on to the extent that when I was in standard 7 I start an examination which was for standard 8 I went from one with the people were in standard 8 which was also a challenge for me that was in 1964 the first time that they opened School uh for standard 7 to be with those who have come from standard 8 to be form one it was a most trying period for me in form one also but I caught up by the time when form three I caught up form four and all that I was now asking myself when I was in form three what do I want to do career some I wanted to be an agricultureal officer and I was told then the subject to look for I needed to do some chemistry maths geography and biology I focus on those but come when I did my form four examination the results from those subjects were not very good so I felt no I cannot go form five with this kind of grade I failed so but I had passed well enough I had a division two very near division one uh by Mark I said no let me go for art stream because that perhaps would be easier for me and so I changed course now the next thing then I said okay which other provis do I want to do I said let me be a lawyer and the reason why I chose to be a lawyer my brother was arrested kissy town for illegal connection of electricity and when he was taken to court growing up under colonial rule I feared policemen Mr mang I feared policeman I feared completely but I saw a lawyer challenging a policeman in court asking hard questions then I said ah this is this is a this is a this is job I want so I chose to be a lawyer but when I did my form for my form six examination the rules had changed that you had to have three principles to do law I had two so the university then now I wanted to look at the reason if you go to the next um I say here education zero option you can see all my options are being closed and now I'm getting depressed so I go to university and I want to enroll and ask myself which is career that I should do somebody tells me economics and then economics I realized I dropped my mathematics when I was in form three I hadn't done quite well although even form five was doing it form five and six had not done my economics so but I said that's now what I want so I went to enroll and the teacher said I your maths you did maths up to form four and there was a credit not the best of the credits we can't allow you in economics I said no allow me I'll get it and so I enrolled for mathematics and all the rest so at University I finished I had an honors degree in econom in economics to my surprise but I had worked hard very hard and so here I must stress the need for hard work at University I was really seriously working very hard I graduated with economics honors now I'm going to the world that time they used to come and recruit us I had a call from the minister of planning to go as an economist I had another one from Central Bank to join banking but I also had opportunity to join the Academia because I had passed very well now for some reason the head of Department didn't think that he could give me that space although I had a scholarship to go to us to train as uh an Academia for the class it's it was a Lo Foundation scholarship so when they denied I said let me go to government because from government i' go and do my postgraduate I joined government employed in the as an economist but then seconded the ministry of uh trade and Industry as as an economist but I was taken to the Department of Industry this is where my career started working because that exposed me to all industry in the country to understand the various sectors of Industry Agro Industries chemical Industries metal Metal Industries and I was working in a department which was sponsored by unido and I was placed to work under the department under the section of metal and Engineering an economist not well trained but my my trainer was an engineer so you put an Economist and engineer together to work together that was tough for me because I had to learn language I had to learn you know words and all things which I had never heard of and at that time we start negotiating with Americans to establish General Motors in Kenya and I have to sit in the table to hear to listen to what they saying about skd CKD Lea Springs some something I not learn I had to start learning fast forward I got the planning and I'm given a scholarship to go to the US I'm in Canada to do my postgraduate come back I'm now advancing in the career the government in Kenya that was now in the late 70s because I joined civil service in the early 70s government Kenya was doing very well wants to industrialize and one of the things then we are saying we need an iron and state industry in the country and so I was to be a team leader to undertake that study when I did it I realized that Kenya could not support that sector on it's own because the market first of all was so small didn't have all the factors of production for that uh for that uh plant for instance ion o was in Uganda was in Tanzania and the rest that then told me that here is not going to work so I needed to start looking of how can Kenya the industrialize at that same time the East African Community dies and negotiation start finish of establishing what is now commen but at that time it was known as PTA I'm growing career in the Civil Service and and I travel to Japan when I'm in Japan I meet somebody who tells me have you ever had of BTA I said yes have you applied for a job there like I did yes he says you will get it and I will get it can you imagine that gentleman was from macius we met in Japan and sure enough while we there we get letters of invitation to go for interview with the economic commission for Africa in AR AB Baba we went got the jobs and went to Zambia even resigning from government because now I'd become a director and being a director at that age I was already now about 3 36 I'm a director of industry and I'm now being given a position out of the country my friends came to me saying are you mad because the next position you're going to be a deputy permanent secretary and a permanent secretary why are youing the country but for me I have that ambition I want my country to industrialize there's conflict in my mind I say I'll go I don't even where I'm going the institution is new we arrived there we are six of us to start a new organization nobody has ever heard of it was very heart lifting I ended up when I left Kenya going there I said no let me go for 2 years if I don't like it I'll come back and continue my career fortunately the government released me on secondment arriving in Zambia and starting that job I now realized the heavy lifting of starting a new organization of course we built and started Comm I mean p started eventually that was transformed to be PTA I mean comma as I am growing I had gone to comma as a senior industrial expert but over time in about 10 years I had become director I was now number two in the the the organization and my Secretary General for some reason I'm really cutting it is removed because he was interested in politics unaware of what was happening I am asked by the Council of ministers that you act as Secretary General because I was now number two of course the gentleman who was asked to leave eventually became president of Malawi and so I step into that office unprepared not even you know trained for it feeling very vulnerable but that is perhaps the fortune I had because then I said I am going to my colleagues that we work together as a team so we developed a team um uh I'll I I'll P toown yeah we'll leave it there I I'll come back back to it so we developed that teamwork through some Grace developed a Teamwork because I was now open to learn how do you run an organization and with the team that we developed we started to make progress in many many areas some of the things which I mentioned before I get there let me step back and say when I left University what did I do and now when I was working in Nairobi when I walked out out of Comas I was not already baptized I was not baptized because I wanted to be baptized when I was around 14 years and the the the my my teacher failed me and you know the reason why they failed me I didn't go to work on this Farm because in those days you had to go and work on the farm and thereafter thereafter I I kind of say then now I'm not going to read and I I also like sports a lot so part of my youth I'm very active physically so I I kind of left without being baptized but when I was at University I had a cousin who had been who was an engineer who had been to New Zealand came back as one of the very first structure Engineers he was a member of this church for a long time called profess some of you probably would have parents who would know him and that attracted me to him and that is what brought me to Nairobi Central Church so when I left University when I left University the first place I started going to is this church we wish to worship there and and so I am a product of niri Central Church and so as I was now worshiping here and before I got my scholarship to go to Canada to do postgraduate the next one you need to get married especially when I was going to Canada I used my friends to look for me for my partner what am I saying here now Role Models do much please be a role model if not help somebody to be a role model so that is what helped me so when I got married as I was going to Canada I was only introduced because people were putting Under Pressure if you go to Canada to study and you are a bachelor you may not come back without having to marry from outside so marry before you go I couldn't get a lady ready to marry my wife was still in college at the medical school so I persuaded her that let start friendship when I'm in Canada we can married so I had to come for leave to come and marry now okay in the workplace I am now Secretary General comma and I am working by the way even when I became Secretary General commer it was miraculous for me I could see God's hand because I was not the most experienced except the fact that I'd been there grown up with the job I understood the job one of the things then I would advise you please try to be a child in your workplace an institution like comma I had to learn so many things about trade about industry about agriculture about transport so what I'm going to advise you is please be a child don't be a stickler to only one line and be very narrow I have seen this and the reason I'm still in this environment and I'll be talking about other things later on is you must always continue to improve yourself continue pursue education as a lifelong profession that you don't give up at any stage and so because at that experience I did well for the interview in spite of the fact that I was bre up against very stiff competition I was appointed Secretary General and while I was in commer Secretary General I served there for two times which is a maximum you are allowed as Secretary General and because of that position you are normally given a title because he a diplomatic position you are given a title of Excellence so I have now started to tell you why so I'm not a career Diplomat I grew into that by provis now having gone through that I was now about to leave comma because I done two terms and uh during that time I developed a very strong network of Secretary General like sadc the head of sadc was a good friend of mine East African Community Echo all those we knew each other our secretary generals so I go to Madagascar to say goodbye to the head of state and when I'm there he hosts a dinner for me and then when we're having dinner he asks me so that's when I was learning all I learned all these manners of How to Eat by the way while in Zambia one of the things which used to Humble me is when you would go for dinner for instance in State House with President C president c will serve all his guests he will not even allow the waiter to serve he's the one to give you a plate if it is a puet he Tau me humility and also he taught me about humanism so any I got to Madagascar to say goodbye head of state his advisor was a former executory of sadic somebody from macius and so we go for dinner and as we were seated for dinner he asks me you are living K you look young where are you going I say no I'm going home I go and maybe pursu now Academia and be in University lecture and write books he say no no no I've seen some jobs advertised that they you apply I say can I say no I said no let me go and look at it Your Excellence so I looked at it and I applied but I don't have resources to campaign government of Kenya was not supporting my candidature as such because they already had some other names people they wanted sponsor and you know these things happen and here I am but fortunately because of the network are developed in West Africa with echo in sadc with the sadic countries in East Africa when we go for elections in Adis and the vote is done by heads of state and government as you have seen this election I March the winner I saw God's hand again on three I saw God Hand in it and so I'm now deput chairperson by the way let me go back and say something because I said I would wave it as secret General in commer everybody knew I will not be working on Sabbath everybody knew and now there is a time when I had not been made acting I'm acting before I did interview to be made Secretary General I'm in church it's a Sabbath morning and I see my driver coming because normally I didn't allow him to take me to church on Sabbath I will drive on my own and so he comes and he comes to me and he says State House is calling you and then I see how come today Sabbath what is this now I started saying does the president know that I worship on Sabbath because I was acting he probably hasn't known me because I was not very senior so then I said do I go or do I not go I prayed I said look because I don't know why he's calling me let me go point of failure but then when I reach that house he calls me in private room he's just himself alone and I go in and he says Ah thank you for coming I say I'm sorry Mr President I'm a bit late I was in church then he looks at me and says then why did you come can you see this but I am grateful that he corrected me in a very nice way he says but why did you come I said I didn't know why you were calling me Mr President and I didn't want to refuse to come because I I I I thought it would have been very polite to refuse to come so anyway there after we shared a lot I mean and we became friends by sharing and thereafter we really would share much so here you are I go to this fast forward to add this when I reach Adis if you notice most of the Summits are taken on Saturday Sabbath and as a deputy person it's not going to be easy to have those meetings on Sabbath fortunately my my my my chairman my my my chairperson he was very flexible I said why don't we change this Amit to start on Sunday and the people in the room particular the commissioner we are 10 Commissioners they are usually we used to be 10 now they are eight commissioner the commissioner say yeah but if you don't want on Saturday you can't put it on Sunday also I said but you people have never had any problems you accept work on Sunday me it is something I can't do so you have your Serv without me but the chairperson then he says no no no let's listen to him and we know him so we can start our Summit on Sundays actually the Summits were changed they were starting on Sunday and I thank God because that was another miracle because I had already decided I would not be attending the open of the summit not only that the Christian Community in at saaba got to know that he is one of us not Adventist Church but the Christian Community they came to me and said look for since Au we have always had Muslims even now it's a Muslim who was elected last time we have hardly had Christians here and we need to start this place to have a place of worship I said what do you want we want to start a prayer breakfast I said they's start it so on during the summit today on Sunday we would host a prayer breakfast where we would invite the heads of state and government come for prayer breakfast then now we going into the summit that was not by Adventist by the way it was by non adven but use that occasion to bring in a few of Adventist speakers especially from the GC and others and so I also learned that you can take religion to the workplace and God can open doors where you didn't expect them to be opened so having said that let's now perhaps go to by the way at kesa one of the things that probably some of you don't know kesa that much uh one of the things that we did while working with the team kesa was the first to establish a free trade area I'm I'm sure you know that in 19 the year 2000 and we established very strong institutions like uh oh go back a bit go back yeah that one trade and Development Bank is very strong actually it's based in Nairobi it's very strong also in Bundi in macius with the balance sheet over over you know 10 billion uh the at uh Africa trade insurance and investment trade agency is an institution that offs Insurance one of the institution we started with the balance sheet over 3 billion plus and also Ze is also this one is headquarters if you go to Upper Hill you see and in a insurance company also very strong plus of course the DAT agreement plus many other things that uh really work the point I'm trying to make here is uh in the workplace one of the things I learned is teamwork I've talked about those values one by one and so I want to fill in a teamw workk my experience in coma because I was not ready to assume leadership I was vulnerable I allowed free thinking and because of that we made very good strides I would say more about that but I don't want to say more and so after having to leave if you go to Ecclesiastes 9:10 Ecclesiastes 9:10 if you read that it will tell you something that if indeed you work hard you can find yourself even serving Kings my exposure at AU was quite interesting especially because at the experience of comma I interacted with all sorts of leaders and one of of them I cannot forget is Gaddafi at one time we became friends and thereafter he never wanted to see me because he came with a very strong program of wanting a United States of Africa and the way he was trying to implement was not working and so I went to the Ambassador and says do you mind us sitting with with the leader to see to help him to see how we can implement this thing in a in eal way so he he invited me and we sat down on one by one after when we sat one by one I was telling him Mr pres you you used to be called brother leer I said brother leer there is another way we can do it he felt I was lighting him thereafter he was so offended in fact he kind of said look please leave me alone now but as I left I was actually worried that I hope he doesn't do something back to me when I I'm at the airport the chief of protocol comes and he says brother R sent a gift to you and what was the gift some camel milk and an envelope I didn't know what to do I said no but you see I cannot first of all I can't take a of milk and I can't accept this and I was with my people I said look this now that is that is a height of of really Temptation now the end I think I could tell is heavy I didn't even know I said I I I I I may I persuade you may I persuade you I I I cannot accept this and so even the people I was with I had two three of my uh chief of staff and the rest were astonished but I stood firm on that because I knew the moment I accept that envelope I am now cooked and so carrying a religion to your workplace carries with it some risks huge risks and from there on he never never never associated with me because that was around beginning of 2010 and by 2011 he had been killed you remember the the Arab Spring and so yes my journey I can tell you I have seen God's hand but one of the attributes that I wanted to also inra in myself first of all is hard work and Performing to the best of the abilities that God has given me and also being a team player I have always wanted and wished to continue to be a team player wherever I am now having said all this what challenges do you see now in your work yours may not follow mine it it may not be the same pathway but I'm going to tell you something about the the shifting and changing workplace can you yeah okay here these are six points which I want us to summarize with one Embrace learning you heard that at the moment in addition to what I do I'm chairman of a bank it has taken me quite some learning I mean to CH Bank you need to read a lot to understand there are so many things because you have to understand regulation under which the bank is regulated you have to understand how you grow the the balance sheet you have to understand the risks that you operate the market risk and all this those it requires learning technology so please never stop learning keep learning especially in your profession I know the people in medical they always want to go uh I have medical medicine my family please continue learning the moment you stop learning you are decaying the second one develop a growth mindset that you will always grow you will always grow if you don't have that mindset that you have arrived you think you have arrived where you are the next thing is Decay so always be curious always be curious and continue learning the third one on technology stay informed please stay informed I I hope how many of you now know how to use AI how many of us know how to use AI oh I'm so happy and I'm so humble to see you that is how it should be and how to apply I tell you for instance I give me just an example in the bank now banking has changed a lot just to give you a tip the old traditional way where you used to come and deposit go and borrow money is gone the bank now that you have because there are so many fex and all this is a bank not where you used to go to a bank you must wear a suit look nice look rich so that you can open an account but a bank that is customer Centric that wants to follow the the the the the the customer's lifestyle and work for you that when you open your app you can pay your electricity from there you can borrow you can go Insurance you can do whatever in other words the bank has changed and so when you employed if you are employed like in accounting department or you are in a cashier that front facing customers is going because the customers are now on the tech so you must be also follow where the customers are so please be up servy please be savy be savy and understand the sector very well the next one so that's on technology Venture into business if I was to take you a journey of when I started business in fact when I left University I took a small loan bought car but also bought land bought a house all over throughout I had that mindset I bought the property in 1984 I took alone that property I bet 1 million it was so difficult I don't want to tell you the value of that property now because you not believe it you not believe it so even when you start select Assets in a manner get somebody who can advise you so that you don't have one n track that you have to have your s you can start some business that you can do you can always have some group you work with that you work with business there's so many opportunities the moment you rely already on Saturday I don't know I can survive necess honestly I can't see how I can so I'm encouraged in you but maybe because have too many dependant and the rest so please be curious even as a church here I have been invited by sitam they have started investment clubs to go and Mentor them and ask to them you know work with them why don't we start here get likeminded and start that kind of thing the world we live in now when you are in a business in a workplace how are decisions taken these days you know I'll tell you this for instance if you look at the reports when we go to the board I can hardly see a sentence because I'll tell you if it cannot be measured it cannot be done data you bring me data data it is data that now operates in the business world this is part of the shifting that is done that business is now data driven as you are here this to me a gold mine because if I capture all your data your phone numbers this is something that I can use profitably because I'll get to know your consumer habits I will know where you visit what you buy and send you those products next to you that is that's how that that is now even the banking has improved because the bank must try to know what you buy and how to follow you as a customer and then finally oh there is still missing customer Centric in a business place now where you work it is the customer that calls the tune that is what is changing you can see a lot of changes that are happening whether you talking of data people are now talking of data protection what have you because they know that your data Ser is value and so this is now the changing place but there are also other changes which I don't think we can have time to talk about all through I I think she talked about it oh there's somebody who talked it earli on I think you did when you are mentioning how the workplace has changed now you can work flexible hours you have competition Global competition because now a workplace has changed the 8 to 500 p.m. kind of place where we used to work in government in those days people would go and leave a jacket on the desk go for business cheating that they are around is gone you can work from home you don't have to go and leave a jacket on your chair you can work from home Flex hours and all this a workplace is changing can you find some of those things which you can also do and can you see how you can digitize your sector even if it is medicine is now digital it's going digital in a big way legal now you can even submit your submissions online and the rest and it is going to change because they are saying technology we are on at the beginning of what is going to continue to change so in short I think I am so happy to be able to meet with you as you many of you are deep into your career please be anxious in your career uh there are there are Bible texts which I would have given you but I think we have gone over time for instance read from Colossians 39 and 10 I think think whatever you find to do do it with all your might as if that's the last job you have that is important because when you are faithful the rewards will come in their own way and recognition will come without you having to go and prompt it people will recognize that you are an asset in an organization because these days now there are metrics that you can use even if you are working from home people can know that this is a productive person carry the name of God with you in that case that people you will testify wherever you are that you are truly one that has changed the place that is known to produce that is known to be standing out she was talking of what will separate you I sometimes sit in interviews and you listen to people coming to look for a job what they tell you an employer is not here for charity an employer is there to for you to add value when you are going for the interview first of all ask yourself what can I do in this organization to make a difference to improve the bottom line don't go there and say ah me I've got good certificate I'm qualified here I've done this job so what but you tell me what are you going to do for me that will change my profit L profitable so do your background test in addition to etiquet you must try to show that you have added value so that when you live an organization you can live a legacy you can walk tall there are so many things one could talk about particularly on issues of legacy and so let's I thank God that many of you especially when you you all indicated that you you are AI savy uh I'm sure you know what that the implications are but also the opportunities that come with it and so keep your eyes antennas open know the world is changing but you have an opportunity to make a difference in the society and may God so richly bless you I don't know whether we have time to ask a question or one or more so the first question I'm I'm scared of asking but I'll still ask it it says to Elder mcha how do you get to be humble despite a very rich profile I don't know I can answer you me it is relative it's relative um to me I mean if you you think that you you you may probably would see that somebody has achieved more but for me I don't see it that way I still see as and finished and finished what work in progress I still continue to see myself work in progress and I I am accur pursuing a number of things uh both in career in business because having worked in government having worked in international organizations now I am in corporate I want to grow in the corporate so I'm just starting all right um I hope the person who's asked that question is satisfied I'd like to request Winnie onori to stand up Winnie is bold enough to shoot her short and and she's requesting whether you can be her mentor to do that if any of you want I'll be happy because that is my privilege that's my privilege we can even have a WhatsApp group where we meet once in a month or whatever and discuss because sharing is part of actually Our obligation as Christians it's obligation that we if you have a cup L year yeah I'll be happy all right uh please keep your questions rolling if you don't get time to answer them now I think he has mentioned about that opportunity to continue to interact and then the last one I have here is how can you make the marketplace a mission fied Yes actually I even at one stage joined as ASI do how many of you know about ASI um how many of you have been in this this church for more than uh 7 years 5 years how many of you how many of you would know he knows him that's my son he used to be a member in this church and um uh he and a few uh colleagues from this church by the way uh you know doctors particularly architect there is an architect in that group there is an engineer in that group all from this church by the way I've started a mission work in Mombasa in a place called qu and um there are two reasons that took them there first they want their children to grow in an environment that they can mold them because we now live in a very toxic environment those an area I would have wanted to talk as a grandparent I'm a grandparent of five um and so it's an area that you should also think through that you you can take religion in your workplace or take yourself to a place where you can evangelize your family but also evangelize yeah some of the mistakes have made um and those are failures I allowed my children to go to to us at very early stage and uh so they went there and started pursuing uh careers and I almost lost two I almost lost two because they went into their lifestyle in America but thank God makaka is one of them who came back and in that Awakening he then now decided that he has to secure his family and so they are in that place where they are growing country living but also evangelizing and also doing something useful so you can carry the mission or in your workplace the way you worship the way you carry yourself the way you do things if you introduce it I give an example for instance hey you introduced to worship and everybody knew that if it's on Sabbath they will not come for me and the same thing even in comma I give you an example of that failure that I went to see a president on a Sabbath and he was admonishing me saying look but why do you have to come now from there on I started to to understand that that humility I was trying to say let me be polite was not necessary he would have still found out why I haven't come he would still have found out because it's so easy for him to say I called him where have you not come I'll come I'll send a message that I was in charge it will not matter but fortunately that became a mission that day because I learned also his needs and that's how we became friends

[292.1s] um Can somebody guess my age I want you
[295.7s] to relax yes
[300.5s] how did you get to know
[302.6s] that how did you know
[305.0s] that
[307.4s] you can somebody get my
[311.0s] age how much 65
[314.0s] 65 another
[318.4s] one
[320.9s] 77 how many of you think that I'm over
[324.4s] 70 how many of you think I'm in the
[327.6s] 60s majority of you think I'm in the
[331.0s] 60s do I say the I cared take
[337.3s] it
[339.2s] yeah I will be 77 this
[343.2s] year yeah I'll be 77 this year and so I
[347.2s] want to start the journey because I
[349.6s] started school before I'm sure even some
[352.4s] of you your parents could even younger
[354.2s] than
[355.9s] me and I started school in the coronial
[359.5s] area
[361.5s] it was so difficult for me to start
[363.6s] school in a family of
[366.4s] nine and by the way I've done my manuals
[369.5s] they are almost ready for printing and
[372.4s] when it's ready I'll also share a copy
[375.0s] here um my father was incarcerated by
[379.4s] the colonial people and was at kicho as
[382.4s] a tea worker I was forced as child labor
[386.8s] to go and assist my uncle and and so I
[390.4s] didn't start school on time I started
[393.1s] school when I was 10
[395.4s] class in spite of the fact that I look
[398.4s] old I started school when I was
[401.3s] 10 and my first test of
[406.6s] failure was in what we used to call
[409.7s] common entrance exam competitive
[412.4s] examination which was for standard 4 to
[414.6s] standard
[415.7s] 5 I sat for that examination in 1960 and
[419.8s] I
[420.9s] failed it was traumatizing for me
[424.8s] because I had
[427.2s] not prepared myself for that
[430.0s] failure and so I was meant to go and
[433.1s] repeat standard
[435.7s] four and when I went to repeat in
[438.0s] standard 4 my teacher was particularly
[441.4s] harsh on me
[443.9s] because there were very few people were
[446.4s] repeating I met people had come from s
[449.6s] three now I'm repeating so the teacher
[452.1s] was very hard on me because we did an
[455.9s] examination to
[457.7s] graders either stream A or B we were
[460.8s] about 70 80 and I was a number that
[465.0s] would have pushed me to stream
[467.0s] B and that offended the teacher the
[470.6s] teacher was very hard on me but from
[474.3s] there
[475.5s] on that pressure changed me
[479.9s] I don't know whether Pressure Works
[482.0s] because
[483.2s] thereafter my performance was much
[486.3s] better and so on to the
[489.9s] extent that when I was in standard 7 I
[492.5s] start an examination which was for
[494.1s] standard 8 I went from
[496.8s] one with the people were in standard 8
[499.9s] which was also a challenge for me that
[502.6s] was in 1964 the first time that they
[505.7s] opened
[507.3s] School uh for standard 7
[511.2s] to be with those who have come from
[513.3s] standard 8 to be form one it was a most
[516.4s] trying period for me in form one also
[519.8s] but I caught up by the time when form
[521.9s] three I caught up form four and all
[526.6s] that
[528.1s] I was now asking myself when I was in
[531.2s] form three what do I want to do
[534.6s] career some I wanted to be an
[536.8s] agricultureal
[538.0s] officer and I
[540.0s] was told then the subject to look for I
[542.2s] needed to do some chemistry maths
[545.2s] geography and biology I focus on those
[549.8s] but come when I did my form four
[553.4s] examination the results from those
[556.1s] subjects were not very
[557.7s] good so I felt no I cannot go form five
[563.0s] with this kind of grade I failed so but
[566.5s] I had passed well enough I had a
[569.4s] division two very near division
[572.6s] one uh by Mark I said no let me go for
[577.6s] art
[578.9s] stream because that perhaps would be
[581.4s] easier for me and so I changed
[585.6s] course now the next thing then I said
[588.3s] okay which other provis do I want to do
[591.2s] I said let me be a
[593.9s] lawyer and the reason why I chose to be
[596.5s] a lawyer my brother was arrested
[599.9s] kissy
[601.4s] town for illegal connection of
[606.2s] electricity
[608.5s] and when he was taken to court growing
[612.4s] up under colonial rule I feared
[615.1s] policemen Mr mang I feared policeman I
[619.3s] feared
[620.6s] completely but I saw a lawyer
[623.1s] challenging a policeman in court asking
[626.2s] hard
[627.2s] questions then I said ah this is this is
[629.5s] a this is a this is job I want so I
[632.9s] chose to be a lawyer but when I did my
[636.5s] form for my form six
[639.2s] examination the rules had changed that
[641.4s] you had to have three
[643.9s] principles to do
[646.3s] law I had
[648.3s] two so the university then now I wanted
[651.2s] to look at the reason if you go to the
[654.8s] next
[656.5s] um I say here education zero option you
[661.3s] can see all my options are being
[663.6s] closed and now I'm getting
[666.4s] depressed so I go to
[669.0s] university and I want to enroll and ask
[672.0s] myself which is career that I should do
[675.3s] somebody tells me
[676.8s] economics and then economics I realized
[679.4s] I dropped my mathematics when I was in
[682.8s] form three I hadn't done quite well
[684.8s] although even form five was doing it
[686.3s] form five and six had not done my
[688.4s] economics
[691.5s] so but I said that's now what I want so
[694.5s] I went to enroll and the teacher said I
[697.3s] your maths you did maths up to form four
[699.5s] and there was a credit not the best of
[701.8s] the credits we can't allow you in
[704.6s] economics I said no allow me I'll get
[707.6s] it and so I enrolled for mathematics and
[711.4s] all the rest so at University I finished
[715.6s] I had an honors degree in econom in
[718.8s] economics
[720.6s] to my
[721.8s] surprise but I had worked hard very
[725.4s] hard and so here I must stress the need
[729.2s] for hard
[730.4s] work at University I was really
[733.4s] seriously working very hard I graduated
[736.2s] with economics honors now I'm going to
[739.4s] the world that time they used to come
[741.2s] and recruit
[742.3s] us I had a call from the minister of
[746.5s] planning to go as an economist I had
[749.9s] another one from Central Bank to join
[752.4s] banking but I also had opportunity to
[756.7s] join the
[758.2s] Academia because I had passed very
[762.5s] well now for some reason the head of
[766.5s] Department didn't think that he could
[769.3s] give me that space although I had a
[771.4s] scholarship to go to
[773.8s] us to train as uh an Academia for the
[777.9s] class it's it was a Lo Foundation
[781.3s] scholarship so when they denied I said
[784.2s] let me go to government because from
[786.0s] government i' go and do my postgraduate
[789.7s] I joined government employed in the as
[792.9s] an economist but then seconded the
[795.0s] ministry of uh trade and
[798.8s] Industry as as an economist but I was
[802.1s] taken to the Department of Industry this
[804.8s] is where my career started
[807.3s] working because that exposed me to all
[810.9s] industry in the country to understand
[813.2s] the various sectors of Industry Agro
[816.1s] Industries chemical Industries metal
[818.8s] Metal Industries and I was working in a
[822.0s] department which was sponsored by
[824.3s] unido and I was placed to work under the
[827.4s] department under the section of metal
[829.7s] and Engineering an economist not well
[833.1s] trained but my my trainer was an
[837.2s] engineer so you put an Economist and
[839.6s] engineer together to work
[841.5s] together that was tough for me because I
[844.6s] had to learn language I had to
[847.4s] learn you know words and all things
[850.0s] which I had never heard of and at that
[852.4s] time we start
[854.4s] negotiating with Americans to establish
[857.0s] General Motors in Kenya and I have to
[859.9s] sit in the table to hear to listen to
[862.9s] what they saying about skd CKD Lea
[867.2s] Springs some something I not learn I had
[869.8s] to start
[873.2s] learning fast
[875.2s] forward I got the planning and I'm given
[877.8s] a scholarship to go to the US I'm in
[880.2s] Canada to do my postgraduate come back
[882.9s] I'm now advancing in the
[885.2s] career the government in Kenya that was
[888.9s] now in the late 70s because I joined
[891.2s] civil service in the early
[893.3s] 70s government Kenya was doing very well
[897.0s] wants to industrialize
[900.0s] and one of the things then we are saying
[901.9s] we
[902.6s] need an iron and state industry in the
[905.5s] country and so I was to be a team leader
[908.5s] to undertake that study when I did it I
[911.5s] realized that Kenya could not support
[914.1s] that sector on it's own because the
[916.7s] market first of all was so small didn't
[919.3s] have all the factors of production for
[921.6s] that uh for that uh
[925.5s] plant for instance ion o was in Uganda
[929.2s] was in Tanzania and the rest that then
[932.8s] told me that here is not going to work
[936.4s] so I needed to start looking of how can
[939.4s] Kenya the
[940.8s] industrialize at that same time the East
[943.3s] African Community
[945.0s] dies and negotiation start finish of
[950.7s] establishing what is now commen but at
[953.1s] that time it was known as PTA I'm
[955.5s] growing career in the Civil
[957.8s] Service and
[959.5s] and I travel to Japan when I'm in Japan
[963.4s] I meet somebody who tells me have you
[965.6s] ever had of BTA I said
[967.8s] yes have you applied for a job there
[970.2s] like I did yes he says you will get it
[973.4s] and I will get
[974.7s] it can you imagine that gentleman was
[978.1s] from macius we met in Japan and sure
[981.7s] enough while we there we get letters of
[984.1s] invitation to go for interview with the
[986.4s] economic commission for Africa in AR AB
[989.2s] Baba we went got the jobs and went to
[993.2s] Zambia even resigning from government
[995.8s] because now I'd become a director and
[998.2s] being a director at that age I was
[1000.8s] already now about
[1002.8s] 3 36 I'm a director of industry and I'm
[1007.5s] now being given a position out of the
[1009.7s] country my friends came to me saying are
[1012.2s] you
[1013.0s] mad because the next position you're
[1015.2s] going to be a deputy permanent secretary
[1016.9s] and a permanent secretary why are youing
[1019.2s] the country but for me I have that
[1022.5s] ambition I want my country to
[1025.2s] industrialize there's conflict in my
[1027.4s] mind I say I'll go I don't even where
[1030.0s] I'm going the institution is new we
[1033.1s] arrived there we are six of us to start
[1035.4s] a new organization nobody has ever heard
[1038.0s] of it was very heart
[1041.5s] lifting I ended up when I left
[1045.0s] Kenya going there I said no let me go
[1047.6s] for 2 years if I don't like it I'll come
[1050.4s] back and continue my career fortunately
[1052.4s] the government released me on
[1056.0s] secondment arriving in
[1058.4s] Zambia and starting that
[1061.9s] job I now realized the heavy lifting of
[1065.4s] starting a new
[1066.8s] organization of course we built and
[1069.4s] started Comm I mean p
[1073.0s] started eventually that was transformed
[1075.4s] to be PTA I mean comma
[1080.0s] as I am growing I had gone to comma as a
[1083.8s] senior industrial
[1086.3s] expert but over time in about 10 years I
[1091.6s] had become director I was now number two
[1094.4s] in the the the
[1096.4s] organization and my Secretary General
[1099.6s] for some reason I'm really cutting it
[1103.6s] is removed because he was interested in
[1106.7s] politics
[1110.2s] unaware of what was happening I am asked
[1115.6s] by the Council of ministers that you act
[1118.8s] as Secretary General because I was now
[1120.9s] number two of course the gentleman who
[1123.8s] was asked to leave eventually became
[1126.0s] president of
[1127.7s] Malawi and so I step into that office
[1132.1s] unprepared not even you know trained for
[1135.7s] it feeling very vulnerable
[1139.5s] but that is perhaps the fortune I had
[1143.3s] because then I said I am going to my
[1147.6s] colleagues that we work together as a
[1149.7s] team so we developed a
[1152.8s] team um
[1156.5s] uh
[1158.1s] I'll I I'll P toown
[1163.6s] yeah we'll leave it there I I'll come
[1166.1s] back back to it so we developed that
[1168.8s] teamwork through some Grace developed a
[1173.3s] Teamwork because I was now open to learn
[1176.9s] how do you run an
[1178.7s] organization and with the team that we
[1182.0s] developed we started to make progress in
[1185.6s] many many areas some of the things which
[1187.6s] I
[1188.9s] mentioned before I get there let me step
[1191.7s] back and
[1193.1s] say when I left University what did I
[1196.6s] do and now when I was working in Nairobi
[1199.2s] when I walked out out of Comas I was not
[1202.0s] already baptized I was not baptized
[1205.2s] because I wanted to be baptized when I
[1207.0s] was around 14
[1209.9s] years and the the the my my teacher
[1214.3s] failed
[1216.6s] me and you know the reason why they
[1218.8s] failed me I didn't go to work on this
[1222.5s] Farm because in those days you had to go
[1224.8s] and work on the farm and thereafter
[1227.2s] thereafter I I kind of say then now I'm
[1230.2s] not going to read and I I also like
[1233.0s] sports a lot so part of my youth I'm
[1235.8s] very active
[1237.6s] physically so I I kind of left without
[1242.1s] being baptized but when I was at
[1244.2s] University I had a
[1246.2s] cousin who had been who was an engineer
[1250.8s] who had been to New Zealand came back as
[1253.4s] one of the very first structure
[1254.8s] Engineers he was a member of this church
[1257.0s] for a long time called profess
[1259.6s] some of you probably would have parents
[1261.4s] who would know him and that attracted me
[1264.6s] to him and that is what brought me to
[1267.4s] Nairobi Central
[1268.8s] Church so when I left University when I
[1272.2s] left University the first place I
[1274.4s] started going to is this church we wish
[1277.2s] to worship
[1278.4s] there and and so I am a product of niri
[1281.6s] Central
[1283.2s] Church and so as I was now worshiping
[1286.7s] here
[1289.1s] and before I got my scholarship to go to
[1291.7s] Canada to do
[1292.9s] postgraduate the next one you need to
[1295.8s] get married especially when I was going
[1297.3s] to Canada I used my friends to look for
[1301.3s] me for my
[1302.7s] partner what am I saying here now Role
[1306.6s] Models do
[1308.6s] much please be a role model if
[1316.6s] not help somebody
[1319.4s] to be a role model so that is what
[1322.3s] helped me so when I got married as I was
[1325.6s] going to Canada I was only introduced
[1327.5s] because people were putting Under
[1328.6s] Pressure if you go to Canada to study
[1331.0s] and you are a bachelor you may not come
[1333.0s] back without having to marry from
[1335.6s] outside so marry before you go I
[1338.0s] couldn't get a lady ready to marry my
[1340.8s] wife was still in college at the medical
[1343.5s] school so I persuaded her that let start
[1346.1s] friendship when I'm in Canada we can
[1348.6s] married so I had to come for leave to
[1350.4s] come and marry now okay in the
[1354.7s] workplace I am now Secretary General
[1359.0s] comma and I am
[1363.0s] working by the way even when I became
[1365.3s] Secretary General commer it was
[1367.0s] miraculous for me I could see God's
[1370.5s] hand
[1373.4s] because I was not the most experienced
[1377.2s] except the fact that I'd been there
[1378.9s] grown up with the job I understood the
[1380.8s] job one of the things then I would
[1383.0s] advise
[1384.4s] you
[1386.5s] please try to be a child in your
[1389.0s] workplace an institution like comma I
[1392.4s] had to learn so many things about
[1394.7s] trade about industry about agriculture
[1398.7s] about transport so what I'm going to
[1401.6s] advise you is please be a
[1404.5s] child don't be a stickler
[1408.6s] to only one line and be very
[1412.5s] narrow I have seen this and the reason
[1415.8s] I'm
[1417.4s] still in this environment and I'll be
[1420.0s] talking about other things later on is
[1424.6s] you must always continue to improve
[1427.8s] yourself continue pursue education as a
[1433.3s] lifelong profession that you don't give
[1436.6s] up at any stage
[1439.0s] and
[1440.0s] so because at that experience I did well
[1444.3s] for the interview in spite of the fact
[1446.8s] that I was bre up against very stiff
[1451.1s] competition I was appointed Secretary
[1454.2s] General and while I was in commer
[1457.6s] Secretary General I served there for two
[1459.7s] times which is a maximum you are allowed
[1462.7s] as Secretary
[1464.0s] General and because of that position you
[1467.2s] are normally given a title
[1469.0s] because he a diplomatic position you are
[1471.6s] given a title of
[1473.7s] Excellence so I have now started to tell
[1476.1s] you why so I'm not a career Diplomat I
[1479.7s] grew into that by provis now having gone
[1483.9s] through
[1486.9s] that I was now about to leave comma
[1490.4s] because I done two
[1492.2s] terms and uh during that time I
[1495.1s] developed a very strong network of
[1497.7s] Secretary General like sadc the head of
[1500.1s] sadc was a good friend of mine East
[1503.0s] African Community Echo all those we knew
[1506.0s] each other our secretary
[1508.4s] generals so I go to Madagascar to say
[1512.3s] goodbye to the head of
[1514.7s] state and when I'm there he hosts a
[1518.2s] dinner for me and then when we're having
[1520.7s] dinner he asks me so that's when I was
[1523.1s] learning all I learned all these manners
[1525.3s] of How to Eat by the way while in Zambia
[1528.6s] one of the things which used to Humble
[1530.4s] me is when you would go for dinner for
[1532.8s] instance in State House with President C
[1536.4s] president c will serve all his
[1540.1s] guests he will not even
[1542.4s] allow the waiter to serve he's the one
[1545.4s] to give you a
[1547.3s] plate if it is a puet he Tau me
[1552.6s] humility and also he taught me about
[1556.8s] humanism so any I got to Madagascar to
[1559.5s] say goodbye head of state his advisor
[1562.9s] was a
[1564.4s] former executory of
[1567.3s] sadic somebody from macius and so we go
[1570.9s] for dinner and as we were seated for
[1572.3s] dinner he asks me you are living K you
[1575.3s] look young where are you going I say no
[1578.0s] I'm going home I go and maybe pursu now
[1580.5s] Academia and be in University lecture
[1583.1s] and write books he say no no no I've
[1586.7s] seen some jobs advertised that they you
[1591.5s] apply I say can I say no I said no let
[1595.8s] me go and look at it Your Excellence so
[1597.6s] I looked at it and I
[1601.0s] applied but I don't have resources to
[1606.0s] campaign government of Kenya was not
[1608.1s] supporting my candidature as
[1610.2s] such because they already had some other
[1613.5s] names people they wanted sponsor and you
[1615.4s] know these things happen and here I am
[1619.4s] but fortunately because of the network
[1621.8s] are developed in West Africa with echo
[1625.6s] in sadc with the sadic countries in East
[1628.7s] Africa when we go for elections in Adis
[1632.1s] and the vote is done by heads of state
[1633.9s] and government as you have seen this
[1635.6s] election I March the winner I saw God's
[1638.6s] hand
[1640.9s] again on three I saw God Hand in
[1644.8s] it and so I'm now deput chairperson
[1649.6s] by the way let me go back and say
[1651.2s] something because I said I would wave it
[1654.0s] as secret General in
[1655.8s] commer everybody knew I will not be
[1658.2s] working on Sabbath everybody
[1662.0s] knew and now there is a time when I had
[1666.3s] not been made acting I'm acting before I
[1670.0s] did interview to be made Secretary
[1672.0s] General I'm in
[1674.9s] church it's a Sabbath morning
[1678.3s] and I see my driver coming because
[1679.9s] normally I didn't allow him to take me
[1681.5s] to church on Sabbath I will drive on my
[1683.9s] own and so he
[1686.8s] comes and he comes to me and he
[1689.6s] says State House is calling
[1692.4s] you and then I see how come today
[1696.0s] Sabbath what is
[1697.9s] this now I started
[1701.2s] saying does the president know that I
[1703.6s] worship on
[1706.5s] Sabbath because I was acting he probably
[1708.8s] hasn't known me because I was not very
[1710.8s] senior so then I said do I go or do I
[1714.0s] not
[1715.4s] go I prayed I said look because I don't
[1718.5s] know why he's calling
[1719.9s] me let me
[1724.0s] go point of
[1728.0s] failure but then when I reach that house
[1730.4s] he calls me in private room he's just
[1733.1s] himself alone and I go in and he says Ah
[1738.9s] thank you for coming I say I'm sorry Mr
[1740.8s] President I'm a bit late I was in church
[1743.9s] then he looks at me and says then why
[1745.4s] did you
[1746.9s] come can you see
[1751.9s] this but I am
[1755.0s] grateful that he corrected me in a very
[1757.8s] nice way he says but why did you come I
[1760.2s] said I didn't know why you were calling
[1761.3s] me Mr President and I didn't want to
[1763.8s] refuse to
[1765.6s] come because
[1769.9s] I I I I thought it would have been very
[1771.7s] polite to refuse to come so
[1774.8s] anyway there after we shared a lot I
[1777.4s] mean and we became friends by
[1780.8s] sharing and thereafter we really would
[1783.4s] share much so here you are I go to this
[1787.7s] fast forward to add this when I reach
[1790.6s] Adis if you notice most of the Summits
[1792.7s] are taken on Saturday
[1794.9s] Sabbath and as a deputy person it's not
[1798.7s] going to be easy to have those meetings
[1801.3s] on
[1802.3s] Sabbath fortunately
[1804.8s] my my my my chairman my my my
[1809.9s] chairperson he was very flexible I said
[1812.8s] why don't we change this Amit to start
[1814.4s] on Sunday and the people in the room
[1817.3s] particular the commissioner we are 10
[1818.7s] Commissioners they are usually we used
[1820.8s] to be 10 now they are eight commissioner
[1823.2s] the commissioner say yeah but if you
[1824.8s] don't want on Saturday you can't put it
[1826.4s] on Sunday also I said but you people
[1829.2s] have never had any problems you accept
[1832.0s] work on Sunday me it is something I
[1834.9s] can't do so you have your Serv without
[1837.9s] me but the chairperson then he says no
[1840.4s] no no let's listen to him and we know
[1842.9s] him so we can start our Summit on
[1846.1s] Sundays actually the Summits were
[1848.4s] changed they were starting on
[1851.2s] Sunday and I thank God because that was
[1853.9s] another miracle because I had already
[1855.6s] decided I would not be attending the
[1857.7s] open of the
[1859.4s] summit not only
[1862.0s] that the Christian Community in at saaba
[1864.9s] got to know that he is one of us not
[1869.7s] Adventist Church but the Christian
[1871.8s] Community they came to me and said look
[1875.0s] for since Au we have always had
[1879.2s] Muslims even now it's a Muslim who was
[1881.4s] elected last time we have hardly had
[1884.8s] Christians here and we need to start
[1888.5s] this place to have a place of
[1890.5s] worship I said what do you want we want
[1893.5s] to start a prayer breakfast I said
[1896.1s] they's start it so on during the summit
[1899.4s] today on
[1900.5s] Sunday we would host a prayer breakfast
[1904.5s] where we would invite the heads of state
[1906.1s] and government come for prayer breakfast
[1908.6s] then now we going into the
[1910.8s] summit that was not by Adventist by the
[1913.6s] way it was by non adven
[1919.7s] but use that occasion to bring in a few
[1924.2s] of Adventist speakers especially from
[1927.1s] the GC and
[1928.7s] others and so I also learned that you
[1932.3s] can take religion to the
[1937.1s] workplace and God can open doors where
[1940.0s] you didn't expect them to be
[1942.5s] opened so having said that let's now
[1947.3s] perhaps
[1948.5s] go to by the way at kesa one of the
[1951.7s] things that probably some of you don't
[1953.6s] know kesa that
[1955.4s] much
[1957.0s] uh one of the things that we did while
[1959.9s] working with the team kesa was the first
[1962.5s] to establish a free trade area I'm I'm
[1966.0s] sure you know that in 19 the year 2000
[1970.0s] and we established very strong
[1972.1s] institutions like uh oh go back a bit go
[1976.9s] back yeah that one trade and Development
[1980.0s] Bank is very strong actually it's based
[1982.4s] in Nairobi it's very strong also in
[1985.8s] Bundi in
[1987.5s] macius with the balance sheet over
[1991.5s] over you know 10
[1994.0s] billion uh the at uh Africa trade
[1998.8s] insurance and investment trade agency is
[2002.7s] an institution that offs Insurance one
[2004.8s] of the institution we started with the
[2007.0s] balance sheet over 3 billion plus and
[2010.0s] also Ze is also this one is headquarters
[2012.6s] if you go to Upper Hill you see and in a
[2016.1s] insurance company also very strong plus
[2018.8s] of course the DAT agreement plus many
[2020.8s] other things that uh really
[2024.4s] work the point I'm trying to make here
[2026.8s] is uh in the workplace one of the things
[2030.1s] I
[2031.0s] learned is
[2034.3s] teamwork I've talked about those values
[2036.9s] one by one
[2038.5s] and so I want to fill in a teamw
[2041.9s] workk my experience in coma because I
[2045.0s] was not ready to assume leadership I was
[2049.6s] vulnerable I allowed free thinking and
[2054.2s] because of that we made very good
[2057.3s] strides I would say more about that but
[2059.7s] I don't want to say more and so after
[2062.4s] having to
[2063.9s] leave if you go to Ecclesiastes 9:10
[2069.5s] Ecclesiastes 9:10 if you read that it
[2072.6s] will tell
[2073.7s] you
[2075.4s] something that if
[2078.4s] indeed you work hard you can find
[2082.6s] yourself even serving
[2085.2s] Kings my exposure at AU was quite
[2089.0s] interesting especially because at the
[2091.0s] experience of comma I interacted with
[2095.0s] all sorts of leaders and one of of them
[2098.2s] I cannot forget is
[2100.3s] Gaddafi at one time we became friends
[2103.8s] and thereafter he never wanted to see
[2106.5s] me because he came with a very strong
[2109.6s] program of wanting a United States of
[2112.4s] Africa and the way he was trying to
[2114.5s] implement was not
[2116.2s] working and so I went to the Ambassador
[2118.8s] and says do you mind us sitting with
[2121.6s] with the leader to see to help him to
[2124.0s] see how we can implement this thing in a
[2126.6s] in eal way
[2128.4s] so he he invited me and we sat down on
[2132.6s] one by one after when we sat one by one
[2136.0s] I was telling him Mr pres you you used
[2139.8s] to be called brother leer I said brother
[2141.6s] leer there is another way we can do it
[2144.5s] he felt I was lighting
[2146.5s] him thereafter he was so
[2149.5s] offended in fact he kind of said look
[2155.7s] please leave me alone now
[2158.7s] but as I
[2160.6s] left I was actually worried that I hope
[2164.6s] he doesn't do something back to me when
[2167.4s] I I'm at the airport the chief of
[2169.9s] protocol comes and he
[2174.5s] says brother R sent a gift to
[2178.9s] you and what was the gift some camel
[2183.0s] milk and an
[2185.6s] envelope I didn't know what to do I said
[2188.1s] no but you see I cannot first of all I
[2191.1s] can't take a of milk and I can't accept
[2194.0s] this and I was with my people I said
[2197.0s] look this now that is that is a height
[2200.9s] of of really Temptation
[2203.6s] now the end I think I could tell is
[2207.2s] heavy I didn't even know I
[2209.3s] said I I I I I may I persuade you may I
[2214.0s] persuade you I I I cannot accept this
[2219.8s] and so even the people I was
[2222.3s] with I had two three of my uh chief of
[2226.9s] staff and the rest were
[2230.3s] astonished but I stood firm on that
[2233.3s] because I knew the moment I accept that
[2236.9s] envelope I am now
[2239.9s] cooked and so carrying a religion to
[2243.2s] your workplace carries with it some
[2246.6s] risks
[2248.5s] huge
[2250.4s] risks and from there
[2253.0s] on he never never never associated with
[2257.7s] me because that was around beginning of
[2261.1s] 2010 and by
[2263.7s] 2011 he had been killed you remember the
[2267.9s] the Arab
[2269.2s] Spring and so yes my journey I can tell
[2274.6s] you I have seen God's hand
[2280.0s] but one of the attributes that I wanted
[2283.2s] to also inra in myself first of all is
[2286.8s] hard
[2287.6s] work and Performing to the best of the
[2292.0s] abilities that God has given
[2294.0s] me and also being a team
[2298.1s] player I have always wanted and wished
[2301.2s] to continue to be a team player wherever
[2303.6s] I
[2304.4s] am now having said all this what
[2308.0s] challenges do you see now in your work
[2311.4s] yours may not follow mine it it may not
[2314.6s] be the same pathway but I'm going to
[2317.3s] tell you something about the the
[2319.9s] shifting and
[2321.5s] changing workplace can you yeah okay
[2326.8s] here these are six points which I want
[2329.5s] us to summarize with
[2333.3s] one Embrace learning
[2338.0s] you heard that at the moment in addition
[2340.9s] to what I do I'm chairman of a
[2344.0s] bank it has taken me quite some
[2348.0s] learning I mean to CH Bank you need to
[2351.1s] read a lot to understand there are so
[2353.6s] many things because you have to
[2355.0s] understand regulation under which the
[2356.9s] bank is regulated you have to understand
[2360.4s] how you grow the the balance sheet you
[2364.8s] have to understand the risks that you
[2366.4s] operate the market risk and all this
[2369.4s] those it requires learning
[2371.8s] technology so please never stop learning
[2376.1s] keep learning especially in your
[2378.4s] profession I know the people in medical
[2380.8s] they always want to go uh I have medical
[2384.7s] medicine my family please continue
[2388.2s] learning the moment you stop learning
[2391.5s] you are
[2393.0s] decaying the second
[2395.3s] one develop a growth
[2398.0s] mindset that you will always grow you
[2401.3s] will always
[2403.6s] grow if you don't have that mindset that
[2406.7s] you have
[2407.7s] arrived you think you have arrived where
[2410.0s] you are the next thing is Decay so
[2413.4s] always be
[2415.0s] curious always be curious and continue
[2417.7s] learning the third
[2419.4s] one on technology stay
[2423.2s] informed please stay informed
[2428.4s] I I hope how many of you now know how to
[2430.5s] use
[2431.7s] AI how many of us know how to use AI oh
[2434.6s] I'm so happy and I'm so humble to see
[2436.8s] you that is how it should be and how to
[2440.6s] apply I tell you for instance I give me
[2443.6s] just an example in the bank now banking
[2447.7s] has changed a lot just to give you a
[2450.7s] tip the old traditional way where you
[2453.2s] used to come and deposit go and borrow
[2455.2s] money is gone
[2458.2s] the bank now that you have because there
[2460.6s] are so many fex and all this is a bank
[2464.9s] not where you used to go to a bank you
[2466.5s] must wear a suit look nice look rich so
[2468.9s] that you can open an
[2470.3s] account but a bank that is customer
[2474.6s] Centric that wants to follow the the the
[2478.4s] the the the customer's lifestyle and
[2481.4s] work for you that when you open your app
[2485.2s] you can pay your electricity from there
[2486.9s] you can borrow you can go Insurance you
[2489.4s] can do whatever in other words the bank
[2492.9s] has changed and so when you employed if
[2496.1s] you are employed like in accounting
[2498.4s] department or you are in a
[2500.8s] cashier that front facing customers is
[2505.6s] going because the customers are now on
[2508.2s] the tech so you must be also follow
[2511.0s] where the customers are so
[2514.1s] please be up servy please be
[2518.6s] savy be savy and understand the sector
[2523.2s] very
[2524.2s] well the next one so that's on
[2526.6s] technology Venture into business if I
[2529.6s] was to take you a journey of when I
[2532.1s] started business in fact when I left
[2534.7s] University I took a small loan bought
[2539.0s] car but also bought land bought a house
[2543.1s] all over throughout I had that mindset
[2549.3s] I bought the property in
[2553.6s] 1984 I took
[2556.4s] alone that property I bet 1 million it
[2559.4s] was so
[2561.3s] difficult I don't want to tell you the
[2563.4s] value of that property now because you
[2566.1s] not believe it you not believe it so
[2570.1s] even when you start select Assets in a
[2573.8s] manner get somebody who can advise you
[2575.6s] so that you don't have one n track that
[2580.0s] you have to have your
[2582.1s] s you can start some business that you
[2587.2s] can
[2588.2s] do you can always have some group you
[2591.0s] work with that you work with business
[2594.0s] there's so many
[2595.7s] opportunities the moment you rely
[2598.0s] already on Saturday I don't know I can
[2600.8s] survive necess
[2603.1s] honestly I can't see how I can so I'm
[2606.8s] encouraged in you but maybe because have
[2609.2s] too many dependant and the rest so
[2613.5s] please be curious even as a church here
[2617.7s] I have been invited
[2619.8s] by
[2621.6s] sitam they have started investment
[2625.9s] clubs to go and Mentor them and ask to
[2629.6s] them you know work with them why don't
[2632.3s] we start here get likeminded and start
[2635.7s] that kind of thing
[2639.8s] the world we live in now when you are in
[2642.6s] a business in a
[2644.6s] workplace how are decisions taken these
[2647.8s] days you know I'll tell you this for
[2651.4s] instance if you look at the reports when
[2654.2s] we go to the
[2655.7s] board I can hardly see a
[2658.9s] sentence because I'll tell you if it
[2661.2s] cannot be measured it cannot be
[2663.6s] done
[2665.7s] data you bring me data
[2669.2s] data it is data that now operates in the
[2672.2s] business world this is part of the
[2674.4s] shifting that is done that business is
[2677.5s] now data driven as you are here this to
[2680.0s] me a gold mine because if I capture all
[2682.8s] your data your phone
[2685.2s] numbers this is something that I can use
[2689.0s] profitably because I'll get to know your
[2691.3s] consumer habits I will know where you
[2693.4s] visit what you buy and send you those
[2696.7s] products next to
[2697.9s] you that is that's how that that is now
[2701.7s] even the banking has improved because
[2703.2s] the bank must try to know what you buy
[2705.6s] and how to follow you as a
[2707.9s] customer and then finally oh there is
[2711.3s] still missing customer
[2714.4s] Centric in a business place now where
[2717.4s] you
[2718.6s] work it is the
[2721.6s] customer that calls the tune that is
[2725.0s] what is changing
[2727.2s] you can see a lot of changes that are
[2728.9s] happening whether you talking of data
[2732.0s] people are now talking of data
[2733.4s] protection what have you because they
[2735.4s] know that your data Ser is
[2738.6s] value and so this is now the changing
[2742.0s] place but there are also other changes
[2743.7s] which I don't think we can have time to
[2746.2s] talk about all
[2748.7s] through I I think she talked about it oh
[2751.4s] there's somebody who talked it earli on
[2752.8s] I think you did when you are mentioning
[2755.7s] how the workplace has changed now you
[2757.5s] can work flexible hours you have
[2759.9s] competition Global competition because
[2763.2s] now a workplace has
[2766.8s] changed the 8 to 500 p.m. kind of place
[2770.6s] where we used to work in government in
[2772.6s] those days people would go and leave a
[2774.2s] jacket on the desk go for business
[2777.0s] cheating that they are around is gone
[2781.0s] you can work from home you don't have to
[2782.4s] go and leave a jacket on your chair you
[2784.4s] can work from home Flex hours and all
[2786.5s] this a workplace is changing can you
[2789.8s] find some of those things which you can
[2793.1s] also do and can you see how you can
[2796.7s] digitize your sector even if it is
[2799.9s] medicine is now digital it's going
[2802.0s] digital in a big way legal now you can
[2805.4s] even submit your submissions online and
[2809.0s] the rest and it is going to change
[2810.9s] because they are saying technology we
[2812.8s] are on at the beginning of what is going
[2815.2s] to continue to change so in
[2819.2s] short I
[2821.6s] think I am so happy to be able to meet
[2824.7s] with you as you many of you are deep
[2827.2s] into your career
[2829.6s] please be anxious in your
[2833.4s] career uh there
[2835.6s] are there are Bible texts which I would
[2838.1s] have given you but I think we have gone
[2839.6s] over time for
[2842.6s] instance read from Colossians 39 and 10
[2846.6s] I think think whatever you find to do do
[2849.5s] it with all your might as if that's the
[2851.4s] last job you
[2853.2s] have that is important because when you
[2856.9s] are faithful the rewards will come in
[2860.0s] their own
[2862.4s] way and recognition will come without
[2865.4s] you having to go and prompt it people
[2868.6s] will
[2870.6s] recognize that you are an asset in an
[2874.5s] organization because these days now
[2877.7s] there are metrics that you can use even
[2880.0s] if you are working from home people can
[2882.0s] know that this is a productive
[2884.7s] person carry the name of God with you in
[2887.3s] that case that people you will testify
[2890.5s] wherever you are that you are truly one
[2893.7s] that has changed the place that is known
[2896.1s] to produce that is known to be standing
[2899.7s] out she was talking of what will
[2901.6s] separate you I sometimes sit in
[2904.2s] interviews and you listen to people
[2906.5s] coming to look for a job what they tell
[2908.6s] you an employer is not here for
[2911.7s] charity an employer is there to for you
[2916.2s] to add value when you are going for the
[2918.4s] interview first of all ask yourself what
[2921.5s] can I do in this organization to make a
[2924.6s] difference to improve the bottom line
[2926.8s] don't go there and say ah me I've got
[2929.1s] good certificate I'm qualified here I've
[2931.3s] done this job so what but you tell me
[2934.7s] what are you going to do for me that
[2936.2s] will change
[2938.0s] my profit L profitable so do your
[2941.8s] background test in addition to etiquet
[2945.1s] you must try to show that you have added
[2949.8s] value so that when you live an
[2951.8s] organization you can live a legacy you
[2954.3s] can walk tall there are so many things
[2957.0s] one could talk about particularly on
[2959.1s] issues of legacy and so
[2962.2s] let's I thank God that many of you
[2968.2s] especially when you you all indicated
[2970.3s] that you you are AI
[2974.7s] savy uh I'm sure you know what that the
[2978.1s] implications
[2980.1s] are but also the opportunities that come
[2984.0s] with
[2984.7s] it and
[2986.5s] so keep your eyes antennas open know the
[2991.2s] world is
[2993.3s] changing but you have
[2997.8s] an opportunity to make a difference in
[3000.2s] the
[3001.1s] society and may God so richly bless you
[3004.5s] I don't know whether we have time to ask
[3005.9s] a question or one or more so the first
[3008.3s] question I'm I'm scared of asking but
[3010.4s] I'll still ask
[3011.9s] it it says to Elder mcha how do you get
[3015.5s] to be humble despite a very rich profile
[3018.9s] I don't know I can answer you me it is
[3023.0s] relative it's relative um
[3028.0s] to me I mean if you you think that you
[3033.2s] you you may probably would see
[3036.1s] that somebody has achieved more but for
[3038.7s] me I don't see it that way I still see
[3042.0s] as and finished and finished what work
[3045.7s] in progress I still continue to see
[3048.1s] myself work in progress and I I am accur
[3051.5s] pursuing a number of things uh both in
[3055.6s] career in business because having worked
[3058.6s] in government having worked in
[3060.9s] international organizations now I am in
[3063.8s] corporate I want to grow in the
[3065.6s] corporate so I'm just
[3068.0s] starting all right um I hope the person
[3070.8s] who's asked that question is satisfied
[3073.3s] I'd like to request Winnie onori to
[3075.6s] stand
[3077.6s] up Winnie is bold enough to shoot her
[3080.9s] short and and she's requesting whether
[3083.8s] you can be her mentor
[3087.0s] to do
[3088.7s] that if any of you want I'll be happy
[3092.5s] because that is my
[3094.1s] privilege that's my privilege we can
[3096.4s] even have a WhatsApp group where we meet
[3099.1s] once in a month or whatever and discuss
[3103.7s] because sharing is part of actually Our
[3108.4s] obligation as
[3110.0s] Christians it's obligation that we if
[3112.8s] you have a cup L year yeah I'll be happy
[3117.2s] all right uh please keep your questions
[3119.4s] rolling if you don't get time to answer
[3121.6s] them now I think he has mentioned about
[3123.6s] that opportunity to continue to interact
[3126.6s] and then the last one I have here is how
[3129.3s] can you make the marketplace a mission
[3131.9s] fied
[3134.2s] Yes actually I even at one stage joined
[3137.9s] as ASI do how many of you know about
[3142.7s] ASI
[3144.5s] um how many of you have been in this
[3146.6s] this church for more than uh 7 years 5
[3151.0s] years how many of
[3152.6s] you how many of you would
[3157.1s] know he knows him that's my son he used
[3160.8s] to be a member in this
[3162.7s] church and
[3165.8s] um uh he and a few uh colleagues from
[3169.9s] this church by the
[3171.3s] way uh you know doctors particularly
[3177.2s] architect there is an architect in that
[3179.2s] group there is an engineer in that group
[3181.6s] all from this church by the way I've
[3184.1s] started a mission work in Mombasa in a
[3186.4s] place called
[3187.9s] qu and
[3191.0s] um there are two reasons that took them
[3193.5s] there first they want their children to
[3196.8s] grow in an
[3198.5s] environment that they can mold them
[3202.0s] because we now live in a very toxic
[3204.0s] environment those an area I would have
[3205.8s] wanted to talk as a grandparent I'm a
[3208.7s] grandparent of
[3210.3s] five um and so it's an area that you
[3214.2s] should also think
[3216.4s] through that you you can take religion
[3219.1s] in your workplace or take yourself to a
[3222.5s] place where you can evangelize your
[3225.1s] family but also evangelize yeah some of
[3228.8s] the mistakes have
[3230.4s] made um and those are
[3233.4s] failures I allowed my children to go to
[3236.5s] to us at very early
[3239.4s] stage and uh so they went there and
[3242.6s] started
[3244.1s] pursuing uh
[3246.8s] careers and I almost lost two I almost
[3250.2s] lost two because they went into their
[3253.2s] lifestyle in America but thank God
[3256.0s] makaka is one of them who came back and
[3259.2s] in that
[3260.3s] Awakening he then now decided that he
[3264.5s] has to secure his family
[3267.0s] and so they are in that place where they
[3268.6s] are growing country living but also
[3271.3s] evangelizing and also doing something
[3273.3s] useful so you can carry the mission or
[3276.8s] in your
[3277.9s] workplace the way you worship the way
[3280.3s] you carry yourself the way you do
[3283.1s] things if you introduce it I give an
[3286.4s] example for instance hey you introduced
[3288.1s] to worship and everybody knew that if
[3291.4s] it's on Sabbath they will not come for
[3294.5s] me and the same thing
[3297.0s] even in comma I give you an example of
[3299.0s] that failure that I went to see a
[3301.3s] president on a Sabbath and he was
[3304.2s] admonishing me saying look but why do
[3306.0s] you have to
[3307.3s] come now from there on I started to to
[3310.5s] understand
[3313.9s] that that humility I was trying to say
[3316.9s] let me be
[3318.1s] polite was not necessary he would have
[3320.4s] still found out why I haven't come he
[3323.0s] would still have found out because it's
[3325.0s] so easy for him to say I called him
[3326.9s] where have you not come I'll come I'll
[3329.7s] send a message that I was in charge it
[3331.8s] will not matter but
[3333.8s] fortunately that became a mission that
[3336.7s] day because I learned also his needs and
[3340.9s] that's how we became friends
