FULL TRANSCRIPT:
and good morning and happy Sabbath Saints God is good and all the time yes yes yes ah it's a blessing and a privilege to be in the house of the Lord this morning I thought that the church is going to be a bit empty because part of the big team is on the other side of uh Fountain of vraa I think our youth Department I'm amazed that the church is so full again today now greetings from Fountain of Hope Sabbath School raka and uh you're very much welcome God is so faithful we're doing fine God's work is doing well and the Church of God is growing Hallelujah now if you're in the hood please pay a visit yeah you in the neighborhood please just just check out on us one of the sabbaths and uh it shall be a blessing this is a special Sabbath where the focus of God's church today is on Christian education education Sabbath and therefore I have entitled the reflection for this morning weakened Powers restricted Vision weakened Powers restricted Vision let us pray father we honor you and you magnify and uplift your holy name this morning we desire now to hear from you and just as you've spoken to us in days past Lord do it again this morning I pray that your spirit who is parus a comforter will be the dusos this morning and teacher to us that we can hear your word we pray for clarity and Lord we refuse everything that which the enemy would use to hinder your word from reaching out to your children be magnified be glorified hide me behind the cross of Jesus that speak your word in Christ's name we pray amen weakened powers and restricted Visions now I was gleaning through the pen of inspiration in a book called education and some of us we've had the pleasure to be able to enjoy that and uh the spirit of God speaks and says I would quote that the world has had its great teachers men of great or giant intellect of extensive research men whose utterances have stimulated thought and open to view vast fields of knowledge now these men have been honored as guides and benefactors of race but behind them or before them we know that there's one who stands higher than they we can trace the line of the world's teachers as far back as human records can extend but the light of the world was before them as the moon and the stars of our solar system Shine by The reflected light of the Sun so as far as their teaching is true the world's great thinkers reflect the the Rays of the sun of righteousness and every gleam of thought every flash of intellect is from the light of of the world Jesus Christ himself amen and therefore the source of all that is Jesus Christ himself now the Book of Genesis 1 and: 27 Genesis 1: 27 it says that God created man in his own image God created man in his own image when Adam came from the Creator's hand he bore in his physical mental and spiritual nature a likeness to his maker it was his purpose the longer man lived the more fully he should reveal this image the image of God and the more fully he was to reflect the glory of the Creator or faculties who were capable of development their capacity and vigor were continually to increase day by day th was the scope offered for the exercise glorious the field open to their research I'm quoting from the book page book education page 151 and therefore the first school which began was in the garden of Aiden and God was the teacher and he taught his first two students the couple Adam and Eve Psalms 32 ver 8 God himself says that I will instruct you and teach you the way you should go I will canel you with my loving eye on you the Bible tells us that God says he is the teacher and he was a teacher and therefore in very original school at which he established himself in Aiden he was the instructor of the two students now the Bible if you go through it you'd find verses that which agreed to this because for sure his word says that he is a teacher he teaches us how to talk Exodus 4:15 it says you are to speak to him and put words in his mouth and I even I will be with you with your mouth and his mouth then he says and I will teach you what you are to do a God who teaches us how to talk then he says Psalms 25: 12 again who is the man who fears the Lord he will instruct him in the way he should choose he will instruct him in the way he should choose he's The God Who teaches us how to make decisions that will honor him and add life to life the Bible keeps on claiming about him being a teacher Psalm 32:8 I will instruct you and teach you in the way you should go I will canel you with my eye upon you the god who teaches us where to go who to go with he gives us discernments another verse Psalms 94: 10 the Bible claims that he who chastens the Nations he will not he will not rebuke even he who teaches men knowledge he gives us the knowhow and many of us this morning could Acclaim or could who give a testimony to this truth that he is a God who instruct us who gives us the knowhow and the knowledge and maybe this morning there's someone who can give a testimony and say yes he has been my teacher he has given me knowledge and today I'm enjoying God's blessings because I've been taught of God in the school of God whether in the business World whether in the politics whether in education any field which you may be this morning God when he teaches you you become successful God when he teaches you you become learned and learned of God hallelujah he says again in the Book of John 14:26 this is now the Holy Spirit God the the trinity in the teaching as a teacher instructor but the advocate John 14:26 the Holy Spirit whom the father will send in my name will teach you all things and will remind you of everything I have said to you now another one 15 26 27 are the same yeah all together it says I will send you the helper from the Father the helper is a spirit of Truth he who comes from the father when he comes he will tell you about me and you will tell people about me too because you've been with me from the beginning one of them is in the Greek word is paracletos I will send another comforter paracletos I I will send you one who shall be able to comfort you and to guide you then he switches and says then I will send you another who shall be dcos the word in Greek which simply means I will send you a rabbi a teacher who shall teach you in all truth hallelujah the holy spirit of God at work John 13: 13 Christ comes in and he says you are calling me teacher and Lord you are calling me theas Clos and Rabbi and you you are right because I am father says I I I instruct you in your ways the spirit says I am your comforter and your teacher and Jesus comes and says yes you call me Rabbi yes you call me teacher because indeed I am the god who has been at work teaching his people instructing his people teaching his church and guiding all through along and all these comes from his vast and limited resources in glory because Ephesians 3:16 Says I pray that from his glorious unlimited resources he will Empower you with a Inner Strength listen to this he will Empower you with the Inner Strength through his Spirit from the unlimited vast resources in glory let me tell you something something God has enough resources God has has enough capability God never runs short he has enough in glory through Jesus Christ Our Lord and we have been listening from for a long time from the world that tells us that God needs help and many of us possibly had come to a place where we reach we get to think that there are some situations some places some Corners in our lives where maybe God is not able but the word of God is reminding us this morning it is from his Unlimited vast resources in glory through Jesus Christ Our Lord hallelujah vast resources in glory richness of Glory it all comes from him it all belongs to him so then he begins a school in the Garden of Eden what was the curriculum I would quote from the spirit of Prophecy in the book of Education says the mysteries of the invisible sorry of the visible Universe with job 37: 16 is says the wondrous work of him which is perfect in knowledge that was the curriculum that was what they were to focus on in the garden of Adam the mysteries of the visible Universe now we have the invisible and we have the what the visible now he says that they were to learn of the Mysteries of the visible universe and they were to f focus on this and this was inviting man's study man's intellect and still is inviting us today because when you look and learn from the visible that which God has created and has given to us today it is impossible to be a hian it is impossible to be a gnostic it is impossible to doubt his existence because nature speaks of God the the visible World proclaims about who he is his majesty and many scientists who have been able who have been real scientists taken their time in research and took their time in that they come out in all and they all come up with one thing there must be an intelligent being behind all this it can't be a product of chance he's beckoning us today too to continue learning have they remained loyal to God this was supposed to continue forever Adam and Eve it was supposed to be through out and even in Eternal ages he would have continued to gain Treasures of knowledge to discover fresh fresh Springs of happiness and to obtain clearer and yet clearer conceptions of the wisdom the power and the love of God and more fully would have fulfilled the object of his creation more and more fully they were to begin to reflect the Creator's Glory so what was what did God Envision in mind as he began education as I was gleaning the spirit of Prophecy the few things I found that were very important and essential I want to share with you this morning and I found out number one it is called the true education God be being a true educationist gives a true education and he says that this true education must develop power to think and to do ah this education which is true which is from God develops power mental power intellectual power to be able to think and to execute Hallelujah people of God now this reflect allow me to this this morning this reflect across the landscape in economy in the field of science in social science and every other aspect it cuts across the true education must give that power to the m to the Mind must equip the mind with the power to think and to do we are in death of thinkers we are in shortage of thinkers people who have the capacity to think and process through things and be able to execute that which they process let me tell you something every time you step somewhere whether there's a leader be it entity or an institution this reflects whether the person in church or the person behind the big desk has the capacity has this power because when the power is there it reflects from the gate reflects in the background it reflects in every aspect whether in politics or in medicine or in science and therefore word of God I submit this to you with humility that when you walk across some places and you find that there's manholes that are open on the streets you find garbage in many places and you wonder exactly what is going on here it it exact actually coming from here true education develops the power intellectual power to be able to think through things and to execute it and therefore when you see things are failing in places when you see things are not going in order go and look behind the desk and you shall be able to understand exactly what is going on and therefore through education must give this power to think and act number two it must equip one with the ability to contemplate the great facts of Duty and Destiny one more time you must equip with the ability to contemplate the great facts of Duty and Destiny now we praise God for our teachers and the good work that is going on in our schools God bless you teachers for the good work you're doing today and may God Empower you because we trust in you we believe in the work you're doing because of us as a family church and the nation as well too but listen to this that when you bring those young brains to you they in your hands to mold and God bless you for the good work but the education which you are giving to these children as they sit under your feet as a rabbi as a teacher you must do everything possible depending with your age I believe you you know what I mean some of them can be able to assimilate more information others can't they levels different levels teacher you understand this but you you must ensure that before they leave your hands you have removed eliminated fogginess from their mind you brought Clarity into their minds and they are able to understand what they are here to do the facts of Duty and Destiny what we are here to do and what happens in the future what I have to do in the future this power develops men who Bears responsibilities who are leaders in Enterprise who are leaders in governance who are leaders in management and who are actually influencing character and that is why we have to be very careful as we raise up these young ones and teach them because it's going to be those leaders tomorrow and you know God's people I remember a professor when I was back in school in college who's the president of the our University and comes and says I treat you with so much respect he was talking to Young Pastors in college he tells us because I know that my retirement is in your hands I'm treating you with what with respect I have to acknowledge you and give you the respect you need because my retirement is in whose hands people of God we never get to think about this but as we raise up as we teach them as we nurture them and raise them up we have to remember that the future we putting it in their hands whether the system works or system fails it is in their hands there will be a time when you have to leave that office and give someone else the key there'll be times when you have to move on and someone else will come and make decisions where you're making good decisions we don't live forever like rock there's a time to come and time to go somebody say Amen there's a time to be occupy that seat occupy that office and there will be a moment child of God when you have to give those keys give those files to somebody else let it sink in the name of Jesus Christ and because of that then I have to live carefully I have to walk carefully I have to remember because everything else every everything will be determined by how I get to do that raising up men and women and who can bear responsibilities who are leaders we have seen lack of responsibility we've learned of many who D just come and leave it someone else would do it for me someone else rais up those children for me someone else who fix that for me and this goes back to the kind of education that was inculcated the thought the principles that were taught the information which was relayed that I learned that it is okay to just wake up in the morning and quit my responsibilities it is in the education people of God men who are strong to think and act another point being able to think and to act another one men who are Masters and not slaves of circumstances learning from the book education masters of who are Masters and not slaves of circumstances we come from this side of the Hem hemisphere in the world where where we we talk about what happened many years ago and we said it is because of unfair this and that we say it's because of the it's not balanced we come to tradeit the unfair something practice and we keep on talking about how unfair it has been for us and how we've been dealt with the bad blow how it has been challenging to us it is not it is what was done to us talk about circumstances through education who raise up men and women who are not slaves to circumstances yes they came and did what have you been doing somebody with me say Amen if you're listening to me amen ah hope I'm not getting to your case too much it has been done they did it yes but what have I been doing true education coming from God what he envisioned was that men would not be slaves to circumstances Bound by policies Bound by things that are Beyond us that we're not able to sit down together and reason and work out things have I stepped into a boardroom some of you work in this corporate places where you have a boardroom and you enter there you sit down and you sit for 2 hours and you come out wondering exactly what my two hours but did they go what exactly did we do 2 hours in a boardroom true education that which God envisioned is the one that strengthens men and they possess the breath of Mind women who possess the breath of mind I tried to check on this the meaning of this and this is what I found this what I found breath of Mind refers to the ability to consider a wide range of perspective ideas and viewpoints on a subject demonstrating an open-mindedness and a willingness to understand different angles rather than being confined to a narrow perspective essentially having a broad understanding and not being limited by a single Viewpoint men who possess breath of mind they are fresh air in a room Hallelujah yes yes yes yes yes there are blessing women who possess breath of Mind there are blessings when you bring them into a place clearness of thought Clarity of Mind removing forgivness of mind and the courage to live up to their convictions people who can stand up and say this is what I believe this is what the Bible teaches me this is what God says in his word and I believe it and I'm going to follow this courage to stand for convictions oh how God is waiting upon us as a church and people of God to raise up a generation that can stand up declare the conviction and say I'm going to follow what I believe because the Bible teaches me that it's a kind of education that expands and strengthens the minds the true high education it is that which is imparted by him or with whom is wisdom and strength job 12: 13 out of whose mouth comes knowledge and understanding our God is a God who is Rich knowledge Rich of understanding that is why the Bible say book of James if you lack wisdom you just call upon him and he shall give you that wisdom The God Who is rich in wisdom rich in knowledge riches in understanding but when God was busy planning about man's good when God was busy putting this into structure Satan was busy looking or seeking his ruin God established the ideal put the structures into place and envisioned what Adam and Eve and the human race shall become but as he was busy doing that the enemy of God the enemy of our life Satan himself was busy seeking Rin the rest is history as you can see today it is history so what is God objective for Education today as I look upon the word of God it's why I pen on the same subject he says number one that the objective which God had for this educ for education is this number one to restore in man the image of his maker the purpose and the objective of Education when God began it when God structured it when God prepared the curriculum and the syllabus it was to restore man in image this is after after the fall he decided to make sure that this education shall bring back back to us where we were supposed to be from beginning restore man the image of the makica to bring him to perfection in which he was created to promote the development of B body mind and soul but the Divine Purpose in his creation might be realized this was to be the work of redemption I'm going to come to that later this was to the objective of Education the great object of life so Point number one the objective and the main purpose of Education was to restore man in the image of his maker number two it is that it was to strengthen the character and fortify the Mind education which we we receiving we're supposed to be receiving people of God it is a kind that create a for you know in olden times they used to build those cities and they put up those fortifications from the word Fort they put up those big walls which were supposed to be for protection against the enemies many City cities in the older times of the Bible had fortified walls fortification this education God's objective was that it was to come and strengthen the character and put a fortification put a wall around the Mind strong wall such education provides more than mental discipline it provides more than the physical training it's strengthens the character so that truth and uprightness are not sacrificed to selfish desire or worldly ambition I remember speaker somewhere I was one day stood up and says that he began a statement which chocked us that you you did not you were not born and you're not God not bring you here to pay bills God did not create you and bring you to this world to pay what bills and if you're not very careful you find sometime the kind of education which is comes the opposite or comes from out there is the kind that instruct us that cures us that we are here for the purposes of paying bills and the moment you're done with your bills you do what you die you go on your way but this was not the objective of God when he was beginning this good work strengthens the character of the truth and uprightness are not sacrificed to selfish desire or worldly Ambitions people of God unless the brain can be able to see Embrace that which is bigger grander better we always sometimes settle for that which is just Shadow and narrow thinking this is exactly what life is about remember human brain actually H hes vacuum we we don't do very well we don't have an answer to something and therefore we don't get 1+ 1al 2 we create a narrative make a narrative or something yeah yeah the way he was looking at me what he said was because a human brain needs to get an answer and therefore if 1 + one is not adding I'm not getting two I will create an answer and and the plan of God because he knew the human mind it is strong he made it according to his own image it's amazing and wonderfully made if you don't give it something Noble something important bigger than it enough it will settle for its own narrative and that is why most of us believe today POS you're living for selfish desires worldly ambition the next level the next level I don't say being ambitious is wrong I'm just trying to say unless we have received something grander than ourselves greater purposeful more meaningful would end up chasing which is temporal because this brain cannot help unless it's given that which is substantial coming from God the Father himself who made it somebody say Amen that is why today truth and uprightness have been sacrificed selfish desires and Wy Ambitions fortifies the minds against evil instead of some master passion becoming a power to destroy every motive and desire are to be brought in Conformity to the great principles of right the great principles of right is this the right thing to do whether someone is watching or someone nobody is watching a sense of accountability driven deep within the core of the spirit and when nobody is even looking at me and watching me I will do the right thing ah fortifies the Mind against as the Perfection of his character God's character is dwelt upon the mind is renewed and the soul is recreated in the image of God number three God God's objective for Education was godliness as the goal to be realized or to be reached amen Ah that's a purpose of Godly education and Christian education when God began this it was in his mind but the goal to be realized is to becoming like God godliness he say is higher than highest human thought can reach is God's ideal for his children one more time higher than the highest human thought can reach is God's ideal for his children say Amen higher than your mind and my mind can never fathom it's God's ideal for his children it's hard to understand to comprehend with a human mind godlikeness godliness it is the goal to be reached before the student that is open a path of continual progress he has to have an object he or she to achieve a standard to attain that includes everything good and pure and Noble he will advance as fast and as far as possible in every branch of true knowledge listen to this but his efforts will be directed to object as much higher than mere selfish and temporal interests as the heavens are higher than the earth the goal is to be coming like God true education takes us to becoming like God godlikeness becoming more like God in every aspect of the Hallelujah and therefore an encouragement to us people of God as we the good work of Education raise that standard higher it is not just a mere degree another mere job not just living for my own purpose but it is that God is a goal to be realized becoming like Christ becoming becomes a goal to be reached as perfect as he is as awesome and marvelous as he is not pursuing of just m selfish and temporal interests number four realizing of the highest pleasure of holy existence you know I've been watching sometimes I used to watch some programs in the TV and and a time I'll get myself watching chefs you know these people who cook guys in the area of um Gastronomy or what yes and um there'll be the best chef on stage and they're busy trying to mix up food and flavors of all different color and texture and taste and I'll be observing how much work intricate that comes into place before he can serve that small sauce with a little beautiful LD down with different colors sort of a small piece of meal and then it gives the person who's supposed to taste who is not a chef who has no experienced in this and he watched them as they taste it and their tongues rest respond to the flavors and the science that has gone into that and I began to ask myself this is the pleasure with food and the tongue you know I believe Kenyans are very good cook Hallelujah God is good we are good Cooks Hallelujah we cook good food and I began to ask myself what is this highest pleasure that we can derive or we can get in life you see someone just tasting a piece of bread and some little food and everything changes the hour changes the face changes because of the Beauty and the wonderful work that has gone in preparation of that small meal the science the skill what is what can you derive from Life what is the highest pleasure and not just pleasure in the worldly terms but the pleasure of those who love the Lord and who want to live lives that honor him hallelujah what is the pleasure what do you delive from here the fourth purpose of Education people of God as God had God object Envision it was that through this education we are to realize the highest pleasure of holy existence there is joy in the Lord verse full fulfillment in Jesus there is true happiness for anybody who begets Jesus you can live a life of satisfaction and fulfillment in Jesus Christ and the church said true education who take us to a place where we begin to appreciate appreciate who he is and begin to discover the Beauty and the pleasure that which only God can give and let me tell you something it gets better with years ah As You Keep On Walking With Jesus as you keep on serving Jesus as you keep on living for this Christ every single day it gets better and better and better and the taste in your mouth keeps on getting better Hallelujah I would love to live 100 years if God allows me but 100 years in Jesus because I believe the experience that I have right now will be a bit different my Elder I would have been able to taste him better know who he is better enjoy my walk with him better experience him more and more much more better there is joy and fulfillment and satisfaction when you live for Jesus and this was the object of predication the man who realize which God had in mind when he created us in the world which was perfect without sin without the corruption and Brokenness we see in the world today people of God the fourth point or the fifth point is true education Redemption is at its core I want to summarize this with with the reading here in the highest sense of the work of education and the work of redemption are one one more time the work of education and the work of redemption are one for in education as in Redemption other Foundation can no man lay than which Christ Jesus Christ has laid himself the book book of Corinthians 3: 11 and Colossians 1: 19 the work of education and Redemption is one and therefore it's important to ask myself is I think about my kids education they think about the structures we put we put into place for Education whether in church or in other settings what is the call of this because if redemp is not the main purpose then we've lost it it should lead to lead to a knowledge of God a true knowledge of who God is and there must be a development in this knowledge every single day teachers in our schools present Jesus Christ make him the object make him the center and the knowledge of that true God let the children Embrace let them appreciate and let them keep on developing in this knowledge knowledge of all true and the knowledge of God is all true knowledge because whatever we turn whether in physical mental or spiritual am whatever we behold apart from the blight of sin this knowledge is revealed the effect of such communion body and mind and soul is beyond estimate and therefore people of God Adam and Eve destroyed this by Disobedience this was fed through sin the Divine likeness was mered man physical Powers were weaked his mental capacity was lessened his spiritual vision deemed that's why the title today is weakened powers and restrict vision and today people of God we mourn the book of 1 Corinthians CH 13:2 as we finish this morning but as for now I see things glassly as for now I see things Darkly ah for this now we see in a mirror dimly but then face to face now I know in part but then shall I know fully just as I also have been fully known this morning God's purpose is to restore us through this education even though things are Darkly they Dee and we can see them very well but one day face to face we shall all see him in glory as he is in Jesus name amen

[57.1s] Sabbath where the focus of God's church
[59.5s] today is on Christian
[62.3s] education education Sabbath and
[66.0s] therefore I have entitled the reflection
[69.7s] for this
[70.8s] morning weakened
[73.6s] Powers restricted
[76.1s] Vision weakened
[79.1s] Powers restricted Vision let us
[82.4s] pray father we honor
[85.7s] you and you magnify and uplift your holy
[88.2s] name this morning
[91.1s] we desire now to hear from
[94.4s] you and just as you've spoken to us in
[97.4s] days
[98.6s] past Lord do it again this
[101.6s] morning I pray that your

[127.0s] me behind the cross of Jesus that speak
[129.4s] your word in Christ's name we pray
[133.0s] amen weakened powers and
[136.2s] restricted
[139.1s] Visions now I was gleaning through the
[142.3s] pen of
[143.5s] inspiration in a book called education
[146.6s] and some of us we've had the pleasure to
[148.9s] be able to enjoy that
[151.8s] and uh the spirit of God speaks and says
[156.0s] I would quote that the world has had its
[159.2s] great
[160.2s] teachers men of great or giant
[164.6s] intellect of extensive
[168.2s] research men whose utterances have
[171.6s] stimulated thought and open to view vast
[177.1s] fields of knowledge
[182.3s] now these men have been
[184.1s] honored as guides and benefactors of
[189.3s] race but behind them or before them we
[194.3s] know that there's one who stands
[197.4s] higher than
[200.0s] they we can trace the line of the
[202.6s] world's teachers as far back as human
[205.6s] records can
[207.5s] extend but the light of the world was
[210.9s] before
[212.2s] them as the moon and the stars of our
[215.2s] solar system Shine by The reflected
[218.3s] light of the Sun so as far as their
[222.2s] teaching is
[223.9s] true the world's great thinkers reflect
[226.8s] the the Rays of the sun of
[230.6s] righteousness and every gleam of thought
[234.2s] every flash of
[237.1s] intellect is from the light of of the
[240.0s] world Jesus Christ himself amen and
[244.6s] therefore the source of all that is
[249.0s] Jesus Christ
[251.8s] himself now the Book of Genesis 1 and:
[255.1s] 27 Genesis 1: 27 it says that God
[259.8s] created man in his own image God created
[265.9s] man in his own image when Adam came from
[269.5s] the Creator's hand he bore in his
[273.0s] physical mental and spiritual nature a
[276.8s] likeness to his
[280.5s] maker it was his purpose the longer man
[285.2s] lived the more fully he should reveal
[289.2s] this image the image of God and the more
[293.6s] fully he was to reflect the glory of the
[298.4s] Creator or faculties who were capable of
[301.2s] development their capacity and
[304.4s] vigor were continually to increase day
[307.3s] by
[308.0s] day th was the scope offered for the
[312.4s] exercise glorious the field open to
[315.6s] their research I'm quoting from the book
[318.1s] page book education page
[321.5s] 151 and therefore the first school which
[324.7s] began was in the garden of Aiden and God
[327.4s] was the teacher and he taught his first
[330.7s] two students the couple Adam and
[335.7s] Eve Psalms 32 ver
[339.1s] 8 God himself says that I will instruct
[343.7s] you and teach you the way you should go
[348.5s] I will canel you with my loving eye on
[353.3s] you the Bible tells us that God says he
[358.3s] is the teacher and he was a teacher and
[361.3s] therefore in very original school at
[363.2s] which he established himself in Aiden he
[366.2s] was the
[367.8s] instructor of the two
[370.7s] students now the Bible if you go through
[373.6s] it you'd find verses that which agreed
[377.1s] to this because for sure his word says
[380.2s] that he is a
[381.4s] teacher he teaches us how to
[384.6s] talk Exodus
[386.7s] 4:15 it says you are to speak to him and
[389.9s] put words in his mouth and I even I will
[394.7s] be with you with your mouth and his
[398.1s] mouth then he says and I will teach you
[402.3s] what you are to do a God who teaches us
[408.2s] how to
[409.9s] talk then he says Psalms 25: 12 again
[414.6s] who is the man who fears the Lord he
[417.4s] will instruct him in the way he should
[421.6s] choose he will instruct
[424.5s] him in the way he should choose he's The
[429.1s] God Who teaches us how to make decisions
[432.2s] that will honor him and add life to life
[435.4s] the Bible keeps on claiming about him
[436.8s] being a
[437.8s] teacher Psalm
[439.8s] 32:8 I will instruct you and teach you
[442.7s] in the way you should go I will canel
[445.9s] you with my eye upon you the god who
[449.8s] teaches us where to go who to go with he
[454.6s] gives us
[457.0s] discernments another verse Psalms 94: 10
[461.6s] the Bible claims that he who chastens
[463.3s] the Nations he will not he will not
[467.5s] rebuke even he who teaches men
[472.8s] knowledge he gives us the
[475.6s] knowhow and many of us this morning
[478.4s] could Acclaim or could who give a
[479.9s] testimony to this truth that he is a God
[484.0s] who instruct us who gives us the knowhow
[487.9s] and the knowledge and maybe this morning
[489.6s] there's someone who can give a testimony
[490.9s] and say yes he has been my teacher he
[494.3s] has given me knowledge and today I'm
[497.4s] enjoying God's blessings because I've
[500.0s] been taught of God in the school of God
[503.0s] whether in the business World whether in
[504.4s] the politics whether in education any
[506.3s] field which you may be this morning God
[509.0s] when he teaches you you become
[511.0s] successful God when he teaches you you
[513.6s] become learned and learned of God
[516.4s] hallelujah he says again in the Book of
[519.1s] John 14:26 this is now the Holy Spirit
[521.7s] God the the trinity in the teaching as a
[525.2s] teacher
[527.6s] instructor but the advocate John 14:26
[531.2s] the Holy Spirit whom the father will
[534.4s] send in my name will teach you all
[538.1s] things and will remind you of everything
[541.8s] I have said to you now another one 15 26
[545.2s] 27 are the same yeah all together it
[546.9s] says I will send you the helper from the
[549.6s] Father the helper is a spirit of Truth
[553.4s] he who comes from the father when he
[555.4s] comes he will tell you about me and you
[558.9s] will tell people about me too because
[562.0s] you've been with me from the beginning
[563.7s] one of them is in the Greek word is
[565.3s] paracletos I will send another comforter
[568.4s] paracletos I I will send you one who
[570.7s] shall be able to comfort you and to
[572.7s] guide you then he switches and says then
[575.3s] I will send you another who shall be
[577.6s] dcos the word in Greek which simply
[579.8s] means I will send you a rabbi a teacher
[582.5s] who shall teach you in all truth
[585.1s] hallelujah the holy spirit of God at
[587.2s] work John 13: 13 Christ comes in and he
[591.7s] says you are calling me teacher and Lord
[595.2s] you are calling me theas Clos and Rabbi
[599.0s] and you you are right because I am
[602.5s] father says I I I instruct you in your
[605.1s] ways the spirit says I am your comforter
[608.5s] and your teacher and Jesus comes and
[610.8s] says yes you call me Rabbi yes you call
[613.8s] me teacher because
[616.9s] indeed I
[618.8s] am the god who has been at work teaching
[621.7s] his people instructing his people
[623.8s] teaching his
[625.2s] church and guiding all through along and
[628.8s] all these comes from his vast and
[632.2s] limited resources in glory because
[634.2s] Ephesians 3:16 Says I pray that from his
[637.5s] glorious unlimited resources he will
[640.5s] Empower you with a Inner Strength listen
[643.7s] to this he will Empower you with the
[646.4s] Inner Strength through his Spirit from
[650.5s] the unlimited vast resources in glory
[653.5s] let me tell you something something God
[655.8s] has enough resources God has has enough
[660.8s] capability God never runs short he has
[664.2s] enough in glory through Jesus Christ Our
[667.1s] Lord and we have been listening from for
[669.8s] a long time from the world that tells us
[672.2s] that God needs help and many of us
[675.3s] possibly had come to a place where we
[676.9s] reach we get to think that there are
[678.9s] some situations some places some Corners
[682.1s] in our lives where maybe God is not able
[685.2s] but the word of God is reminding us this
[686.6s] morning it is from his Unlimited
[690.3s] vast resources in glory through Jesus
[692.9s] Christ Our Lord hallelujah vast
[695.4s] resources in
[696.8s] glory richness of
[700.1s] Glory it all comes from him it all
[703.0s] belongs to him so then he begins a
[706.4s] school in the Garden of Eden what was
[708.7s] the curriculum I would quote from the
[710.7s] spirit of Prophecy in the book of
[711.6s] Education says the mysteries of the
[714.1s] invisible sorry of the visible Universe
[718.0s] with job 37: 16 is says the wondrous
[722.6s] work of him which is perfect in
[726.0s] knowledge that was the curriculum that
[729.8s] was what they were to focus on in the
[732.8s] garden of Adam the mysteries of the
[736.0s] visible Universe now we have the
[738.6s] invisible and we have the what the
[742.2s] visible now he says that they were to
[745.2s] learn of the Mysteries of the visible
[747.4s] universe and they were to f focus on
[749.8s] this and this was inviting man's study
[753.9s] man's intellect and still is inviting us
[757.7s] today because when you look and learn
[761.7s] from the visible that which God has
[764.5s] created and has given to us today it is
[767.0s] impossible to be a hian it is impossible
[769.8s] to be a gnostic it is impossible to
[773.0s] doubt his existence because nature
[774.8s] speaks of God the the visible World
[777.9s] proclaims about who he is his majesty
[781.6s] and many scientists who have been able
[783.7s] who have been real scientists taken
[785.8s] their time in research and took their
[788.5s] time in that they come out in all and
[791.7s] they all come up with one thing there
[793.6s] must be an intelligent being behind all
[796.6s] this it can't be a product of
[800.7s] chance he's beckoning us today too to
[803.0s] continue learning have they remained
[805.8s] loyal to
[806.8s] God this was supposed to continue
[809.4s] forever Adam and Eve it was supposed to
[811.8s] be through out and even in Eternal ages
[816.0s] he would have continued to gain
[818.6s] Treasures of knowledge to discover fresh
[822.4s] fresh Springs of happiness and to obtain
[827.2s] clearer and yet clearer conceptions of
[830.7s] the wisdom the power and the love of God
[835.4s] and more fully would have fulfilled the
[838.3s] object of his creation more and more
[842.1s] fully they were to begin to
[845.6s] reflect the Creator's
[849.5s] Glory so what was what did God Envision
[854.2s] in mind as he began
[856.2s] education as I was gleaning the spirit
[858.2s] of Prophecy the few things I found that
[860.6s] were very important and essential I want
[862.2s] to share with you this morning and I
[864.0s] found out number one it is called the
[867.0s] true education God be being a true
[871.4s] educationist gives a true
[875.2s] education and he says that this true
[878.5s] education must develop power to think
[883.8s] and to do ah this education which is
[887.8s] true which is from God
[891.5s] develops power mental power intellectual
[895.8s] power to be able to think
[899.6s] and to execute Hallelujah people of God
[902.3s] now this reflect allow me to this this
[905.2s] morning this reflect across the
[910.6s] landscape in
[912.6s] economy in the field of science in
[915.7s] social science and every other aspect it
[918.2s] cuts across the true education must give
[922.9s] that power to the m to the Mind must
[925.8s] equip the mind with the power to think
[928.6s] and to do we are in death of thinkers we
[933.4s] are in shortage of thinkers people who
[936.4s] have the capacity to think and process
[939.3s] through things and be able to execute
[942.5s] that which they process let me tell you
[944.4s] something every time you step somewhere
[946.7s] whether there's a
[947.7s] leader be it entity or an institution
[951.8s] this reflects whether the person in
[954.7s] church or the person behind the big desk
[957.3s] has the capacity has this
[961.8s] power because when the power is there it
[964.8s] reflects from the gate reflects in the
[968.2s] background it reflects in every aspect
[971.7s] whether in politics or in medicine or in
[973.5s] science and therefore word of God I
[976.0s] submit this to you with humility that
[977.8s] when you walk across some places and you
[979.8s] find that there's manholes that are open
[982.0s] on the streets you find garbage in many
[985.0s] places and you wonder exactly what is
[986.9s] going on here it it exact actually
[989.4s] coming from here true education develops
[993.4s] the power intellectual power to be able
[996.2s] to think through things and to execute
[999.2s] it and therefore when you see things are
[1001.6s] failing in places when you see things
[1003.4s] are not going in order go and look
[1006.6s] behind the desk and you shall be able to
[1009.6s] understand exactly what is going on and
[1011.9s] therefore through
[1015.8s] education must give this
[1019.0s] power to think and act number two it
[1021.8s] must equip one with the
[1024.4s] ability to contemplate the great facts
[1028.3s] of Duty and Destiny one more time you
[1032.2s] must equip with the ability to
[1035.2s] contemplate the great facts of Duty and
[1038.5s] Destiny now we praise God for our
[1042.0s] teachers and the good work that is going
[1043.2s] on in our schools God bless you teachers
[1044.6s] for the good work you're doing
[1046.0s] today and may God Empower you because we
[1049.0s] trust in you we believe in the work
[1050.2s] you're doing because of us as a family
[1052.7s] church and the nation as well too but
[1055.0s] listen to this that when you bring those
[1057.6s] young brains to you they in your hands
[1059.8s] to mold and God bless you for the good
[1061.9s] work but the education which you are
[1065.1s] giving to these children as they sit
[1067.3s] under your feet as a rabbi as a teacher
[1070.3s] you must do everything
[1072.3s] possible depending with your age I
[1074.6s] believe you you know what I mean some of
[1076.4s] them can be able to assimilate more
[1077.6s] information others can't they levels
[1079.2s] different levels teacher you understand
[1080.6s] this but you you must ensure that before
[1084.4s] they leave your
[1085.6s] hands you have removed eliminated
[1088.1s] fogginess from their mind you brought
[1090.6s] Clarity into their minds and they are
[1093.8s] able to understand what they are here to
[1097.6s] do the facts of Duty and
[1102.1s] Destiny what we are here to do and what
[1105.3s] happens in the future what I have to do
[1108.0s] in the future this power develops men
[1111.4s] who Bears
[1113.1s] responsibilities who are leaders in
[1115.4s] Enterprise who are leaders in governance
[1118.3s] who are leaders in management and who
[1120.7s] are actually
[1122.6s] influencing
[1125.5s] character and that is why we have to be
[1127.3s] very careful as we raise up these young
[1129.0s] ones and teach them because it's going
[1131.2s] to be those leaders tomorrow and you
[1134.6s] know God's people I remember a professor
[1136.1s] when I was back in school in college
[1139.1s] who's the president of the our
[1140.6s] University and comes and says I treat
[1142.7s] you with so much respect he was talking
[1144.9s] to Young Pastors in college he tells us
[1148.5s] because I know that my retirement is in
[1150.4s] your hands I'm treating you with what
[1153.7s] with
[1154.8s] respect I have to acknowledge you and
[1157.9s] give you the respect you need because my
[1160.8s] retirement is in whose
[1163.0s] hands people of God we never get to
[1165.8s] think about this but as we raise up as
[1169.2s] we teach them as we nurture them and
[1172.0s] raise them up we have to remember that
[1175.2s] the future we putting it in their hands
[1178.6s] whether the system works or system
[1181.7s] fails it is in their hands there will be
[1184.4s] a time when you have to leave that
[1185.5s] office and give someone else the key
[1187.9s] there'll be times when you have to move
[1189.2s] on and someone else will come and make
[1191.6s] decisions where you're making good
[1193.2s] decisions we don't live forever like
[1195.3s] rock there's a time to come and time to
[1198.2s] go somebody say Amen there's a time to
[1200.8s] be occupy that seat occupy that office
[1203.9s] and there will be a moment child of God
[1206.6s] when you have to give those keys give
[1208.5s] those files to somebody
[1210.8s] else let it sink in the name of Jesus
[1213.2s] Christ and because of that then I have
[1215.6s] to live carefully I have to walk
[1217.5s] carefully I have to
[1219.0s] remember because everything else every
[1221.7s] everything will be determined by how I
[1223.6s] get to do
[1226.5s] that raising up men and women and who
[1228.8s] can bear
[1230.3s] responsibilities who are
[1232.5s] leaders we have seen lack of
[1236.2s] responsibility we've learned of many who
[1238.1s] D just come and leave it someone else
[1240.4s] would do it for me someone else rais up
[1242.9s] those children for me someone else who
[1245.6s] fix that for
[1247.8s] me and this goes back to the kind of
[1251.1s] education that was inculcated the
[1254.1s] thought the principles that were taught
[1256.4s] the information which was relayed that I
[1259.2s] learned that it is okay to just wake up
[1261.0s] in the morning and quit my
[1262.7s] responsibilities it is in the education
[1265.7s] people of God men who are strong to
[1269.0s] think and act another point being able
[1271.6s] to think and to act another one men who
[1275.1s] are Masters and not slaves of
[1279.2s] circumstances learning from the book
[1281.1s] education masters of who are Masters and
[1285.2s] not slaves of circumstances we come from
[1289.0s] this side of the Hem hemisphere in the
[1290.9s] world where where we we talk about what
[1294.1s] happened many years ago and we said it
[1297.4s] is because of unfair this and that we
[1301.8s] say it's because of the it's not
[1303.4s] balanced we come to tradeit the unfair
[1306.3s] something practice and we keep on
[1308.6s] talking about how unfair it has been for
[1312.4s] us and how we've been dealt with the bad
[1314.8s] blow how it has been challenging to us
[1317.8s] it is not
[1319.2s] it is what was done to
[1321.7s] us talk about
[1323.6s] circumstances through
[1325.8s] education who raise up men and women who
[1329.5s] are not slaves to circumstances yes they
[1333.4s] came and did what have you been doing
[1336.4s] somebody with me say Amen if you're
[1338.4s] listening to me amen ah hope I'm not
[1341.8s] getting to your case too much it has
[1343.8s] been done they did it yes but what have
[1348.2s] I been doing true education coming from
[1350.5s] God what he envisioned was that men
[1354.2s] would not be slaves to circumstances
[1357.6s] Bound by policies Bound by things that
[1361.4s] are Beyond us that we're not able to sit
[1363.3s] down together and reason and work out
[1366.2s] things have I stepped into a boardroom
[1369.2s] some of you work in this corporate
[1370.9s] places where you have a boardroom and
[1373.1s] you enter there you sit down and you sit
[1375.0s] for 2 hours and you come out wondering
[1377.4s] exactly what my two hours but did they
[1379.8s] go what exactly did we do 2 hours in a
[1384.7s] boardroom true education that which God
[1387.4s] envisioned is the one that strengthens
[1389.9s] men and they possess the breath of
[1394.6s] Mind women who possess the breath of
[1397.3s] mind I tried to check on this the
[1398.7s] meaning of this and this is what I found
[1400.4s] this what I found breath of Mind refers
[1402.5s] to the ability to consider a wide range
[1405.6s] of perspective ideas and viewpoints
[1409.0s] on a subject demonstrating an
[1412.2s] open-mindedness and a willingness to
[1414.8s] understand different angles rather than
[1417.4s] being confined to a narrow perspective
[1420.1s] essentially having a broad understanding
[1424.1s] and not being limited by a single
[1427.2s] Viewpoint men who possess breath of mind
[1431.7s] they are fresh air in a room Hallelujah
[1434.6s] yes yes yes yes yes there are blessing
[1437.1s] women who possess breath of Mind there
[1439.7s] are blessings when you bring them into a
[1442.6s] place clearness of thought Clarity of
[1445.4s] Mind removing forgivness of mind and the
[1449.6s] courage to live up to their convictions
[1453.1s] people who can stand up and say this is
[1454.5s] what I believe this is what the Bible
[1456.9s] teaches me this is what God says in his
[1461.0s] word and I believe it and I'm going to
[1463.8s] follow this courage to stand for
[1467.6s] convictions oh how God is waiting upon
[1470.2s] us as a church and people of God to
[1471.4s] raise up a generation that can stand
[1475.0s] up declare the conviction and say I'm
[1477.2s] going to follow what I believe because
[1478.9s] the Bible teaches me
[1482.8s] that it's a kind of education that
[1486.0s] expands and
[1487.7s] strengthens the
[1490.2s] minds the true high
[1492.6s] education it is that which is imparted
[1496.4s] by him or with whom is wisdom and
[1500.5s] strength job 12: 13 out of whose mouth
[1504.5s] comes knowledge and understanding our
[1508.7s] God is a God who is
[1511.5s] Rich knowledge Rich of understanding
[1516.0s] that is why the Bible say book of James
[1517.3s] if you lack wisdom you just call upon
[1520.4s] him and he shall give you that wisdom
[1523.9s] The God Who is rich in
[1526.4s] wisdom rich in knowledge
[1529.3s] riches in understanding but when God was
[1531.3s] busy planning about man's good when God
[1534.4s] was busy putting this into structure
[1536.9s] Satan was busy looking or seeking his
[1541.9s] ruin God established the ideal put the
[1545.2s] structures into place and envisioned
[1547.6s] what Adam and Eve and the human race
[1549.8s] shall become but as he was busy doing
[1552.0s] that the enemy of God the enemy of our
[1555.4s] life Satan himself was busy seeking
[1560.5s] Rin the rest is history as you can see
[1562.6s] today it is history so what is God
[1565.3s] objective for Education
[1567.8s] today as I look upon the word of God
[1570.4s] it's why I pen on the same
[1572.2s] subject he says number one that the
[1575.0s] objective which God had for this educ
[1577.6s] for education is this number one to
[1580.3s] restore in man the image of his maker
[1585.2s] the purpose and the objective of
[1589.2s] Education when God began it when God
[1593.0s] structured it when God prepared the
[1595.2s] curriculum and the syllabus it was to
[1597.7s] restore man in image this is after after
[1600.4s] the fall he decided to make sure that
[1603.2s] this education shall bring back back to
[1605.9s] us where we were supposed to be from
[1608.6s] beginning restore man the image of the
[1610.6s] makica to bring him to
[1613.3s] perfection in which he was created to
[1616.5s] promote the development of B body mind
[1619.2s] and soul but the Divine Purpose in his
[1622.0s] creation might be realized this was to
[1626.2s] be the work of redemption I'm going to
[1628.8s] come to that later this was to the
[1631.0s] objective of Education the great object
[1634.4s] of life so Point number one the
[1636.6s] objective and the main purpose of
[1639.2s] Education was to restore man in the
[1641.8s] image of his maker number two it is that
[1645.5s] it was to strengthen the character and
[1648.3s] fortify the Mind education which we we
[1651.6s] receiving we're supposed to be receiving
[1652.6s] people of God it is a kind that create a
[1655.4s] for you know in olden times they used to
[1658.0s] build those cities and they put up those
[1660.0s] fortifications from the word Fort they
[1662.0s] put up those big walls which were
[1663.4s] supposed to be for protection against
[1664.8s] the enemies many City cities in the
[1666.4s] older times of the Bible had fortified
[1668.7s] walls fortification this education God's
[1672.7s] objective was that it was to come and
[1675.0s] strengthen the character and put a
[1679.2s] fortification put a wall around the Mind
[1683.5s] strong
[1686.9s] wall such education provides more than
[1689.9s] mental discipline it provides more than
[1692.5s] the physical training it's strengthens
[1694.7s] the character so that truth and
[1698.2s] uprightness are not sacrificed to
[1701.7s] selfish desire or worldly ambition I
[1706.2s] remember speaker
[1708.5s] somewhere I was one day stood up and
[1710.4s] says that he began a statement which
[1712.4s] chocked us that you you did not you were
[1714.7s] not born and you're not God not bring
[1716.3s] you here to pay
[1719.2s] bills God did not create you and bring
[1722.8s] you to this world to pay what
[1726.9s] bills and if you're not very careful you
[1729.8s] find sometime the kind of education
[1731.6s] which is comes the opposite or comes
[1734.0s] from out there is the kind that instruct
[1736.9s] us that cures
[1740.1s] us that we are here for the purposes of
[1744.4s] paying bills and the moment you're done
[1746.7s] with your bills you do what you die you
[1749.4s] go on your way but this was not the
[1752.6s] objective of God when he was beginning
[1755.6s] this good
[1757.2s] work strengthens the character of the
[1761.0s] truth and uprightness are not
[1765.0s] sacrificed to selfish desire or worldly
[1769.3s] Ambitions people of God unless the brain
[1772.8s] can be able to
[1774.2s] see Embrace that which is bigger grander
[1779.2s] better we always sometimes settle for
[1781.6s] that which is just Shadow and narrow
[1783.6s] thinking this is exactly what life is
[1785.8s] about remember human brain actually H
[1788.1s] hes vacuum we we don't do very well we
[1789.8s] don't have an answer to something and
[1791.4s] therefore we don't get 1+ 1al 2 we
[1793.8s] create a narrative make a narrative or
[1795.6s] something yeah yeah the way he was
[1797.4s] looking at me what he said was because a
[1800.7s] human brain needs to get an answer and
[1804.2s] therefore if 1 + one is not adding I'm
[1806.5s] not getting two I will create an
[1811.0s] answer and and the plan of God because
[1813.4s] he knew the human mind it is strong he
[1818.1s] made it according to his own image it's
[1820.9s] amazing and wonderfully made if you
[1823.6s] don't give it something Noble something
[1826.1s] important bigger than it enough it will
[1829.2s] settle for its own
[1832.7s] narrative and that is why most of us
[1835.3s] believe today POS you're living for
[1837.3s] selfish desires worldly ambition the
[1840.5s] next level the next level I don't say
[1843.2s] being ambitious is wrong I'm just trying
[1845.0s] to say unless we have received something
[1848.0s] grander than ourselves greater
[1850.8s] purposeful more meaningful would end up
[1853.8s] chasing which is temporal because this
[1856.5s] brain cannot help
[1859.0s] unless it's given that which is
[1860.8s] substantial coming from God the Father
[1863.7s] himself who made it somebody say
[1867.2s] Amen that is why today truth and
[1871.0s] uprightness have been
[1874.2s] sacrificed selfish desires and Wy
[1878.5s] Ambitions fortifies the minds against
[1881.0s] evil instead of some master passion
[1883.7s] becoming a power to destroy every motive
[1887.0s] and desire are to be brought in
[1889.9s] Conformity to the great principles of
[1893.3s] right the great principles of right is
[1896.6s] this the right thing to
[1899.6s] do whether someone is watching or
[1902.9s] someone nobody is watching a sense of
[1905.1s] accountability driven deep within the
[1907.2s] core of the spirit and when nobody is
[1910.0s] even looking at me and watching me I
[1912.2s] will do the right thing
[1915.2s] ah fortifies the Mind against
[1919.0s] as the Perfection of his character God's
[1920.9s] character is dwelt upon the mind is
[1924.7s] renewed and the soul is recreated in the
[1928.5s] image of God number
[1931.4s] three God God's objective for
[1934.3s] Education was
[1936.7s] godliness as the goal to be realized or
[1939.8s] to be reached amen Ah that's a purpose
[1943.0s] of Godly education and Christian
[1945.3s] education when God began this it was in
[1948.6s] his mind but the goal to be realized is
[1952.1s] to becoming like God godliness he say is
[1956.6s] higher than highest human thought can
[1959.6s] reach is God's ideal for his children
[1963.9s] one more time
[1966.6s] higher than the highest human thought
[1969.5s] can reach is God's ideal for his
[1974.0s] children say
[1975.3s] Amen higher than your mind and my mind
[1978.7s] can never fathom it's God's ideal for
[1981.3s] his children it's hard to understand to
[1982.8s] comprehend with a human mind
[1985.8s] godlikeness godliness it is the goal to
[1989.0s] be reached before the student that is
[1992.0s] open a path of continual progress he has
[1994.8s] to have an object he or she to achieve a
[1998.0s] standard to attain that includes
[2000.8s] everything good and pure and Noble he
[2004.0s] will advance as fast and as far as
[2006.6s] possible in every branch of true
[2008.4s] knowledge listen to this but his efforts
[2011.4s] will be directed to object as much
[2013.3s] higher than mere selfish and temporal
[2017.3s] interests as the heavens are higher than
[2020.9s] the earth the goal is to be coming like
[2024.4s] God true education takes us to becoming
[2027.8s] like God godlikeness becoming more like
[2030.6s] God in every aspect of the Hallelujah
[2033.0s] and therefore an encouragement to us
[2035.3s] people of God as we the good work of
[2036.8s] Education
[2038.4s] raise that standard higher it is not
[2040.8s] just a mere degree another mere job not
[2044.3s] just living for my own purpose but it is
[2047.0s] that God is a goal to be realized
[2050.7s] becoming like Christ becoming becomes a
[2053.1s] goal to be reached as perfect as he is
[2056.6s] as awesome and marvelous as he is not
[2060.4s] pursuing of just m selfish and temporal
[2064.5s] interests number four realizing
[2068.4s] of the highest pleasure of holy
[2072.0s] existence you
[2074.0s] know I've been watching sometimes I used
[2076.4s] to watch some programs in the
[2079.5s] TV and and a time I'll get myself
[2083.2s] watching chefs you know these people who
[2085.5s] cook guys in the area of um Gastronomy
[2089.5s] or what yes and um there'll be the best
[2094.0s] chef on stage and they're busy trying to
[2097.1s] mix up
[2098.2s] food and flavors of all different color
[2100.6s] and texture and taste and I'll be
[2104.0s] observing how much work
[2107.8s] intricate that comes into place before
[2110.6s] he can serve that small sauce with a
[2113.0s] little beautiful LD down with different
[2115.0s] colors sort of a small piece of
[2118.1s] meal and then it gives the person who's
[2120.3s] supposed to taste who is not a chef who
[2122.4s] has no experienced in this and he
[2124.6s] watched them as they taste it and their
[2126.8s] tongues rest respond to the
[2129.0s] flavors and the science that has gone
[2131.1s] into
[2132.4s] that and I began to ask
[2135.0s] myself this is the pleasure with food
[2138.3s] and the tongue you
[2142.2s] know I believe Kenyans are very good
[2144.3s] cook Hallelujah God is
[2147.8s] good we are good Cooks Hallelujah we
[2150.4s] cook good
[2154.3s] food and I began to ask myself
[2158.5s] what is this highest
[2161.1s] pleasure that we can derive or we can
[2164.0s] get in
[2165.3s] life you see someone just tasting a
[2168.0s] piece of bread and some little food and
[2171.4s] everything changes the hour changes the
[2174.0s] face changes because of the Beauty and
[2177.0s] the wonderful work that has gone in
[2178.3s] preparation of that small meal the
[2180.7s] science the
[2183.0s] skill what is what can you derive from
[2186.4s] Life what is the highest pleasure and
[2188.9s] not just pleasure in the worldly terms
[2191.6s] but the pleasure of those who love the
[2193.6s] Lord and who want to live lives that
[2196.0s] honor him hallelujah what is the
[2198.3s] pleasure what do you delive from here
[2200.7s] the fourth purpose of Education people
[2202.4s] of God as God had God object Envision it
[2206.2s] was that through this education we are
[2209.2s] to realize the highest pleasure of holy
[2213.4s] existence there is joy in the Lord verse
[2217.2s] full fulfillment in Jesus there is true
[2220.4s] happiness for anybody who begets Jesus
[2223.2s] you can live a life of satisfaction and
[2226.4s] fulfillment in Jesus Christ and the
[2229.5s] church
[2231.3s] said true education who take us to a
[2234.8s] place where we begin to appreciate
[2236.8s] appreciate who he is and begin to
[2239.9s] discover the Beauty and the pleasure
[2242.9s] that which only God can give and let me
[2245.4s] tell you something it gets better with
[2248.1s] years ah As You Keep On Walking With
[2251.3s] Jesus as you keep on serving Jesus as
[2253.6s] you keep on living for this Christ every
[2256.7s] single day it gets better and better and
[2260.1s] better and the taste in your mouth keeps
[2262.7s] on getting better Hallelujah I would
[2264.8s] love to live 100 years if God allows me
[2266.8s] but 100 years in Jesus because I believe
[2269.5s] the experience that I have right now
[2271.0s] will be a bit different my Elder I would
[2272.7s] have been able to taste him better know
[2274.8s] who he is better enjoy my walk with him
[2277.7s] better experience him more and more much
[2280.2s] more better there is joy and fulfillment
[2283.6s] and satisfaction when you live for
[2287.6s] Jesus and this was the object of
[2290.5s] predication the man who
[2293.3s] realize which God had in mind when he
[2297.4s] created us in the world which was
[2300.2s] perfect without sin without the
[2302.8s] corruption and Brokenness we see in the
[2304.0s] world today people of God the fourth
[2307.1s] point or the fifth point is true
[2310.2s] education
[2311.7s] Redemption is at its core I want to
[2314.4s] summarize this with with the reading
[2315.4s] here in the highest sense of the work of
[2317.9s] education and the work of redemption are
[2320.6s] one one more time the work of education
[2325.3s] and the work of redemption are one for
[2329.4s] in education as in
[2331.6s] Redemption other Foundation can no man
[2334.2s] lay than which Christ Jesus Christ has
[2336.4s] laid himself the book book of
[2338.3s] Corinthians 3: 11 and Colossians 1:
[2341.8s] 19 the work of education and Redemption
[2346.2s] is one and
[2348.9s] therefore it's important to ask
[2352.2s] myself is I think about my kids
[2354.9s] education they think about the
[2357.8s] structures we put we put into place for
[2359.3s] Education whether in church or in other
[2362.9s] settings what is the call of this
[2366.6s] because if redemp
[2368.3s] is not the main purpose then we've lost
[2370.8s] it it should lead to lead to a knowledge
[2373.1s] of God a true knowledge of who God is
[2376.9s] and there must be a development in this
[2379.8s] knowledge every single day teachers in
[2382.1s] our schools present Jesus Christ make
[2385.6s] him the object make him the center and
[2388.6s] the knowledge of that true God let the
[2390.9s] children Embrace let them appreciate and
[2394.5s] let them keep on developing in this
[2396.6s] knowledge
[2397.8s] knowledge of all true and the knowledge
[2399.5s] of God is all true
[2400.9s] knowledge because whatever we turn
[2403.6s] whether in physical mental or spiritual
[2406.4s] am whatever we behold apart from the
[2408.6s] blight of sin this knowledge is revealed
[2411.9s] the effect of such communion body and
[2413.6s] mind and soul is beyond estimate and
[2417.0s] therefore people of God Adam and Eve
[2420.0s] destroyed this by Disobedience this was
[2422.6s] fed through sin the Divine likeness was
[2425.2s] mered man physical Powers were weaked
[2427.6s] his mental capacity was lessened his
[2430.1s] spiritual vision deemed that's why the
[2432.2s] title today is weakened powers and
[2434.5s] restrict vision and today people of God
[2437.2s] we mourn the book of 1 Corinthians CH
[2439.8s] 13:2 as we finish this morning but as
[2442.6s] for now I see things glassly as for now
[2447.6s] I see things
[2449.6s] Darkly ah for this now we see in a
[2453.1s] mirror dimly but then face to face now I
[2457.0s] know in part but then shall I know fully
[2461.3s] just as I also have been fully known
[2466.3s] this morning God's purpose is to restore
[2469.4s] us through this education even though
[2472.1s] things are Darkly they Dee and we can
[2473.7s] see them very well but one day face to
[2475.7s] face we shall all see him in glory as he
[2478.4s] is in Jesus name amen
