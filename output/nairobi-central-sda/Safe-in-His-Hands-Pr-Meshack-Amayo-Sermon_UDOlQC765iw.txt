FULL TRANSCRIPT:
as you know today we will be talking about our Savior Jesus Christ as he talks to 
us in the Book of John chapter 10 that I will   be able to call it a survey of the Book of John 
and they are bringing to us something that is so   dear to John about Jesus talking about Christ as 
the chief Shepherd and I invite you today that   you will be able to go with me that we may survey 
The Book of John chapter 10 and in the survey of   John chapter 10 I think you can if it's not ready 
you can come back later please you can come back   later the topic of our sermon is safe in his hand 
safe in his hand and it is coming to us from the   verse that has been read but we first read from 
verse 1-9 verse 1- 5 John chap 10 we read from   verse 1-5 and it says most assuredly I say to you 
he who does not enter the Sheepfold by the door   but climbs up some other way the same is a thief 
and a robber but he who enters by the door is The   Shepherd of the sheep to him the doorkeeper opens 
and the sheep hear his voice and he calls his own   Sheep by name and leads them out verse four and 
when he brings out his sheep he goes before them   and the Sheep follow him for they know his voice 
yet yet they will by no means follow a stranger   but will free flee from him for they do not know 
the voice of a stranger we may pause here John is   elaborating to us what Jesus was telling the 
Pharisees it is good to understand who Jesus   is talking to here and why would Jesus bring 
this story we get it from the previous chapter   that Jesus did a miracle and opened the eyes of a 
man who was born blind after opening the eyes the   Pharisees come and say and tell that man praise 
God give God glory this man is a sinner because   he has healed you on a Sabbath day but this man is 
telling the Pharisees what I know a sinner cannot   do something like that then they rebuked him you 
are also a sinner and then Jesus after after that   meets this man because they had separated Jesus 
meets this man and tells this man would you want   to know the Son of God then the man said who is 
it that I may be able to believe then Christ told   him he is the one who is talking to you the man 
worshiped Jesus after worshiping Jesus and the   Pharisees rejected Jesus Jesus comes to them and 
tells them most assuredly I say to you he who does   not enter the shipold by the door and climbs on 
any other side the same is a thief and a robber   why was Jesus talking about the sheep and the 
Sheepfold here and the door it it was always known   that in the in the ancient times like uh 3,000 BC 
around that time from 3,000 BC it was always known   that a Shepherd Kings and religious leaders were 
shepherds and sometimes they would call them that   the shepherd is a humble Shepherd or the shepherd 
is a righteous Shepherd so the king is righteous   the king is humble the king is doing well so the 
the shepherd was used inter interchangeably with   a leader or a king and then it was known that now 
through that there is a door of entering the heart   of the people so Christ is telling them that 
I am the door and anyone who wants to get into   the lives of the children of God I am the door 
and then anyone who would want to take the sheep   and would want to go to any other way through 
any other way that one is a thief and a robber   anyone who would want to go through the door is 
the shepherd of the sheep so he's telling them if   you want to enter into life if you want to lead my 
people also you need to go through the door that   is why uh this verse is saying I say to you he who 
does not enter the shipold by the door but climb   up some other way the same is a thief and a robber 
he who enters by the door is The Shepherd of the Sheep next to that it says to him 
the doorkeeper opens and the sheep   hear his voice Christ is saying saying 
that that man who is coming through the   door the doorkeeper will open now the 
question would be who is the doorkeeper now you know in in a metaphor there would be 
many debates yes but seemingly here you find   that to that person the holy spirit opens the 
door if you are coming direct to the sheep and   you are a Shepherd the holy spirit will open 
the door for you I think the question that   Jesus Christ was answering to the Pharisees 
is that after doing a miracle of opening an   eye of somebody who was born blind Christ 
is telling them that I am the lifegiver   not only in this life but in the life to come 
so therefore Christ proceeds by saying in verse four verse three still and the sheep hear his 
voice and he calls his [Music] own Sheep by name   and he leads them out when he comes in Christ will 
call you by your name and he will lead you out   leading you out to where he lead me to he leads 
me to the Green Pastures he will come in he will   call me by name and he will lead me out it reminds 
me that this man knows where the pasture is and   he will lead me to the Green Pastures in verse 
four he says and when he brings out his sheep he   goes before them and the Sheep follow him for they 
know his voice and they will by no means follow a stranger those who have been with the 
Lord those who have understood the savior they understand his voice they know his voice they walk with him when 
Christ speaks they understand him him and they will by no means follow a stranger 
they can differentiate the voice of Satan from   the voice of Jesus Christ when they are 
faced with challenges in the family and   they are feeling that two voices are speaking 
there is one voice to commit sin and another   voice to persevere they can differentiate 
the voice of a stranger and they will by   no means follow a stranger so Christ is 
saying those who are mine they know me   they understand me they hear my voice they 
will never follow a stranger then he tells them he tells them in verse 7 
then Jesus said to them again   most assuredly I say to you I am the door of the sheep he is telling all of us nowhere else you 
can find a way out except through the door and he   saying I am the door you are refusing to accept me 
and I am the door through the Sheep through to the   Sheep so Christ is insisting that they understand 
him and in verse 9 as we jump it says Christ is saying I am the Good Shepherd the Good Shepherd gives his life for the Sheep but a hling he who is not the shepherd 
one who does not own the Sheep SE the wolf coming and leave leaves the sheep and 
flee I would want to repeat that part   so that we get it Christ is 
saying that is verse 11 I am   the Good Shepherd the good shepher 
gives his life for the Sheep but a Hing he who is not the shepherd one who 
does not own the ship he sees the wolf   coming and leaves the sheep and fleas 
away Christ is saying a good shepherd   would take all his interest on the sheep I am 
the Good Shepherd I am not a hired servant a   hired servant when wolf is coming will see that 
his own life is in danger and will run away he   running away because he is not the owner of the 
ship but he has been hired so he's running away   he doesn't care whether the Sheep is in danger 
so he will stick with the Sheep even unto death when David David was a young boy but 
he came when the Philistines were fighting   with the Israelites and there was this great 
Giant Goliath that defied the army of God for   40 days and when he just took some some food to 
the brothers where the brothers were fighting he   saw this man and he was roed and he said what 
will be given to a man who who will kill this   man and he was told that King sa had offered 
something then he said let no one's heart   faint because I will go and fight him and Saul 
was told what David had said and he was very   happy so Saul said bring the man who is going to 
fight Goliath and David was brought to to Saul   when he saw David he saw a very small boy by 
the way you know if this you allow this boy to   go and fight you will be defeated and when you 
are defeated the whole nation is defeated it is   a great risk so Saul is really fearing to risk 
the life of the nation and he tells David in a   polite manner boy you see you are very young 
but this man has been a man of war since his   youth David said your servant was a shepherd 
and was keeping sheep in the wilderness and   when a lion came when a bear came I took them 
by the beard and I struck them and I saved a sheep from its jaws he will be like one of them David said 
what is David saying when a bear came when a   lion came they would better kill me rather than 
kill the Sheep I offered my life to die for the   sheep in the wilderness that is what David 
is saying and that is why Christ is saying I   am the Good Shepherd I am not [Applause] 
hired I am ready to lay my life for the Sheep a hirling will see the wolf coming and will 
run away because a hiring is not the owner of the sheep I am the Good Shepherd the 
Good Shepherd gives his life for the Sheep but a Hing he who is not the shepherd 
one who does not own the Sheep sees the wolf   coming and leaves the sheep and fleas and the 
Wolf catches the sheep and scatters them the   hireling flees because he is a Hing he is 
of pay and does not care about the Sheep   then Christ come comes back to say I am the 
Good Shepherd I know my sheep and I am known   by my sheep I know the people who trust 
me and the people who trust me they know me there is a large congregation I 
understand each one but all those   people who are coming before me and 
they trust me they understand my ways so they spoke like that Christ expressed to 
them this the reason is because they rejected him   but he is convincing them that there is no 
any other door you will pass through except   by Me by the way I am the shepherd I am the one 
giving you eternal life so after telling them that   they had a lot of debate debate I think it's verse 
21 that is telling us that they have had a lot of debate it is verse 20 19 that says therefore 
there was a division again among the Jews   because of the sayings of these says and 
many of these of of them said he has a demon and he is mad why do you listen to him 
you are listening to a mad man you see that that one is a 
total rejection they had rejected   he still talking to them they are still 
rejecting and saying Jesus Christ is mad then do you know what happens verse 21 is saying others said 
those are not the words of one who has demon can a demon Open the Eyes of the blind the way we see him talk   this man is not mad and when we see the 
things he has done this man is sent from God then he proceeds in verse 22 it proceeds in 
verse 22 and say that it was a feast and they   went to the feast in jerus j Jerusalem the 
same time same discourse in verse 23 and   Jesus walked in the temple in Solomon's por 
then the Jews surrounded him and said to him   how long do you keep us in doubt how long 
do you keep us in doubt meaning that when   they were debating themselves on someone 
some people are saying is mad and others   say no anyone who is mad cannot be able to 
give somebody and I then the discourse uh continues the far the the Jews come 
before him and they ask him now a   strict question for how long will you put us in darkness it is like you are the Son of 
God and you are not saying it and how   long will we be wondering whether you are 
the one or not if you are the one tell us plainly verse 25 says Jesus 
answered them answered them   and said I told you and you do not 
believe is that a very nice answer you wanted him to say it plainly is that thing not   plain I had told you but you did not 
believe what else do you want me to do the works that I do in my father's 
name they bear witness of me even the   one when I gave the ice that 
is a witness that I am from the father you see they pushed Jesus that just in 
this chapter the seven Iams that are in the   Book of John two of them are found here I am the 
door I am the Good Shepherd apart from the other   us that before Abraham was I am another one I am 
the bread that came from Heaven another one I am   the True Vine another one which is call again 
today is that he said I am the resurrection and   the life that one is also very important to our 
study today Christ told them in verse 25 I told   you and you do not believe the works that I do 
in my father's name they bear witness of me I   am interested in verse 26 but you do not believe 
because you are not my sheep as I said to to you   Christ is telling the Jews the reason you can't 
understand this one is because you are not my   sheep my sheep hear my voice the reason you have 
a struggle to understand the problems that you are   going through is because you are no his sheep 
the reason why you are failing to understand   why you have to go through a test that 
you are going through is because you   are not his sheep my sheep know 
my voice they will not have a struggle the reason why you are 
always complaining about God not doing   is because you are not his sheep 
because you can't follow his steps by the way the reason why you 
cannot change your moral standards and   you know you think you can never 
change is because you are not in sheep the reason why you can 
never change your dressing Style   it must always be an immoral type it's 
because you are not a sheep if you are   a sheep it would be easy you would 
understand it you will be willing to transform he says same verse 26 he says 
but you do not believe because you are not of my sheep as I said to you verse 27 my sheep hear my voice and I know them and they 
follow me there are three words there that   to me are very important my sheep here 
my voice the word hear my sheep hear my voice and I know them that is 
another powerful one I know them and they follow me that 
word that God is telling us that they hear my voice who we can understand 
it that we can understand his sound we   can get the sound we can understand his 
language we can understand his dialect   we can understand his utterances 
we can understand his tone we may   understand his blasts you didn't get the last 
one you can understand his blasts when you are   on the wrong and he bless you you will hear it 
when you are moving away from him and he rebukes   you you will hear him rebuking you they hear 
me he is telling them you are not of my sheep that is why you are struggling to understand 
because my sheep they hear me when I talk to   them when I have blessed them they understand 
that and they rejoice in me when they go wrong   and I rebuke them they understand me they hear 
my voice when they sin and I bring unto them   punishment they really accept what is coming from 
the Lord because they they know my utterances they   understand the language in which I speak to them 
my sheep they know they they hear me and then   Christ is again saying and I know them Christ is 
telling you I understand them when they are down   I understand when they feel sad I understand 
them when they are encouraged I understand   them when they are having no peace I understand 
them or you can even translate the translate it   say I am acquainted with them when they are 
shedding tears I understand their tears when   they are in pain I understand their pain my 
sheep I know them I am acquainted with their grief when they are grieving I 
understand what is in their heart then he says and they follow me in all 
situations where we will be with my sheep   my sheep will be following me they will 
be walking with me another word I can call   it they accompany me they will make sure 
they accompany me as a Shepherd to where   I am taking them my sheep will accompany 
me to Jerusalem my sheep will accompany   me to the New Jerusalem I know my sheep 
hear my voice I know them and they follow me meaning that we will accompany Jesus whatever the situation 
whatever the challenge we understand   stand him and we will be willing to 
follow him after saying that in verse 27 he comes to verse 28 but I'll just 
read straight from 27 and 28 my sheep   hear my voice and I know them and they follow me   and I give them eternal life and they shall never 
perish neither shall anyone snatch them out of my hand you know some verses in 
the Bible are just beautiful   even when you just read them without 
explaining they're just beautiful Christ is telling who is Christ talking 
to by the way he is talking to these Jews   who are refusing to accept that Christ is 
the Son of God so here he is telling them   that if you f if you are really my sheep 
you will hear my voice I will know you   and you will follow me and if you do that if 
you believe if you believe I will lead you   to eternal life I give them I give if you look at 
it it's like not a conditional condition is there   yes for believing but it is not something that 
might or might might not happen it is definite   is saying I will give them eternal life those 
who will hear my voice Christ says I am giving   you I have given you it is present continuous I 
give them eternal life those who are accepting   the savior he is saying I am your Shepherd I give 
you eternal life and he says and they shall never perish let me that that that word translated 
as never in the original language it is not   one word but there are two words they have 
only translated one word and the reason why   they have translated one word is because if 
translated all of them they will mean the same thing never is a negation and the other one 
also is a negation saying no no never and it is the strongest kind of 
negation Christ is saying in that verse 28   I give them eternal life and they will 
not never perish meaning we can always   say certainly they will never perish 
surely they will never perish those who   hear my voice they will know they will 
not they will never perish that one is   telling you that this salvation that Christ is 
talking about is s the title of our seron is saying Safe in His Hand the title 
of our sermon is saying Safe in   His Hand Christ is saying those who 
are accepting me they will not never perish those who are following me certainly 
they will never perish eternal life is yours and because you hear his voice he is saying that you will never follow a stranger 
because you don't understand the language of   a stranger When a Stranger is coming to you 
and telling you have immoral associations you   will never follow a stranger When a Stranger is 
coming to you and telling you break your family   you will never follow a stranger because you don't 
understand the language of a stranger because you   know the shepherd only his voice you understand 
that is why in this verse 28 it is saying I give them and I give them eternal life and I give them eternal 
life and they shall never perish I've just slowed down we have not 
finished they shall never perish neither shall anyone snatch them out of my hand you didn't get that one Christ is saying 
those who are believing in me no one will ever   snatch them out of my hand I have put them here 
I have given them full protection no one no one   will snatch them out of my hand I was struggling 
to understand the meaning of snatch snatch them no   one can snatch them out of my hand then I thought 
it could be something that is decisive and sudden   somebody's coming suddenly to snatch us out of 
our savior's hand Christ is saying no never no   one can come suddenly and snatch us out of his 
hand but that one is still not enough snatching   could also be an open use of Force to take us 
out of his hand open demonstration of force   can the devil come and forcefully remove us from 
the hands of Jesus Christ says no one will snatch   you out of my hand I understand the strength 
of the devil he is just an angel I created   he has no power even in an open demonstration of 
strength the devil cannot St snat you out of my hand Deuteronomy 33:3 saying his holy ones 
are Safe in His Hands his holy ones are   Safe in His Hands no one can come to 
us and snatch us from the hands of   Jesus Jesus is persuading us children of God 
that sometimes life might be challenging but   trust me I am the shepherd accept that 
I help you look for the green pasture no wonder someone in the psalmist the 
in in the Book of Psalms someone just   said he looked at all these things and he 
just conclud concluded that the Lord is   my shepherd I shall not want the Lord is my 
shepherd He will keep me he will protect me someone is telling me as CHS are coming that 
I want to hear the voice of the Lord in all   the challenges that I have been going through 
I am going through I want to hear the voice   of the Lord some of you would be willing to come 
forward for a prayer after the song so you can be   coming forward but any of us who is 
saying Lord I want to hear your voice   as you talk to me and in your hands 
I will be safe please be standing up anyone who is telling the Lord I want to be hearing your voice and I will 
be safe just the same thing anyone of us is still   feeling that you need prayers that you may hear 
the Lord's voice you may get powers to hear the   Lord's voice and you want to be coming to the 
pulpit for prayers please can I see you you want   to be hearing the voice of the Lord the Lord will 
be able to keep you safe you understand between   you and your God and you're praying Lord help me 
much more hear your voice so that I may trust you   the more please come forward as corers are going 
to sing coras please come forward our last [Music] song someone is saying I would 
want to hear the voice of the Lord such that it will help me be safe in his hands you will be coming also as we sing it is for 
your prayer life for your spiritual life you would   want to depend upon the voice of the Lord that 
he talks to you you understand him you obey him   you know that the distance between you and him 
whether be whether a bigger distance a smaller   distance between you and your savior you are 
telling the Lord I want you to help me to hear   your voice to follow you I have challenges in my 
life and I want to follow [Music] you it is not a   call for baptism it is a call for your spiritual 
life that we can pray for your life that the Lord   may be able to transform you and change you 
I think it is song number 538 we can sing

TIMESTAMPED TRANSCRIPT:
[0.9s] as you
[3.7s] know today we will be talking
[13.6s] about our Savior Jesus Christ as he talks to 
us in the Book of John chapter 10 that I will  
[27.3s] be able to call it a survey of the Book of John 
and they are bringing to us something that is so  
[40.2s] dear to John about Jesus talking about Christ as 
the chief Shepherd and I invite you today that  
[55.7s] you will be able to go with me that we may survey 
The Book of John chapter 10 and in the survey of  
[65.7s] John chapter 10 I think you can if it's not ready 
you can come back later please you can come back  
[73.2s] later the topic of our sermon is safe in his hand 
safe in his hand and it is coming to us from the  
[88.6s] verse that has been read but we first read from 
verse 1-9 verse 1- 5 John chap 10 we read from  
[100.4s] verse 1-5 and it says most assuredly I say to you 
he who does not enter the Sheepfold by the door  
[111.7s] but climbs up some other way the same is a thief 
and a robber but he who enters by the door is The  
[123.2s] Shepherd of the sheep to him the doorkeeper opens 
and the sheep hear his voice and he calls his own  
[132.9s] Sheep by name and leads them out verse four and 
when he brings out his sheep he goes before them  
[143.3s] and the Sheep follow him for they know his voice 
yet yet they will by no means follow a stranger  
[156.0s] but will free flee from him for they do not know 
the voice of a stranger we may pause here John is  
[170.5s] elaborating to us what Jesus was telling the 
Pharisees it is good to understand who Jesus  
[181.1s] is talking to here and why would Jesus bring 
this story we get it from the previous chapter  
[193.8s] that Jesus did a miracle and opened the eyes of a 
man who was born blind after opening the eyes the  
[206.3s] Pharisees come and say and tell that man praise 
God give God glory this man is a sinner because  
[217.1s] he has healed you on a Sabbath day but this man is 
telling the Pharisees what I know a sinner cannot  
[229.7s] do something like that then they rebuked him you 
are also a sinner and then Jesus after after that  
[240.2s] meets this man because they had separated Jesus 
meets this man and tells this man would you want  
[248.0s] to know the Son of God then the man said who is 
it that I may be able to believe then Christ told  
[257.6s] him he is the one who is talking to you the man 
worshiped Jesus after worshiping Jesus and the  
[267.2s] Pharisees rejected Jesus Jesus comes to them and 
tells them most assuredly I say to you he who does  
[279.2s] not enter the shipold by the door and climbs on 
any other side the same is a thief and a robber  
[289.9s] why was Jesus talking about the sheep and the 
Sheepfold here and the door it it was always known  
[300.1s] that in the in the ancient times like uh 3,000 BC 
around that time from 3,000 BC it was always known  
[312.7s] that a Shepherd Kings and religious leaders were 
shepherds and sometimes they would call them that  
[323.9s] the shepherd is a humble Shepherd or the shepherd 
is a righteous Shepherd so the king is righteous  
[334.2s] the king is humble the king is doing well so the 
the shepherd was used inter interchangeably with  
[342.5s] a leader or a king and then it was known that now 
through that there is a door of entering the heart  
[352.0s] of the people so Christ is telling them that 
I am the door and anyone who wants to get into  
[363.8s] the lives of the children of God I am the door 
and then anyone who would want to take the sheep  
[376.7s] and would want to go to any other way through 
any other way that one is a thief and a robber  
[385.0s] anyone who would want to go through the door is 
the shepherd of the sheep so he's telling them if  
[394.4s] you want to enter into life if you want to lead my 
people also you need to go through the door that  
[407.8s] is why uh this verse is saying I say to you he who 
does not enter the shipold by the door but climb  
[419.9s] up some other way the same is a thief and a robber 
he who enters by the door is The Shepherd of the
[431.6s] Sheep next to that it says to him 
the doorkeeper opens and the sheep  
[446.0s] hear his voice Christ is saying saying 
that that man who is coming through the  
[454.5s] door the doorkeeper will open now the 
question would be who is the doorkeeper
[461.9s] now you know in in a metaphor there would be 
many debates yes but seemingly here you find  
[473.8s] that to that person the holy spirit opens the 
door if you are coming direct to the sheep and  
[484.7s] you are a Shepherd the holy spirit will open 
the door for you I think the question that  
[494.9s] Jesus Christ was answering to the Pharisees 
is that after doing a miracle of opening an  
[501.4s] eye of somebody who was born blind Christ 
is telling them that I am the lifegiver  
[510.1s] not only in this life but in the life to come 
so therefore Christ proceeds by saying in verse
[521.2s] four verse three still and the sheep hear his 
voice and he calls his [Music] own Sheep by name  
[539.7s] and he leads them out when he comes in Christ will 
call you by your name and he will lead you out  
[552.7s] leading you out to where he lead me to he leads 
me to the Green Pastures he will come in he will  
[563.7s] call me by name and he will lead me out it reminds 
me that this man knows where the pasture is and  
[574.1s] he will lead me to the Green Pastures in verse 
four he says and when he brings out his sheep he  
[584.9s] goes before them and the Sheep follow him for they 
know his voice and they will by no means follow a
[599.6s] stranger those who have been with the 
Lord those who have understood the
[611.4s] savior they understand his voice they know his
[619.5s] voice they walk with him when 
Christ speaks they understand him
[629.4s] him and they will by no means follow a stranger 
they can differentiate the voice of Satan from  
[642.2s] the voice of Jesus Christ when they are 
faced with challenges in the family and  
[650.2s] they are feeling that two voices are speaking 
there is one voice to commit sin and another  
[659.5s] voice to persevere they can differentiate 
the voice of a stranger and they will by  
[670.6s] no means follow a stranger so Christ is 
saying those who are mine they know me  
[680.4s] they understand me they hear my voice they 
will never follow a stranger then he tells
[690.1s] them he tells them in verse 7 
then Jesus said to them again  
[698.6s] most assuredly I say to you I am the door of the
[706.2s] sheep he is telling all of us nowhere else you 
can find a way out except through the door and he  
[719.8s] saying I am the door you are refusing to accept me 
and I am the door through the Sheep through to the  
[728.4s] Sheep so Christ is insisting that they understand 
him and in verse 9 as we jump it says Christ is
[740.4s] saying I am the Good
[745.0s] Shepherd the Good Shepherd gives his life for the
[753.1s] Sheep but a
[757.6s] hling he who is not the shepherd 
one who does not own the
[769.6s] Sheep SE the wolf
[780.2s] coming and leave leaves the sheep and 
flee I would want to repeat that part  
[792.9s] so that we get it Christ is 
saying that is verse 11 I am  
[799.1s] the Good Shepherd the good shepher 
gives his life for the Sheep but a
[810.4s] Hing he who is not the shepherd one who 
does not own the ship he sees the wolf  
[824.9s] coming and leaves the sheep and fleas 
away Christ is saying a good shepherd  
[839.8s] would take all his interest on the sheep I am 
the Good Shepherd I am not a hired servant a  
[851.4s] hired servant when wolf is coming will see that 
his own life is in danger and will run away he  
[863.1s] running away because he is not the owner of the 
ship but he has been hired so he's running away  
[871.8s] he doesn't care whether the Sheep is in danger 
so he will stick with the Sheep even unto
[880.9s] death when David David was a young boy but 
he came when the Philistines were fighting  
[898.4s] with the Israelites and there was this great 
Giant Goliath that defied the army of God for  
[909.5s] 40 days and when he just took some some food to 
the brothers where the brothers were fighting he  
[921.9s] saw this man and he was roed and he said what 
will be given to a man who who will kill this  
[930.0s] man and he was told that King sa had offered 
something then he said let no one's heart  
[940.1s] faint because I will go and fight him and Saul 
was told what David had said and he was very  
[949.0s] happy so Saul said bring the man who is going to 
fight Goliath and David was brought to to Saul  
[960.4s] when he saw David he saw a very small boy by 
the way you know if this you allow this boy to  
[966.5s] go and fight you will be defeated and when you 
are defeated the whole nation is defeated it is  
[972.8s] a great risk so Saul is really fearing to risk 
the life of the nation and he tells David in a  
[984.1s] polite manner boy you see you are very young 
but this man has been a man of war since his  
[995.3s] youth David said your servant was a shepherd 
and was keeping sheep in the wilderness and  
[1006.6s] when a lion came when a bear came I took them 
by the beard and I struck them and I saved
[1020.1s] a sheep from its
[1022.0s] jaws he will be like one of them David said 
what is David saying when a bear came when a  
[1034.2s] lion came they would better kill me rather than 
kill the Sheep I offered my life to die for the  
[1044.5s] sheep in the wilderness that is what David 
is saying and that is why Christ is saying I  
[1056.0s] am the Good Shepherd I am not [Applause] 
hired I am ready to lay my life for the
[1066.4s] Sheep a hirling will see the wolf coming and will 
run away because a hiring is not the owner of the
[1084.0s] sheep I am the Good Shepherd the 
Good Shepherd gives his life for the
[1094.2s] Sheep but a Hing he who is not the shepherd 
one who does not own the Sheep sees the wolf  
[1110.2s] coming and leaves the sheep and fleas and the 
Wolf catches the sheep and scatters them the  
[1121.7s] hireling flees because he is a Hing he is 
of pay and does not care about the Sheep  
[1133.5s] then Christ come comes back to say I am the 
Good Shepherd I know my sheep and I am known  
[1145.2s] by my sheep I know the people who trust 
me and the people who trust me they know
[1154.3s] me there is a large congregation I 
understand each one but all those  
[1167.3s] people who are coming before me and 
they trust me they understand my
[1174.2s] ways so they spoke like that Christ expressed to 
them this the reason is because they rejected him  
[1191.6s] but he is convincing them that there is no 
any other door you will pass through except  
[1199.0s] by Me by the way I am the shepherd I am the one 
giving you eternal life so after telling them that  
[1209.0s] they had a lot of debate debate I think it's verse 
21 that is telling us that they have had a lot of
[1215.7s] debate it is verse 20 19 that says therefore 
there was a division again among the Jews  
[1226.0s] because of the sayings of these says and 
many of these of of them said he has a
[1234.4s] demon and he is
[1238.1s] mad why do you listen to him 
you are listening to a mad
[1245.7s] man you see that that one is a 
total rejection they had rejected  
[1252.8s] he still talking to them they are still 
rejecting and saying Jesus Christ is mad
[1262.1s] then do you know what
[1262.9s] happens verse 21 is saying others said 
those are not the words of one who has
[1274.7s] demon can a demon Open the Eyes of the
[1281.0s] blind the way we see him talk  
[1288.7s] this man is not mad and when we see the 
things he has done this man is sent from
[1296.9s] God
[1301.6s] then he proceeds in verse 22 it proceeds in 
verse 22 and say that it was a feast and they  
[1316.9s] went to the feast in jerus j Jerusalem the 
same time same discourse in verse 23 and  
[1325.2s] Jesus walked in the temple in Solomon's por 
then the Jews surrounded him and said to him  
[1332.4s] how long do you keep us in doubt how long 
do you keep us in doubt meaning that when  
[1340.5s] they were debating themselves on someone 
some people are saying is mad and others  
[1344.9s] say no anyone who is mad cannot be able to 
give somebody and I then the discourse uh
[1355.8s] continues the far the the Jews come 
before him and they ask him now a  
[1367.5s] strict question for how long will you put us in
[1371.9s] darkness it is like you are the Son of 
God and you are not saying it and how  
[1381.7s] long will we be wondering whether you are 
the one or not if you are the one tell us
[1387.0s] plainly verse 25 says Jesus 
answered them answered them  
[1396.9s] and said I told you and you do not 
believe is that a very nice answer
[1410.5s] you wanted him to say it plainly is that thing not  
[1413.2s] plain I had told you but you did not 
believe what else do you want me to
[1422.7s] do the works that I do in my father's 
name they bear witness of me even the  
[1438.2s] one when I gave the ice that 
is a witness that I am from the
[1447.6s] father you see they pushed Jesus that just in 
this chapter the seven Iams that are in the  
[1460.1s] Book of John two of them are found here I am the 
door I am the Good Shepherd apart from the other  
[1468.5s] us that before Abraham was I am another one I am 
the bread that came from Heaven another one I am  
[1480.5s] the True Vine another one which is call again 
today is that he said I am the resurrection and  
[1492.7s] the life that one is also very important to our 
study today Christ told them in verse 25 I told  
[1505.8s] you and you do not believe the works that I do 
in my father's name they bear witness of me I  
[1518.4s] am interested in verse 26 but you do not believe 
because you are not my sheep as I said to to you  
[1529.8s] Christ is telling the Jews the reason you can't 
understand this one is because you are not my  
[1537.9s] sheep my sheep hear my voice the reason you have 
a struggle to understand the problems that you are  
[1550.3s] going through is because you are no his sheep 
the reason why you are failing to understand  
[1559.2s] why you have to go through a test that 
you are going through is because you  
[1566.6s] are not his sheep my sheep know 
my voice they will not have a
[1576.7s] struggle the reason why you are 
always complaining about God not doing  
[1588.5s] is because you are not his sheep 
because you can't follow his
[1592.9s] steps by the way the reason why you 
cannot change your moral standards and  
[1603.1s] you know you think you can never 
change is because you are not in
[1609.2s] sheep the reason why you can 
never change your dressing Style  
[1620.0s] it must always be an immoral type it's 
because you are not a sheep if you are  
[1628.0s] a sheep it would be easy you would 
understand it you will be willing to
[1634.0s] transform he says same verse 26 he says 
but you do not believe because you are
[1651.4s] not of my sheep as I said to you verse 27 my
[1660.8s] sheep hear my voice and I know them and they 
follow me there are three words there that  
[1673.3s] to me are very important my sheep here 
my voice the word hear my sheep hear my
[1683.9s] voice and I know them that is 
another powerful one I know
[1693.0s] them and they follow me that 
word that God is telling us that
[1710.1s] they hear my voice who we can understand 
it that we can understand his sound we  
[1720.0s] can get the sound we can understand his 
language we can understand his dialect  
[1730.2s] we can understand his utterances 
we can understand his tone we may  
[1738.4s] understand his blasts you didn't get the last 
one you can understand his blasts when you are  
[1747.8s] on the wrong and he bless you you will hear it 
when you are moving away from him and he rebukes  
[1756.9s] you you will hear him rebuking you they hear 
me he is telling them you are not of my sheep
[1770.8s] that is why you are struggling to understand 
because my sheep they hear me when I talk to  
[1780.6s] them when I have blessed them they understand 
that and they rejoice in me when they go wrong  
[1789.2s] and I rebuke them they understand me they hear 
my voice when they sin and I bring unto them  
[1801.8s] punishment they really accept what is coming from 
the Lord because they they know my utterances they  
[1814.6s] understand the language in which I speak to them 
my sheep they know they they hear me and then  
[1823.2s] Christ is again saying and I know them Christ is 
telling you I understand them when they are down  
[1837.8s] I understand when they feel sad I understand 
them when they are encouraged I understand  
[1847.2s] them when they are having no peace I understand 
them or you can even translate the translate it  
[1858.2s] say I am acquainted with them when they are 
shedding tears I understand their tears when  
[1867.5s] they are in pain I understand their pain my 
sheep I know them I am acquainted with their
[1877.7s] grief when they are grieving I 
understand what is in their heart
[1889.2s] then he says and they follow me in all 
situations where we will be with my sheep  
[1897.2s] my sheep will be following me they will 
be walking with me another word I can call  
[1904.3s] it they accompany me they will make sure 
they accompany me as a Shepherd to where  
[1913.2s] I am taking them my sheep will accompany 
me to Jerusalem my sheep will accompany  
[1921.2s] me to the New Jerusalem I know my sheep 
hear my voice I know them and they follow
[1931.6s] me meaning that we will accompany
[1939.0s] Jesus whatever the situation 
whatever the challenge we understand  
[1948.0s] stand him and we will be willing to 
follow him after saying that in verse
[1958.5s] 27 he comes to verse 28 but I'll just 
read straight from 27 and 28 my sheep  
[1971.2s] hear my voice and I know them and they follow me  
[1979.3s] and I give them eternal life and they shall never 
perish neither shall anyone snatch them out of my
[1996.9s] hand you know some verses in 
the Bible are just beautiful  
[2004.1s] even when you just read them without 
explaining they're just beautiful
[2011.2s] Christ is telling who is Christ talking 
to by the way he is talking to these Jews  
[2018.4s] who are refusing to accept that Christ is 
the Son of God so here he is telling them  
[2030.5s] that if you f if you are really my sheep 
you will hear my voice I will know you  
[2038.6s] and you will follow me and if you do that if 
you believe if you believe I will lead you  
[2051.0s] to eternal life I give them I give if you look at 
it it's like not a conditional condition is there  
[2063.4s] yes for believing but it is not something that 
might or might might not happen it is definite  
[2071.8s] is saying I will give them eternal life those 
who will hear my voice Christ says I am giving  
[2081.8s] you I have given you it is present continuous I 
give them eternal life those who are accepting  
[2093.4s] the savior he is saying I am your Shepherd I give 
you eternal life and he says and they shall never
[2106.4s] perish let me that that that word translated 
as never in the original language it is not  
[2119.2s] one word but there are two words they have 
only translated one word and the reason why  
[2125.7s] they have translated one word is because if 
translated all of them they will mean the same
[2131.9s] thing never is a
[2137.4s] negation and the other one 
also is a negation saying no no
[2146.0s] never and it is the strongest kind of 
negation Christ is saying in that verse 28  
[2158.5s] I give them eternal life and they will 
not never perish meaning we can always  
[2169.4s] say certainly they will never perish 
surely they will never perish those who  
[2179.9s] hear my voice they will know they will 
not they will never perish that one is  
[2190.2s] telling you that this salvation that Christ is 
talking about is s the title of our seron is
[2199.5s] saying Safe in His Hand the title 
of our sermon is saying Safe in  
[2211.3s] His Hand Christ is saying those who 
are accepting me they will not never
[2222.3s] perish those who are following me certainly 
they will never perish eternal life is
[2236.3s] yours and because you hear his voice he is
[2243.8s] saying that you will never follow a stranger 
because you don't understand the language of  
[2253.2s] a stranger When a Stranger is coming to you 
and telling you have immoral associations you  
[2263.5s] will never follow a stranger When a Stranger is 
coming to you and telling you break your family  
[2270.6s] you will never follow a stranger because you don't 
understand the language of a stranger because you  
[2280.0s] know the shepherd only his voice you understand 
that is why in this verse 28 it is saying I give
[2294.1s] them and I give them eternal
[2300.9s] life and I give them eternal 
life and they shall never
[2310.0s] perish I've just slowed down we have not 
finished they shall never perish neither shall
[2323.1s] anyone snatch them out of my
[2330.4s] hand you didn't get that one Christ is saying 
those who are believing in me no one will ever  
[2342.6s] snatch them out of my hand I have put them here 
I have given them full protection no one no one  
[2354.2s] will snatch them out of my hand I was struggling 
to understand the meaning of snatch snatch them no  
[2362.7s] one can snatch them out of my hand then I thought 
it could be something that is decisive and sudden  
[2371.4s] somebody's coming suddenly to snatch us out of 
our savior's hand Christ is saying no never no  
[2381.2s] one can come suddenly and snatch us out of his 
hand but that one is still not enough snatching  
[2390.2s] could also be an open use of Force to take us 
out of his hand open demonstration of force  
[2408.7s] can the devil come and forcefully remove us from 
the hands of Jesus Christ says no one will snatch  
[2418.0s] you out of my hand I understand the strength 
of the devil he is just an angel I created  
[2427.6s] he has no power even in an open demonstration of 
strength the devil cannot St snat you out of my
[2437.3s] hand Deuteronomy 33:3 saying his holy ones 
are Safe in His Hands his holy ones are  
[2457.4s] Safe in His Hands no one can come to 
us and snatch us from the hands of  
[2465.7s] Jesus Jesus is persuading us children of God 
that sometimes life might be challenging but  
[2478.5s] trust me I am the shepherd accept that 
I help you look for the green pasture
[2488.6s] no wonder someone in the psalmist the 
in in the Book of Psalms someone just  
[2496.3s] said he looked at all these things and he 
just conclud concluded that the Lord is  
[2503.8s] my shepherd I shall not want the Lord is my 
shepherd He will keep me he will protect me
[2518.2s] someone is telling me as CHS are coming that 
I want to hear the voice of the Lord in all  
[2527.9s] the challenges that I have been going through 
I am going through I want to hear the voice  
[2536.4s] of the Lord some of you would be willing to come
