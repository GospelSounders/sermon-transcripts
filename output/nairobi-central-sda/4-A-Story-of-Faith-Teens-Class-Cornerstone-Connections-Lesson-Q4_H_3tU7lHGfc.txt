welcomed her warmly and she decided to keep going there when her church closed she loved going to church now on Sabbath instead of Sunday she loved worshiping God because she knew that he takes care of the Siberian you pick people but then the Advent Pastor the Adventist Pastor left and the Adventist Church closed unfortunately there was no church in savong where great grandmother Harriet could worship she missed going to church but she had faith that the church would reopen because she knew God takes care of the Siberian you pick people a few years passed then an Adventist husband and wife

Sabbath great grandmother Harriet was so happy she could go to church again she loved going to church she loved worshiping God because she knew that he takes care of the Siberian up people then the

saying that we should persevere because the dawn is actually almost coming and that's a beautiful say way into our lesson for today which is entitled a story of Faith a story of Faith before we begin let me invite um the panelists with me here to introduce themselves starting with my far-left so hello my name is MTI namban hi I'm salmona hello I'm teacher Joan welcome all and my name is teacher Bridget I'll be your moderator for today now before we begin I'd like to invite Miss Sati to begin with prayer let's pray we thank you Lord for your goodness for your love for your mercy and for your compassion as we dive deep into the gems and the jewels of this lesson be with us and guide us in Jesus name we pray and we believe amen amen thank you so much now as we get into our lesson entitled a story of faith when you think of Faith there are some stories that quickly come to mind one of the stories is definitely Abraham going to sacrifice his only son Isaac there's also the story of Daniel being thrown into the lion's den but today we're going to look at a very interesting story of faith maybe one that um many do not consider or many do not think about when it comes to Faith but it's a very very interesting um aspect of faith that is brought out from our story today now before before we begin um I just like you to know where we are at this point in time now in our last quarter we were studying about how the Israelites had been scattered the Jews had been scattered in a foreign land they had been taken captive by King Nebuchadnezzar in Babylon and now they've stayed in this captivity for some time but one thing that was sure is that God had promised them that after 70 years that they would be free to go back to the land where they were supposed to be where they where God had promised them and so this time had ended the first decree had been given for the Jews to go back to their land but very few actually it said that there were about less than 50,000 who decided to go back to their land the others felt that they had become so comfortable in a foreign land the second decree came after a few years but still still very few people went and you know as I was reading this I drew a lesson from this that do you know is it possible for us to feel so comfortable in things of the world and for sake you know our Christianity because to be honest Christianity requires a lot of work you have to pray you have to fast at some times you have to keep studying the word of God you have to meet with other believers to keep on growing Christian is like a garden um I don't know how many of you have seen a garden or have a garden somewhere but if you have a garden the first time you've teed it you know you've prepared it the fertilizer is there you've sewn your seeds when the seeds begin to sprout they don't Sprout alone they sprout with weeds and funny thing is these weeds grow faster than the actual plants and you realize that if you do not take care of it for some time then it's um it's going to be terrible the weeds will just over grow and choke these plants and so it's a lesson that I got even just um as an introduction to where we are so we'll get right into the story but before that um why don't we go through the what do you think section of to dat CH Joan what's in our what do you think section today so on our what do you think section today this is a question that we are being asked it says how would you respond if you are facing persecution for your Christian beliefs how would you respond if you are facing persecution for your Christian beliefs the first um option is uh so we get to choose from this and I hope each and everyone of us here will get to choose one so the first one is remain faithful to God and His truth regardless of the consequences second option pray earnestly and first trusting God with a solution third one encourage your fellow Christian friend and ask them to join you in prayer fourth pray for those who persecute you that they may experience the love of Jesus and accept him as their personal Savior and friend lastly take matters into your own hands and deny your Christian faith for fear of punishment misati you're the first one right so I I can say for a fact that like the first few ones like first four things I would no okay other than the second one I really don't like like missing eating but for real so the thing is uh but mainly what I do is I would pray that these guys can experience the love of Christ I think personally I feel that's that's like a cheat code out of this cuz if someone feels the love of Christ then that love will prevent them from being like let's burn this guy cuz he does not agree with us I think I find that the better solution I think that was also Christ's method rather than like forcing someone to be like yo man your your delulu he's like no not that could we all love each other and respect each other's beliefs I find that to be the solution you know I find getting that personally is what would be most fulfilling to me yeah okay Bridget um I think I would choose to encourage um my fellow Christian friends and ask them to join me in prayer I believe so much in corporate prayer and I've seen it working a lot um sometimes even you alone don't have the strength to pray when things are going wrong and um maybe unlike misati I often feel like I want my enemies or the people persecuting me to go through painful situations so um I find it hard to pray for them and wish good for them which I really am praying to God to help me overcome but I'd really would encourage people around me to pray with me that you know situations turn around M yes uh I think for me clearly I wouldn't want to die but I wouldn't want to deny God so I'll pray honestly and fast trusting God with the absolute solution just hoping he'll save me in time for me not to die amen and in time for me not to deny him yeah yeah thank you I think I'd also go with encouraging my fellow Christian friends and asking them to join me in prayer there's something about fellowship and friends and there's a way friends can even make a situation look small yet it's big because of the jokes they make and you get to laugh about it and pray about it so I think it it will lift the heavy burden that I'll be having at that time back to you Bridget thank you so much for that now just in line with that there's a story that's given um as an illustration before we get into the main story of today so in Russia before the Berlin Wall came down um there were people people in Russia were not allowed to worship freely basically Christians could not worship freely so they often had to Worship in secret places so there was a certain day where there were a group of Believers gathered in a secret chamber um and um as they were praying some Russian soldiers came to where they were they got into the chamber and these soldiers actually had rifles and the thing those soldiers said if you're a Christian um and you trust in God um stay in this place but if you do not believe in God exit this place so they were given some time and slowly by slowly people started leaving because they had already seen that this um Christian this Russian soldiers had rifles so they were afraid for their lives it's like they were being persecuted after some time most people left and there were very few Christians who were left in that chamber then after they had left this Russian soldiers locked the door they stayed within that room with those few Christians shortly after they dropped their rifles and said we're also Christians we just wanted to see um who are the True Believers for us to worship with them and that's a a story that you know if it were to happen to us today you know should our lives be put on the line if you were to choose life or death um for the sake of admitting that you are a Christian that you worship God would you stay there or would you choose death um you know for Christ would you stay there and choose death or would you get out and save your life at the expense of you know denying your Christianity and that's part of the story that we're going to get into today so I'll invite Salon to take us right into our story for today after the so our story today is the story of Queen Esther I'm sure we quite familiar to it and after the queen had had defied the king king zis es she was chased away and Esther was chosen and then modai overheard some men plotting to kill the king he told Esther Esther told the king and they were hanged on a tree and after this a man called Harmon was honored and he was given the Ring of the king he was given power like he was like the second to the king so everyone was told to bow down to hamon when he was passing but modai did not bow down to hamon so hamon told the king there are some people who choose not to bow to me so can we make a decree that says that anyone who does not bow to me she will get killed and the King gives him the and tells him to go ahead and do what to go ahead and do whatever he wants so when Modi heard this he tore his clothes wor s cloth and wept and he told Esther's unx to go and tell Esther of this decree so Esther sent a reply and said to modai go and gather all the Jews who are in Susu and fast for me do not eat or drink for 3 days or night I and my attendance will fast as you do when this is done I will go to the king so Esther wanted her friends and her people to pray for her because he was going to see the king to ask her to to ask him to redeem her people so modai went away and carried out all of Esther's instructions amen thank you so much for that summary on our story of Esther now just to bring a bit more context into this story as I had started by saying um God had tried twice through decrees to tell the Jews who are scattered it's time for you to go back to your land because he had foreseen that things were going to get really dirty and dark in Middle Persia cuz at this point we the time of the mid Persian Empire and so here he is um he sent out two decrees but people are still comfortable where they are but one thing about our God and it's something that we see constantly Through the Bible and not only in the Bible but even in our lives God is very merciful he's very very merciful you can imagine these are people who had um decided to stay in a place where death was coming their way but God still wanted to save them from destruction and so he deviced a way he deviced a plan and it's interesting how Esther chapter 1 begins um you know with how this king king zarus who's he's he's quite extravagant yeah he decided he's going to um have a banquet for 180 days that's almost 6 months this guy must have been quite rich but he was quite extravagant you can imagine how much you can do with those resources that he spent during those 180 days he could have changed so much in his kingdom but he decided for 180 days I'm going to hold a banquet and then when it came to the wine he told the people I want you to drink as much as you can there's no limit you can imagine and you can imagine it wasn't the cheap wine guys it was you know some quality wine that they were taking there and um as you look at that you know the story just slowly unfolds and you see him you know when he's very drunk he decides to call out his queen queen vashi um to come and be SE by the other people but then you know she says no and slowly by slowly that is eventually how Esther found her way here now that the important lessons that we're going to learn and I think we learn those lessons by going through out of the story Salon you could take us through out of the story for today okay so our first question is in what way did Esther demonstrate through true faith in Jesus Christ I think the thing is she was open willing and ready to risk her life okay coming without any context like in my head I'm like why wouldn't you approach the king that's your husband as in like it seems so bizarre it's like man you are afraid you'll die but of course the thing is I'm sure the rules at that point the context brings out that because the King was to be kept extremely safe no unauthorized Personnel could be there unless they had been told and their rules were clear if the king is not pleased to behold someone no negotiations it's decapitation and whatnot so for her she was taking this risk of I could die and if I die then there is no more chance of any salvation to my people but at the same time if she did nothing then they would die nonetheless so it's like die or die so let's let me just try the dying part let me risk it yes absolutely okay so the next question what was the driving force that caused Esther to go before the king even if it was against the law and it risked her life as you said it was against the law and she would have been easily sentenced to die but what do you think drove her to doing that I think I would say that you realize before she went to the king it is said that she told all her people she said gather all the Jews from wherever they are and let them pray for me even here where I am together with all these um servants I have we're going to fast and we're going to pray and she did that for 3 days you can imagine they were not eating they were not drinking for 3 days straight and that just goes back to the point that I had said initially there's so much power in corporate prayer so this corporate prayer gave her some strength to actually realize that oh you know what if I perish I perish I'm going to do this and another lesson that I also picked from that is you know that sometimes we pray we are in the chambers with people we're praying for them let's say you're praying for someone who's sick in hospital you've prayed together but once you leave that hospital you're like hey truly God is this person really going to leave another day but you realize that Esther herself after prayer she decided I'm taking it on I'm going to see this King whether I die I die but I'm going to try it after all cuz we've prayed so it's the prayer that actually just propelled her to go can I add I also think that it's a genuine love for her people because if she didn't care about them should' be like y can die I'm I'm in the palace I mean what she was really selfless it showed a lot of I in her I see what Christ has been to us that he was that he risked his life to come and save us who have um wronged him in so many ways and I think in this way she was Christlike to risk her own life so that she can be able to save the life of those who people who are from her side amen question that may be out of con context but he in the lesson why do you think King zakus listened to hmon and granted him his wish I think the thing is Hama knew how to butter the king up he buttered him very well he was like there is a people in your kingdom who do not follow the rules that you stipulate therefore it would be most unwise for the king to retain this human beings that's are things very nice the K like by the way you make sense so let's let's finish them you know I think same thing with Nebuchadnezzar when it was brought before Daniel it was like there are people in this Kingdom who are planning to insubordinate you they do not worship you or your gods they do not fear you they think you are some other man and of course the believe here is that he believed he was God God reincarnate or son of whatever so that's the thing so by being by attacking him sort of indirectly and making him feel insecure hamon was able to be like King you and me we are solid and for me I only care about you and I also want you to live live long King and because of that the King was like wa that kill them yes and I think a lot of the Kings we see in the Bible um they don't do so well with flattery they really love the flattery and that flattery makes them make decisions which um later you see they end up regretting because it you know just contributes to that downfall yeah I think that's all for out of the story okay thank you so much um we've we've seen some beautiful lessons now how about um we get some insights from what Patriarchs and Prophets says for today in line with our story of Faith the story of Esther today all right so the trying experiences that came to God's people in the days of Esther were not peculiar to that age alone the Revelator looking down the ages the close of time has declared the dragon was wroth with the woman and went to make war with the remnant of her seed which keep the Commandments of God and have the testimony of Jesus Christ that is revelation 12:17 some who are today some who today are living on the earth will see these words fulfilled amen and you know that's um it may seem a bit scary but you realize these Jews a decree was given that they should be killed and if you if you've read that story it's funny how Hammon had told you know all the people at the gate they should bow to to him like when he's passing you know give me the homage I deserve and he was told that there's this guy there's this one guy modai he's whenever you pass he's not doing this and hamon was not impressed now you can imagine instead of assassinating or instead of just dealing with Mod himself he was like you know what he's not this is not the root problem the root problem is these people these Jews and he decided we're finishing off all these Jews so literally these guys were are told at a certain time next year you're going to be killed can you imagine being told that next year um December you guys um your death is coming what are you guys going to do you can imagine so it must have been something quite terrifying for them um and imagine that's what is being said here in the flashlight that just as you know those people of God were told that you know their death is coming so in the last days they're also going to be trouble last time and you know we're going to be tested and it's going to be like are you going to stand for God even though it means losing your life or are you going to forsake God and say you know after all what do I have to lose so it can be a bit terrifying but when you know what is at the end the Glorious end even when you look at the story of Esther and How It Ends there's always a glorious end the truth is to pay homage to he who deserves the true homage that is Jesus Christ so even as we proceed I'd like to invite CH Joan to take us through our key text for today and just give us a little insight on it our key text from the lesson so our key text is from Esther chapter 4 verse 15 and 16 Esther 4:1 15 and 16 and I will leave new king I will read new King James version in your hearing it says then Esther told them to reply to modai go gather all the Jews who are present at in shushan and fast for me neither eat nor drink for three days night and neither eat nor drink for three days night or day my mind my maids and I will Fast likewise and so I will go to the King which is against the law and if I perish I perish now that's courage yes man it's it's quite some courage and um you know the rhetorical question I just ask is how daring are you um when it comes to matters of God you know when you were young um I wouldn't advocate for this but when you were young there was a a game called Truth or Dare yes and you know You' you'd be dared to do things and some people would be so daring to actually do those things to the point that you wondering okay how how could you do this yeah but now the question for today is how daring can you be you know Esther was so daring to the point that she went to the king you know it is said in the Bible that no one could go to the king unless he had summoned you and when he summons you you only go in after he's raised his golden scepter so that you go and touch it and then that shows that he's accepted but Esther decided to go even without a sermon from the King and by God's grace the story goes on and you'll realize that she found favor in his sight and so you know whenever we trust God there's always favor that we'll get you know sometimes it's not even um immediate but those small acts of showing that you trust in God they culminate in you know some Grand favor some things happened to you you can't even imagine how they did yeah um I'd like us to just quickly go through um the Sunday part that says you know God will always be by our side whether we feel him there or not and it's true sometimes you feel like God has left you you're like I feel all alone yes but the truth is he's always by your side and sometimes we are so caught up in our own lives and problems that we forget that it's him we should depend on and not ourselves you know how many times do we carry burdens which honestly if we just let them go to God um we'd be much better of you know and it says however as in every good relationship there needs to be a consistent two-way communication God communicates with us through his word through the influence of his holy spirit on our conscience and through his unnumbered blessings in response we communicate with God through prayer through obedience to the teachings of his words and trust in him for everything that preoccupies us you realize that our relationship with God it's not just a one-way relationship of you know God I want God I need God thank you God it's not there's also a part that we need to play um you know as ourselves and there's nothing as beautiful that God desires from us than trusting in Him because he knows how our future looks like and now the question I just want to ask from that Sunday part is you know we've seen how God communicates with us and we've seen how we can communicate with him so what steps do you think we can take to ensure that we maintain our communication with God regularly because there's so much destruction there's so much influence there's a lot happening but what can we do practically as Christians to ensure that our communication with God is regular what do you guys think I am tempted to sing read your Bible pray read your Bible pray every day share that word if you want to grow yes amen any any other thoughts what do you think we can do I think I think on the foundation level I believe one needs to be able to advance in a relationship with God as a friend and the thing is with a friend you just tell a friend at odd moments for absolutely no reason I think we all have the experience so you just call your friend to be like yay I woke up this morning like and and that sort of thing or something seemingly so pretty and I think that's that's the right way like you approach God and you speak to God in a way that it's more of of camad rather than be like Yo God today there's something I need then when you get that thing you're like it's all good man I got it but after that you're like I am you don't talk to him again that is and I feel that that actually feels very sad you know if you are to like put yourself Po in the shoes god fine God is not a man but thing is if you just look at yourself and you're like if if you have someone in your life who the only time they ever call you is like yo I need this and the thing is someone's like buttering you up fast I'm like oh you're such a good person you said this I love you oh and by the way there's that thing I need and that feels very painful that it's such a pattern over and over and over again I feel that that hurts you know that's the thing and I think God is hurt at times like there are times it's he grieved that he had made human beings and I think it's such habits that lead to that I think at times you just need to talk to God and times I believe it's it's good as part of life as a Christian to be able to pray without buttering God like by the time I think that that's actually a great exercise like to say a prayer where not like God God God you did this you did that you're a good god without the butter without the salt without the spice and then you'll raw the way you are I believe that is how you build that relationship with God wow that's quite profound thank you for that I'd like to invite salmon on to please read for us our further Insight from today which is coming from prophets and Kings page 601 so the crisis that Esa faced demanded quick honest action but both she and modai realized that unless God should work mightily in their behalf their own efforts will be unavailing amen um God just did what he always does when you call on God you know he can quickly come through for you and that's what we see he did for Esther now as we come to a close um in our lesson for today you realize that Esther Queen Esther and the people trusted God you know this was a big thing their lives were at stake their death was looming yeah but you realize that maybe some people have not experienced you know such big things that they feel like they should pray to God about and I just want to encourage you that but you know what even the small things you can pray to God about um I don't know is it the grades that you're looking for is it true friends that you want is it you want to get out out you want to get out of you know negative influence is it that you're actually struggling to read your Bible is it that you're struggling with gossip you know those things that seem so small you can still pray to God about them it doesn't have to be an accident it doesn't have to be a sick person the most minute things and as MTI said make God your friend you can talk to him about absolutely anything and that's what he wants us to be that's how he wants us to be with him if you have any other thoughts you could just add as we now almost concludes yes Almon so I remember a few weeks ago I was at my aunt's place and I opened the door and a cut entered and she said get that cut away so I took it and threw it so I felt guilty because I had done that I I I felt very remorseful so I was thinking of what I should have done better should I have handled it with more care but then I prayed just asked God I'm sorry for what I did to the cat I really regret it the moment I said amen all the guilt had gone yeah you know prayer is a very powerful gift that God has given to us and we shouldn't exploit it for our needs as M said we should use prayer as means to build ourselves and build a relationship with God for us to be in heaven abely amen amen I like that and at the same time my mind is drawn to Psalms where I don't know which psalmist one psalmist records you are God's children Children of the most high so in essence when God created us imbued us with his spirit and with his breath he's like I want to have a relationship with you that is unique fine physically we are genetically similar to animals but like for a fact we are genetically similar to animals but God says that despite that in your flesh you resemble the bonobus monkey in your spirit you are in my image and that you are a God you are my child and what not amen amen wow um we'll just each pick one of the punch lines that you feel um you know spoke to you and maybe I'll start with mine um Mark 9:23 in the NIV version that says everything is possible for one who believes and you know we serve a God who is Limitless he gives us unnumbered blessings so with you believing with you having that faith and by the way we're not told to have a big faith it doesn't even have to be the size of your hand it's literally the size of a mustard seed you guys if you've seen a mustard seed I've not seen it in real life I've Googled it but that thing is Tiny it's minute so you just need even that little faith to move mountains so um maybe we can start from teacher Joan as we come back in terms of the punch lines just pick one and um yes we can proceed um mine is Luke 119 it says so I say to you ask and it will be given to you seek and you will find knock and the door will be opened to you yes I'll go with Proverbs 3:5 trust in the Lord with all your heart and lean not on your own understanding right right here is James 2:18 but someone will say you have faith I have Deeds show me your faith without deeds and I will show you my faith by my Deeds amen finally I just want to POS a question um if your life was ever in danger because of your Christian beliefs and you had to defend your faith what would you see in defense of your faith maybe you guys have not thought about it but it's actually something to think about now that we've seen in our flashlight section we've been told that you know the trbl last times are coming and you know you have to be ready to defend your faith you have to be ready to stand for God so you know what would you say in defense of your faith um any closing thoughts before we pray from anyone MTI any closing thoughts it's none at the present I believe we have thoroughly dissected this topic and jumped into it okay any closing thoughts I also have nothing to say Joan any closing thoughts yes sometimes hon can be someone in our workplace someone in class someone in our family and you feel like they're all over your business I think this shows us that the first person we need to go to is to Jesus and tell him about it then we can sort it out and talk to people who we need to talk to yeah amen amen thank you so much dear viewer for having us before we finish I'd like like to invite salmon to close for us with prayer let's pray our kind and loving father thank you for being with us and for guiding us through this lesson we will be with us as you guide our Christian Life and as we make friendship with you in Jesus name we pray and believe amen amen amen

[89.9s] and great granddaughters if you visit
[92.5s] her house on a summer afternoon you will
[95.2s] see that she is the only person who is
[97.4s] awake more likely than not you will find
[100.2s] great grandmother Harriet sitting in a
[102.8s] chair at the kitchen table sipping a
[105.0s] glass of

[110.2s] daughters and and granddaughters and
[112.6s] great granddaughters sleeping on

[120.0s] at 2:30 in the
[121.7s] morning when the snow melted finally the
[125.2s] church was closed meanwhile an SDA
[128.6s] Church opened in town great grandmother
[131.4s] Harriet went to the Adventist Church a
[133.5s] few times before her church
[136.0s] closed the people at the Adventist
[138.6s] Church welcomed her warmly and she
[140.8s] decided to keep going there when her
[142.9s] church closed she loved going to church
[146.0s] now on Sabbath instead of
[148.6s] Sunday she loved worshiping God because
[151.5s] she knew that he takes care of the
[154.1s] Siberian you pick people but then the
[158.2s] Advent Pastor the Adventist Pastor left
[161.2s] and the Adventist Church closed
[163.2s] unfortunately there was no church in
[166.0s] savong where great grandmother Harriet
[168.6s] could worship she missed going to church
[172.5s] but she had faith that the church would
[174.8s] reopen because she
[176.4s] knew God takes care of the Siberian you
[179.2s] pick people
[180.4s] a few years passed then an Adventist
[183.0s] husband and wife moved to Sava and
[185.6s] reopen the church the husband and wife
[188.3s] were retired nurses who came from Far
[191.1s] Far Away in North Carolina they
[193.8s] volunteered to live in Sava to make sure
[196.2s] that the church was open every Sabbath
[199.1s] great grandmother Harriet was so happy
[201.5s] she could go to church again she loved
[204.0s] going to church she loved worshiping God
[206.6s] because she knew that he takes care of
[208.5s] the Siberian up people
[211.4s] then the husband died the great
[213.8s] grandmother harried worried if the
[216.2s] church would close but the man's wife

[558.4s] wow what a beautiful message that is a
[561.8s] kiswahili song saying that we should
[564.2s] persevere because the dawn is actually
[566.8s] almost coming and that's a beautiful say
[569.6s] way into our lesson for today which is
[572.5s] entitled a story of Faith a story of
[576.8s] Faith before we begin let me invite um
[579.9s] the panelists with me here to introduce
[582.3s] themselves starting with my far-left
[585.8s] so hello my name is MTI
[590.5s] namban hi I'm
[593.5s] salmona hello I'm teacher Joan welcome
[597.5s] all and my name is teacher Bridget I'll
[599.6s] be your moderator for today now before
[602.2s] we begin I'd like to invite Miss Sati to
[605.2s] begin with prayer let's pray we thank
[608.3s] you Lord for your goodness for your love
[610.1s] for your mercy and for your compassion
[612.1s] as we dive deep into the gems and the
[614.0s] jewels of this lesson be with us and
[616.4s] guide us in Jesus name we pray and we
[618.3s] believe amen amen thank you so much now
[622.3s] as we get into our lesson entitled a
[625.2s] story of faith when you think of Faith
[628.2s] there are some stories that quickly come
[630.0s] to mind one of the stories is definitely
[633.2s] Abraham going to sacrifice his only son
[636.3s] Isaac there's also the story of Daniel
[639.6s] being thrown into the lion's den but
[642.2s] today we're going to look at a very
[643.8s] interesting story of faith maybe one
[646.9s] that um many do not consider or many do
[649.8s] not think about when it comes to Faith
[652.5s] but it's a very very interesting um
[655.0s] aspect of faith that is brought out from
[657.3s] our story today now before before we
[659.9s] begin um I just like you to know where
[663.0s] we are at this point in time now in our
[665.9s] last quarter we were studying about how
[668.8s] the Israelites had been scattered the
[670.8s] Jews had been scattered in a foreign
[673.5s] land they had been taken captive by King
[676.4s] Nebuchadnezzar in Babylon and now
[679.1s] they've stayed in this captivity for
[680.9s] some time but one thing that was sure is
[684.2s] that God had promised them that after 70
[687.9s] years that they would be free to go back
[690.5s] to the land where they were supposed to
[692.5s] be where they where God had promised
[694.4s] them and so this time had ended the
[698.1s] first decree had been given for the Jews
[701.3s] to go back to their land but very few
[704.4s] actually it said that there were about
[705.8s] less than 50,000 who decided to go back
[708.8s] to their land the others felt that they
[711.2s] had become so comfortable in a foreign
[713.9s] land the second decree came after a few
[717.6s] years but still still very few people
[721.0s] went and you know as I was reading this
[724.2s] I drew a lesson from this that do you
[727.0s] know is it possible for us to feel so
[729.6s] comfortable in things of the world and
[732.8s] for sake you know our Christianity
[735.1s] because to be honest Christianity
[738.2s] requires a lot of work you have to pray
[741.4s] you have to fast at some times you have
[743.8s] to keep studying the word of God you
[745.9s] have to meet with other believers to
[747.7s] keep on growing Christian is like a
[750.0s] garden um I don't know how many of you
[752.3s] have seen a garden or have a garden
[754.3s] somewhere but if you have a garden the
[756.9s] first time you've teed it you know
[758.4s] you've prepared it the fertilizer is
[760.4s] there you've sewn your seeds when the
[762.3s] seeds begin to sprout they don't Sprout
[764.7s] alone they sprout with weeds and funny
[767.6s] thing is these weeds grow faster than
[770.7s] the actual plants and you realize that
[773.4s] if you do not take care of it for some
[775.5s] time then it's um it's going to be
[777.6s] terrible the weeds will just over grow
[779.5s] and choke these plants and so it's a
[781.7s] lesson that I got even just um as an
[784.0s] introduction to where we are so we'll
[786.5s] get right into the story but before that
[789.2s] um why don't we go through the what do
[790.8s] you think section of to dat CH Joan
[792.9s] what's in our what do you think section
[797.7s] today so on
[800.4s] our what do you think section today this
[803.3s] is a question that we are being asked it
[805.2s] says how would you respond if you are
[807.8s] facing persecution for your Christian
[810.4s] beliefs how would you respond if you are
[812.8s] facing persecution for your Christian
[816.3s] beliefs the first um option is uh so we
[820.0s] get to choose from this and I hope each
[822.5s] and everyone of us here will get to
[823.9s] choose one so the first one is remain
[826.1s] faithful to God and His truth regardless
[828.5s] of the consequences second option pray
[831.8s] earnestly and first trusting God with a
[835.2s] solution third one encourage your fellow
[838.2s] Christian friend and ask them to join
[840.3s] you in prayer fourth pray for those who
[843.5s] persecute you that they may experience
[845.7s] the love of Jesus and accept him as
[848.0s] their personal Savior and friend lastly
[851.7s] take matters into your own hands and
[853.6s] deny your Christian faith for fear of
[856.4s] punishment misati you're the first one
[859.2s] right so I I can say for a fact that
[862.7s] like the first few ones like first four
[865.6s] things I would no okay other than the
[867.7s] second one I really don't like like
[869.3s] missing eating but for real so the thing
[872.2s] is uh but mainly what I do is I would
[875.5s] pray that these guys can experience the
[877.1s] love of Christ I think personally I feel
[879.8s] that's that's like a cheat code out of
[881.3s] this cuz if someone feels the love of
[883.2s] Christ then that love will prevent them
[885.6s] from being like let's burn this guy cuz
[888.1s] he does not agree with us I think I find
[890.4s] that the better solution I think that
[892.1s] was also Christ's method rather than
[895.0s] like forcing someone to be like yo man
[897.4s] your your delulu he's like no not that
[901.6s] could we all love each other and respect
[904.4s] each other's beliefs I find that to be
[907.1s] the solution you know I find getting
[910.2s] that personally is what would be most
[912.6s] fulfilling to me yeah okay
[916.8s] Bridget um I think I would choose to
[920.6s] encourage um my fellow Christian friends
[923.5s] and ask them to join me in prayer I
[925.9s] believe so much in corporate prayer and
[928.2s] I've seen it working a lot um sometimes
[931.5s] even you alone don't have the strength
[933.6s] to pray when things are going wrong and
[936.9s] um maybe unlike misati I often feel like
[940.5s] I want my enemies or the people
[942.5s] persecuting me to go through painful
[945.1s] situations so um I find it hard to pray
[948.6s] for them and wish good for them which I
[950.7s] really am praying to God to help me
[952.5s] overcome but I'd really would encourage
[955.1s] people around me to pray with me that
[957.1s] you know situations turn around
[959.6s] M yes uh I think for me clearly I
[963.5s] wouldn't want to die but I wouldn't want
[966.1s] to deny God so I'll pray honestly and
[969.2s] fast trusting God with the absolute
[971.7s] solution just hoping he'll save me in
[974.2s] time for me not to die amen and in time
[976.8s] for me not to deny him yeah yeah thank
[980.4s] you I think I'd also go with encouraging
[982.4s] my fellow Christian friends and asking
[984.1s] them to join me in prayer there's
[986.2s] something about fellowship and friends
[988.2s] and there's a way friends can even make
[991.1s] a situation look small yet it's big
[994.2s] because of the jokes they make and you
[996.0s] get to laugh about it and pray about it
[998.6s] so I think it it will lift the heavy
[1000.5s] burden that I'll be having at that time
[1002.8s] back to you Bridget thank you so much
[1005.0s] for that now just in line with that
[1007.4s] there's a story that's given um as an
[1010.0s] illustration before we get into the main
[1012.2s] story of today so in Russia before the
[1015.6s] Berlin Wall came down um there were
[1018.4s] people people in Russia were not allowed
[1020.4s] to worship freely basically Christians
[1022.9s] could not worship freely so they often
[1025.4s] had to Worship in secret places so there
[1027.8s] was a certain day where there were a
[1029.4s] group of Believers gathered in a secret
[1031.9s] chamber um and um as they were praying
[1035.5s] some Russian soldiers came to where they
[1038.2s] were they got into the chamber and these
[1040.8s] soldiers actually had rifles and the
[1043.6s] thing those soldiers said if you're a
[1046.4s] Christian um and you trust in God
[1049.4s] um stay in this place but if you do not
[1051.9s] believe in God exit this place so they
[1055.2s] were given some time and slowly by
[1058.0s] slowly people started leaving because
[1060.7s] they had already seen that this um
[1063.0s] Christian this Russian soldiers had
[1065.6s] rifles so they were afraid for their
[1067.1s] lives it's like they were being
[1069.0s] persecuted after some time most people
[1071.9s] left and there were very few Christians
[1074.8s] who were left in that chamber then after
[1077.6s] they had left this Russian soldiers
[1079.7s] locked the door they stayed within that
[1082.2s] room with those few Christians shortly
[1084.7s] after they dropped their rifles and said
[1087.5s] we're also Christians we just wanted to
[1090.0s] see um who are the True Believers for us
[1092.7s] to worship with them and that's a a
[1095.6s] story that you know if it were to happen
[1098.2s] to us today you know should our lives be
[1100.8s] put on the line if you were to choose
[1103.2s] life or death um for the sake of
[1106.0s] admitting that you are a Christian that
[1107.6s] you worship God would you stay there or
[1110.2s] would you choose death um you know for
[1112.9s] Christ would you stay there and choose
[1114.6s] death or would you get out and save your
[1116.5s] life at the expense of you know denying
[1118.8s] your Christianity and that's part of the
[1121.3s] story that we're going to get into today
[1123.6s] so I'll invite Salon to take us right
[1126.1s] into our story for
[1128.3s] today after the so our story today is
[1132.5s] the story of Queen Esther I'm sure we
[1135.4s] quite familiar to it and after
[1139.2s] the queen had had defied the king king
[1144.7s] zis es she was chased away and Esther
[1147.8s] was chosen and then modai overheard some
[1153.4s] men plotting
[1155.0s] to kill the king he told Esther Esther
[1158.8s] told the king and they were hanged on a
[1161.9s] tree and after
[1164.2s] this a man called
[1166.7s] Harmon was honored and he was given the
[1170.5s] Ring of the king he was given power like
[1172.9s] he was like the second to the king so
[1176.7s] everyone was told to bow down to hamon
[1179.4s] when he was passing but modai did not
[1182.2s] bow down to hamon so hamon told the king
[1185.6s] there are some people who choose not to
[1188.1s] bow to me so can we make a decree that
[1190.8s] says that anyone who does not bow to me
[1194.2s] she will get killed and the King gives
[1198.2s] him the and tells him to go ahead and do
[1202.3s] what to go ahead and do whatever he
[1205.8s] wants so when Modi heard this he tore
[1210.1s] his clothes wor s cloth and wept and he
[1215.1s] told Esther's unx to go and tell Esther
[1218.9s] of this decree so Esther sent a reply
[1222.2s] and said to modai go and gather all the
[1225.1s] Jews who are in Susu and fast for me do
[1228.5s] not eat or drink for 3 days or
[1232.1s] night I and my attendance will fast as
[1235.0s] you do when this is done I will go to
[1237.5s] the king so Esther wanted her friends
[1240.7s] and her people to pray for her because
[1242.9s] he was going to see the king to ask her
[1246.2s] to to ask him to redeem her people so
[1248.9s] modai went away and carried out all of
[1251.8s] Esther's
[1253.8s] instructions amen thank you so much for
[1256.2s] that summary on our story of Esther
[1259.2s] now just to bring a bit more context
[1261.5s] into this story as I had started by
[1264.5s] saying um God had tried twice through
[1268.6s] decrees to tell the Jews who are
[1272.0s] scattered it's time for you to go back
[1274.2s] to your land because he had foreseen
[1277.1s] that things were going to get really
[1278.7s] dirty and dark in Middle Persia cuz at
[1281.8s] this point we the time of the mid
[1283.3s] Persian Empire and so here he is um he
[1287.1s] sent out two decrees but people are
[1289.4s] still comfortable where they are but one
[1291.7s] thing about our God and it's something
[1293.9s] that we see constantly Through the Bible
[1297.0s] and not only in the Bible but even in
[1298.6s] our lives God is very merciful he's very
[1302.6s] very merciful you can imagine these are
[1305.4s] people who had um decided to stay in a
[1308.4s] place where death was coming their way
[1311.0s] but God still wanted to save them from
[1314.0s] destruction and so he deviced a way he
[1317.8s] deviced a plan and it's interesting how
[1320.5s] Esther chapter 1 begins um you know with
[1323.8s] how this king king zarus who's he's he's
[1327.3s] quite extravagant yeah he decided he's
[1330.2s] going to um have a banquet for 180 days
[1334.4s] that's almost 6 months this guy must
[1336.7s] have been quite rich but he was quite
[1339.2s] extravagant you can imagine how much you
[1342.0s] can do with those resources that he
[1344.0s] spent during those 180 days he could
[1346.5s] have changed so much in his kingdom but
[1348.9s] he decided for 180 days I'm going to
[1351.3s] hold a banquet and then when it came to
[1354.2s] the wine he told the people I want you
[1356.0s] to drink as much as you can there's no
[1358.4s] limit you can imagine and you can
[1360.4s] imagine it wasn't the cheap wine guys it
[1362.2s] was you know some quality wine that they
[1364.6s] were taking there and um as you look at
[1368.0s] that you know the story just slowly
[1370.0s] unfolds and you see him you know when
[1372.6s] he's very drunk he decides to call out
[1375.4s] his queen queen vashi um to come and be
[1378.2s] SE by the other people but then you know
[1381.0s] she says no and slowly by slowly that is
[1383.6s] eventually how Esther found her way here
[1386.1s] now that the important lessons that
[1387.8s] we're going to learn and I think we
[1389.6s] learn those lessons by going through out
[1391.5s] of the story Salon you could take us
[1393.2s] through out of the story for today okay
[1396.1s] so our first question is in what way did
[1399.7s] Esther demonstrate through true faith in
[1402.2s] Jesus
[1404.4s] Christ I think the thing is she was open
[1407.4s] willing and ready to risk her life okay
[1410.8s] coming without any context like in my
[1413.1s] head I'm like why wouldn't you approach
[1415.2s] the king that's your husband as in like
[1418.0s] it seems so bizarre it's like man you
[1420.6s] are afraid you'll die but of course the
[1422.6s] thing is I'm sure the rules at that
[1424.3s] point the context brings out that
[1426.5s] because the King was to be kept
[1428.1s] extremely safe no
[1430.6s] unauthorized Personnel could be there
[1433.1s] unless they had been told and their
[1435.0s] rules were clear if the king is not
[1437.4s] pleased to behold someone no
[1440.3s] negotiations it's decapitation and
[1443.2s] whatnot so for her she was taking this
[1445.5s] risk of I could die and if I die then
[1450.1s] there is no more chance of any salvation
[1453.3s] to my people but at the same time if she
[1456.3s] did nothing then they would die
[1458.7s] nonetheless so it's like die or die so
[1461.9s] let's let me just try the dying part let
[1465.7s] me risk it yes absolutely
[1470.3s] okay so the next question what was the
[1473.3s] driving force that caused Esther to go
[1475.4s] before the king even if it was against
[1478.1s] the law and it risked her life as you
[1481.0s] said it was against the law and she
[1483.4s] would have been easily sentenced to die
[1486.3s] but what do you think drove her to doing
[1489.8s] that I think I would say that you
[1493.0s] realize before she went to the king it
[1496.2s] is said that she told
[1499.0s] all her people she said gather all the
[1501.1s] Jews from wherever they are and let them
[1503.5s] pray for me even here where I am
[1506.1s] together with all these um servants I
[1508.0s] have we're going to fast and we're going
[1509.8s] to pray and she did that for 3 days you
[1512.8s] can imagine they were not eating they
[1514.5s] were not drinking for 3 days straight
[1517.7s] and that just goes back to the point
[1519.9s] that I had said initially there's so
[1521.9s] much power in corporate prayer so this
[1525.4s] corporate prayer gave her some strength
[1527.5s] to actually realize that oh you know
[1529.8s] what if I perish I perish I'm going to
[1532.6s] do this and another lesson that I also
[1534.8s] picked from that is you know that
[1536.7s] sometimes we pray we are in the chambers
[1539.7s] with people we're praying for them let's
[1541.3s] say you're praying for someone who's
[1542.4s] sick in hospital you've prayed together
[1545.2s] but once you leave that hospital you're
[1546.8s] like hey truly God is this person really
[1549.8s] going to leave another day but you
[1551.8s] realize that Esther herself after prayer
[1554.8s] she decided I'm taking it on I'm going
[1557.2s] to see this King
[1559.2s] whether I die I die but I'm going to try
[1561.5s] it after all cuz we've prayed so it's
[1563.4s] the prayer that actually just propelled
[1565.8s] her to go can I add I also think that
[1569.2s] it's a genuine love for her people
[1572.7s] because if she didn't care about them
[1574.3s] should' be like y can die I'm I'm in the
[1576.8s] palace I mean what she was really
[1579.4s] selfless it showed a lot of I in her I
[1582.9s] see what Christ has been to us that he
[1586.1s] was that he risked his life to come and
[1588.6s] save us who have um wronged him in so
[1591.9s] many ways and I think in this way she
[1594.2s] was Christlike to risk her own life so
[1597.2s] that she can be able to save the life of
[1599.2s] those who people who are from her side
[1602.4s] amen question that may be out of con
[1605.4s] context but he in the lesson why do you
[1608.6s] think King zakus listened to hmon and
[1611.4s] granted him his
[1613.4s] wish I think the thing is Hama knew how
[1615.8s] to butter the king up he buttered him
[1618.7s] very well he was like there is a people
[1621.7s] in your kingdom who do not follow the
[1625.1s] rules that you
[1627.2s] stipulate therefore it would be most
[1630.8s] unwise for the king to retain this human
[1634.5s] beings that's are things very nice the K
[1637.4s] like by the way you make sense so let's
[1640.4s] let's finish them you know I think same
[1642.0s] thing with Nebuchadnezzar when it was
[1643.9s] brought before Daniel it was like there
[1645.9s] are people in this Kingdom who are
[1647.7s] planning to insubordinate you they do
[1649.8s] not worship you or your gods they do not
[1652.2s] fear you they think you are some other
[1654.7s] man and of course the believe here is
[1656.5s] that he believed he was God God
[1658.1s] reincarnate or son of whatever so that's
[1661.1s] the thing so by being by attacking him
[1664.3s] sort of indirectly and making him feel
[1667.2s] insecure hamon was able to be like
[1671.4s] King you and me we are solid and for me
[1675.7s] I only care about you and I also want
[1678.3s] you to live live long King and because
[1681.4s] of that the King was like wa that kill
[1685.1s] them yes and I think a lot of the Kings
[1687.8s] we see in the Bible um they don't do so
[1690.6s] well with flattery they really love the
[1693.2s] flattery and that flattery makes them
[1695.9s] make decisions which um later you see
[1699.0s] they end up regretting because it you
[1700.9s] know just contributes to that
[1704.3s] downfall yeah I think that's all for out
[1707.3s] of the story
[1708.8s] okay thank you so much um we've we've
[1711.0s] seen some beautiful lessons now how
[1713.6s] about um we get some insights from what
[1716.7s] Patriarchs and Prophets says for today
[1719.0s] in line with our story of Faith the
[1720.9s] story of Esther today all right so the
[1723.0s] trying experiences that came to God's
[1725.0s] people in the days of Esther were not
[1726.9s] peculiar to that age alone the Revelator
[1729.4s] looking down the ages the close of time
[1732.2s] has declared the dragon was wroth with
[1734.5s] the woman and went to make war with the
[1736.2s] remnant of her seed which keep the
[1738.1s] Commandments of God and have the
[1739.4s] testimony of Jesus Christ that is
[1741.2s] revelation 12:17 some who are today some
[1744.4s] who today are living on the earth will
[1747.1s] see these words
[1749.6s] fulfilled amen and you know that's um it
[1753.4s] may seem a bit scary but you realize
[1756.7s] these Jews a decree was given that they
[1759.5s] should be killed and if you if you've
[1761.2s] read that
[1762.2s] story it's funny how Hammon had told you
[1765.8s] know all the people at the gate they
[1767.2s] should bow to to him like when he's
[1769.5s] passing you know give me the homage I
[1772.0s] deserve and he was told that there's
[1774.2s] this guy there's this one guy
[1776.3s] modai he's whenever you pass he's not
[1779.2s] doing this and hamon was not impressed
[1782.3s] now you can imagine instead of
[1783.9s] assassinating or instead of just dealing
[1785.8s] with Mod himself he was like you know
[1787.6s] what he's not this is not the root
[1789.9s] problem the root problem is these people
[1792.1s] these Jews and he decided we're
[1794.3s] finishing off all these Jews so
[1796.6s] literally these guys were are told at a
[1799.3s] certain time next year you're going to
[1801.8s] be killed can you imagine being told
[1803.6s] that next year um December you guys um
[1807.8s] your death is coming what are you guys
[1809.6s] going to do you can imagine so it must
[1811.8s] have been something quite terrifying for
[1813.8s] them um and imagine that's what is being
[1816.0s] said here in the flashlight that just as
[1818.9s] you know those people of God were told
[1821.7s] that you know their death is coming so
[1824.4s] in the last days they're also going to
[1826.9s] be trouble last time
[1828.6s] and you know we're going to be tested
[1830.1s] and it's going to be like are you going
[1831.6s] to stand for God even though it means
[1834.3s] losing your life or are you going to
[1836.4s] forsake God and say you know after all
[1840.0s] what do I have to lose so it can be a
[1842.5s] bit terrifying but when you know what is
[1845.3s] at the end the Glorious end even when
[1847.7s] you look at the story of Esther and How
[1849.5s] It Ends there's always a glorious end
[1852.5s] the truth is to pay homage to he who
[1855.4s] deserves the true homage that is Jesus
[1858.1s] Christ so even as we proceed I'd like to
[1861.0s] invite CH Joan to take us through our
[1863.3s] key text for today and just give us a
[1865.6s] little insight on it our key text from
[1868.6s] the
[1870.1s] lesson so our key text is from Esther
[1873.2s] chapter 4 verse 15 and
[1876.0s] 16 Esther 4:1 15 and 16 and I will leave
[1880.2s] new king I will read new King James
[1882.6s] version in your hearing it says then
[1885.3s] Esther told them to reply to modai go
[1888.7s] gather all the Jews who are present at
[1891.1s] in shushan and fast for me neither eat
[1894.8s] nor drink for three days
[1897.3s] night and neither eat nor drink for
[1900.6s] three days night or day my mind my maids
[1904.5s] and I will Fast likewise and so I will
[1906.8s] go to the King which is against the law
[1909.1s] and if I perish I perish now that's
[1913.3s] courage yes man it's it's quite some
[1916.6s] courage and um you know the rhetorical
[1919.7s] question I just ask is how daring are
[1923.1s] you um when it comes to matters of God
[1926.8s] you know when you were young um I
[1928.6s] wouldn't advocate for this but when you
[1930.2s] were young there was a a game called
[1932.1s] Truth or Dare yes and you know You'
[1935.0s] you'd be dared to do things and some
[1937.7s] people would be so daring to actually do
[1939.8s] those things to the point that you
[1941.2s] wondering okay how how could you do this
[1944.2s] yeah but now the question for today is
[1947.0s] how daring can you be you know Esther
[1949.7s] was so daring to the point that she went
[1952.5s] to the king you know it is said in the
[1954.2s] Bible that no one could go to the king
[1956.9s] unless he had summoned you and when he
[1959.8s] summons you you only go in after he's
[1962.0s] raised his golden scepter so that you go
[1963.9s] and touch it and then that shows that
[1965.2s] he's accepted but Esther decided to go
[1968.3s] even without a sermon from the King and
[1971.8s] by God's grace the story goes on and
[1973.8s] you'll realize that she found favor in
[1976.0s] his sight and so you know whenever we
[1978.9s] trust God there's always favor that
[1982.4s] we'll get you know sometimes it's not
[1984.5s] even um immediate but those small acts
[1988.2s] of showing that you trust in God they
[1990.6s] culminate in you know some Grand favor
[1993.2s] some things happened to you you can't
[1994.7s] even imagine how they did yeah um I'd
[1997.8s] like us to just quickly go through um
[2000.8s] the Sunday part that says you know God
[2003.5s] will always be by our side whether we
[2006.7s] feel him there or not and it's true
[2009.2s] sometimes you feel like God has left you
[2011.2s] you're like I feel all alone yes but the
[2014.2s] truth is he's always by your side and
[2016.4s] sometimes we are so caught up in our own
[2018.0s] lives and problems that we forget that
[2020.9s] it's him we should depend on and not
[2022.8s] ourselves you know how many times do we
[2024.8s] carry burdens which honestly if we just
[2028.0s] let them go to God um we'd be much
[2031.4s] better of you know and it says however
[2034.7s] as in every good relationship there
[2036.4s] needs to be a consistent two-way
[2039.0s] communication God communicates with us
[2041.3s] through his word through the influence
[2043.5s] of his holy spirit on our conscience and
[2046.0s] through his unnumbered blessings in
[2049.3s] response we communicate with God through
[2051.9s] prayer through obedience to the
[2054.0s] teachings of his words and trust in him
[2056.6s] for everything that preoccupies us you
[2059.8s] realize that our relationship with God
[2063.1s] it's not just a one-way relationship of
[2065.4s] you know God I want God I need God thank
[2068.0s] you God it's not there's also a part
[2070.9s] that we need to play um you know as
[2073.2s] ourselves and there's nothing as
[2075.4s] beautiful that God desires from us than
[2078.2s] trusting in Him because he knows how our
[2081.2s] future looks like and now the question I
[2083.7s] just want to ask from that Sunday part
[2085.8s] is you know we've seen how God
[2088.0s] communicates with us and we've seen how
[2089.8s] we can communicate with him so what
[2092.2s] steps do you think we can take to ensure
[2095.5s] that we maintain our communication with
[2097.5s] God regularly because there's so much
[2100.6s] destruction there's so much influence
[2103.2s] there's a lot happening but what can we
[2105.8s] do practically as Christians to ensure
[2109.3s] that our communication with God is
[2112.0s] regular what do you guys
[2114.3s] think I am tempted to sing read your
[2117.4s] Bible pray read your Bible pray every
[2120.8s] day share that word if you want to grow
[2123.9s] yes amen any any other thoughts what do
[2127.0s] you think we can do I think I think on
[2129.2s] the foundation level I believe one needs
[2131.9s] to be able to advance in a relationship
[2134.1s] with God as a friend and the thing is
[2136.4s] with a friend you just tell a friend at
[2139.1s] odd
[2140.2s] moments for absolutely no reason I think
[2142.8s] we all have the experience so you just
[2144.0s] call your friend to be like yay I woke
[2146.5s] up this morning like and and that sort
[2149.0s] of thing or something seemingly so
[2150.7s] pretty and I think that's that's the
[2152.4s] right way like you approach God and you
[2154.9s] speak to God in a way that it's more of
[2157.7s] of camad rather than be like Yo God
[2160.8s] today there's something I need then when
[2163.2s] you get that thing you're like it's all
[2165.1s] good man I got it but after that you're
[2167.3s] like I am you don't talk to him again
[2170.1s] that is and I feel that that actually
[2171.9s] feels very sad you know if you are to
[2174.5s] like put yourself Po in the shoes god
[2176.6s] fine God is not a man but thing is if
[2178.9s] you just look at yourself and you're
[2180.8s] like if if you have someone in your life
[2183.1s] who the only time they ever call you is
[2184.9s] like yo I need this and the thing is
[2187.8s] someone's like buttering you up fast I'm
[2190.2s] like oh you're such a good person you
[2192.4s] said this I love you oh and by the way
[2195.9s] there's that thing I need and that feels
[2198.6s] very painful that it's such a pattern
[2201.5s] over and over and over again I feel that
[2204.4s] that hurts you know that's the thing and
[2206.2s] I think God is hurt at times like there
[2208.8s] are times it's he
[2211.3s] grieved that he had made human beings
[2213.8s] and I think it's such habits that lead
[2216.1s] to that I think at times you just need
[2217.6s] to talk to God and times I believe it's
[2220.0s] it's good as part of life as a Christian
[2222.3s] to be able to pray without buttering God
[2226.0s] like by the time I think that that's
[2227.5s] actually a great exercise like to say a
[2229.8s] prayer where not like God God God you
[2232.2s] did this you did that you're a good god
[2234.2s] without the butter without the salt
[2236.6s] without the spice and then you'll raw
[2238.5s] the way you are I believe that is how
[2240.4s] you build that relationship with God wow
[2243.4s] that's quite profound thank you for that
[2246.1s] I'd like to invite salmon on to please
[2248.5s] read for us our further Insight from
[2250.8s] today which is coming from prophets and
[2253.2s] Kings page
[2255.5s] 601 so the crisis that Esa faced
[2258.4s] demanded quick honest action but both
[2261.2s] she and modai realized that unless God
[2263.7s] should work mightily in their behalf
[2266.4s] their own efforts will be
[2268.5s] unavailing amen um God just did what he
[2273.1s] always does when you call on God you
[2275.6s] know he can quickly come through for you
[2278.6s] and that's what we see he did for Esther
[2281.4s] now as we come to a close um in our
[2284.0s] lesson for today you realize that Esther
[2288.2s] Queen Esther and the people trusted God
[2291.2s] you know this was a big thing their
[2293.1s] lives were at stake their death was
[2296.7s] looming yeah but you realize that maybe
[2299.6s] some people have not experienced you
[2301.8s] know such big things that they feel like
[2304.2s] they should pray to God about and I just
[2306.5s] want to encourage you that but you know
[2307.9s] what even the small things you can pray
[2310.7s] to God about um I don't know is it the
[2313.6s] grades that you're looking for is it
[2316.6s] true friends that you want is it you
[2319.4s] want to get out out you want to get out
[2321.5s] of you know negative influence is it
[2324.4s] that you're actually struggling to read
[2326.6s] your Bible is it that you're struggling
[2329.3s] with gossip you know those things that
[2331.7s] seem so small you can still pray to God
[2333.8s] about them it doesn't have to be an
[2335.4s] accident it doesn't have to be a sick
[2337.1s] person
[2338.2s] the most minute things and as MTI said
[2341.3s] make God your friend you can talk to him
[2343.7s] about absolutely anything and that's
[2346.9s] what he wants us to be that's how he
[2348.6s] wants us to be with him if you have any
[2351.1s] other thoughts you could just add as we
[2353.5s] now almost concludes yes Almon so I
[2356.8s] remember a few weeks ago I was at my
[2359.8s] aunt's place and I opened the door and a
[2363.4s] cut entered and she said get that cut
[2366.7s] away
[2368.0s] so I took it and threw
[2369.9s] it so I felt guilty because I had done
[2374.0s] that I I I felt very
[2377.6s] remorseful so I was thinking of what I
[2380.6s] should have done better should I have
[2383.2s] handled it with more care but then I
[2387.2s] prayed just asked God I'm sorry for what
[2390.1s] I did to the cat I really regret it the
[2393.9s] moment I said amen all the guilt had
[2396.4s] gone
[2398.0s] yeah you know prayer is a very powerful
[2401.6s] gift that God has given to us and we
[2404.5s] shouldn't exploit it for our needs as M
[2407.2s] said we should use prayer as means to
[2410.9s] build ourselves and build a relationship
[2413.5s] with God for us to be in heaven abely
[2416.4s] amen amen I like that and at the same
[2419.3s] time my mind is drawn to Psalms where I
[2423.6s] don't know which psalmist one psalmist
[2425.0s] records you are God's children Children
[2427.6s] of the most high so in essence when God
[2430.4s] created us imbued us with his spirit and
[2433.1s] with his breath he's like I want to have
[2435.7s] a relationship with you that is unique
[2438.2s] fine physically we are genetically
[2440.7s] similar to animals but like for a fact
[2444.5s] we are genetically similar to animals
[2446.2s] but God says that despite that in your
[2450.0s] flesh you resemble the bonobus monkey in
[2453.8s] your spirit you are in my image
[2457.8s] and that you are a God you are my child
[2462.1s] and what not amen amen wow um we'll just
[2467.4s] each pick one of the punch lines that
[2469.4s] you feel um you know spoke to you and
[2472.3s] maybe I'll start with mine um Mark 9:23
[2476.4s] in the NIV version that says everything
[2479.8s] is possible for one who believes and you
[2483.2s] know we serve a God who is Limitless he
[2487.4s] gives us unnumbered blessings so with
[2490.6s] you believing with you having that faith
[2492.6s] and by the way we're not told to have a
[2494.4s] big faith it doesn't even have to be the
[2496.4s] size of your hand it's literally the
[2498.2s] size of a mustard seed you guys if
[2500.2s] you've seen a mustard seed I've not seen
[2501.7s] it in real life I've Googled it but that
[2504.0s] thing is Tiny it's minute so you just
[2507.4s] need even that little faith to move
[2509.9s] mountains so um maybe we can start from
[2512.5s] teacher Joan as we come back in terms of
[2514.5s] the punch lines just pick one and um yes
[2517.7s] we can proceed um mine is Luke 119 it
[2522.2s] says so I say to you ask and it will be
[2526.2s] given to you seek and you will find
[2528.7s] knock and the door will be opened to you
[2532.3s] yes I'll go with Proverbs 3:5 trust in
[2536.7s] the Lord with all your heart and lean
[2538.7s] not on your own
[2542.6s] understanding right right here is James
[2546.1s] 2:18 but someone will say you have faith
[2550.2s] I have Deeds show me your faith without
[2553.5s] deeds and I will show you my faith by my
[2558.5s] Deeds amen
[2561.6s] finally I just want to POS a question um
[2565.2s] if your life was ever in danger because
[2567.6s] of your Christian beliefs and you had to
[2570.4s] defend your
[2571.5s] faith what would you see in defense of
[2575.0s] your faith maybe you guys have not
[2577.4s] thought about it but it's actually
[2579.6s] something to think about now that we've
[2581.4s] seen in our flashlight section we've
[2583.1s] been told that you know the trbl last
[2585.0s] times are coming and you know you have
[2587.4s] to be ready to defend your faith you
[2589.2s] have to be ready to stand for God so you
[2591.9s] know what would you say in defense of
[2593.8s] your faith um any closing thoughts
[2596.2s] before we pray from anyone MTI any
[2599.4s] closing thoughts it's none at the
[2602.0s] present I believe we have thoroughly
[2603.8s] dissected this topic and jumped into it
[2606.6s] okay any closing thoughts I also have
[2609.7s] nothing to say Joan any closing thoughts
[2613.1s] yes sometimes hon can be someone in our
[2615.4s] workplace someone in class someone in
[2618.8s] our family and you feel like they're all
[2620.7s] over your business I think this shows us
[2623.4s] that the first person we need to go to
[2625.5s] is to Jesus and tell him about it then
[2627.6s] we can sort it out and talk to people
[2629.8s] who we need to talk to yeah amen amen
