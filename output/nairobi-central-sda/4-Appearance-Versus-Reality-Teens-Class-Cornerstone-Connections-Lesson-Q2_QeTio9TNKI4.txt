FULL TRANSCRIPT:
Good morning, good afternoon, and good evening. Welcome to lesson four of the cornerstone lesson where our topic is appearance versus reality. Interesting topic. Uh before we begin, like to introduce our panelist from to for today starting from my far left. Hi, my name is Sed. Hi everyone, my name is Brenda. Hi, my name is Holder. Hi, my name is Winston. My name is Jonan. I'll be guiding you through this lesson today. I'd like to ask Holder to offer of prayer as we begin. Let us pray. Our dear everlasting mercy in heaven, thank you for today. Dear father, as you're about to start our panel discussion, pray for your grace and we pray that we may touch a lot of hearts. Thank you Lord for all this and I pray this trusting and believing. Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. So just to prompt us into our lesson today. Um the Israelites or let me just start from the very beginning. After the fall of man, a promise was made. Yeah. In the punishment to the serpent, God said, I'll put enmity between you and the woman and your offspring and her offspring. You will bruise her heel and then uh the woman's offering will crush your head. So from the very beginning, Adam and Eve knew there was someone who's going to come and save them from sin. And from that moment on, they thought it's going to be something that won't take long. So when they got their first two children, they knew these were these are the saviors. You're going to go back to Eden because it was just right there. But then disaster struck. One of their sons decided to just finish off a quarter of the world's population. Yeah. killed his his brother and um they became hopeless. Then they got another son, Seth, who they now thought this is going to be the one to save us. But that did not happen. Years rolled by 2,000 years later. Then the Messiah came. Now the Israelites during the Passover feast, it was meant to be a foreshadow or something that was pointing to the Messiah. So in ancient Israel tradition, I think they still do it until now. When they're having Passover, they usually have an extra empty seat. Who is it reserved for? Elijah. Yeah, let's read that. Let me just read that verse. That's from the book of Malachi 4:5 and 6 just to give us the context of what our story talks about today. Malachi 4:5 and 6. I'd like to ask Holder. You there? Okay. Can you just read it out loud? Malachi 4 verse 5 and 6. It says, "See, I will send the prophet Elijah to you before that great and dreadful day of the Lord comes. He will turn the hearts of the parents to their children and the hearts of the children to their parents. Or else I will come and strike the land with total destruction." That's the very verse, the very last verse of the book. Malachi, that's the Old Testament. So the Israelites knew Elijah is going to come back again because he'd gone to heaven. So they knew that's the guy who's going to come and save us or that's the guy who's going to come and warn us of the impending danger. And that is what they knew. So when John the Baptist was preaching or when they saw John the Baptist, most people thought John the Baptist is Elijah in a whole new body, right? Because one, he dressed like Elijah. two lived in the wilderness like Elijah did. He did not have a permanent home. So John the Baptist himself, he knew the work that he was meant to do, but he lost hope at one point of his life. That was when he was put in prison. So we're going to see that in our story today. So let us move to our lesson. Appearance versus reality. There's a picture there. What do you guys see in the picture? What can you get from the picture? Start with Winston. Um, for me, what I see, I think there are two guys. And they're sort of in a structure like a prison. Mhm. And they're sort of reading a a book, I guess. Yeah. Of which I think it's the Bible, maybe. All right. Yeah. Mhm. Now, from the two of them, can you tell who's the prisoner or are they both prisoners? Um, from what I see, I'd say I'd say both of them are prisoners. Yeah, maybe. Mhm. Yeah. All right. Uh-huh. Thanks for that. Um, Brenda, what what can you see in that image or picture something? Um, I don't know if I'm the one who's overreading it or overthinking. Mhm. But when I'm looking at this picture, I'm thinking about the title, appearance versus reality. So the appearance of the photo is two guys behind so you'd think oh they're going through a tough time they're in jail they should be sad but behind you don't see sad guys you see people who are reading what we are assuming is the Bible so the appearance verse the reality of the photo so the the the bars Mhm. and then the two it's it's almost like they don't care that they're in jail. It's like they're it's another day at home having a Bible study. Something like that. Yeah. All right. Interesting. Anyone else? Holder said, "I'm getting the perception of Paul and Silas." Yeah, cuz they might be behind uh prison bars or something, but then they they don't look sad. They're just reading the Bible. Same case to Paul and Silas. They were just praying and seeing hymns. Yeah. So, that's my perception of it. All right. Interesting. I I also have a twist to it now that you've mentioned it. What if they're not behind bars? This is a perspective of someone who's in jail looking at people outside. Just thinking out loud. Probably the inside. Probably the inside the city. Okay. All right. Okay. Let us move on. Um the flashlights. Flashlight. Uh Winston, you can read that for us. Um the flashlight of today's lesson. uh as the Messiah herald, John was much more than a prophet. End quote. For while prophets had seen from afar Christ's advent, to John it has it was given to behold him to hear the testimony from heaven to his messiahship and to present him to Israel as the scent of God. Yes. Jesus said, "He that is least in the kingdom of heaven is greater than he." The desire, the desire of ages, page 220. Thank you for that. Christ in his um messages to his disciples, he actually mentions that there is no prophet greater than John, but he also added that he that is the list in the kingdom of heaven is greater than John the Baptist. Very interesting, deep words to think about. Um John and Jesus were born around the same time. They both had the same same work, right? The their task were intertwined. And uh John did his work perfectly. Yeah. He called people to repentance, prepared their hearts for Jesus, then Jesus came and then people rejected him. Yeah. Sad, sad, sad. Anyway, key text. Matthew 11:11. Sid, could you read that for us? Matthew 11:11 says, "Truly, I tell you, among these born of women, there has not risen anyone greater than John the Baptist. Yet, whoever is least in the kingdom of heaven is greater than he." Thank you for that. Humility. It's a call for humility to us. Let's move to the what do you think section just answer some of the things there and then now we get into the lesson. Okay. So in the what do you think section we're going to be answering how we define success. Mhm. So probably you can start us off. Um in your definition of success Sid what are some things you consider as being successful in your life? If you achieve that you know I have succeeded in life. What just tell us like some two two or three things. I feel like one thing that would define your success. Mhm. Feel like for most people would be money. Mhm. Uh the amount of money you have, the lifestyle you're living, I feel like it in today's world would define uh how successful you are. Yeah. Another thing that would define how successful you are is um how much time you spend doing what you love. So if you spend a lot of time doing the thing that you love, I feel you you have succeeded at you succeeded in life. All right. Interesting twist. Okay. Um, Brenda, list the names of three or four people who have had a positive influence on you. I see that's a long that's a long list. Yeah, probably we can do two. Or those which you can Mhm. I guess my my brother, the one I follow. Ah, okay. and um my maths teacher back in year 11. Okay. And and there's this uh this comedian I like listening to. Okay. But I can't say I can't pronounce his name. So yeah, I think those three for now. And my dad. Ah. Yeah. And my dad. I was waiting for a parent. All right. So those have had a really positive influence on you. Yeah. Your life. All right. Thank you for that. Um okay. So now for you Hula still on the same people who have had a big influence in your life. Um what are the relationship to you? So basically now tell us the people who have had an influence in your life. You can list like three and then Winston um you'll tell us the people who have influenced you. What makes them such an influence to you? So just think of that as we coming to you. So Hula who who have influenced you in your life and what's the relationship to you? Okay. Obvious um my mother. Okay. Charity begins at home. M interesting. Love that. Uh-huh. I can say my sister who follows me. Yeah. Even though obviously yes there obvious corals at home but they mean well and I can say my former high school class teacher. Oh, okay. Yeah, she was really Yeah. impactful in one way or another in my life, apart from teaching, obviously. Yeah. So, yeah, that is good. I I love how you guys are having good relationships with your teachers. Yeah. Good stuff. Good stuff. It means you're liking school. So, nice. Winston. Um for me, I'd say um the question was how who who the people who have impacted you in your life, what makes them such an impact? Oh, okay. For me, I'd say um one of the most people who has made my life so so good, like positively, I'd say my dad cuz personally I I take my dad my dad as my role model cuz I feel like how he composes himself, how he handles me like let's say like his son and how like he generally handles our family. Yeah, I really admire that. I love that. I love that. You guys are making me want to melt, but it's okay. Love for family and the people who mentor you. That's it's a very good thing because those are the people who want the best for you, right? They're preparing the way for your life like John the Baptist did. John the Baptist prepared the way for Jesus. Same with the people influencing you in your lives right now. They're preparing the future. I mean your future path. Just make it as smooth as possible. So thank you for sharing. Did you know section uh Holder can read through that then it gets into the story. Did you know section? Mhm. Woof gang Amadius Mosat died so poor he couldn't even get a proper burial. He was buried in a porter's field. Yet Mosat's music has been considered the most loved and beautiful of all the classical musicians. I'm sure each one of us has heard about Mosat. Yeah. While Martin Luther is well known as the German Hercules of the Protestant Reformation, Philip Mel Meangthon was the intellectual quiet reformer and colleague of Luther who wrote the first great Protestant confession of faith, the Augsburg confession. Uhhuh. John Widner, a 7th Day Adventist, helped save the lives of dozens of Jews and others who rightly feared persecution and death under the Nazi regime in World War II. He labored in secret, his actions known unknown until after the war ended. He was among the righteous at the state of Israel and others around the world honored for his courage. Amen. Thank you for that. So this basically tells us there are some people who have played a really big role but we do not know of their names, right? including of the Adventist church. You we all know about Ellen White and James Whites and Uh Smith and all those other people. But there are some people who played really significant roles that we do not know the names of example even the Bible. How many know the name of the boy who had five loaves and two fish? I even mentioned but that story is repeated so many times for our benefit. Yeah. Now, just to get into that, uh, Brenda, there's there's a story about, um, someone before we get into our story, someone and, uh, who really influenced the Adventist church, including our hymbook. Could you just give us this story? Yeah. So, uh, the lady was called an Rebecca Smith and she was and she lived only 37 years. She died at the age of 37. She was a young teacher, a poet, and an editor who was instrumental in helping James White edit what is today the Adventist Review. Her contribution during the pioneering days of the church was said to be of immense value. At the end of her short life, an had not amassed many of the world's riches or achieved great public position. She was however remembered most touchingly by her brother Uriah who incorporated one of Annie's favorite phrases in the closing closing of his letters, yours in the blessed hope. Even though Annie Smith died at a young age, her legacy lives on. 10 of her poems are still used today as hymns in the Seventh Day Adventist himnil. Her story is part of the Adventist church history. Her enduring influence shows what young people can do when rightly using their talents to honor God and share the blessed hope of his soon return. Amen. Thank you. Yeah. This story, this is a young person. She may not be as young as you guys are right now. Yeah. But in the Adventist history, young people have played the biggest role. Ellen White, she was really young, got her first vision at 17, right? We have here Annie Smith. We had so many other people, right, who the work that they laid as young people laid the foundation of what we are as a church right now. And we're standing on the shoulders of people past who really held up this church to such an extent that most of us who were put in the same position will not have done the same. Yeah. So as young people, we really have a big task to play. The Bible says, "Let no one despise your youth." There's a plan for you God has. Okay? Even to you, our viewer. John the Baptist was also a young person at that time. The guy died at a young age. We're going to see how that happened. And I'll ask Holder to just give us a synopsis of into the story. So for those who do not have the lesson, our story is from Matthew 11 verse 1-1 and Matthew chapter 14 verse 3-11. Holder just give us a summary of what's happening. Okay. So uh the story starts off where Jesus finished instructing these 12 disciples and he went on there from to teach and preach in the towns of Galilee. Then when John the Baptist back then he was in prison he heard about the Messiah and he he really wasn't sure of when his death will come but it was really it was impeding. So he called upon his two disciples to go and ask him if he is the one or they should wait for another. So the disciples, the two disciples went and when they asked Jesus the question, Jesus didn't reply immediately. But then a group of people who were lame, blind, they were all sick. They just came to Jesus and Jesus healed them. And after the healing is when Jesus turned to the disciples and told them to go and tell John what they have seen. So the disciples went back to to John to give him the report and John uh remembered the prophecy by Isaiah and said it was truly him. Um yes. So Mhm. So that's Matthew 11. Yes. Yeah. Matthew 11 and Matthew chapter 14 we get to see that Herod had arrested John the Baptist because Herodius his wife had had a very big influence on him in deserve ages um we are page paragraph two is it let me just confirm that that should be um chapter 22 yes that's chapter 22 uh-huh so uh earlier on uh king Herod heard about all the messages that John was going around telling the people, he actually believed most of them. But then when um when John the Baptist confronted him telling him that it's not right that he married his sister's brother that it made Herodius very furious and she since she had a lot of influence on on the king on Herod. Yeah. Yeah. It he just did whatever Herodia said and put him to prison. So Herod Okay. After the influence from Herodiius, he he wanted to kill John the Baptist, but he he saw it it was not good because the people would have him killed because Yeah. riots. Yeah. Because because he was a prophet. Yeah. So on Herod's birthday, the daughter of Herodias, he she danced very well and Herod was very pleased by that. So Herodiius told the daughter to okay the king told the daughter of Herodias that he could give her anything she wanted. So Herodius tricked her mind and said she should go and tell Herod to have the king the head of John John the Baptist on a silver platter and that's what happened. Yeah. Uh thank you for that Julia. sad ending to such a great prophet. And um John the Baptist had all the opportunity to call attention on himself. Here's why. John and Jesus never met until the baptism. You guys know that. Yeah. Right. When Christ was born in Bethlehem, like Christ used to live in Nazareth with John the Baptist and Elizabeth, you know, small family circle. But due to the senses, Christ was born in Bethlehem. But after the the wise men decided to deceive Herod and all that, Joseph fled to Egypt until Herod died. This was probably lots of years later. That's when now he came back to Nazareth. Probably Jesus was already old by then around probably 10 or 11 because when he was 12 is when they went to Jerusalem to visit the temple. Probably John was a bit older and had already be began his missions. So John started his mission in the wilderness. They did not have a chance to interact with Christ. First time they met was at the baptism. That that's what uh we get from the Bible and uh the spirit of prophecy and desire of ages. And John was very humble meeting Jesus. All this time he'd been preaching. He'd never met him. He had the chance to just boast and and just take all the glory for himself and ask for for offerings like some of our preachers do today. But question is why why did John the Baptist not do that? Why do you think he was humble all the way to the end even to the point of death? Why do you think he was humble to the point of death? Brenda, you look like you have something. I'm I'm trying to like reason out cuz we see a lot of not a lot but we see other cases in the Bible where we had um very humble people. We had the case of Moses where he grew up rich. Mhm. And then he had to God had to send him out through um the whole case of killing one of the task masters. He had to send him out into the wilderness to go live now with his future wife's family and become a shepherd to humble him from being a prince to a shepherd. But this is a different case cuz John was from the law from the beginning. He's from a priest family and that's that's not expected to be very you know bougie or something like that. So he had he came from a locally so there's no place of getting any pride or anything like that. Honestly, he would he would get let's say jealousy cuz let's say he was put in this position to guide people and he has to point out all these things that um the politicians quot and are doing you know King Herod and everyone else. Oh, you're doing this wrong or the taxes etc. So he had all the reasons to be mad and use his um the power given on him to boast to be loud. But he was humble and I don't think I don't for me personally I don't have anything that could logically explain that psychology in my head it just doesn't make sense doesn't make sense for him to be if that was me personally guys the Lord forgive me I think I would have started some type of rebellion but John didn't do that and he was humble as you said from beginning to the end and I I honestly don't have an answer for that cuz that's I think that's something only God can give you that patience that humility that is only something God can give you. Yeah, thank you for that. Um, we can read John 1 6 and 7. John 1 6 and 7. Um, I think I'll ask Sid to read that. John 1:6 and 7. You know, it's very interesting, you know, um, the births of John and Jesus were announced around the same time. So, John would have he would have questioned, you know, we were born around the same time. Why wouldn't I have been the Messiah and the other way around? Jesus came later. I'm the older one. Why? Why? Why not? Why me? Why me? But John 1 6 and 7 said John 1:6 and 7 says, "There was a man sent from God whose name was John. He came as a witness to testify concerning that light so that through him all might believe." Yeah. Um John's purpose was clearly outlined. Yeah. And this was a man sent directly from God to prepare the way for God's son. That's a very important person in God's um family circle, right? But does John's ending seem like that one of a successful man with the way we define success in our world right now? A man with riches, someone who has accomplished all the um you know their accolades in life. They have their PhDs and so many papers. They are published. They've done interviews. Do you think John's ending could have been better? Winston. Um I'd say to how according to how people view it can view it right now. Yeah. I feel like people might say that um um John's ending was like in vain. Mhm. Like um cuz he he ended up dying. Yeah. But I feel like that's not it. cuz actually we see that um God's plan for John was to come as the light. He was the one to come to prepare the way for Jesus. Something like that. But we see that um that was what that that was what actually happened cuz we see that um from here John's John's death didn't silence the message nor the coming of the coming the coming kingdom. It actually happened. And it's something that actually happened. So yeah, I feel like it wasn't in vain. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. All right. And if I could add on to that. Yeah. If you go further in um John 1 6 and 7, you go to 8, it says he was not that light, but he was sent to bear witness of that light. Mhm. So if if he I I want to use illustration of a torch. Yeah. He was the torch to show where you're supposed to go. like okay in in Shags back when I go to Shagu and it's very dark at night you know we don't have like the lights the city lights it's very very dark without lights and my mom would take a torch and point to where she wants me to go so I could see where I'm going just but that doesn't mean that I myself I'm not finding like I found my way right so the torch did its job the torch doing its job doesn't mean it's any lesser than the light coming out of it does that make sense yeah so kind of like um think can tie it up to the sun and the moon. Yeah. The the the moon reflects light from the sun. That does not mean the moon is any lesser is any less important than than the sun. Yeah. Thank you for that. Um so as we as we wrapping up Yeah. Uhhuh. So I'm just losing this question here. Yes. John despite doing all that he he still almost lost hope when he sent his disciples to confirm with Jesus. Are you the Messiah or is there someone else to come? What do you think might have led to John feeling hopeless at that time? Cuz I'm sure he'd been in prison for a while and Jesus knew about it. Jesus had the power. I mean, he was healing people who were blind and deaf. He could get John out of prison in a miraculous way. So why do you think John might have lost hope at that time? Holder. Okay. I like how Ellen White in the desire videos put it that Elijah at some point he thought that the coming king would like the Messiah would come as someone who will sit on thrones would overthrow those those in power. But in contrary, Jesus actually didn't overthrow the people in power. He was just trying to show how the kingdom of heaven runs. So that's how I I think I I like that analogy. Um and it's the same mentality that the Jews had from the very beginning. It's that um the Jews knew the Messiah would come from the clouds. full grown man with all the angels come fight and just overthrow everyone. But this was someone who did seen being born as a child son to a carpenter and then they're told this is the guy coming to save us. I am sure John had the same mentality as well. I mean he was a Jew from a priestly family. He'd been taught that that's that's how the Messiah was supposed to come. So he he might have lost hope. might have been dimmed, but in his mind, he still knew his work was accomplished. And I believe John John died a very satisfied man, knowing that his work was accomplished. Yeah. Now, if I was to ask us, you know, just just to think about it uh as you as you go more after this lesson, at what point in your life can you say, "Lord, I've accomplished all I've done. I have fought the fights. I've kept the faith. and now I am ready to just rest. Yeah, it it's a big challenge for us to get there, but it's only God who can um enable us to get to that point in life. So, as you finish up, uh any parting thoughts or something you can read from the punchlines or from the further insight? I'll start with Sid. It's it's good to be humble. Yeah, cuz God can't work through you if you're not humble. True. If John wasn't humble, God wouldn't have been he wouldn't have been able to complete the work that the Lord had for him. So be just be humble and let God work through you. Amen. Thank you for that. I probably can pick one of the punchlines that really speaks to you. Matthew 11:10. Mhm. This is the one about whom it is written, I will send my messenger ahead of you who will prepare your way before you. Thank you for that. So the Lord prepares his way. He sends his people to prepare his way for us and for his work to be done. Thank you for that. Sid Brenda, any parting words? Um, as you were talking earlier about how he died a satisfied man, it came to me how many of the Jews how they were raised knowing that Jesus is coming in all this glory to fight this big battle. In a way, it did happen. If you think about it like in a metaphor cuz before that the world was ruled by sin. The devil was the prince of the world. But as soon as Jesus came and died for us, another type of war started a spiritual war on earth to fight, you know, that that to remove that strength that he had on people and to save as many people he can, right? Yeah. And for many Jews, they didn't look at it like that. You'd think the lack of metaphors in Israel back then, but okay, it's because of a lack of of understanding of the word, lack of, you know, the knowledge needed to understand that that scripture, right? And in a way we as Christians are given that role because there are many people who don't know about how the word is supposed to be interpreted or how we're supposed to understand it. We are the ones sent out you know to bear the light. We are not the light. We are to bear the light for the people to understand cuz the Jews didn't know because they weren't told. John was sent to to tell them. Yeah. Right. And in a way he wasn't any lesser cuz he was sent by God. Right. Just like how Jesus came as the son of God. So we should we should really take up that that burden. I feel like so many Christians are scared of taking it up. Yeah. But John John gives us I feel like it's a motivation like he was able to do it and finish it satisfied. He had his success at the end of his of the day. And I think so we can do the same. Can do the same. And the verse that touched me is um John 1 16:7. There was a man sent from God whose name was John. He came as a witness to testify concerning concerning the light so that through him all might believe. Amen. Thank for that Brenda. All right. So finish up. You'll read uh the first further insight than the second further insight. Mhm. God never leaves his children otherwise than they would choose to be led. If they could see the end from the beginning and discern the glory of the purpose which they are fulfilling as co-workers with him. Ellen White 22 24 and 225. Thank you. God only leads you as you'd allow him to lead you. Yeah. Um and the last further insights, and of all the gifts that heaven can bestow upon men, fellowship with Christ in his sufferings is the most weighty trust and the highest honor. Amen. Yeah. And just to close, I'd like to mention that um what I learned like from the lesson and what I'd like to share is my definition of success as I've seen. Um I feel like you know sometimes we consider success as being like the fulfillment of our plans of which mostly is materialistic. Yeah. Yeah. But I feel like um success um as as as you've seen in our story the greatest the greatest definition of success is fulfillment of God's plan in our lives. Yeah. Like fulfilling that plan that God has in your life. That's the greatest definition of success. Amen. Thank you for that. Appearance versus reality. That has been our lesson. Thank you so much for staying with us till the end. Like to ask Winston to pray with us as we close. Okay. Let us pray. Almighty God, we come before you this wonderful time to thank you for the gift of life. We thank you for being with us since we started our lesson until this wonderful time that we want to close. Father, protect us. Continue guiding us and may your will be done upon our lives. Father, help us to apply whatever we have learned today in our lives. Father, help us. We all have different purposes. Dear Lord, help us to to to identify them and achieve success. Dear Lord, thank you for being with us today and protect us all in Jesus name we pray and believe. Amen. Amen. Till next time. Thank you. 

==================================================

TIMESTAMPED TRANSCRIPT:
[0.3s] Good morning, good afternoon, and good
[2.6s] evening. Welcome to lesson four of the
[6.8s] cornerstone lesson where our topic is
[10.4s] appearance versus
[12.9s] reality. Interesting topic. Uh before we
[16.1s] begin, like to introduce our panelist
[18.2s] from to for today starting from my far
[20.6s] left. Hi, my name is Sed. Hi everyone,
[23.0s] my name is Brenda. Hi, my name is
[25.4s] Holder. Hi, my name is Winston. My name
[28.4s] is Jonan. I'll be guiding you through
[30.5s] this lesson today. I'd like to ask
[32.6s] Holder to offer of prayer as we begin.
[34.7s] Let us pray. Our dear everlasting mercy
[37.1s] in heaven, thank you for today. Dear
[39.0s] father, as you're about to start our
[40.8s] panel discussion, pray for your grace
[43.4s] and we pray that we may touch a lot of
[47.0s] hearts. Thank you Lord for all this and
[49.4s] I pray this trusting and believing.
[51.1s] Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. So just to
[53.4s] prompt us into our lesson today. Um the
[56.5s] Israelites or let me just start from the
[58.5s] very beginning. After the fall of man, a
[60.4s] promise was made. Yeah. In the
[62.6s] punishment to the serpent, God said,
[67.9s] I'll put enmity between you and the
[70.2s] woman and your offspring and her
[71.7s] offspring. You will bruise her heel and
[75.1s] then uh the woman's offering will crush
[77.6s] your head. So from the very beginning,
[80.3s] Adam and Eve knew there was someone
[83.1s] who's going to come and save them from
[85.0s] sin. And from that moment on, they
[88.7s] thought it's going to be something that
[90.7s] won't take long. So when they got their
[93.0s] first two children, they knew these were
[95.8s] these are the saviors. You're going to
[97.5s] go back to Eden because it was just
[99.0s] right there. But then disaster struck.
[102.6s] One of their sons decided to just finish
[105.0s] off a quarter of the world's population.
[106.6s] Yeah. killed his his brother and um they
[111.2s] became hopeless. Then they got another
[113.6s] son, Seth, who they now thought this is
[115.6s] going to be the one to save us. But that
[117.8s] did not happen. Years rolled by 2,000
[121.0s] years later. Then the Messiah came. Now
[124.6s] the Israelites during the Passover
[126.6s] feast, it was meant to be a foreshadow
[130.4s] or something that was pointing to the
[132.0s] Messiah. So in ancient Israel tradition,
[136.0s] I think they still do it until now. When
[138.5s] they're having Passover, they usually
[140.3s] have an extra empty
[142.3s] seat. Who is it reserved for? Elijah.
[146.3s] Yeah, let's read that. Let me just read
[148.6s] that verse. That's from the book of
[150.7s] Malachi 4:5 and 6 just to give us the
[154.2s] context of what our story talks about
[156.4s] today. Malachi 4:5 and 6.
[161.3s] I'd like to ask Holder. You there?
[165.1s] Okay. Can you just read it out loud?
[167.5s] Malachi 4 verse 5 and 6. It says, "See,
[172.2s] I will send the prophet Elijah to you
[174.1s] before that great and dreadful day of
[176.2s] the Lord comes. He will turn the hearts
[178.2s] of the parents to their children and the
[180.6s] hearts of the children to their parents.
[182.4s] Or else I will come and strike the land
[184.2s] with total destruction."
[186.4s] That's the very verse, the very last
[188.2s] verse of the book. Malachi, that's the
[190.7s] Old Testament. So the Israelites knew
[193.4s] Elijah is going to come back again
[194.9s] because he'd gone to heaven. So they
[196.9s] knew that's the guy who's going to come
[198.2s] and save us or that's the guy who's
[200.0s] going to come and warn us of the
[201.8s] impending danger. And that is what they
[204.5s] knew. So when John the Baptist was
[207.0s] preaching or when they saw John the
[208.6s] Baptist, most people thought John the
[211.2s] Baptist is Elijah in a whole new body,
[214.3s] right? Because one, he dressed like
[216.9s] Elijah. two lived in the wilderness like
[219.4s] Elijah did. He did not have a permanent
[221.2s] home. So John the Baptist himself, he
[224.2s] knew the work that he was meant to do,
[227.0s] but he lost hope at one point of his
[229.4s] life. That was when he was put in
[231.5s] prison. So we're going to see that in
[233.7s] our story today. So let us move to our
[237.5s] lesson. Appearance versus reality.
[240.7s] There's a picture
[242.2s] there. What do you guys see in the
[244.2s] picture? What can you get from the
[245.6s] picture? Start with Winston.
[248.6s] Um, for me, what I see, I think there
[251.8s] are two guys.
[254.0s] And they're sort of in a structure like
[256.3s] a prison. Mhm. And they're sort of
[259.0s] reading a a book, I guess. Yeah. Of
[261.5s] which I think it's the Bible, maybe. All
[264.2s] right. Yeah. Mhm. Now, from the two of
[266.9s] them, can you tell who's the prisoner or
[269.0s] are they both prisoners?
[271.6s] Um, from what I
[273.8s] see, I'd say I'd say both of them are
[277.3s] prisoners. Yeah, maybe. Mhm. Yeah. All
[281.1s] right. Uh-huh. Thanks for that. Um,
[283.4s] Brenda, what what can you see in that
[286.3s] image or picture something? Um, I don't
[290.6s] know if I'm the one who's overreading it
[292.5s] or overthinking. Mhm. But when I'm
[294.6s] looking at this picture, I'm thinking
[296.2s] about the title, appearance versus
[298.4s] reality. So the appearance of the photo
[300.8s] is two guys behind
[304.8s] so you'd think oh they're going through
[306.8s] a tough time they're in jail they should
[308.9s] be sad but behind you don't see sad guys
[311.0s] you see people who are reading what we
[312.8s] are assuming is the Bible so the
[315.0s] appearance verse the reality of the
[317.5s] photo so the the the bars Mhm. and then
[321.0s] the two it's it's almost like they don't
[322.6s] care that they're in jail. It's like
[324.3s] they're it's another day at home having
[325.9s] a Bible study. Something like that.
[328.0s] Yeah. All right.
[329.5s] Interesting. Anyone else? Holder said,
[332.2s] "I'm getting the perception of Paul and
[336.2s] Silas."
[338.1s] Yeah,
[339.3s] cuz they might be behind uh prison bars
[343.0s] or something, but then they they don't
[345.6s] look sad. They're just reading the
[347.0s] Bible. Same case to Paul and Silas. They
[349.4s] were just praying and seeing hymns.
[351.6s] Yeah. So, that's my perception of it.
[353.5s] All right. Interesting. I I also have a
[355.4s] twist to it now that you've mentioned
[356.9s] it. What if they're not behind bars?
[360.1s] This is a perspective of someone who's
[361.7s] in jail looking at people outside.
[366.4s] Just thinking out loud. Probably the
[368.9s] inside. Probably the inside the city.
[371.2s] Okay. All right. Okay. Let us move on.
[374.9s] Um the flashlights. Flashlight. Uh
[377.0s] Winston, you can read that for us. Um
[379.4s] the flashlight of today's lesson.
[382.4s] uh as the
[384.2s] Messiah herald, John was much more than
[387.3s] a prophet. End quote. For while prophets
[390.2s] had seen from afar Christ's advent, to
[393.5s] John it has it was given to behold him
[396.1s] to hear the testimony from heaven to his
[399.4s] messiahship and to present him to Israel
[402.3s] as the scent of God. Yes. Jesus said,
[405.4s] "He that is least in the kingdom of
[407.6s] heaven is greater than he." The desire,
[410.2s] the desire of ages, page 220. Thank you
[413.5s] for that. Christ in his um messages to
[417.3s] his disciples, he actually mentions that
[419.6s] there is no prophet greater than John,
[422.7s] but he also added that he that is the
[425.9s] list in the kingdom of heaven is greater
[428.0s] than John the
[429.6s] Baptist. Very interesting, deep words to
[431.9s] think about.
[433.6s] Um John and Jesus were born around the
[436.2s] same time. They both had the same same
[439.3s] work, right? The their task were
[442.6s] intertwined. And
[444.8s] uh John did his work perfectly. Yeah. He
[449.3s] called people to repentance, prepared
[451.0s] their hearts for Jesus, then Jesus came
[453.2s] and then people rejected him. Yeah. Sad,
[456.6s] sad, sad. Anyway, key text. Matthew
[459.2s] 11:11.
[460.7s] Sid, could you read that for us? Matthew
[462.7s] 11:11 says, "Truly, I tell you, among
[466.7s] these born of women, there has not risen
[470.8s] anyone greater than John the Baptist.
[473.9s] Yet, whoever is least in the kingdom of
[476.5s] heaven is greater than he." Thank you
[479.4s] for that. Humility. It's a call for
[481.7s] humility to us. Let's move to the what
[484.0s] do you think section just answer some of
[487.0s] the things there and then now we get
[488.3s] into the lesson. Okay. So in the what do
[490.4s] you think section we're going to
[492.8s] be answering how we define success. Mhm.
[497.4s] So probably you can start us off. Um in
[500.7s] your definition of success Sid what are
[503.7s] some things you consider as being
[506.1s] successful in your life? If you achieve
[509.3s] that you know I have succeeded in life.
[511.5s] What just tell us like some two two or
[513.4s] three
[514.6s] things. I feel like one thing that
[518.3s] would define your success. Mhm. Feel
[522.6s] like for most people would be money.
[525.7s] Mhm.
[527.3s] Uh the amount of money you have, the
[530.4s] lifestyle you're living, I feel like it
[533.5s] in today's world would define
[538.1s] uh how successful you are. Yeah. Another
[541.6s] thing that would define how successful
[543.8s] you are is
[546.9s] um how much time you spend doing what
[550.2s] you love.
[552.0s] So if you
[553.4s] spend a lot of time doing the thing that
[557.2s] you love, I feel you you have succeeded
[561.1s] at you succeeded in life. All right.
[564.5s] Interesting twist. Okay. Um,
[568.6s] Brenda, list the names of three or four
[571.8s] people who have had a positive influence
[574.2s] on you. I see that's a long that's a
[577.4s] long list. Yeah, probably we can do two.
[581.0s] Or those which you can Mhm.
[584.5s] I guess
[585.8s] my my brother, the one I follow. Ah,
[589.8s] okay. and
[592.2s] um my maths teacher back in year 11.
[596.8s] Okay.
[599.8s] And and there's this
[602.5s] uh this
[604.4s] comedian I like listening to. Okay. But
[607.3s] I can't say I can't pronounce his name.
[609.0s] So yeah, I think those three for now.
[612.8s] And my dad. Ah. Yeah. And my dad. I was
[615.0s] waiting for a parent. All right. So
[617.3s] those have had a really positive
[618.6s] influence on you. Yeah. Your life. All
[620.6s] right. Thank you for that. Um okay. So
[624.2s] now for you Hula still on the same
[626.1s] people who have had a big influence in
[627.7s] your life.
[630.0s] Um what are the relationship to you? So
[632.9s] basically now tell us the people who
[635.4s] have had an influence in your life. You
[636.9s] can list like three and then Winston um
[640.5s] you'll tell us the people who have
[642.1s] influenced
[643.3s] you. What makes
[645.6s] them such an influence to you? So just
[648.6s] think of that as we coming to you. So
[650.1s] Hula who who have influenced you in your
[652.6s] life and what's the relationship to you?
[655.8s] Okay. Obvious um my mother. Okay.
[659.3s] Charity begins at home. M interesting.
[662.2s] Love that. Uh-huh. I can say my sister
[665.6s] who follows me. Yeah. Even though
[668.0s] obviously yes there obvious corals at
[671.6s] home but they mean well and I can say my
[675.5s] former high school class teacher. Oh,
[677.8s] okay. Yeah, she was really
[680.7s] Yeah. impactful in one way or another in
[682.8s] my life, apart from teaching, obviously.
[684.9s] Yeah. So, yeah, that is good. I I love
[687.1s] how you guys are having good
[688.0s] relationships with your teachers. Yeah.
[689.8s] Good stuff. Good stuff. It means you're
[691.8s] liking school. So, nice. Winston. Um for
[695.6s] me, I'd say um the question was how who
[699.1s] who the people who have impacted you in
[701.0s] your life, what makes them such an
[703.5s] impact? Oh, okay. For me, I'd say um one
[707.4s] of the most people who has made my life
[710.9s] so so good, like positively, I'd say my
[714.3s] dad cuz personally I I take my dad my
[718.2s] dad as my role model cuz I feel like how
[721.5s] he composes himself, how he handles me
[725.0s] like let's say like his son and how like
[727.4s] he generally handles our family. Yeah, I
[730.2s] really admire that. I love that. I love
[732.6s] that. You guys are making me want to
[734.5s] melt, but it's
[735.7s] okay. Love for family and the people who
[739.0s] mentor you. That's it's a very good
[740.7s] thing because those are the people
[742.8s] who want the best for you, right?
[745.9s] They're preparing the way for your life
[748.4s] like John the Baptist did. John the
[750.8s] Baptist prepared the way for Jesus. Same
[754.1s] with the people influencing you in your
[755.5s] lives right now. They're preparing the
[757.8s] future. I mean your future path. Just
[759.9s] make it as smooth as possible. So thank
[762.0s] you for sharing. Did you know section
[765.7s] uh Holder can read through that then it
[768.0s] gets into the story. Did you know
[770.4s] section? Mhm. Woof gang Amadius Mosat
[773.5s] died so poor he couldn't even get a
[775.4s] proper burial. He was buried in a
[777.9s] porter's field. Yet Mosat's music has
[781.1s] been considered the most loved and
[783.0s] beautiful of all the classical
[784.4s] musicians. I'm sure each one of us has
[786.3s] heard about Mosat. Yeah. While Martin
[789.4s] Luther is well known as the German
[791.1s] Hercules of the Protestant Reformation,
[794.3s] Philip Mel Meangthon was the
[797.4s] intellectual quiet reformer and
[799.4s] colleague of Luther who wrote the first
[801.8s] great Protestant confession of faith,
[804.1s] the Augsburg confession. Uhhuh. John
[807.1s] Widner, a 7th Day Adventist, helped save
[809.8s] the lives of dozens of Jews and others
[812.2s] who rightly feared persecution and death
[814.6s] under the Nazi regime in World War II.
[816.9s] He labored in secret, his actions known
[819.8s] unknown until after the war ended. He
[822.8s] was among the righteous at the state of
[824.6s] Israel and others around the world
[826.6s] honored for his courage. Amen. Thank you
[829.6s] for that. So this basically tells us
[832.9s] there are some people who have played a
[834.8s] really big role but we do not know of
[837.7s] their names, right? including of the
[840.2s] Adventist church. You we all know about
[842.6s] Ellen White and James Whites and Uh
[844.8s] Smith and all those other people. But
[847.1s] there are some people who played really
[848.7s] significant roles that we do not know
[851.2s] the names of example even the Bible. How
[854.9s] many know the name of the boy who had
[857.0s] five loaves and two fish? I even
[859.7s] mentioned but that story is repeated so
[861.6s] many times for our benefit. Yeah. Now,
[865.0s] just to get into that, uh, Brenda,
[866.9s] there's there's a story about, um,
[869.6s] someone before we get into our story,
[871.7s] someone and, uh, who really influenced
[873.9s] the Adventist church, including our
[875.4s] hymbook. Could you just give us this
[877.2s] story? Yeah. So, uh, the lady was called
[882.1s] an Rebecca Smith and she was and she
[884.7s] lived only 37 years. She died at the age
[886.6s] of 37. She was a young teacher, a poet,
[889.8s] and an editor who was instrumental in
[891.8s] helping James White edit what is today
[893.8s] the Adventist Review. Her contribution
[896.2s] during the pioneering days of the church
[897.9s] was said to be of immense value. At the
[900.2s] end of her short life, an had not
[901.7s] amassed many of the world's riches or
[903.4s] achieved great public position. She was
[906.4s] however remembered most touchingly by
[908.2s] her brother Uriah who incorporated one
[911.2s] of Annie's favorite phrases in the
[913.0s] closing closing of his letters, yours in
[915.7s] the blessed hope. Even though Annie
[917.8s] Smith died at a young age, her legacy
[919.9s] lives on. 10 of her poems are still used
[922.2s] today as hymns in the Seventh Day
[923.8s] Adventist himnil. Her story is part of
[926.2s] the Adventist church history. Her
[927.7s] enduring influence shows what young
[929.4s] people can do when rightly using their
[931.4s] talents to honor God and share the
[933.7s] blessed hope of his soon return. Amen.
[936.6s] Thank you. Yeah. This story, this is a
[940.6s] young person. She may not be as young as
[942.4s] you guys are right now. Yeah. But in the
[945.9s] Adventist history, young people have
[948.9s] played the biggest
[950.2s] role. Ellen White, she was really young,
[953.0s] got her first vision at 17, right? We
[956.2s] have here Annie Smith. We had so many
[959.0s] other people, right, who the work that
[962.9s] they laid as young people laid the
[965.3s] foundation of what we are as a church
[966.7s] right now. And we're standing on the
[968.7s] shoulders of people past who really held
[971.8s] up this church to such an extent that
[974.2s] most of us who were put in the same
[975.5s] position will not have done the same.
[978.6s] Yeah. So as young people, we really have
[981.0s] a big task to play. The Bible says, "Let
[984.2s] no one despise your
[985.7s] youth." There's a plan for you God has.
[988.3s] Okay? Even to you, our viewer. John the
[990.6s] Baptist was also a young person at that
[992.2s] time. The guy died at a young age. We're
[994.1s] going to see how that happened. And I'll
[996.1s] ask Holder to just give us a synopsis of
[998.6s] into the story. So for those who do not
[1001.0s] have the lesson, our story is from
[1003.0s] Matthew 11 verse 1-1 and Matthew chapter
[1007.4s] 14 verse 3-11. Holder just give us a
[1010.6s] summary of what's happening.
[1013.4s] Okay. So uh the story starts off where
[1015.9s] Jesus finished instructing these 12
[1019.5s] disciples and he went on there from to
[1023.8s] teach and preach in the towns of
[1025.8s] Galilee. Then when John the Baptist back
[1029.8s] then he was in prison he heard about the
[1032.1s] Messiah and he he really wasn't sure of
[1035.7s] when his death will come but it was
[1039.4s] really it was impeding. So he called
[1042.1s] upon his two disciples to go and ask him
[1047.4s] if he is the one or they should wait for
[1049.5s] another. So the disciples, the two
[1051.9s] disciples went and when they asked Jesus
[1054.9s] the question, Jesus didn't reply
[1057.0s] immediately. But then a group of people
[1060.2s] who were lame, blind, they were all
[1062.8s] sick. They just came to Jesus and Jesus
[1065.4s] healed them.
[1067.2s] And after the healing is when Jesus
[1070.6s] turned to the disciples and told them to
[1072.9s] go and tell John what they have seen. So
[1075.5s] the disciples went back to to John to
[1079.8s] give him the report
[1081.7s] and John uh remembered the prophecy by
[1085.2s] Isaiah and said it was truly him. Um
[1089.6s] yes. So Mhm. So that's Matthew 11. Yes.
[1093.9s] Yeah. Matthew 11 and Matthew chapter 14
[1097.0s] we get to see that Herod had arrested
[1100.1s] John the Baptist because Herodius his
[1103.0s] wife had had a very big influence on him
[1106.5s] in deserve ages um we are page paragraph
[1109.9s] two is it
[1113.4s] let me just confirm that that should be
[1115.0s] um chapter 22 yes that's chapter 22
[1117.8s] uh-huh so uh earlier
[1119.8s] on uh king Herod heard about all the
[1123.2s] messages that John was going around
[1125.6s] telling the people, he
[1127.5s] actually believed most of them. But then
[1131.4s] when um when John the Baptist confronted
[1136.7s] him telling him that it's not right that
[1138.7s] he married his sister's brother that it
[1142.2s] made Herodius very furious and she since
[1145.6s] she had a lot of influence on on the
[1148.8s] king on Herod. Yeah. Yeah. It he just
[1152.3s] did whatever Herodia said and put him to
[1155.0s] prison.
[1156.6s] So Herod Okay. After the influence from
[1160.6s] Herodiius, he he wanted to kill John the
[1164.5s] Baptist, but he he saw it it was not
[1167.7s] good because the people would have him
[1170.9s] killed because Yeah. riots. Yeah.
[1173.0s] Because because he was a prophet. Yeah.
[1175.7s] So on Herod's birthday, the daughter of
[1179.0s] Herodias, he she danced very well and
[1183.0s] Herod was very pleased by that. So
[1186.0s] Herodiius told the daughter to okay the
[1188.9s] king told the daughter of Herodias that
[1193.0s] he could give her anything she wanted.
[1195.0s] So Herodius tricked her mind and said
[1197.5s] she should go and tell Herod to have the
[1201.0s] king the head of John John the Baptist
[1203.4s] on a silver platter and that's what
[1205.7s] happened. Yeah. Uh thank you for that
[1208.6s] Julia. sad ending to such a great
[1210.9s] prophet. And
[1213.2s] um John the Baptist had all the
[1215.8s] opportunity to call attention on
[1219.1s] himself. Here's
[1220.9s] why. John and Jesus never met until the
[1223.7s] baptism. You guys know that. Yeah.
[1226.0s] Right. When Christ was born in
[1228.1s] Bethlehem, like Christ used to live in
[1230.3s] Nazareth with John the Baptist and
[1232.6s] Elizabeth, you know, small family
[1235.2s] circle. But due to the senses, Christ
[1238.0s] was born in Bethlehem. But after the the
[1241.5s] wise men decided to deceive Herod and
[1243.4s] all that, Joseph fled to Egypt until
[1247.6s] Herod died. This was probably lots of
[1249.3s] years later. That's when now he came
[1250.9s] back to Nazareth. Probably Jesus was
[1253.6s] already old by then around probably 10
[1256.0s] or 11 because when he was 12 is when
[1258.8s] they went to Jerusalem to visit the
[1260.7s] temple. Probably John was a bit older
[1263.7s] and had already be began his missions.
[1266.2s] So John started his mission in the
[1268.7s] wilderness. They did not have a chance
[1270.4s] to interact with Christ. First time they
[1272.9s] met was at the baptism. That that's what
[1277.4s] uh we get from the Bible and uh the
[1279.6s] spirit of prophecy and desire of ages.
[1282.0s] And John was very humble meeting Jesus.
[1287.4s] All this time he'd been preaching. He'd
[1289.0s] never met him. He had the chance to just
[1290.6s] boast and and just take all the glory
[1293.1s] for himself and ask for for offerings
[1295.8s] like some of our preachers do today. But
[1299.1s] question
[1300.8s] is why why did John the Baptist not do
[1304.5s] that? Why do you think he was humble all
[1306.8s] the way to the end even to the point of
[1309.6s] death? Why do you think he was humble to
[1312.5s] the point of death? Brenda, you look
[1314.4s] like you have something. I'm I'm trying
[1316.7s] to like reason out cuz we see a lot of
[1320.5s] not a lot but we see other cases in the
[1322.6s] Bible where we had um very humble
[1324.3s] people. We had the case of Moses where
[1327.1s] he grew up rich. Mhm. And then he had to
[1332.1s] God had to send him out through um the
[1335.1s] whole case of killing one of the task
[1337.4s] masters. He had to send him out into the
[1339.0s] wilderness to go live now with his
[1341.3s] future wife's family and become a
[1343.5s] shepherd to humble him from being a
[1346.0s] prince to a shepherd. But this is a
[1348.5s] different case cuz John was from the law
[1351.4s] from the beginning. He's from a priest
[1353.8s] family and that's that's not expected to
[1355.8s] be very you know bougie or something
[1357.8s] like that. So he had he came from a
[1360.8s] locally so there's no place of getting
[1362.2s] any pride or anything like that.
[1364.1s] Honestly, he would he would get let's
[1365.8s] say jealousy cuz let's say he was put in
[1367.9s] this position to guide people and he has
[1370.4s] to point out all these things that um
[1374.2s] the politicians quot and are doing you
[1376.2s] know King Herod and everyone else. Oh,
[1378.0s] you're doing this wrong or the taxes
[1380.2s] etc. So he had all the reasons to be mad
[1382.6s] and use his um the power given on him to
[1386.0s] boast to be loud. But he was humble and
[1388.8s] I don't think I don't for me personally
[1391.6s] I don't have anything that could
[1393.0s] logically explain that psychology in my
[1395.6s] head it just doesn't make sense doesn't
[1396.8s] make sense for him to be if that was me
[1398.9s] personally guys the Lord forgive me I
[1402.4s] think I would have started some type of
[1404.0s] rebellion but John didn't do that and he
[1407.0s] was humble as you said from beginning to
[1408.7s] the end and I I honestly don't have an
[1411.4s] answer for that cuz that's I think
[1412.8s] that's something only God can give you
[1414.9s] that patience that humility that is only
[1417.4s] something God can give you. Yeah, thank
[1419.3s] you for that. Um, we can read John 1 6
[1422.7s] and 7. John 1 6 and 7. Um, I think I'll
[1426.9s] ask Sid to read that. John 1:6 and 7.
[1431.3s] You know, it's very interesting, you
[1433.8s] know, um, the births of John and Jesus
[1437.3s] were announced around the same time.
[1440.8s] So, John would
[1443.2s] have he would have questioned, you know,
[1445.4s] we were born around the same time. Why
[1446.6s] wouldn't I have been the Messiah and the
[1449.3s] other way around? Jesus came later. I'm
[1450.8s] the older one. Why? Why? Why not? Why
[1452.6s] me? Why me? But John 1 6 and 7
[1456.1s] said John 1:6 and 7 says, "There was a
[1460.2s] man sent from God whose name was John.
[1463.8s] He came as a witness to
[1466.3s] testify concerning that light so that
[1470.7s] through him all might believe."
[1474.4s] Yeah. Um John's purpose was clearly
[1477.5s] outlined. Yeah. And this was a man sent
[1481.4s] directly from God to prepare the way for
[1483.8s] God's son. That's a very important
[1485.8s] person in God's um family circle, right?
[1489.7s] But does John's ending seem like that
[1492.9s] one of a successful man with the way we
[1494.7s] define success in our world right now? A
[1496.4s] man with riches, someone who has
[1498.5s] accomplished all the um you know their
[1501.0s] accolades in life. They have their PhDs
[1503.2s] and so many papers. They are published.
[1505.0s] They've done
[1506.1s] interviews. Do you think John's ending
[1509.2s] could have been better?
[1512.6s] Winston. Um I'd say to how according to
[1516.6s] how people view it can view it right
[1518.9s] now. Yeah. I feel like people might say
[1521.0s] that um um John's ending was like in
[1525.3s] vain. Mhm. Like um cuz he he ended up
[1529.8s] dying. Yeah. But I feel like that's not
[1532.6s] it. cuz actually we see that um God's
[1536.2s] plan for John was to come as the light.
[1540.0s] He was the one to come to prepare the
[1542.3s] way for Jesus. Something like that. But
[1544.6s] we see that um that was what that that
[1548.2s] was what actually happened cuz we see
[1550.2s] that um from here John's John's death
[1554.3s] didn't silence the message
[1557.2s] nor the coming of
[1560.1s] the coming the coming kingdom. It
[1562.1s] actually happened. And it's something
[1563.2s] that actually happened. So yeah, I feel
[1565.2s] like it wasn't in vain. Yeah. Yeah.
[1567.8s] Yeah. All right. And if I could add on
[1570.2s] to that. Yeah. If you go further in um
[1572.5s] John 1 6 and 7, you go to 8, it says he
[1575.8s] was not that light, but he was sent to
[1578.0s] bear witness of that light. Mhm. So if
[1581.8s] if he I I want to use illustration of a
[1584.2s] torch. Yeah. He was the torch to show
[1586.9s] where you're supposed to go. like okay
[1588.7s] in in Shags back when I go to Shagu and
[1590.8s] it's very dark at night you know we
[1592.0s] don't have like the lights the city
[1593.3s] lights it's very very dark without
[1594.7s] lights and my mom would take a torch and
[1597.6s] point to where she wants me to go so I
[1600.2s] could see where I'm going just but that
[1602.1s] doesn't mean that I myself I'm not
[1604.7s] finding like I found my way right so the
[1606.9s] torch did its job the torch doing its
[1609.4s] job doesn't mean it's any lesser than
[1611.2s] the light coming out of it does that
[1613.7s] make sense yeah so kind of like um think
[1616.6s] can tie it up to the sun and the moon.
[1618.7s] Yeah. The the the moon reflects light
[1620.6s] from the sun. That does not mean the
[1622.3s] moon is any lesser is any less important
[1626.1s] than than the sun. Yeah. Thank you for
[1627.8s] that. Um so as we as we wrapping up
[1632.6s] Yeah. Uhhuh. So I'm just losing this
[1635.4s] question here. Yes. John despite doing
[1639.0s] all that he he still almost lost hope
[1643.9s] when he sent his disciples to confirm
[1646.3s] with Jesus. Are you the Messiah or is
[1648.7s] there someone else to come? What do you
[1650.8s] think might have led to John feeling
[1653.3s] hopeless at that time? Cuz I'm sure he'd
[1655.4s] been in prison for a while and Jesus
[1657.1s] knew about it. Jesus had the power. I
[1659.3s] mean, he was healing people who were
[1660.6s] blind and deaf. He could get John out of
[1664.2s] prison in a miraculous way. So why do
[1666.8s] you think John might have lost hope at
[1668.8s] that time? Holder.
[1671.2s] Okay. I like how Ellen White in the
[1674.2s] desire videos put it that Elijah at some
[1678.6s] point he thought that the coming king
[1681.5s] would like the Messiah would come as
[1685.9s] someone who will sit on thrones would
[1688.2s] overthrow those those in power. But in
[1691.4s] contrary, Jesus actually didn't
[1694.9s] overthrow the people in power. He was
[1697.7s] just trying to show how the kingdom of
[1699.9s] heaven runs. So that's how I I think I I
[1704.7s] like that analogy. Um and it's the same
[1707.3s] mentality that the Jews had from the
[1709.7s] very beginning. It's that
[1712.4s] um the Jews knew the Messiah would come
[1715.5s] from the clouds. full grown man with all
[1718.3s] the angels come fight and just overthrow
[1720.8s] everyone. But this was someone who did
[1724.0s] seen being born as a child son to a
[1727.0s] carpenter and then they're told this is
[1729.0s] the guy coming to save us. I am sure
[1731.2s] John had the same mentality as well. I
[1733.0s] mean he was a Jew from a priestly
[1735.2s] family. He'd been taught that that's
[1736.7s] that's how the Messiah was supposed to
[1738.1s] come. So he he might have lost hope.
[1742.2s] might have been dimmed, but in his mind,
[1744.9s] he still knew his work was accomplished.
[1747.1s] And I believe John John died a very
[1750.9s] satisfied man, knowing that his work was
[1753.3s] accomplished. Yeah.
[1755.6s] Now, if I was to ask us, you know, just
[1758.5s] just to think about it uh as you as you
[1760.9s] go more after this lesson, at what point
[1763.8s] in your life can you say, "Lord, I've
[1766.3s] accomplished all I've done. I have
[1767.8s] fought the fights. I've kept the faith.
[1770.6s] and now I am ready to just
[1773.0s] rest. Yeah, it it's a big challenge for
[1775.9s] us to get there, but it's only God who
[1777.7s] can um enable us to get to that point in
[1780.2s] life. So, as you finish up, uh any
[1782.6s] parting thoughts or something you can
[1785.0s] read from the punchlines or from the
[1786.9s] further insight? I'll start with Sid.
[1788.8s] It's it's good to be humble. Yeah, cuz
[1793.0s] God can't work through you if you're not
[1795.8s] humble. True. If John wasn't humble, God
[1800.2s] wouldn't have been he wouldn't have been
[1802.2s] able to complete the work that the Lord
[1804.8s] had for him. So be just be humble and
[1809.8s] let God work through you. Amen. Thank
[1812.7s] you for that. I probably can pick one of
[1814.4s] the punchlines that really speaks to
[1815.8s] you. Matthew 11:10. Mhm. This is the one
[1820.2s] about whom it is written, I will send my
[1823.4s] messenger ahead of you who will prepare
[1826.1s] your way before you. Thank you for that.
[1831.0s] So the Lord prepares his way. He sends
[1833.0s] his people to prepare his way for us and
[1835.1s] for his work to be done. Thank you for
[1837.1s] that. Sid Brenda, any parting words? Um,
[1841.2s] as you were talking
[1842.7s] earlier about how he died a satisfied
[1845.6s] man, it came to me how many of the Jews
[1848.6s] how they were raised knowing that Jesus
[1850.2s] is coming in all this glory to fight
[1852.0s] this big battle. In a way, it did
[1854.5s] happen. If you think about it like in a
[1856.2s] metaphor cuz before that the world was
[1859.4s] ruled by sin. The devil was the prince
[1862.1s] of the world. But as soon as Jesus came
[1864.3s] and died for us, another type of war
[1866.2s] started a spiritual war on earth to
[1868.7s] fight, you know, that that to remove
[1871.0s] that strength that he had on people and
[1873.5s] to save as many people he can, right?
[1875.9s] Yeah. And for many Jews, they didn't
[1878.2s] look at it like that. You'd think the
[1880.5s] lack of metaphors in Israel back then,
[1883.9s] but okay, it's because of a lack of of
[1886.6s] understanding of the word, lack of, you
[1888.5s] know, the knowledge needed to understand
[1890.3s] that that scripture, right? And in a way
[1893.8s] we as Christians are given that role
[1896.9s] because there are many people who don't
[1898.4s] know about how the word is supposed to
[1901.3s] be interpreted or how we're supposed to
[1902.9s] understand it. We are the ones sent out
[1905.9s] you know to bear the light. We are not
[1908.0s] the light. We are to bear the light for
[1909.5s] the people to understand cuz the Jews
[1911.2s] didn't know because they weren't told.
[1913.3s] John was sent to to tell them. Yeah.
[1915.4s] Right. And in a way he wasn't any lesser
[1917.8s] cuz he was sent by God. Right. Just like
[1920.6s] how Jesus came as the son of God. So we
[1924.2s] should we should really take up that
[1926.4s] that burden. I feel like so many
[1929.0s] Christians are scared of taking it up.
[1931.0s] Yeah. But John John gives us I feel like
[1933.4s] it's a motivation like he was able to do
[1935.8s] it and finish it satisfied. He had his
[1937.8s] success at the end of his of the day.
[1939.5s] And I think so we can do the same. Can
[1941.2s] do the same. And the verse that touched
[1943.0s] me is um John 1 16:7. There was a man
[1946.8s] sent from God whose name was John. He
[1948.6s] came as a witness to testify concerning
[1950.4s] concerning the light so that through him
[1952.6s] all might believe. Amen. Thank for that
[1955.0s] Brenda. All right. So finish up. You'll
[1957.3s] read uh the first further insight than
[1959.4s] the second further insight. Mhm. God
[1963.1s] never leaves his children otherwise than
[1965.4s] they would choose to be led. If they
[1967.4s] could see the end from the beginning and
[1969.2s] discern the glory of the purpose which
[1971.0s] they are fulfilling as co-workers with
[1973.0s] him. Ellen
[1974.8s] White 22 24 and 225. Thank you. God only
[1978.4s] leads you as you'd allow him to lead
[1979.9s] you. Yeah. Um and the last further
[1984.1s] insights, and of all the gifts that
[1986.7s] heaven can bestow upon men, fellowship
[1988.9s] with Christ in his sufferings is the
[1991.3s] most weighty trust and the highest
[1993.4s] honor. Amen. Yeah. And just to close,
[1997.0s] I'd like to mention that um what I
[1999.3s] learned like from the lesson and what
[2001.2s] I'd like to share is my definition of
[2003.8s] success as I've seen. Um I feel like you
[2007.2s] know sometimes we consider success as
[2009.4s] being like the fulfillment of our plans
[2012.8s] of which mostly is materialistic. Yeah.
[2015.8s] Yeah. But I feel like um success um as
[2019.6s] as as you've seen in our story the
[2022.0s] greatest the greatest definition of
[2024.5s] success is fulfillment of God's plan in
[2028.7s] our lives. Yeah. Like fulfilling that
[2031.0s] plan that God has in your life. That's
[2033.4s] the greatest definition of success.
[2035.0s] Amen. Thank you for that. Appearance
[2037.2s] versus reality. That has been our
[2038.9s] lesson. Thank you so much for staying
[2040.4s] with us till the end. Like to ask
[2042.7s] Winston to pray with us as we close.
[2045.5s] Okay. Let us pray. Almighty God, we come
[2048.2s] before you this wonderful time to thank
[2049.8s] you for the gift of life. We thank you
[2051.6s] for being with us since we started our
[2053.2s] lesson until this wonderful time that we
[2054.8s] want to close. Father, protect us.
[2056.9s] Continue guiding us and may your will be
[2058.6s] done upon our lives. Father, help us to
[2060.8s] apply whatever we have learned today in
[2062.6s] our lives. Father, help us. We all have
[2065.1s] different purposes. Dear Lord, help us
[2067.0s] to to to identify them and achieve
[2071.0s] success. Dear Lord, thank you for being
[2072.9s] with us today and protect us all in
[2075.2s] Jesus name we pray and believe. Amen.
[2077.4s] Amen. Till next time. Thank you.
