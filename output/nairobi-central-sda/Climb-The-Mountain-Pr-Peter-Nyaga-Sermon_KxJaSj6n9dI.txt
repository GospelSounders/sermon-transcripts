FULL TRANSCRIPT:
Welcome to our fourth day of our four days of strategic speaking on our strategic forecast for the year 2025 rooted and growing. This four days we've been speaking in regards to the focus or the theme for the second quarter that is rise and build. This quarter begins this month began last Sabbath and goes all the way to the end of June. free months of rise and build and what we have basically done this week is to speak to this theme that going to run for three months and try to give us a taste of what is expected as we go through this particular three months. So when I say root and growing, respond and say rise and build. Are we together? Okay. And when I say rise and build, respond and say what? Brutant and growing. Let's try. Brutant and growing. Uh, no. We can do better than that. We can do better than that. Rooten and growing. Rise and build. Rise and build. Yeah, that a bit of warm up. A bit of warm up. Okay, let me try those up there. Those up there. Those up there. Brutin and growing. Okay, let me see down here. Rooten and growing. [Applause] Ah, you guys, you're going to pull up your socks. Okay, everyone. Rooten and growing. Rise and build. Rise and build. Rooten and grow. Now this is our discussion for the next three months and it is anchored in the text of Nehemiah chapter 2 verse 17 and 18. Nehemiah chapter 2 verse 17 and 18 is the guiding text for these two or three months in this quarter the second quarter of this year when we talk about rise and build the Bible says then I said to them you see the distress that we are in uh we can read together I've seen it's being projected here can we read together why don't you start then I said to them you See the distress that we are in. How Jerusalem lies waste and its gates are burned with fire. Come and let us build the wall of Jerusalem that we may no longer be reproached. 18 Oh, I think they're delayed to give it. Okay, let's go to vers 18. want to start. And I told them of the hand of my God, which had been good upon me, and also of the king's words that he had spoken to me. So they said, "Let us rise up and build." Then they set their hands to this good work. Can you say amen? You see this is a very powerful theme. Rise and build. And we pulled this theme from this passage verse 18 the last segment where the Bible says so they said let us rise up and build. And we saw a serious commitment of God's people when God appealed to them to turn their hearts to his church, his house, and beautify the house and give it the glory and the befitting image that God demands. So we have so far from Wednesday been able to zoom into this discussion and on the first day on Wednesday we looked at the casting of the vision. By the way I've been dealing with four C's in this message. The four the first C has been casting the vision or if you want sharing the vision. That is what we looked at on the first day on Wednesday representing the month of a April. So the entire month we will be casting the vision. Now in the month of May this is represented by the message I brought to us on Thursday. The message was entitled clearing the rubbles. Clearing the rubbles. Yesterday, Friday, the message representing the month of June, the title subject was committed to the cause. Committed to the cause. And today our message is climb the mountain. Can everyone say climb the mountain? A bit louder. Climb the mountain. So four C's in this quarter. The first C is casting the vision. Number two C is clearing the troubles. Number three C for us is what? Committing to the cause. And number four C is climb the mountain. So I want to welcome you to a tough ascent to the mountaintop. Let's pray. Gracious Father in heaven, hallowed be thy name, thy kingdom come, thy will be done in this place and for this message as it is in heaven. For thine is the kingdom, the power, and glory. You said, if you be lifted up, you shall draw all men unto yourself. And so, my father, this morning, I pray that may I not be seen. May I not be heard, but may you be seen and heard as you speak to your people. My prayer, my father, is that you may pour your words into my mouth and order my thoughts and my lips to your will. In Jesus name we pray. Amen. Climb the mountain. Friends, let me begin by saying we stand at a very pivotal moment in the history of Nairobi Central Church where God is calling each one of us to ascend to the mountaintop. The call is climb the mountain. And I've been trying to see what is special about the mountain. And indeed, I've come to discover in the Bible there's something very special about the mountains. Generally, mountains tire the soul because mountains stand tall. They are immovable. They look majestic. When you behold a mountain, you admire. That's why we have people who spend their time training and training and training how to go and climb the mountains. And they climb one mountain, they go, they train for another mountain. They feel good when they conquer mountains. One day I sat with a mountain climber and asked him, "What what motivates you?" And he told me, you know what, my friend, when you're on the top of the mountain, you see the glory of God. You see life differently and you wonder at the creation of God. There is something special when you are on the top of the mountain. Now God has always had moments when he called his people to climb the mountain for many and various reasons. You see friends, God calling you to climb the mountain is actually calling you from the low plains of life and he want you to step on a higher ground. Not just physical ground but higher ground in your life. Higher ground in your experience, higher ground in your sp in your spiritual life, higher ground in your careers, higher ground in anything and everything you do in this life. God always is interested in lifting you high. In the scripture, mountains are often places where people meet with God. A place where they receive his vision and a place where they hear his voice and a place where their lives are changed. Mountains are used of God for him to reveal himself to people that people may see his plan and his purpose that they may hear his voice with clarity and that their lives may be transformed. But friends, you know that climbing mountains isn't easy. Climbing mountains takes effort. When I was growing up in our Pathfinder club, we my we had a very vibrant Pathfinder club in my church and we had spend most of the times we were hiking and climbing the mountains. I love that. I love that. And and one thing I learned about the mountain climbing. Well, whereas climbing the mountain is tough, descending it is even more tougher than climbing the mountain. And I kept on asking myself, why is it that when you're going down the mountain is quite difficult? I come to conclude that when you climb the mountain, God want you to stay there. Can somebody say amen? God doesn't want you to go down the mountain. He lift you high and he want you to enjoy. You can only climb on the higher mountain. He doesn't require to go down. You see friends, but before you get up there, it takes effort. It takes determination and a willingness to endure the hand path upward. One day I got an opportunity to climb Mount Si and we were with my friends and we climbed beginning around the middle of the night. We climbed the mountain. The mountain is tough. I know most of us have climbed that mountain. The mountain is tough climbing up there and we climbed. We were so excited all the way from Kenya. Finally at the foot of Mount Sai and we are climbing to see where Moses stood up there. So we began with a lot of psych and power and energy. Our guy told us listen to me this mountain is a tough one. The way you began with a lot of energy and excitement running I am afraid you may not reach at the peak of the mountain. Now we we didn't understand what you we were so excited. In fact we wanted to see who will be the first one to be on the top of the mountain. Well, my friends who could be listening to this were with me. Not every one of us was able to get to the top of the mountain. Now, I'm glad I made it. But I had injuries for the next two weeks. But I'm just saying climbing the mountain is not an easy thing for anyone to do. However, mountains were created for people to climb. Can somebody say amen? Mountains are there to be climbed. So, don't fear the mountains. And you see when I'm talking about mountains, I'm talking about so many things in our lives. There are various mountains in our lives. Mountains. Mountains that challenge our progress. They I'm not just talking about the physical mountains. I'm talking about things that challenge your progress. Things are like obstacles on your way. Things that you feel are difficult for you to move. Things that block your progress. These are mountainies and are there for you to climb them. Because when you climb the challenge that is facing you, then you see the glory of God. You see friends, as you climb the mountain, you are inviting in this message to climb deeper into the message and into the relationship that you ought to share with God. God want to give you a greater vision and a renewed purpose for your existence and the reason why you are here in the church. Now the book of Nemiah gives us a test of what God expect of his people today in Arabic central church. Now in Nehemiah gets a burden because the house of God is broken. The walls are lying in ruins. The gates have been burnt. And somebody may ask what about wars? What is it that why bother with wars? I thought I wish there was the the temple that was broken. But was now let me speak and tell us this morning friends that the walls in the days of Nehemiah was so important because the walls were a sign of national security. People used to build strong and massive walls as a sign of fortified cities. When you did not have a wall around you, you are exposed, you are useless and anyone, you are just a useless person. Now when the church of God was constructed, God also instructed a massive wall to be built around the temple of Jerusalem with serious gates made of metal. Now when the enemies came, they came attacked the walls, broke the walls down. And while they were telling God and the people that were worshiping in Jerusalem, your God is so weak, we can attack him and break him and smash him and trap him down like we have done to the wall of the church and the temple of your God. And it was reproach and it was disgrace. and Nehemiah where he is a slave in some country finds out that the Jerusalem the temple of God the wall surrounding the temple has been broken. The Bible tells me the was troubled in his heart and in his soul. I want to pause here and ask you what troubles you about the house of the Lord. What troubles you? Are you ever troubled by how the house of the Lord looks like? Are you ever troubled by what is taking place in the house of the Lord? Are you troubled? Nehemiah at this particular time has not seen the ruins, but he has heard of the report of all the walls of the temple have been brought down. And now people are laughing at the people of God. Nemiah said, "What is happening here?" Now, let me also let you know there are people in Jerusalem. And the people in Jerusalem are not bothered. They are there. They are witnessing the ruins every day, but they're not bothered. They go to the same temple. They are not bothered. The church of God is lying in ruins. They are not bothered. But Nehemiah, a man in a slave country, when he of the house of God has been exposed to ridicule, the heart of Nehemiah was troubled. In verse number four, the Bible says, "And Nehemiah sat and he was troubled and he was praying and fasting and pleading with the Lord that God can do something to remove away the disgrace." I'm just asking this morning, what troubles your heart? Now, let me take you to the book of Hagai. The book of Hagi, chapter one comes with a similar story. Now, Hagi is called again, God speaks to Hagi to go and tell the people of Israel to build the temple. Now, the temple, of course, we know in the Israel that Hagi and Nehemiah lived um a period of time of about about 700 to 900 years difference in terms of you know the time span and Hagai was the first one. So the story in the book of Hag comes before the story in the book of Nemiah. Now in the days of Hagai the entire temple was broken was destroyed and the king said there now God speaks to a guy and tells a guy go and tell my people. Now in verse number eight of the book of Hag chapter 1, the Bible says, "Go up to the mountains and bring wood and build the temple that I may take pleasure in it and glorify God." You know the Bible in this particular passage is speaking to to God's people. Now God speaking to Hagi, it shows him the way the church is looking like. It is a time for the people to go and climb the mountain. The way the church looks like, the way the temple looks like, this one cannot be repaired. This one cannot be rebuilt. This one cannot be fixed. When people have not gone to the mountain, this one demands a going to the mountain. This one demands a climbing of the mountain. Because the things that are needed, the resources that are needed to rebuild the temple cannot be found in ordinary situations. You've got to go to the mountain. That is where I have kept all the things that are needed to rebuild my temple. Can somebody say amen? God tells the guy, "Go and tell them to go to the mountain." Wait a minute. You see friends, what we are doing as a church in this season is not ordinary. This is not business as usual. These people had their wealth, they had their money, they had they and their they had their estates, they had their plots, they had all those things. God told them, "I know who you owe. I know the things you have, but for this one, I want you to move out of your homes, go out of your estate, go to the mountains, and go climb up there. Bring down the timber that is needed for my house. Now, I told you last when I spoke here briefly, and I am not ashamed, and I'm not shying about this one. I am challenging you on this one. God is not asking you to just give an offering that come from your pocket alone or only. God want you to go identify a mountain, climb that mountain, bring the offering to fix the mess in the house of God. Do you have a witness out there? Can you say amen? God want you to go out of your way. Go and look for your friends. Go and look for the king. Go and look for you know Nehemiah went to the king. This is an heathen king and the heathen king supplied all that was needed for the rebuilding of the walls of Jerusalem. This one is a climbing of the mountain. You see friends in the book of Hagi the Israelites and lived in captivity in Pia for a very long time. And when Hagay is speaking here is about 18 years after the first dispatchment of uh or the release of the captives back to Jerusalem. So they returned from from Babylon and the king of course you know the story the king Sarah had allowed them to go back and rebuild the temple when you check in the Ezra chapter 1 verse 1-4. But however, the sen story is this. When they returned, when God released them, God going to set them free from their captivity and they came back to Jerusalem with instruction to go and build the temple of God. They came when we take the book of Ezra because the same same story in the book of Ezra. They came, they lay the foundation, they lay the altar, they started constructing, but midway they got tired. They abandoned the project of God and they went back and began on their personal individual family project developing themsel growing themsel because they have lived in captivity for too long. God is unvisible. He wanted to spend all our resources in fixing a temple where we have nowhere to sleep. And they were busy building their homes. They continued. They completed their homes. Their homes were fortified. They were magnificent. They were good. They began now enjoying their homes. They were there for 16 good years. No one bothered themsel with the plight of the house of the Lord until God came again. He spoke to Hagai and told him, "Hag guy, go and ask these people. I see in your homes. You have good houses. You have built for yourself good houses. You enjoying good places. But my house is a disgrace. Is lying in freeze. I am disgraced. You are better than me. I'm your God. I've given you all these things, but your place is better than my place. What kind of a people are you? As you are thankless people, go. If you have said you have nothing, climb the mountain, bring the timbers. I created the timber. Go bring the timber that my house may be rebuilt. Let me speak to us friends. And by the way, I want to be very frank with us. I have never been troubled as a pastor the way I'm troubled in this season because I know whenever God makes such an appeal to the body of faith, two things are involved. God has prepared to bless the church or God has prepared to deal with the church. These are two things I can tell you for sure. Had I've been praying and every time I pray before I raise from my prayer I hear God tell me pastor judgment is coming. Today I'm here to speak to us to tell us God is asking us to climb the mountain. I want to have a few photos here. I I hope my team up there is able to do that. Let's just let's just appreciate a few photos here. Can tell me friends, how do you want pastor to be cool, to be nice, to be quiet when the house of God looks this way? How? At least for me, my sister, I know your house. made sense. I know your house. It doesn't look like this way. That's why I'm so much emotional about this message. I've been to your homes. Tell me here whose house looks like this. Ooh. Ooh. God broke them from exile. They first began with God's work. Midway they left it and they all went back to develop themselves. They were busy. They forgot. I see this message and exactly that is what is happening in Arabic Central Church. We began well. Why do we want to end badly, my dear friends? We began well. Where did the spirit go? Why do we drive our very good expensive cars, park them every Sabbath? Well, the house of God looks this way and we are not troubled. How are we out of our minds, people? We come here, we are so at peace. You're never troubled. What is this? Now, let me preach this sermon is my maybe it's my last but I have done what God is telling me to tell you today. This one, my friends, is disgrace. Nemiah came and told them, "No, no, no, no, no, no." No, no, no, no, no, no. Let us not pretend people. This one, this one is reproach. This one is disgrace. You know, I can't even understand that Nehemiah had to come from slavery to come and tell people that come on, come on, come on, come on. This is disgrace. Well, they were coming there every week. No one of them was bothered. Elder Mai, you can call Elder's council and you vote persona to leave with immediate effect. With immediate effect, but but allow me to speak what the Lord is asking me to do. You see, the reason why I'm so passionate is what I find in the book of Hagai. Now listen to the book of Hagai. H in the book of Hag God tells me tells them okay fine fine fine. Mhm. And learn evil to s but let me tell you what has been happening. This God telling them you see I looked at you. I've been appealing to you. Anyone who brings this thought you shut it down. You go back to your farms. Basi you plant. Finish for me. You plant. You don't want to tell me. You plant. You bring in little. You spend your money in tending to your farms but the yield the outcome is not commensurate. The money that you're holding, the finances you have refused to bring to my house, you will spend them in your useless farms. I will make sure you will not have a yield that befits your effort until when you know I am crying for my house. I can tell you for sure. I can tell you for sure. Most of you here the kind of jobs you're doing you're not supposed to be doing them. God mute. God applied some breaks in your progress. You are experiencing difficulties at your workplace. The environment is becoming toxic. You began your business is not growing. You come here every Sabbath, every camp meeting, have attendance of prayer. Jos is writing prayer requests on purpose dropping there. I don't know how many books you are finished writing prayer request for your business for your career and nothing seemed to change. God says wait a minute wait a minute doesn't matter how long you stay in your prayer so long as you have turned your ear deaf to the plight of my house you will plant and you will harvest little. This is a hard truth that I have to speak to my church with utmost love because I know you love God. You want to serve him. But on this one, we need to be awakened the way Haggai Awoken people the way Hermaya awoke those people. So God chose a guy go and show them to climb the mountain. You see friends, I find in the Bible Every time God has called his people to climb the mountain, there's something special want to do. God causes people to climb the mountain of sacrifice in order to build something greater than themselves. A place where his presence can dwell, where his glory can be revealed, and where his name can be glorified. Today we are standing at a moment in time when God is calling us to climb the mountain together, not physically physical mountain, but spiritually and mentally and socially and financially in order to bring a beating image of God in his temple. Now on is it on Thursday or Thursday that day I spoke here and I said God is an expensive God. Eric God God knows how to enjoy life my friend God God does not dwell on cheap things. No no no no no no no. Look at God even at creation all that he created. The Bible tells me the testimony is everything was perfect. When God wanted the children of Israel to construct a place of worship in the wilderness, the tent just the tent, go and look at the description of the tent in the wilderness. You you go to go to Ruaka fountain of hope and see where people worshiping and look at the tent that God instructed in that particular time and that that was temple before they come to Canaan. Now when God instructed the temple to be built, go and check the instructions, the choice of material, find things, expensive things. God is not cheap. Don't portray a cheap God. If your God is cheap, my God is not cheap. God is expensive. Now if you don't know what I'm telling you, I was checking the Bible and the Bible tells me when we go to heaven even pastor who has never seen a gold most of you have seen gold I've never seen not even touching I've never seen oh oh no I've seen it in the pictures but the Bible tells me when we go to heaven our walk pathways is the street in heaven. The street the streets not the main thing. The street are made of gold. Question. If the streets are made of gold, what about the bedroom of God? You know, we just think like human beings. Sister, if if the streets if the streets of heaven are made of gold, is God extravagant? Yes, God is extravagant because he owns everything. And God lives in this place that he owns everything. So when he invites you to come back with what he has given you and give him an image befitting him, God is not making unreasonable appeal. That is why he says you planned and you do what a little. Now somebody may look at the church and say ah pastor look at that all members please look at that. Now when you see those spots that is not paint. No no no no this is not designed the roof design the ceiling. No no no no no no no. You know you may think that is what it was designed. No this is not designed. This is the wasting of the temple of God and we come we sit comfortably and you know because we did this front part you know this front part deceives people now you know online people when you see this front part you think ah the church is ah the church hey and don't even come to see and we are saying people of God people of God, we can do better things. God want you to climb the mountain. And and a time God calls people to climb the mountain is because he want them to sacrifice something. He called Abraham. So Abraham, climb the mountain with your son. He wanted to reveal to Abraham the extent of his confidence in Abraham. He knew Abraham loves him. But Abraham never knew that God had such a deep trust in Abraham. And God was testing Abraham as to whether he knows how much God loves him to go and sacrifice your son. God had a plan not to kill Isaac but to sacrifice the lamb. And so Abraham ascends to the mountain. He climbed the mountain to sacrifice a son. But the Bible tells me he did not lose a son because God provided. Hallelujah. Somebody those who will climb this mountain are not going to lose a livelihood. Those who are going to climb this mountain shall not going to lose a livelihood. Let me speak to my church and tell you on this day this mountain this mountain this mountain is a testing moment for the church. When God wanted to test Moses, he beat him climb the mountain in Sinai. Moses failed the test. He came down, broke the tablets. Thank God gave him, you know, you know, the first person to retake an exam was Moses. You guys are not with me. You're not with me. The first person to retake exam. So if there's any student listening to me and you failed in my grace and you have to retain don't you be worried God is starting that one Moses failed the test and God and to give him another paper to do thank God the second paper Moses passed can somebody say amen we have to climb the mountain and climbing the mountain is a test of our faith Jesus was be on the mountain to climb the mountain to go and be touched I praise God Because Jesus never wasted chance. Jesus passed the exam and he saved the world. Whenever God calls you to climb the mountain is a testing time. This one. This one. This one is a test elder pew. This one my church board members. This one. My church members. This one. This one is not an ordinary thing. This one is a test. The question I ask you today, will you pass the test or fail the test? Look at the person next to you. Just just look look at him or at her with mercy and sympathy. With kindness. Don't rebuke them. Don't rebuke them. Don't just look them with mercy. With kindness. Ask them, "My sister, my brother, will you pass the exam?" I don't know why you look at me. Look at your friend. Look at your friend. Look at your friend. Simple instructions. Simple instructions. Those are seated alone now. Those see the internet. Those internet. Those internet. Just type there. Just type there. Just type there. Will you pass this exam? This exam. By the way, there's no simple exam. Exam is an exam. A test is a test. Even right now, even those we have so many professors here. If I called you, if I just called, I told you my good elders and good people here, can you meet in my office? I have a small test for you. You will see some of you start getting nervous. What test? What is possible to test? There's no simple test. But this one is not meant to prove you wrong. This one is meant to prove God might in your life. God is testing to see how much you trust in him. This one is a test and I pray that we all may pass with flying colors. Can I hear amen out here? What are we afraid of? Now, let me show you something here. The PA people I see about 16. the PE people give me give me no I I you you forgive me for this but I and to think deeply about this thing and I said come on am I asking the church to do what is impossible am I unreasonable as a pastor I said okay so let's let me have it so I I went into a giving I went into a giving no no this one's not enough of this one give me the one I sent you So I I call it Narabi Central Church members estimated net worth dear friend where wait the thing is coming this is coming are we asking you to do what you're not now look at this look at this look at this look at this look at this now there's a simple analysis I did from our giving you see every month every month we you limit 10% of your earnings True or false? Ah, are you with me? Every month you remit to the church treasury 10% of your earning. True or false? So what we have as a church is a 10% of your honeying. What is 100%. Mhm. Now if I got into a private space, forgive me. But now in an average I took an estimated figure of 13 million at times goes to 15 at times can come down to 10 when we have a very bad day of bad month but we never goes down there. Then I also looked at the percentage of givers. Now what will shock you is that very small percentage of the membership of Nabi Central Church that are actually giving. We are people here. Mhm. People here who come every Sabbath consume worship you go home. Which hotel will you go eat at home without pay? Where are you getting free services in this country? Now God said in my design, no free services. Come to me not emptyhanded. It's a simple logic. Don't come to me empty-handed. God is saying you've got to pay. Well, I'm using business language to explain a point. Are you with me? Mhm. So cautiously when you come from January to December, we are giving ti and offering, you don't give. We ask you for money for the crusade, you don't give. We asking money for committing, you don't give. Uhhuh. Are you okay? Are you okay? So why the church running? So I was shocked to know that the figures have here is about 20% of the church membership that is giving. Can you imagine? That is alarming. So ask that friend next to you, are you part of the [Laughter] 80%. I I know I know I I know we not used to these kind of messages, but allow me today to have it plain black and white after this. Well, are you part of the 80%. Now I said okay fine. So if 10% How much is 10% per month? How much? So 100% by just that simple estimate we are looking at 130 million flowing in our pockets here. here every month. Every month and that is of 20% of the members not not even 50% 20% of us are swimming in swimming swimming swimming siming in 130 million per month and the church is struggling. I could go ahead and hide myself in some bushes that you would get me. And I said, "Wait a minute." And then I said, "Okay, if this is one month, how much is one year?" And he was shocked to see how rich we are as a church. 1.5 billion Kenyan shillings flows in the homes of the members of Nairobi central church at 20% of the membership and then you here tell me pastor go to so and so go to honorable we bewitched and who bewitched Now let me bring it close. I'm just addressing is it possible to climb this mountain? Now as I was doing my research, I was told just one man just one man donated all the pews this very expensive timber you see here. And the other day I was doubting an elder came here and confirmed to me said pastor yes I was there when he stood in the old sanctuary and committed him. So before pastor said pastor I am going to donate all the pews for the church. One man I think can come from us. He was not a Kenyan. Was he a Kenyan Ruth? You you don't know you are not here. Ment you did your wedding in old sanctuary. Unfort you are my friend so I have to keep using you. I hope you were there that day. You were there. Is he a Kenyan? Did he die? Have you seen his family begging? You tell me. I'm just think loudly. I'm just think loudly now. Now you see look at this church. We all very proud of this church. True. And some of you are getting injuries because like I'm portraying you in a negative. No will be good. No, I'm told it's a logic. It's a simple logic. When the church was being built, the builders, the church members were members worshiping in the old Sanfield. True or false? So what is the capacity of the own sanctuary? What was the capacity then? How many members put up all these? Which year? It's about 27 years ago. Look at the economy of the days at the numbers of the members who sacrifice all this. You see, look at us today in our numbers. Our book shows me we are 9,000 plus members. Do you tell me pastor? Of course, you know that is is is blocked and with names you cannot tell where they are and granted. So, how many are we? Are we 200? Are we 300? How many are we? So if a handful of people worshiping in that small temple were able to do all this, what about the massive numbers we have today in this church? He says you planned Now the Bible tells me God spoke to them so passionately and he told them go and bring the timber. I am speaking to my church and I'm telling you the time has come. Let us go to the mountain. Let us go to the mountain. Go and bring the timber. Go and bring materials. Go bring resources. God will not forgive us. God will not sit well when he's watching us doing the things we're doing. Some of us at a personal level we are running a project worth hundreds of millions but when we ask you to come and give even 100 it's a problem honestly must I preach all this you don't see and some of us start talking too I'm a cupa. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. My good, by the way, church, I love you from the deepest. There's no church I've ever served with all my mind, my life, my everything like Central Church. You wait that day when God comes. He'll show you how my heart was committed to the church. I've got to tell you the truth. Let's remove this disgrace. Can I tell you something? Can I tell you something? Just one of you here, one of you here can decide to do all that you want to do for the church. One, oh, so pastor, you have been coming to our houses to see how much you have blessed. I'm just, you know. Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. There are times when we've got to get serious. People car us building the temple. Let's stand. Let's stand. Let's stand. Let's stand. Coras, let's sing that song. [Music] foreign speech.

TIMESTAMPED TRANSCRIPT:
[0.6s] Welcome
[3.9s] to our fourth day
[8.8s] of our four days of strategic speaking
[13.6s] on our strategic forecast for the year
[17.5s] 2025 rooted and growing.
[22.4s] This four days we've been
[26.9s] speaking in regards to the focus or the
[31.3s] theme for the second
[33.0s] quarter that is rise and
[39.0s] build. This quarter begins this month
[42.6s] began last
[44.4s] Sabbath and goes all the way to the end
[47.1s] of June. free months of rise and
[51.2s] build and what we have basically done
[53.9s] this week is to speak to this theme that
[58.8s] going to run for three months and try to
[61.9s] give us a taste of what is expected as
[65.0s] we go through this particular three
[70.0s] months. So when I say root and growing,
[74.6s] respond and say rise and build. Are we
[77.6s] together? Okay. And when I say rise and
[81.3s] build, respond and say what? Brutant and
[84.5s] growing. Let's try. Brutant and growing.
[91.5s] Uh,
[93.2s] no. We can do better than that. We can
[96.6s] do better than that. Rooten and growing.
[100.6s] Rise and build. Rise and build.
[106.0s] Yeah, that a bit of warm up. A bit of
[107.9s] warm up. Okay, let me try those up
[110.5s] there. Those up there. Those up there.
[113.7s] Brutin and growing.
[117.8s] Okay, let me see down here. Rooten and
[121.6s] growing.
[122.7s] [Applause]
[124.6s] Ah, you guys, you're going to pull up
[126.9s] your socks. Okay, everyone. Rooten and
[130.3s] growing. Rise and build. Rise and build.
[134.7s] Rooten and grow. Now this is our
[137.9s] discussion for the next three months and
[140.8s] it is anchored in the text of Nehemiah
[143.5s] chapter 2 verse 17 and 18. Nehemiah
[148.6s] chapter 2 verse 17 and 18 is the guiding
[152.4s] text for these two or three months in
[154.8s] this quarter the second quarter of this
[156.9s] year when we talk about rise and build
[160.3s] the Bible says then I said to them you
[163.8s] see the distress that we are in
[169.3s] uh we can read together I've seen it's
[170.8s] being projected here can we read
[172.0s] together why don't you start then I said
[175.4s] to them you See the distress that we are
[179.2s] in. How Jerusalem lies waste and its
[184.1s] gates are burned with fire. Come and let
[187.9s] us build the wall of Jerusalem that we
[191.4s] may no longer be reproached.
[199.0s] 18 Oh, I think they're delayed to give
[202.6s] it. Okay, let's go to vers 18. want to
[205.7s] start. And I told them of the hand of my
[209.5s] God, which had been good upon me, and
[213.6s] also of the king's words that he had
[217.0s] spoken to me. So they said, "Let us rise
[221.5s] up and build." Then they set their hands
[225.7s] to this good work. Can you say amen?
[230.9s] You see this is a very powerful
[233.9s] theme. Rise and build. And we pulled
[238.5s] this theme from this passage verse 18
[242.2s] the last segment where the Bible says so
[244.9s] they said let us rise up and build. And
[249.6s] we saw a serious commitment of God's
[252.8s] people when God appealed to them to turn
[256.2s] their hearts to his church, his house,
[258.5s] and beautify the house and give it the
[260.5s] glory and the befitting image that God
[264.3s] demands.
[267.1s] So we have so far from Wednesday been
[270.6s] able to zoom into this discussion and on
[274.6s] the first day on Wednesday we looked
[278.8s] at the casting of the vision. By the way
[282.4s] I've been dealing with four C's in this
[285.3s] message. The four the first C has been
[288.2s] casting the vision or if you want
[290.6s] sharing the vision. That is what we
[293.2s] looked at on the first day on Wednesday
[295.7s] representing the month of a April. So
[299.0s] the entire month we will be casting the
[301.3s] vision. Now in the month of
[304.6s] May this is represented by the message I
[308.2s] brought to us on Thursday. The message
[311.4s] was entitled clearing the rubbles.
[315.4s] Clearing the rubbles.
[318.4s] Yesterday,
[319.8s] Friday, the message representing the
[323.1s] month of
[324.4s] June, the title subject was committed to
[328.6s] the cause. Committed to the
[332.8s] cause. And today our message is
[337.6s] climb the mountain. Can everyone say
[340.3s] climb the
[341.9s] mountain? A bit louder. Climb the
[344.6s] mountain.
[346.5s] So four C's in this quarter. The first C
[349.5s] is casting the vision. Number two C is
[353.8s] clearing the troubles. Number three C
[357.0s] for us is what? Committing to the cause.
[361.4s] And number four C is climb the mountain.
[367.4s] So I want to welcome
[369.7s] you
[372.1s] to a
[374.3s] tough ascent
[376.8s] to the
[380.2s] mountaintop. Let's
[382.2s] pray. Gracious Father in
[385.3s] heaven, hallowed be thy name, thy
[387.5s] kingdom
[388.7s] come, thy will be done in this place and
[393.2s] for this message as it is in heaven.
[397.0s] For thine is the kingdom, the power, and
[400.8s] glory. You said, if you be lifted up,
[403.3s] you shall draw all men unto yourself.
[405.9s] And so, my father, this morning, I pray
[407.8s] that may I not be seen. May I not be
[409.9s] heard, but may you be seen and heard as
[413.1s] you speak to your
[414.7s] people. My prayer, my father, is that
[417.0s] you may pour your words into my mouth
[419.7s] and order my thoughts and my lips to
[421.8s] your will. In Jesus name we pray.
[426.7s] Amen.
[428.2s] Climb the
[433.5s] mountain.
[435.2s] Friends, let me begin by saying we
[439.0s] stand at a very pivotal moment in the
[442.8s] history of Nairobi Central
[446.0s] Church where God is calling each one of
[449.1s] us to ascend to the mountaintop.
[455.6s] The call is climb the
[459.8s] mountain. And I've been trying to see
[462.5s] what is special about the
[465.8s] mountain. And indeed, I've come to
[467.9s] discover in the Bible there's something
[470.3s] very special about the
[475.8s] mountains. Generally, mountains tire the
[479.4s] soul because mountains stand tall.
[483.8s] They are
[485.1s] immovable. They look
[487.5s] majestic. When you behold a mountain,
[489.9s] you
[490.8s] admire. That's why we have people who
[493.2s] spend their time training and training
[495.7s] and training how to go and climb the
[498.1s] mountains. And they climb one mountain,
[500.6s] they go, they train for another
[501.8s] mountain. They feel good when they
[503.8s] conquer
[505.3s] mountains. One day I sat with a mountain
[508.0s] climber and asked him, "What what
[510.4s] motivates you?" And he told me, you know
[513.2s] what, my friend, when you're on the top
[515.5s] of the
[516.6s] mountain, you see the glory of God. You
[521.0s] see life differently and you wonder at
[524.4s] the creation of God. There is something
[527.4s] special when you are on the top of the
[530.6s] mountain. Now God has
[534.1s] always had moments when he called his
[537.1s] people to climb the mountain for many
[541.7s] and various reasons. You see
[545.3s] friends, God calling you to climb the
[548.2s] mountain is actually calling you from
[550.8s] the low plains of life and he want you
[553.7s] to step on a higher ground. Not just
[556.9s] physical ground but higher ground in
[559.3s] your life. Higher ground in your
[561.3s] experience, higher ground in your sp in
[563.7s] your spiritual life, higher ground in
[565.8s] your careers, higher ground in anything
[568.3s] and everything you do in this life. God
[570.8s] always is interested in lifting you
[575.8s] high. In the
[578.1s] scripture, mountains are often places
[580.7s] where people meet with
[583.6s] God. A place where they receive his
[587.7s] vision and a place where they hear his
[591.4s] voice and a place where their lives are
[595.7s] changed.
[597.4s] Mountains are used of God for him to
[601.5s] reveal himself to people that people may
[605.5s] see his plan and his purpose that they
[609.2s] may hear his voice with clarity and that
[612.3s] their lives may be transformed.
[615.4s] But
[616.3s] friends, you know that climbing
[618.6s] mountains isn't
[620.8s] easy. Climbing mountains takes
[625.1s] effort. When I was growing up in our
[629.0s] Pathfinder club, we my we had a very
[632.5s] vibrant Pathfinder club in my church and
[635.6s] we had spend most of the times we were
[639.7s] hiking and climbing the mountains. I
[642.3s] love that. I love
[643.8s] that.
[645.6s] And and one thing I learned about the
[648.3s] mountain
[651.2s] climbing. Well, whereas climbing the
[654.3s] mountain is
[656.6s] tough, descending it is even more
[659.3s] tougher than climbing the
[661.6s] mountain. And I kept on asking myself,
[663.9s] why is it that when you're going down
[665.5s] the mountain is quite difficult?
[669.8s] I come to conclude that when you climb
[672.6s] the mountain, God want you to stay
[675.0s] there. Can somebody say amen? God
[677.9s] doesn't want you to go down the
[679.8s] mountain. He lift you high and he want
[683.0s] you to enjoy. You can only climb on the
[685.3s] higher mountain. He doesn't require to
[687.4s] go
[688.9s] down. You see friends, but before you
[692.4s] get up there, it takes effort. It takes
[694.6s] determination and a willingness to
[696.6s] endure the hand path upward.
[700.2s] One day I got an opportunity to climb
[702.4s] Mount Si and we were with my friends and
[706.2s] we
[707.7s] climbed beginning around the middle of
[709.8s] the night. We climbed the mountain. The
[712.1s] mountain is tough. I know most of us
[713.6s] have climbed that mountain. The mountain
[715.5s] is tough climbing up there and we
[717.7s] climbed. We were so excited all the way
[720.2s] from Kenya. Finally at the foot of Mount
[723.2s] Sai and we are climbing to see where
[725.7s] Moses stood up there. So we began with a
[729.2s] lot of psych and power and energy. Our
[731.8s] guy told us listen to me this mountain
[735.1s] is a tough one. The way you began with a
[738.3s] lot of energy and excitement running I
[741.4s] am afraid you may not reach at the peak
[744.3s] of the mountain. Now we we didn't
[746.2s] understand what you we were so excited.
[748.2s] In fact we wanted to see who will be the
[750.1s] first one to be on the top of the
[751.7s] mountain.
[754.8s] Well, my friends who could be listening
[757.0s] to this were with
[759.2s] me. Not every one of us was able to get
[762.3s] to the top of the mountain. Now, I'm
[764.7s] glad I made
[766.4s] it. But I had injuries for the next two
[771.2s] weeks. But I'm just saying climbing the
[774.2s] mountain is not an easy thing for anyone
[777.3s] to do.
[778.8s] However, mountains were created for
[783.0s] people to climb. Can somebody say amen?
[786.1s] Mountains are there to be climbed. So,
[789.2s] don't fear the
[791.9s] mountains. And you see when I'm talking
[794.2s] about
[795.3s] mountains, I'm talking about so many
[797.8s] things in our
[799.1s] lives. There are various mountains in
[801.7s] our
[802.8s] lives. Mountains. Mountains that
[805.8s] challenge our progress. They I'm not
[808.2s] just talking about the physical
[809.5s] mountains. I'm talking about things that
[812.2s] challenge your progress. Things are like
[815.0s] obstacles on your way. Things that you
[817.5s] feel are difficult for you to move.
[820.0s] Things that block your progress. These
[822.6s] are mountainies and are there for you to
[826.0s] climb them. Because when you climb the
[829.0s] challenge that is facing you, then you
[831.4s] see the glory of God.
[835.3s] You see
[838.2s] friends, as you climb the
[843.4s] mountain, you are inviting in this
[845.8s] message to climb deeper into the message
[849.2s] and into the relationship that you ought
[851.8s] to share with God. God want to give you
[854.9s] a greater vision and a renewed purpose
[858.4s] for your existence and the reason why
[860.7s] you are here in the church. Now the book
[863.7s] of
[865.2s] Nemiah gives us a test of what
[870.6s] God expect of his people today in Arabic
[874.6s] central church. Now in Nehemiah gets a
[877.7s] burden because the house of God is
[880.8s] broken. The walls are lying in ruins.
[884.3s] The gates have been burnt. And somebody
[886.4s] may ask what about wars? What is it that
[889.4s] why bother with wars? I thought I wish
[892.6s] there was the the temple that was
[894.4s] broken. But was now let me speak and
[896.8s] tell us this morning friends that the
[899.6s] walls in the days of Nehemiah was so
[903.9s] important because the walls were a sign
[907.2s] of national
[908.7s] security. People used to build strong
[912.2s] and massive walls as a sign of fortified
[915.4s] cities. When you did not have a wall
[918.8s] around you, you are exposed, you are
[921.4s] useless and
[923.0s] anyone, you are just a useless person.
[925.5s] Now when the church of God was
[928.0s] constructed, God also instructed a
[931.0s] massive wall to be built around the
[933.7s] temple of Jerusalem with serious gates
[936.9s] made of metal. Now when the enemies
[939.2s] came, they came attacked the walls,
[942.3s] broke the walls down. And while they
[944.9s] were telling God and the people that
[947.1s] were worshiping in Jerusalem, your God
[949.8s] is so weak, we can attack him and break
[953.8s] him and smash him and trap him down like
[957.2s] we have done to the wall of the church
[960.3s] and the temple of your God. And it was
[963.4s] reproach and it was disgrace. and
[966.0s] Nehemiah where he is a slave in some
[969.6s] country finds out that the Jerusalem the
[973.0s] temple of God the wall surrounding the
[975.6s] temple has been broken. The Bible tells
[978.4s] me the was troubled in his heart and in
[982.5s] his soul. I want to pause here and ask
[986.3s] you what troubles you about the house of
[991.0s] the Lord.
[993.1s] What troubles
[994.8s] you? Are you ever troubled by how the
[998.5s] house of the Lord looks like? Are you
[1000.7s] ever troubled by what is taking place in
[1003.9s] the house of the Lord? Are you troubled?
[1006.2s] Nehemiah at this particular time has not
[1009.8s] seen the ruins, but he has heard of the
[1013.3s] report of all the walls of the temple
[1016.0s] have been brought down. And now people
[1018.6s] are laughing at the people of God.
[1021.4s] Nemiah said, "What is happening here?"
[1023.1s] Now, let me also let you know there are
[1025.6s] people in Jerusalem. And the people in
[1028.5s] Jerusalem are not bothered. They are
[1032.6s] there. They are witnessing the ruins
[1034.5s] every day, but they're not bothered.
[1036.3s] They go to the same temple. They are not
[1038.6s] bothered. The church of God is lying in
[1041.0s] ruins. They are not bothered. But
[1043.4s] Nehemiah, a man in a slave country, when
[1047.3s] he of the house of God has been exposed
[1050.9s] to ridicule, the heart of Nehemiah was
[1053.7s] troubled. In verse number four, the
[1055.6s] Bible says, "And Nehemiah sat and he was
[1059.0s] troubled and he was praying and fasting
[1062.5s] and pleading with the Lord that God can
[1065.0s] do something to remove away the
[1067.3s] disgrace."
[1069.0s] I'm just asking this morning, what
[1072.2s] troubles your heart? Now, let me take
[1075.5s] you to the book of
[1076.8s] Hagai. The book of Hagi, chapter one
[1080.4s] comes with a similar story. Now, Hagi is
[1084.2s] called again, God speaks to Hagi to go
[1086.8s] and tell the people of Israel to build
[1089.4s] the temple. Now, the temple, of course,
[1092.2s] we know in the Israel that Hagi and
[1095.5s] Nehemiah lived um a period of time of
[1099.5s] about about 700 to 900 years difference
[1103.5s] in terms of you know the time span and
[1106.0s] Hagai was the first one. So the story in
[1108.8s] the book of Hag comes before the story
[1111.0s] in the book of Nemiah. Now in the days
[1113.6s] of Hagai the entire temple was broken
[1118.7s] was destroyed and the king said there
[1122.6s] now God speaks to a guy and tells a guy
[1125.5s] go and tell my people. Now in verse
[1128.4s] number eight of the book of Hag chapter
[1130.6s] 1, the Bible says, "Go up to the
[1133.2s] mountains and bring wood and build the
[1136.2s] temple that I may take pleasure in it
[1139.7s] and
[1141.1s] glorify God." You know the Bible in this
[1143.9s] particular
[1145.5s] passage is speaking to to God's people.
[1149.0s] Now God speaking to Hagi, it shows him
[1151.6s] the way the church is looking like. It
[1154.5s] is a time for the people to go and climb
[1158.8s] the mountain. The way the church looks
[1162.1s] like, the way the temple looks like,
[1165.4s] this one cannot be repaired. This one
[1169.1s] cannot be rebuilt. This one cannot be
[1172.1s] fixed. When people have not gone to the
[1175.2s] mountain, this one demands a going to
[1178.7s] the mountain. This one demands a
[1181.1s] climbing of the mountain. Because the
[1183.8s] things that are needed, the resources
[1185.9s] that are needed to rebuild the temple
[1188.7s] cannot be found in ordinary situations.
[1192.2s] You've got to go to the mountain. That
[1195.0s] is where I have kept all the things that
[1198.8s] are needed to rebuild my temple. Can
[1201.1s] somebody say amen? God tells the guy,
[1203.9s] "Go and tell them to go to the
[1208.6s] mountain." Wait a minute.
[1211.6s] You see
[1213.0s] friends, what we are doing as a church
[1215.7s] in this
[1216.9s] season is not
[1220.4s] ordinary. This is not business as
[1224.4s] usual. These
[1226.4s] people had their wealth, they had their
[1229.5s] money, they had they and their they had
[1231.7s] their estates, they had their plots,
[1233.8s] they had all those things. God told
[1236.2s] them, "I know who you owe. I know the
[1239.2s] things you have, but for this one, I
[1241.8s] want you to move out of your homes, go
[1245.0s] out of your estate, go to the mountains,
[1248.4s] and go climb up there. Bring down the
[1252.2s] timber that is needed for my house. Now,
[1256.1s] I told you last when I spoke here
[1259.2s] briefly, and I am not ashamed, and I'm
[1262.2s] not shying about this one. I am
[1264.4s] challenging you on this one.
[1267.4s] God is not asking you to just give an
[1270.7s] offering that come from your pocket
[1273.0s] alone or only. God want you to go
[1276.6s] identify a mountain, climb that
[1279.4s] mountain, bring the offering to fix the
[1283.3s] mess in the house of God. Do you have a
[1285.8s] witness out there? Can you say amen? God
[1288.2s] want you to go out of your way. Go and
[1290.4s] look for your friends. Go and look for
[1292.2s] the king. Go and look for you know
[1294.0s] Nehemiah went to the king. This is an
[1296.6s] heathen king and the heathen king
[1299.0s] supplied all that was needed for the
[1302.2s] rebuilding of the walls of Jerusalem.
[1304.6s] This one is a climbing of the
[1307.0s] mountain. You see friends in the book of
[1311.5s] Hagi the
[1313.7s] Israelites and lived in captivity in Pia
[1317.0s] for a very long time.
[1321.8s] And when Hagay is speaking here is about
[1324.0s] 18 years after the first dispatchment of
[1327.5s] uh or the release of the captives back
[1331.0s] to
[1333.6s] Jerusalem. So they returned from from
[1337.2s] Babylon and the king of course you know
[1339.9s] the story the king Sarah had allowed
[1342.4s] them to go back and rebuild the temple
[1345.7s] when you check in the Ezra chapter 1
[1347.6s] verse
[1348.4s] 1-4. But however, the sen story is this.
[1352.9s] When they returned, when God released
[1356.2s] them, God going to set them free from
[1357.9s] their captivity and they came back to
[1363.2s] Jerusalem with instruction to go and
[1366.3s] build the temple of
[1368.8s] God. They
[1370.8s] came when we take the book of Ezra
[1372.9s] because the same same story in the book
[1373.9s] of Ezra. They came, they lay the
[1376.9s] foundation, they lay the altar, they
[1379.8s] started constructing, but midway they
[1383.6s] got tired. They abandoned the project of
[1387.3s] God and they went back and began on
[1391.0s] their personal individual family project
[1394.9s] developing themsel growing themsel
[1397.4s] because they have lived in captivity for
[1399.2s] too long. God is unvisible. He wanted to
[1402.6s] spend all our resources in fixing a
[1404.9s] temple where we have nowhere to sleep.
[1407.2s] And they were busy building their homes.
[1409.8s] They continued. They completed their
[1412.1s] homes. Their homes were fortified. They
[1414.2s] were magnificent. They were good. They
[1416.4s] began now enjoying their homes. They
[1418.6s] were there for 16 good years. No one
[1422.9s] bothered themsel with the plight of the
[1425.6s] house of the Lord until God came again.
[1428.3s] He spoke to Hagai and told him, "Hag
[1430.2s] guy, go and ask these people. I see in
[1433.6s] your homes. You have good houses. You
[1436.4s] have built for yourself good houses. You
[1438.4s] enjoying good places. But my house is a
[1441.5s] disgrace. Is lying in freeze. I am
[1444.6s] disgraced. You are better than me. I'm
[1447.9s] your God. I've given you all these
[1449.9s] things, but your place is better than my
[1453.0s] place. What kind of a people are you? As
[1455.8s] you are thankless people, go. If you
[1458.2s] have said you have nothing, climb the
[1459.8s] mountain, bring the timbers. I created
[1462.6s] the timber. Go bring the timber that my
[1465.4s] house may be
[1468.0s] rebuilt. Let me speak to us
[1470.5s] friends. And by the way, I want to be
[1472.7s] very frank with us.
[1475.8s] I have never been troubled as a
[1479.6s] pastor the way I'm troubled in this
[1482.4s] season because I know whenever God makes
[1488.0s] such an
[1489.4s] appeal to the body of faith, two things
[1493.4s] are
[1494.0s] involved. God has prepared to bless the
[1497.8s] church or God has prepared to deal with
[1501.2s] the church.
[1503.0s] These are two things I can tell you for
[1504.5s] sure. Had I've been praying and every
[1506.7s] time I pray before I raise from my
[1509.3s] prayer I hear God tell me pastor
[1512.2s] judgment is
[1514.8s] coming. Today I'm here to speak to
[1519.2s] us to tell
[1521.2s] us God is asking us to climb the
[1526.5s] mountain. I want to have a few photos
[1529.0s] here. I I hope my team up there is able
[1531.8s] to do that. Let's just let's just
[1533.8s] appreciate a few photos
[1537.1s] here. Can tell me friends, how do you
[1540.8s] want pastor to be cool, to be nice, to
[1544.5s] be quiet when the house of God looks
[1547.1s] this way?
[1550.4s] How? At least for
[1552.9s] me, my sister, I know your house. made
[1557.6s] sense. I know your house. It doesn't
[1559.5s] look like this way. That's why I'm so
[1562.4s] much emotional about this message. I've
[1564.7s] been to your homes. Tell me here whose
[1568.2s] house looks like
[1571.5s] this.
[1575.2s] Ooh. Ooh.
[1586.7s] God broke them from
[1589.6s] exile. They first began with God's work.
[1593.4s] Midway they left it and they all went
[1597.0s] back to develop themselves. They were
[1599.8s] busy. They forgot. I see this message
[1603.0s] and exactly that is what is happening in
[1606.1s] Arabic Central Church. We began well.
[1609.5s] Why do we want to end badly, my dear
[1613.5s] friends? We began well. Where did the
[1616.9s] spirit go? Why do we drive our very good
[1620.1s] expensive cars, park them every Sabbath?
[1623.0s] Well, the house of God looks this way
[1625.4s] and we are not
[1629.2s] troubled.
[1631.0s] How are we out of our minds, people?
[1635.0s] We come here, we are so at peace. You're
[1638.6s] never
[1640.5s] troubled. What is
[1644.8s] this? Now, let me preach this sermon is
[1647.4s] my maybe it's my last but I have done
[1650.6s] what God is telling me to tell you
[1653.0s] today. This one, my friends, is
[1656.0s] disgrace. Nemiah came and told them,
[1658.7s] "No, no, no, no, no, no."
[1662.4s] No, no, no, no, no, no. Let us not
[1664.8s] pretend people. This one, this one is
[1667.8s] reproach. This one is disgrace. You
[1670.6s] know, I can't even understand that
[1673.9s] Nehemiah had to come from slavery to
[1677.3s] come and tell people that come on, come
[1679.5s] on, come on, come on. This is disgrace.
[1682.9s] Well, they were coming there every week.
[1685.8s] No one of them was
[1688.2s] bothered.
[1693.3s] Elder
[1696.0s] Mai, you can call Elder's council and
[1698.4s] you vote persona to leave with immediate
[1703.7s] effect. With immediate effect, but but
[1706.4s] allow me to speak what the Lord is
[1708.4s] asking me to
[1709.6s] do. You see, the reason why I'm so
[1712.6s] passionate is what I find in the book of
[1714.3s] Hagai. Now listen to the book of Hagai.
[1718.9s] H in the book of Hag God tells me tells
[1723.4s] them okay fine
[1725.7s] fine
[1727.4s] fine. Mhm. And learn evil to s but let
[1731.9s] me tell you what has been happening.
[1733.0s] This God telling them you see I looked
[1736.4s] at you. I've been appealing to you.
[1739.5s] Anyone who brings this thought you shut
[1741.2s] it down. You go back to your farms. Basi
[1745.1s] you
[1747.0s] plant. Finish for me. You
[1751.2s] plant. You don't want to tell
[1754.0s] me. You
[1755.8s] plant. You bring in little. You spend
[1761.4s] your
[1762.2s] money in tending to your farms but the
[1765.9s] yield the outcome is not commensurate.
[1771.0s] The money that you're holding, the
[1773.3s] finances you have refused to bring to my
[1775.4s] house, you will spend them in your
[1777.8s] useless
[1779.1s] farms. I will make sure you will not
[1782.6s] have a yield that befits your effort
[1785.9s] until when you know I am crying for my
[1790.0s] house. I can tell you for sure. I can
[1793.5s] tell you for sure. Most of you
[1796.9s] here the kind of jobs you're doing
[1800.4s] you're not supposed to be doing
[1802.4s] them. God
[1805.4s] mute. God applied some breaks in your
[1809.6s] progress. You are experiencing
[1811.6s] difficulties at your workplace. The
[1813.8s] environment is becoming toxic. You began
[1816.3s] your business is not growing. You come
[1819.3s] here every Sabbath, every camp meeting,
[1821.8s] have attendance of prayer. Jos is
[1824.2s] writing prayer requests on purpose
[1826.5s] dropping there. I don't know how many
[1828.1s] books you are finished writing prayer
[1829.8s] request for your business for your
[1831.8s] career and nothing seemed to change. God
[1835.0s] says wait a minute wait a minute doesn't
[1838.4s] matter how long you stay in your prayer
[1840.9s] so long as you have turned your ear deaf
[1843.1s] to the plight of my house you will plant
[1846.1s] and you will harvest little.
[1849.5s] This is a hard truth that I have to
[1853.0s] speak to my church with utmost love
[1856.0s] because I know you love God. You want to
[1858.9s] serve him. But on this one, we need to
[1862.3s] be awakened the way Haggai Awoken people
[1865.7s] the way Hermaya awoke those
[1868.1s] people. So God chose a guy go and show
[1870.9s] them to climb the mountain. You see
[1874.2s] friends, I find in the Bible
[1882.3s] Every
[1885.0s] time God has called his people to climb
[1888.4s] the
[1890.3s] mountain, there's something special want
[1892.5s] to
[1893.5s] do. God causes people to climb the
[1896.1s] mountain of sacrifice in order to build
[1899.3s] something greater than themselves. A
[1902.3s] place where his presence can dwell,
[1904.5s] where his glory can be revealed, and
[1906.6s] where his name can be glorified. Today
[1909.0s] we are standing at a moment in time when
[1911.8s] God is calling us to climb the mountain
[1914.6s] together, not physically physical
[1916.8s] mountain, but spiritually and mentally
[1919.4s] and socially and financially in order to
[1923.4s] bring a beating image of God in his
[1928.5s] temple. Now on is it on Thursday or
[1932.2s] Thursday that day I spoke here and I
[1935.8s] said God is an expensive
[1942.8s] God. Eric
[1945.5s] God God knows how to enjoy life my
[1949.2s] friend God God does not dwell on cheap
[1952.0s] things. No no no no no no no. Look at
[1954.3s] God even at creation all that he
[1957.2s] created. The Bible tells me the
[1959.0s] testimony is everything was
[1963.2s] perfect. When God
[1967.2s] wanted the children of Israel to
[1969.5s] construct a place of worship in the
[1971.1s] wilderness, the tent just the tent, go
[1974.3s] and look at the description of the tent
[1977.0s] in the
[1979.7s] wilderness. You you go to go to Ruaka
[1982.5s] fountain of hope and see where people
[1984.5s] worshiping and look at the tent that God
[1986.8s] instructed in that particular time and
[1989.4s] that that was temple before they come to
[1991.5s] Canaan. Now when God instructed the
[1994.2s] temple to be built, go and check the
[1997.5s] instructions, the choice of
[2000.3s] material, find things, expensive things.
[2004.6s] God is not
[2006.7s] cheap. Don't portray a cheap
[2010.2s] God. If your God is cheap, my God is not
[2015.0s] cheap. God is expensive. Now if you
[2018.3s] don't know what I'm telling you, I was
[2020.0s] checking the Bible and the Bible tells
[2022.8s] me when we go to heaven even pastor who
[2027.9s] has never seen a
[2030.8s] gold most of you have seen gold I've
[2034.2s] never seen not even touching I've never
[2035.8s] seen oh oh no I've seen it in the
[2039.1s] pictures but the Bible tells me when we
[2042.6s] go to heaven our walk pathways is the
[2047.8s] street in heaven. The street the streets
[2052.3s] not the main thing. The street are made
[2056.4s] of
[2059.3s] gold. Question. If the streets are made
[2062.3s] of gold, what about the bedroom of God?
[2066.4s] You know, we just think like human
[2067.6s] beings.
[2069.3s] Sister, if if the streets if the streets
[2072.7s] of heaven are made of gold, is God
[2076.7s] extravagant?
[2081.5s] Yes, God is
[2083.6s] extravagant
[2085.2s] because he
[2087.5s] owns
[2090.4s] everything. And God lives in this place
[2094.1s] that he owns everything. So when he
[2096.5s] invites
[2097.6s] you to come back with what he has given
[2101.2s] you and give him an
[2104.5s] image befitting him, God is not making
[2110.2s] unreasonable appeal. That is why he says
[2113.2s] you planned and you do what a little.
[2120.3s] Now somebody may look at the church and
[2122.4s] say ah
[2127.6s] pastor look at
[2129.7s] that all members please look at
[2134.0s] that. Now when you see those spots that
[2137.4s] is not
[2139.3s] paint. No no no no this is not designed
[2142.0s] the roof design the ceiling. No no no no
[2143.6s] no no no. You know you may think that is
[2145.5s] what it was designed. No this is not
[2146.6s] designed.
[2148.6s] This is the wasting of the temple of
[2152.0s] God and we
[2154.0s] come we sit
[2156.9s] comfortably and you know because we did
[2160.1s] this front part you know this front part
[2161.7s] deceives people now you know online
[2163.2s] people when you see this front part you
[2164.6s] think ah the church is ah the church
[2170.0s] hey and don't even come to
[2173.6s] see and we are saying people of God
[2177.4s] people of God, we can do better things.
[2181.0s] God want you to climb the mountain. And
[2183.4s] and a time God calls people to climb the
[2185.5s] mountain is because he want them to
[2187.5s] sacrifice
[2189.1s] something. He called Abraham. So
[2191.9s] Abraham, climb the mountain with your
[2195.5s] son. He wanted to reveal to Abraham the
[2199.8s] extent of his confidence in Abraham. He
[2203.6s] knew Abraham loves him. But Abraham
[2206.1s] never knew that God had such a deep
[2208.5s] trust in Abraham. And God was testing
[2211.3s] Abraham as to whether he knows how much
[2213.5s] God loves him to go and sacrifice your
[2215.6s] son. God had a plan not to kill Isaac
[2218.6s] but to sacrifice the lamb. And so
[2220.7s] Abraham ascends to the mountain. He
[2223.3s] climbed the mountain to sacrifice a son.
[2226.4s] But the Bible tells me he did not lose a
[2229.8s] son because God provided. Hallelujah.
[2232.4s] Somebody those who will climb this
[2236.0s] mountain are not going to lose a
[2238.2s] livelihood. Those who are going to climb
[2240.2s] this mountain shall not going to lose a
[2242.6s] livelihood. Let me speak to my church
[2245.1s] and tell you on this day this mountain
[2248.8s] this mountain this mountain is a testing
[2252.7s] moment for the
[2259.6s] church. When God wanted to test Moses,
[2262.9s] he beat him climb the mountain in Sinai.
[2265.6s] Moses failed the test. He came down,
[2270.3s] broke the tablets. Thank
[2273.8s] God gave him, you know, you
[2277.8s] know, the first person to retake an exam
[2280.7s] was
[2282.5s] Moses. You guys are not with me. You're
[2284.6s] not with me. The first person to retake
[2287.0s] exam. So if there's any student
[2288.9s] listening to me and you failed in my
[2290.4s] grace and you have to retain don't you
[2292.2s] be worried God is starting that one
[2295.4s] Moses failed the test and God and to
[2298.1s] give him another paper to do thank God
[2301.5s] the second paper Moses passed can
[2303.8s] somebody say amen we have to climb the
[2306.3s] mountain and climbing the mountain is a
[2308.7s] test of our faith Jesus was be on the
[2312.6s] mountain to climb the mountain to go and
[2315.0s] be touched I praise God Because Jesus
[2318.6s] never wasted chance. Jesus passed the
[2322.1s] exam and he saved the world. Whenever
[2325.6s] God calls you to climb the mountain is a
[2328.3s] testing
[2330.4s] time. This one. This one. This one is a
[2336.1s] test elder pew. This one my church board
[2339.8s] members. This one. My church members.
[2342.4s] This one. This one is not an ordinary
[2346.0s] thing. This one is a test. The question
[2348.9s] I ask you today, will you pass the test
[2352.5s] or fail the
[2358.9s] test? Look at the person next to you.
[2362.1s] Just just look look at him or at her
[2364.6s] with mercy and sympathy. With kindness.
[2366.8s] Don't rebuke them. Don't rebuke them.
[2368.1s] Don't just look them with mercy. With
[2369.9s] kindness. Ask them, "My sister, my
[2371.8s] brother, will you pass the exam?"
[2375.5s] I don't know why you look at me. Look at
[2376.8s] your friend. Look at your friend. Look
[2378.3s] at your friend. Simple instructions.
[2380.2s] Simple
[2381.9s] instructions. Those are seated alone
[2383.8s] now. Those see the internet. Those
[2385.4s] internet. Those internet. Just type
[2386.5s] there. Just type there. Just type there.
[2388.3s] Will you pass this exam? This
[2392.2s] exam. By the
[2394.3s] way, there's no simple exam. Exam is an
[2397.3s] exam. A test is a test. Even right now,
[2400.2s] even those we have so many professors
[2402.0s] here. If I called you, if I just called,
[2405.1s] I told you my good elders and good
[2407.2s] people here, can you meet in my office?
[2408.7s] I have a small test for
[2411.7s] you. You will see some of you start
[2414.1s] getting nervous. What test? What is
[2415.9s] possible to test? There's no simple
[2418.8s] test. But this one is not meant to prove
[2423.0s] you wrong. This one is meant to prove
[2426.2s] God might in your life. God is testing
[2429.5s] to see how much you trust in him. This
[2432.6s] one is a test and I pray that we all may
[2437.5s] pass with flying colors. Can I hear amen
[2440.8s] out
[2441.7s] here? What are we afraid of? Now, let me
[2445.0s] show you something here. The PA people I
[2447.8s] see about 16. the PE people give me give
[2449.7s] me
[2451.3s] no I I you you forgive me for this but I
[2455.3s] and to think deeply about this thing and
[2457.1s] I said come on am I asking the church to
[2460.2s] do what is impossible am I unreasonable
[2462.7s] as a pastor I said
[2466.0s] okay
[2467.6s] so let's let me have it so I I went into
[2471.1s] a
[2472.0s] giving I went into a giving no no this
[2475.2s] one's not enough of this one give me the
[2477.0s] one I sent you
[2479.5s] So I I call it Narabi Central Church
[2482.9s] members estimated net
[2488.1s] worth dear friend where wait the thing
[2491.1s] is coming this is
[2492.7s] coming are we asking you to do what
[2495.0s] you're not now look at this look at this
[2496.3s] look at this look at this look at this
[2498.4s] now there's a simple analysis I did from
[2500.4s] our giving you see every month every
[2504.2s] month we you limit 10% of your earnings
[2507.6s] True or false? Ah, are you with me?
[2510.5s] Every month you remit to the church
[2512.9s] treasury 10% of your earning. True or
[2517.2s] false? So what we have as a church is a
[2521.5s] 10% of your honeying. What is
[2530.6s] 100%. Mhm.
[2535.0s] Now if I got into a private space,
[2536.6s] forgive
[2537.9s] me. But
[2541.4s] now in an
[2544.2s] average I took an estimated figure of 13
[2547.0s] million at times goes to 15 at times can
[2549.1s] come down
[2550.4s] to 10 when we have a very bad day of bad
[2554.0s] month but we never goes down there. Then
[2557.7s] I also looked at the percentage of
[2560.2s] givers. Now what will shock you is that
[2565.3s] very small percentage of the membership
[2568.7s] of Nabi Central Church that are actually
[2571.3s] giving. We are people here.
[2576.3s] Mhm. People here who come every Sabbath
[2579.8s] consume worship you go home.
[2587.4s] Which hotel will you go eat at home
[2589.7s] without
[2591.4s] pay? Where are you getting free services
[2594.2s] in this country? Now God said in my
[2597.3s] design, no free services. Come to me not
[2600.8s] emptyhanded. It's a simple logic. Don't
[2603.5s] come to me empty-handed. God is saying
[2607.0s] you've got to
[2608.4s] pay. Well, I'm using business language
[2612.8s] to explain a point. Are you with me?
[2615.6s] Mhm. So cautiously when you come from
[2618.9s] January to December, we are giving ti
[2622.1s] and offering, you don't give. We ask you
[2624.3s] for money for the crusade, you don't
[2625.9s] give. We asking money for committing,
[2627.8s] you don't give.
[2630.9s] Uhhuh. Are you
[2633.6s] okay? Are you okay? So why the church
[2637.3s] running? So I was shocked to know that
[2640.6s] the figures have here is about 20% of
[2642.6s] the church membership that is giving.
[2644.6s] Can you imagine? That is
[2647.6s] alarming. So ask that friend next to
[2649.8s] you, are you part of the
[2654.3s] [Laughter]
[2659.7s] 80%. I I know I know I I know we not
[2662.7s] used to these kind of messages, but
[2663.8s] allow me today to have it plain black
[2667.4s] and
[2670.4s] white after this.
[2675.7s] Well, are you part of the
[2677.4s] 80%.
[2678.9s] Now I said okay fine. So if
[2683.4s] 10% How much is 10% per
[2686.5s] month? How
[2690.7s] much? So
[2693.6s] 100% by just that simple estimate we are
[2697.0s] looking at 130 million flowing in our
[2700.3s] pockets here.
[2702.3s] here every month. Every month and that
[2705.6s] is of 20% of the members not not even
[2708.6s] 50% 20% of
[2711.1s] us are swimming in swimming swimming
[2714.5s] swimming siming in 130 million per month
[2719.7s] and the church is struggling.
[2735.1s] I could go ahead and hide myself in some
[2736.6s] bushes that you would get me. And I
[2738.8s] said, "Wait a minute." And then I said,
[2740.2s] "Okay, if this is one month, how much is
[2742.9s] one year?" And he was shocked to see how
[2745.9s] rich we are as a church.
[2750.6s] 1.5 billion Kenyan shillings flows in
[2756.2s] the homes of the members of Nairobi
[2758.9s] central church at 20% of the
[2767.6s] membership and then you here tell me
[2769.7s] pastor go to so and so go to
[2773.6s] honorable we
[2776.4s] bewitched and who bewitched
[2781.7s] Now let me bring it close. I'm just
[2784.7s] addressing is it possible to climb this
[2787.1s] mountain? Now as I was doing my
[2791.6s] research, I was told just one
[2795.2s] man just one
[2797.5s] man donated all the pews this very
[2800.9s] expensive timber you see here. And the
[2804.0s] other day I was doubting an elder came
[2805.5s] here and confirmed to me said pastor yes
[2807.6s] I was there when he stood in the old
[2810.0s] sanctuary and committed him. So before
[2812.7s] pastor said pastor I am going to donate
[2816.2s] all the pews for the church. One
[2820.3s] man I think can come from
[2823.8s] us. He was not a
[2826.8s] Kenyan. Was he a Kenyan Ruth? You you
[2829.0s] don't know you are not here. Ment you
[2831.6s] did your wedding in old sanctuary.
[2833.3s] Unfort you are my friend so I have to
[2834.8s] keep using
[2837.2s] you. I hope you were there that day. You
[2840.6s] were there. Is he a
[2843.6s] Kenyan? Did he
[2846.0s] die? Have you seen his family
[2849.5s] begging? You tell me.
[2863.2s] I'm just think loudly. I'm just think
[2864.8s] loudly now.
[2867.7s] Now you see look at this church. We all
[2871.3s] very proud of this church.
[2873.3s] True. And some of you are getting
[2875.3s] injuries because like I'm portraying you
[2877.1s] in a negative.
[2881.4s] No will be good.
[2883.6s] No, I'm told it's a logic. It's a simple
[2886.9s] logic. When the church was being built,
[2889.9s] the builders, the church members were
[2892.6s] members worshiping in the old Sanfield.
[2894.5s] True or false? So what is the capacity
[2897.1s] of the own
[2901.7s] sanctuary? What was the capacity then?
[2904.6s] How many members put up all
[2908.2s] these? Which year?
[2912.2s] It's about 27 years ago. Look at the
[2913.9s] economy of the days at the numbers of
[2915.8s] the members who sacrifice all this. You
[2918.2s] see, look at us today in our numbers.
[2922.3s] Our book shows me we are 9,000 plus
[2926.3s] members. Do you tell me pastor? Of
[2928.3s] course, you know that is is is blocked
[2930.7s] and with names you cannot tell where
[2932.2s] they are and granted. So, how many are
[2934.8s] we? Are we
[2938.4s] 200? Are we 300?
[2942.6s] How many are we? So if a handful of
[2945.4s] people worshiping in that small temple
[2948.0s] were able to do all this, what about the
[2951.9s] massive numbers we have today in this
[2958.4s] church? He says you planned
[2973.0s] Now the Bible tells me God spoke to them
[2976.3s] so passionately and he told them go and
[2978.6s] bring the timber. I am speaking to my
[2980.8s] church and I'm telling you the time has
[2982.8s] come. Let us go to the mountain. Let us
[2985.4s] go to the mountain. Go and bring the
[2987.7s] timber. Go and bring materials. Go bring
[2990.6s] resources. God will not forgive us. God
[2994.4s] will not sit well when he's watching us
[2998.7s] doing the things we're doing. Some of us
[3000.6s] at a personal level we are running a
[3002.7s] project worth hundreds of millions but
[3005.4s] when we ask you to come and give even
[3008.4s] 100 it's a
[3012.2s] problem honestly must I preach all
[3016.4s] this you don't
[3022.0s] see and some of us start
[3025.5s] talking too I'm a
[3029.2s] cupa. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. My
[3033.5s] good, by the way, church, I love you
[3036.0s] from the deepest. There's no church I've
[3038.2s] ever served with all my mind, my life,
[3040.7s] my everything like Central Church. You
[3043.2s] wait that day when God comes. He'll show
[3045.3s] you how my heart was committed to the
[3047.3s] church. I've got to tell you the
[3050.3s] truth. Let's remove this disgrace.
[3056.2s] Can I tell you something? Can I tell you
[3059.0s] something? Just one of you here, one of
[3062.3s] you here can decide to do all that you
[3065.5s] want to do for the church.
[3076.4s] One, oh, so pastor, you have been coming
[3078.6s] to our houses to see how much you have
[3080.7s] blessed. I'm just, you know. Oh, no, no,
[3083.8s] no, no, no, no, no, no,
[3086.1s] no. There are times when we've got to
[3088.9s] get serious.
[3093.8s] People car
[3096.8s] us building the temple. Let's stand.
[3100.1s] Let's stand. Let's stand. Let's stand.
[3101.9s] Coras, let's sing that
[3108.1s] song.
[3116.0s] [Music]
[3121.8s] foreign speech.
