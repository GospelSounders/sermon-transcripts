FULL TRANSCRIPT:
good morning good evening good day happy Sabbath good afternoon from wherever you're joining us from uh my name is bism lumumba welcome to the Teens book club today we're going to be studying the book When God Says remember uh but before we do let's say a prayer dear father in Heaven oh Lord God we come before you at this time father we'd like to thank you so much for another opportunity to discuss oh Father be with us now in Jesus name I pray amen amen amen and amen ladies and gentlemen today we'll be discussing chapter 8 exposing the devil's deceptive delusions but before I start I just wanted to introduce my co-host sair sair say hi hello my name is sair tine and I'm so excited to dive into this chapter amen amen kibana um so I'll just proceed by giving you a little bit of an introduction into the chapter uh so the chapter is called exposing the devil's deceptive delusions and it starts by giving us an expose on the greatest magicians in the world you know the greatest magicians in the world uh practice their magic through deception right uh you see them going through one screen they come out through the other and they lie to you that they have disappeared you know or one of the best is that you know they stick a sword into somebody else but really the sword goes into a tube and turns around the body of the other person and unfortunately does not well it doesn't kill them not not unfortunate fortunate it doesn't kill them uh but you're deceived and you think that oh he has passed a sword through his associate or through his assistant right but ladies and gentlemen some of the greatest deception in this world are religious right and they have been made by the Devil Himself some of the greatest deceptions in this world are religious right and in the book uh uh Mark Finley unmas a number of these religions right rather a number of these deceptions right and so he begins particularly by pointing us to the Book of Revelation and in the Book of Revelation he points us to the the the woman in white and the woman in Scarlet right the woman in white and the woman in scarlet and he tells us about and he goes on to describe these women uh about the woman in white who keeps the law of God and this is from Revelation 12:1 17 who's clothed with the sun right and who on the moon right and then he goes on to describe the other woman the woman in Scarlet who ideally you know is a is is a woman who is adorned in scarlet and Purple colors you know is the mother of Harlot yeah and has left her true lover Jesus Christ so the first woman is the true church H but the other woman is the false church and the the woman who is dressed in Scarlet in Scarlet has a name written right on her forehead mystery Babylon the great all right and from there after he introduces mystery B Babylon the great he gives us the characteristics the characteristics of spiritual Babylon spiritual Babylon and the chapter goes on to describe what a spiritual Babylon what these characteristics of spiritual Babylon are and how they are prevalent within our society today and that's what uh we shall continue to do uh throughout this expose all right so I I have one first question one of the one of the one of the the characteristics of human Babylon uh or of spiritual Babylon rather is uh that of uh is that of image worship now image worship that is really prevalent in our society so S I don't know uh perhaps maybe you could comment on this uh do you see any uh uh uh any any manifestation of image Worship in our society today first of all thank you so much for the amazing summary i' would like to point that it's quite interesting to find that these magicians I mean their Works evoke a sense of humor and entertainment but when deceptions are introduced in a religious form by the most ultimate Illusionist and deceiver Satan it's not something to joke about and we as Christians need to identify this readily before we are steeped in sin and fully duped okay to answer your question on how Babylon is explained as a system of image centered worship and how does it look like today I would say that I stem the following statement based on Romans chap 1: 25 before I would love to read it um in a moment here and so Romans chapter 1 verse 25 says they exchanged the truth about God for a lie and worshiped and served created things rather than the Creator who is forever praised amen and so Paul is writing to the Romans and is showing how God's Wrath will be against sinful Humanity noticed that they're exchanging the truth about God for a lie and this is our idea of White Lies but the devil is very very good at this and so we see this trend in how religious people pastors clerks deacons all these people are actually twisted God's word but we must be very aware of this and so to tie into modern society I believe that modern society bows down to the idols of wealth and fame and they're sort of repeating babylon's Legacy of idolatry worshiping the image over the Creator we also see in Colossians chapter 3: 5 would you please read that for us yes I have that here Colossians CH 3 and verse 5 uh just give me a moment sorry all right and this is particularly looking at the outcome of not obeying God's law and so it's it's showing us to it's showing us a means to rid ourselves of these immoral parts of our nature yeah and that's exactly what it says Colossians 3:5 it says put to death your members which are on the earth fornication and cleanness passion evil desire and covetousness which is idolatry and the next verse please verse 6 it says because these things because of these things the wrath of God is coming upon the sons of Disobedience absolutely this is the Wrath full fold and so God will eventually deal with them appropriately and that is equally a hope for those we see who are consistently doing wicked things and not receiving their punishment here in this temporary State God's Wrath will be revealed mhm so worship has evolved I think we can't deny that but it's essential to know that the essence of idolatry has remained the same remained unchanged we see that there's also Idols of self to worship oneself is equally idolatry right and so that is included that's the devil's way in an attempt to change our true de Devotion to God I think that's important amen amen amen and that's very right um the book also goes on to elaborate other forms of Babylonian systems that have come with us here for example that the spiritual Babylonian system is a system that was human Le all right and you see even in Babylon when nebuchad stands at at at the portical there in Babylon and he looks out and he says isn't this Babylon that I have created and similarly here in our world we have human systems right human religious systems uh uh religious or organizations religious systems that look to men as their founder as their leader rather than God you know we also have uh in the book he also elaborates ancestor worship right in Babylon we all know about the great God tamuz and how tamuz was looked at as a as as a provider and whenever there was a drought then people would say that tamuz has died but similarly in our day and age we have veneration of the Dead you know you find that people are venerating people who have died before right and and calling into action but uh sa I just wanted to ask you now uh just to elaborate on one other uh uh characteristic of of of Fallen Babylon which is the worship of the sun you know the sun worship and particularly in this uh context you look at uh the the the the the the making holy of Sunday you know and and and that veneration perhaps maybe you could even take us to the history through the Roman history and even Babylon and then talk to us about how we see it today in modern society yes so like this Center of sun worship I think it's worth noting because Mark Finley identified that this is somewhat the root of worship on Sunday and so we see back to the Roman Empire and the wake of Constantine who has now received some sort of vision and that has he's decided to become Christian and so we're moving from a stage of persecution where the Christians are hiding in the catacombs they are being heavily persecuted and now there's this contention because Christians are the government and so Constantine has to make political decisions if we are to state that this is a Christian government that means we have to rid all the paganistic systems but that develops this compromise right this intertwining of paganism and Christianity which is somewhat detrimental for um what we now see today because now the introduction of Sunday worship was because of this sun worship but Mark Finley includes includes us to say that why are we so dependent on the history of humanity why are we so dependent on man's word as opposed to God's word does man really have the power to shift and change God's law no because God's law is a law with no amendments amen and so in light of the history despite this let us not be swayed by the majority rule that indeed Sunday is the day of worship but in fact understand that the law declares that Sabbath worship must be observed according to what God instructs us to do amen amen amen uh those are very insightful topics now in the final uh part of the chapter Mark Finley goes on to have an indictment I would call it on the Protestant churches that have refused to obey the Bible Sabbath you know and he even quotes uh numerous authors there that you know really call them out for for for for what is seen uh as as as a derogation of the Protestant movement you know um in the book I'll just quote he quotes uh Cardinal Gibbons who is a Catholic author and he says you know the reason and sense demand the acceptance of one or the other you can only have one or the other either Sabbath either the biblical Sabbath or uh uh Sunday all right and he indicts protestantism and he says you know either protestantism uh and the keeping of the Holy Saturday or Catholicism and the keeping of holy Sunday you know compromise is impossible compromise is impossible um and so uh towards the end of the Bible he actually makes or rather towards the end of the book he actually makes a call to say that you know you can only have one and you cannot pay attention to the deceptive delusions that are there you either have to make a choice which one are you going to keep all right and so I think also the guidance of or rather the glasses to fully see through the blur of the world is gained through Reading God reading about God and so I think it in the previous chapters it talks about how a knowledge of God opens the doors to heaven the path to Heaven is the world that we're living in right now where things are quite confusing but once we understand who God is and what his plan is for us and the importance of the law which is quite clear if we adopt it wholeheartedly then I think things are Clarity is provided but also compromised again is impossible amen amen so I just want to encourage you as we conclude to buy a copy of the book When God Says Remember When God Says remember if you don't want to take our word for it uh of what is in here buy it for yourself and read it and have a look and and and and and make your own conclusions uh with the light that is shining therein having said that I'd like to call SOA please maybe pray for us as we conclude thank you let us pray dear heavenly father God thank you for this wonderful chapter that teaches teaches us most importantly to observe the sabbath day for the Sabbath day is crucial for our rest and the renewal of a relationship with you as we continue to delve in this book in your servants words from when God said remember let us look back to the biblical truth let us ground ourselves in a law with no amendments let us not search for compromise in the for the sake of the majority rule or for convenience but rather seek to abide in your truth day in and day out we trust and believe in your name amen amen amen and amen see you and goodbye

TIMESTAMPED TRANSCRIPT:
[0.6s] good morning good evening good day happy
[3.4s] Sabbath good afternoon from wherever
[5.4s] you're joining us from uh my name is
[7.7s] bism lumumba welcome to the Teens book
[10.7s] club today we're going to be studying
[12.1s] the book When God Says
[14.8s] remember uh but before we do let's say a
[17.8s] prayer dear father in Heaven oh Lord God
[20.2s] we come before you at this time father
[22.1s] we'd like to thank you so much for
[23.3s] another opportunity to discuss oh Father
[26.8s] be with us now in Jesus name I pray amen
[29.7s] amen amen and amen ladies and gentlemen
[32.0s] today we'll be discussing chapter 8
[34.2s] exposing the devil's deceptive delusions
[37.9s] but before I start I just wanted to
[39.4s] introduce my co-host sair sair say hi
[42.5s] hello my name is sair tine and I'm so
[45.2s] excited to dive into this chapter amen
[48.0s] amen kibana um so I'll just proceed by
[51.1s] giving you a little bit of an
[52.5s] introduction into the chapter uh so the
[55.2s] chapter is called exposing the devil's
[58.3s] deceptive delusions and it starts by
[61.3s] giving us an expose on the greatest
[63.8s] magicians in the world you know the
[65.6s] greatest magicians in the world uh
[67.8s] practice their magic through deception
[70.6s] right uh you see them going through one
[72.8s] screen they come out through the other
[74.3s] and they lie to you that they have
[75.4s] disappeared you know or one of the best
[78.5s] is that you know they stick a sword into
[80.4s] somebody else but really the sword goes
[82.0s] into a tube and turns around the body of
[84.2s] the other person and unfortunately does
[87.2s] not well it doesn't kill them not not
[89.0s] unfortunate fortunate
[90.4s] it doesn't kill them uh but you're
[92.7s] deceived and you think that oh he has
[95.1s] passed a sword through his associate or
[97.8s] through his assistant right but ladies
[99.8s] and gentlemen some of the greatest
[101.3s] deception in this world are religious
[104.1s] right and they have been made by the
[107.4s] Devil Himself some of the greatest
[109.6s] deceptions in this world are religious
[112.9s] right and in the book uh uh Mark Finley
[116.7s] unmas a number of these religions right
[120.3s] rather a number of these deceptions
[123.2s] right and so he begins particularly by
[126.0s] pointing us to the Book of Revelation
[128.0s] and in the Book of Revelation he points
[129.7s] us to the the the woman in white and the
[132.2s] woman in Scarlet right the woman in
[134.9s] white and the woman in scarlet and he
[137.0s] tells us about and he goes on to
[139.3s] describe these women uh about the woman
[141.6s] in white who keeps the law of God and
[144.4s] this is from Revelation 12:1 17 who's
[147.4s] clothed with the sun right and who on
[150.3s] the moon right and then he goes on to
[152.7s] describe the other woman the woman in
[156.6s] Scarlet
[158.2s] who ideally you know is a is is a woman
[163.5s] who is adorned in scarlet and Purple
[165.7s] colors you know is the mother of Harlot
[169.1s] yeah and has left her true lover Jesus
[171.9s] Christ so the first woman is the true
[174.4s] church H but the other woman is the
[178.0s] false church and the the woman who is
[181.0s] dressed in Scarlet in Scarlet has a name
[185.9s] written right on her forehead mystery
[189.1s] Babylon the great all right and from
[192.4s] there after he introduces mystery B
[195.0s] Babylon the great he gives us the
[197.7s] characteristics the characteristics of
[200.1s] spiritual Babylon spiritual Babylon and
[203.9s] the chapter goes on to describe what a
[207.0s] spiritual Babylon what these
[208.9s] characteristics of spiritual Babylon are
[211.8s] and how they are prevalent within our
[214.3s] society today and that's what uh we
[217.8s] shall continue to do uh throughout this
[221.0s] expose all right so I I have one first
[224.0s] question one of the one of the one of
[226.8s] the the characteristics of human Babylon
[229.8s] uh or of spiritual Babylon rather is uh
[233.3s] that of
[235.0s] uh is that of image worship now image
[239.8s] worship that is really prevalent in our
[241.8s] society so S I don't know uh perhaps
[244.1s] maybe you could comment on this uh do
[246.3s] you see any uh uh uh any any
[252.5s] manifestation of image Worship in our
[254.9s] society today first of all thank you so
[257.7s] much for the amazing summary i' would
[260.1s] like to point that it's quite
[261.6s] interesting to find that these
[264.0s] magicians I mean their Works evoke a
[266.6s] sense of humor and entertainment but
[269.8s] when deceptions are introduced in a
[272.1s] religious form by the most ultimate
[275.1s] Illusionist and deceiver Satan it's not
[278.3s] something to joke about and we as
[280.2s] Christians need to identify this readily
[283.8s] before we are steeped in sin and fully
[287.0s] duped okay to answer your question on
[290.7s] how Babylon is explained as a system of
[294.3s] image centered worship and how does it
[296.3s] look like today I would say that
[301.9s] I stem the following statement based on
[305.2s] Romans chap 1:
[307.2s] 25 before I would love to read it
[311.8s] um in a moment here and so Romans
[315.3s] chapter 1 verse 25
[319.8s] says they exchanged the truth about God
[323.7s] for a lie and worshiped and served
[326.4s] created things rather than the Creator
[329.7s] who is forever praised
[332.1s] amen and so Paul is writing to the
[335.5s] Romans and is showing how God's Wrath
[338.2s] will be against sinful Humanity noticed
[341.8s] that they're exchanging the truth about
[343.6s] God for a lie and this is our idea of
[346.8s] White Lies but the devil is very very
[349.7s] good at this and so we see this trend in
[352.6s] how religious people pastors clerks
[356.9s] deacons all these people are actually
[359.2s] twisted God's word but we must be very
[362.2s] aware of this and so to tie into modern
[365.2s] society I believe that modern society
[368.1s] bows down to the idols of wealth and
[372.4s] fame and they're sort of repeating
[374.9s] babylon's Legacy of idolatry worshiping
[378.9s] the image over the Creator we also see
[382.6s] in Colossians chapter 3: 5 would you
[386.0s] please read that for us yes I have that
[388.1s] here Colossians CH 3 and verse 5 uh just
[391.7s] give me a moment
[393.1s] sorry all right and this is particularly
[396.6s] looking at the outcome
[399.8s] of not obeying God's law and so it's
[403.3s] it's showing us to it's showing us a
[405.8s] means to rid ourselves of these
[409.3s] immoral parts of our nature yeah and
[412.7s] that's exactly what it says Colossians
[414.4s] 3:5 it says put to death your members
[417.0s] which are on the earth fornication and
[419.6s] cleanness passion evil desire and
[421.6s] covetousness which is idolatry and the
[424.1s] next verse please verse 6 it says
[425.9s] because these things because of these
[427.8s] things the wrath of God is coming upon
[429.7s] the sons of Disobedience absolutely this
[432.6s] is the Wrath full fold and so God will
[436.1s] eventually deal with them appropriately
[439.0s] and that is equally a hope for those we
[441.1s] see who are consistently doing wicked
[443.2s] things and not receiving their
[444.9s] punishment here in this temporary State
[447.8s] God's Wrath will be revealed mhm so
[450.4s] worship has evolved I think we can't
[452.7s] deny that but it's essential to know
[454.9s] that the essence of idolatry has
[458.7s] remained the same remained unchanged we
[461.1s] see that there's also Idols of self to
[464.1s] worship oneself is
[466.6s] equally idolatry right and so that is
[470.4s] included that's the devil's way in an
[472.9s] attempt to change our true de Devotion
[476.7s] to God I think that's important amen
[478.8s] amen amen and that's very right um the
[481.7s] book also goes on to elaborate other
[483.5s] forms of Babylonian systems that have
[485.8s] come with us here for example that the
[488.6s] spiritual Babylonian system is a system
[490.9s] that was human Le all right and you see
[494.0s] even in Babylon when nebuchad stands at
[496.8s] at at the portical there in Babylon and
[498.7s] he looks out and he says isn't this
[500.1s] Babylon that I have created and
[502.0s] similarly here in our world we have
[504.8s] human systems right human religious
[507.3s] systems uh uh religious or organizations
[510.3s] religious systems that look to men as
[512.8s] their founder as their leader rather
[514.9s] than God you know we also have uh in the
[517.8s] book he also elaborates ancestor worship
[520.2s] right in Babylon we all know about the
[522.3s] great God tamuz and how tamuz was looked
[526.2s] at as a as as a provider and whenever
[529.3s] there was a drought then people would
[530.9s] say that tamuz has died but similarly in
[533.8s] our day and age we have veneration of
[537.3s] the Dead you know you find that people
[539.3s] are venerating people who have died
[540.9s] before right and and calling into action
[544.2s] but uh sa I just wanted to ask you now
[547.2s] uh just to elaborate on one other uh uh
[551.0s] characteristic of of of Fallen Babylon
[553.6s] which is the worship of the sun you know
[556.9s] the sun worship and particularly in this
[559.8s] uh context you look at uh the the the
[562.1s] the the the making holy of Sunday you
[565.6s] know and and and that veneration perhaps
[567.8s] maybe you could even take us to the
[569.0s] history through the Roman history and
[571.3s] even Babylon and then talk to us about
[573.6s] how we see it today in modern society
[576.3s] yes so like this Center of sun worship I
[578.4s] think it's worth noting because Mark
[580.1s] Finley identified that this is somewhat
[582.8s] the root of worship on Sunday and so we
[586.7s] see back to the Roman Empire and the
[589.6s] wake of Constantine who has now received
[593.2s] some sort of vision and that has he's
[595.5s] decided to become Christian and so we're
[598.3s] moving from a stage of persecution where
[601.2s] the Christians are hiding in the
[602.8s] catacombs they are being heavily
[605.2s] persecuted and now there's this
[607.5s] contention because Christians are the
[610.1s] government and so Constantine has to
[612.6s] make political decisions if we are to
[615.6s] state that this is a Christian
[617.6s] government that means we have to rid all
[621.0s] the paganistic systems but that develops
[624.2s] this compromise right this intertwining
[627.0s] of paganism and Christianity which is
[630.0s] somewhat detrimental for um what we now
[633.6s] see today because now the introduction
[636.4s] of Sunday worship was because of this
[639.1s] sun worship but Mark Finley includes
[642.8s] includes us to say that why are we so
[645.5s] dependent on the history of humanity why
[649.5s] are we so dependent on man's word as
[653.0s] opposed to God's word does man really
[655.4s] have the power to shift and change God's
[657.9s] law no because God's law is a law with
[661.3s] no amendments amen and so in light of
[664.2s] the history despite this let us not be
[667.4s] swayed by the majority rule that indeed
[671.5s] Sunday is the day of worship but in
[674.5s] fact understand that the law declares
[677.6s] that Sabbath worship must be observed
[680.1s] according to what God instructs us to do
[682.6s] amen amen amen uh those are very
[685.9s] insightful topics now in the final uh
[688.6s] part of the chapter Mark Finley goes on
[690.8s] to have an indictment I would call it on
[693.7s] the Protestant churches that have
[695.2s] refused to obey the Bible Sabbath you
[697.9s] know and he even quotes uh numerous
[700.0s] authors there that you know really call
[703.0s] them out for for for for what is seen uh
[706.9s] as as as a derogation of the Protestant
[709.8s] movement you know um in the book I'll
[713.0s] just quote he quotes uh Cardinal Gibbons
[715.4s] who is a Catholic author and he says you
[717.8s] know the reason and sense demand the
[719.9s] acceptance of one or the other you can
[722.1s] only have one or the other either
[724.2s] Sabbath either the biblical Sabbath or
[727.6s] uh uh Sunday all right and he indicts
[730.4s] protestantism and he says you know
[732.0s] either protestantism uh and the keeping
[734.5s] of the Holy Saturday or Catholicism and
[737.7s] the keeping of holy Sunday you know
[740.2s] compromise is impossible compromise is
[743.1s] impossible um and so uh towards the end
[747.0s] of the Bible he actually makes or rather
[749.2s] towards the end of the book he actually
[751.1s] makes a call to say that you know you
[754.1s] can only have one and you cannot pay
[757.4s] attention to the deceptive delusions
[759.6s] that are there you either have to make a
[761.7s] choice which one are you going to keep
[764.8s] all right and so I think also the
[767.2s] guidance of or rather the glasses to
[771.3s] fully see through the blur of the world
[774.8s] is gained through Reading God reading
[777.2s] about God and so I think it in the
[780.6s] previous chapters it talks about how a
[783.0s] knowledge of God opens the doors to
[785.8s] heaven the path to Heaven is the world
[788.9s] that we're living in right now where
[790.9s] things are quite confusing but once we
[794.0s] understand who God is and what his plan
[795.9s] is for us and the importance of the law
[799.0s] which is quite clear if we adopt it
[802.7s] wholeheartedly then I think things are
[805.7s] Clarity is provided but also compromised
[809.4s] again is impossible amen amen so I just
[813.1s] want to encourage you as we conclude to
[815.1s] buy a copy of the book When God Says
[817.8s] Remember When God Says remember if you
[819.8s] don't want to take our word for it uh of
[822.0s] what is in here buy it for yourself and
[824.0s] read it and have a look and and and and
[826.1s] and make your own conclusions uh with
[828.4s] the light that is shining therein having
[831.0s] said that I'd like to call SOA please
[832.8s] maybe pray for us as we conclude thank
[835.3s] you let us pray dear heavenly father God
[838.3s] thank you for this wonderful chapter
[840.6s] that teaches teaches us most importantly
[843.5s] to observe the sabbath day for the
[845.8s] Sabbath day is crucial for our rest and
[848.9s] the renewal of a relationship with you
[851.4s] as we continue to delve in this book in
[854.0s] your servants words from when God said
[857.2s] remember let us look back to the
[859.4s] biblical truth let us ground ourselves
