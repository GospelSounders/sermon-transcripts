good you can have your seat now um now with that in mind allow me to take you to my summon today I very use PowerPoint but because of this today I'm going to use PowerPoint point now the theme rooted and growing when we start for 3 days this is what God impressed on our thoughts and the text of Colossians chapter 2 verse number 6 through 7 came into our mind so powerfully and we feel like this should be the guiding text for the next two years now it's projected um I hope those online are able also to see the verse projected but let's read together it's Colossians chapter 2 verse 6 and 7 can you read together as you heard have therefore received Christ Jesus the Lord so walk in him rooted and built up in him and establish in the faith as you have been taught abounding in it with Thanksgiving now this should be our memory verse by the end of the first quarter every child every youth every man every woman should be able to stand here and recet this verse without any struggle so please notice somewhere go memorize this verse and keep talking about it talk about it at home at workplace everywhere you go in the council meetings in The Breakfast meetings in all Retreat meetings there should be the verse to be read until it gets in us as you have therefore received Christ Jesus the Lord so walk in him rooted and buil built up in him now the concept of rooting and growing for Nairobi Central Church a church that has existed here for number of years now is not a New Concept yes indeed we have established ourselves as a church as a Congregation of faith we have done a lot of things for the Lord but yet we feel we need to continue rooting and growing this theme reminds us that a strong foundation in Christ is not only sustains US during life storms but also equips us to thrive and fulfill our god-given purpose there is a need and urgency for the church today to root and root and root because we are in the very edge of Eternity we are in a time when we are being tested from every side you know our doctrines our beliefs our standing as a people in the society is being tested every single day we can't afford to say we have been rooted we have to keep on checking the length and the depth of our root in Jesus that we may be able to withand the pressure of the day this Focus challenges us to cultivate deeper spiritual disciplines a blessing int intentional growth and live lives that overflow with gratitude and service together let us press into the richness of being rooted in Christ and embrace the abundance life of G in him we were blessed with the writings of LG white the pen of inspiration drawn from life and sketches of sesa white page 1 and6 which was written 1902 where she wrote the very beautiful passage we like speaking about we have nothing to fear for the future except except as we shall forget the way the Lord has led us and he's teaching in our past history this is where we are anchored that yes we are here as a as a church there is a lot of things that are waiting for us but we have nothing to fear going forward except if we shall forget how the Lord has led the church so we have every reason to introspect and see where we still need to continue you know anchoring our faith in Christ who is the author and the finisher of our faith we want to focus more on the teaching of Jesus the teaching of the word of God that has become the Cornerstone the pillar for the Adventist Church we have been known for many years as the Church of the book but I'm not very sure whether today we can become called the people of the book I find today the Bible is not Central in the Christian church is not Central even in many Adventist homes yet we need now to come back and go back to the book search the scriptures train our children based on the scriptures ground them in the word of God so that we can be able to grow the Next Generation that cannot be bought or be sold men and women who are strongly founded in the scriptures this will not happen until we are inten and as a church we need to focus the next two years going back to our fundamental beliefs teaching them every day in our homes teach them every Sabbath in our churches teaching them every week in our Bible studies at home and our prayer CS we need to go back to our fundamental beliefs as though we never heard about them and teach them AR fresh to grow the Next Generation that is founded in the scriptures so quarter one that we have starting today we'll be looking at fir rooting fir rooting and we'll be guided by the text of Jeremiah chap 17 verse number 7-8 the Bible says here blessed is the man who trust in the Lord and whose hope is the Lord for he shall be like a tree planted By the Waters that tree will sprads out its roots by the river now that concept of spreading the roots By the Waters by the river is the concept of rooting so blessed is the man who trust in the Lord whose hope is in the Lord because such a person who has trust in the Lord and his hope is in the Lord is a man who is root putting in the Lord and because of that the promise is In this passage he will not fear can somebody say Amen any man who trust in the Lord and whose hope is in the Lord is len to a tree that is rooting straight to the waters even when advanc weather conditions come that tree will fear nothing you see the Bible says and will not fear when heat comes but its leaves will be green and will not be anxious let me pause your friends and say as a care student of Prophecy I see the heat is coming I don't know how many of you see what I see but I can tell you for sure from the prophecy the heat is coming and only tree that is rooted and is root have gone all the way to the river so with stand the Heat of the Moment it's only that tree that is root are deeply into the water that her leaves or its leaves shall keep being green when the Sun is hot and the weather is scorching everywhere that tree is a Christian whose belief and hope is sounded on God and God Alone this is the kind of a church I want to see see in the next two years a church that has nothing but God and God Alone this is what I admire to see happening in the lives of our young people our children and all that we bring to the fold let them know that they are only safe when their faith and their belief is anchored in the word of God the Bible says blessed is the man I want to say here blessed is the church that will root in Jesus you see friends we were thinking through what happens the science behind the biology behind the tree and the growth and we comp a number of trees you know there are trees when the rain ceases they immediately start dying away I have come from the village and we have come from the rains were not enough for this season so I've seen a number of plants now are drying up it has taken about three or so weeks without rins and and already the plants are drying away why because they had they didn't have enough time to take Roots deep to where they can find source of water without depending the in water but when I looked around the other trees they are so green the mango trees by the way have come with so many mango so who you my friend you can see me after this the mango are so ripe and so green the trees but the crops are drying up I kept on thinking you know this because that thing was in my mind I kept on asking no how comes that the mango trees the orange trees and these other fruit treat are very green but the maze is drying up and what came to my mind is the science behind the root the tree has been there long enough and they have known how to take their Roots deep deep deep to the levels of water underground no matter what weather conditions are there the mango tree is always green yes I say you can thrive in every season and never cease to bear fruit no matter the heat of Trials or the drought of the insanes if you root in Christ and so that's how the first go going to look like so the first month that is this month January we'll be looking at planted in Christ and the text that is going to guide us is Ephesians chapter 3 verse number 17 the old month from today we will be discussing about being planted in who in Christ the second month of February we'll be looking at nourished by the word we anchor ourselves the text of Proverbs chapter 4 verse number 20 the month of March that brings the end the first quarter we'll be looking at strengthened in Fai strengthened in Fai 2 Corinthians chapter 15 verse number 38 then the second quarter we will having rooted having rooted in Christ having been nourished through the word of God and having been strengthened in faith now we can function so the second quarter we'll be talking about rise and build rise and build and the key verse that will be guiding Us in the second quarter will be nemiah chapter 2:8 the Bible says in nemiah chapter 2:8 it's a very beautiful story here there when nemiah desired to rebuild the walls of Jerusalem and he cast The Vision to the people and the people said we shall rise and build we shall rise and build having been rooted in Christ we desire the church to say we shall rise and build rise and build is a providential call to step out in faith to restore to strengthen and to create what has been broken or left undone now the N Central Church we have been here for a while it is could be possible that in the course of our existence as a people some things have been destroyed some faith has been destroyed some commitment has been destroyed some dreams have been destroyed we need to pause for 3 months and look at how we can restore some people have been weakened by many afflictions of this life we need to be intentional and strengthen one another in the Lord but maybe there are some areas we never ventured into and we need to go there in faith most of us as we s sit here today we met the sanctuary have been constructed we didn't we not participate in the own Sanctuary we did not participate in building this new Sanctuary we even don't we don't understand what it means to build a house of prayer for the Lord and seemingly we feel that we are very comfortable in this Sanctuary but we want to challenge us today there's still a lot to be done for the Lord in this place we still need to have a faith that was with the people who put up this big Sanctuary we need to be in the Spirit of sacrifice that was with our forefathers who built the sanctuary we are to move Beyond Comfort align with God's Will and labor with faith to give God's house Beauty and magnificen worth his glory as well as we labor for our eternity now let me prepare you this theme is very targeted because i' I've sympathized with you I've have seen how you struggle walking in here every Sabbath and the g is a hell of its kind we have very small space for parking here most of you have difficulties in coming here on supper now some of you wake very early in the morning to come and park and you take your breakfast here in church not because you really wanted to come in church very is because we are looking for packing am I talking to somebody and I'm looking at you people I'm asking what's wrong with us I mean we've got to do something with this problem it has been here for two and we are buying cars we are buying cars we are not reducing terms of cars we are we increasing cars every now where are they going where are we parking them can I tell you something we can't expand this church this way you also know that there's no space here neither can we go this way there's no space neither can we go that way there's no space neither can we go this way there's no space we have only two options this way or that way and we've got to Brave our our s and face it in these two years is our commitment as pastorate and the head Elders that we are going to go this way for you I want you to come to church comfortably drive yourself anytime you want to come to the Lord park your car and work Worship the Lord though in a struggle we have a dream very soon you come to unveil it of a five level parking space underground right now the plan is almost at the level of compession in terms of planning and soon we coming to bring it to you and that cannot happen until we all agree with Nehemiah and his people we will rise and build thank you for that who said amen out there so this quarter looks like this the month of April are you with me unveiling the vision that's what we'll be dealing with in the month of of of of April we are going to unveil the vision that God has for the church based on the book of nemiah chapter 2 verse number 17 and for the whole month we will be looking at what really happened what was behind the the the force and the conviction and the strategy of Nehemiah and his people that we can learn and apply it in Central Church now the month of May will be looking at clearing the rbls and and and and there are many rbls in this church rbls of Faith people who are so much fragmented in terms of faith that you will say Pastor will tell you let us let us let us pick this microphone and take it there and you get a thousand complaints my pastor why we are going to clear the rbl can somebody say Amen until we all come into one Unity Unity of one faith and one purpose as a people the month of June we'll be looking at finishing the walls and you can be very sure this is very timed because by this particular time the works will have started if God is on our side and we believe in him when we pray we feel him speaking to us we know this is happening this year it's our prayer that before the end of this year we are done with this project of parking I know you're looking at me and saying pastor are you out of your mind I'm not out of my mind I am a little faith because he said even that little faith can make mountains move can somebody say Amen yes so the fourth quarter that brings the end of this year is I mean the thir quarter rather the thir quarter is faithful foundations faithful foundations now I remember when we were thinking through the th quarter one of our Pastor said families are struggling and if the family is not okay we continue struggling in church and so we chose to dedicate an entire quarter talking about relationship at the family level the family leader Elder Ela should be very happy because we will do a crusade for 3 months for families Faith what foundations and the text is 1 Corinthians chapter 3 verse number 11 for no other Foundation can anyone lay than that which is laid which is that Jesus Christ every relationship must be founded on the principles of Jesus Christ and we'll be looking at the supremacy of Christ as the foundation the Cornerstone of our building I I say here this morning Jesus can we read that statement Jesus let's read again Jesus he is the only foundation you know there are so many foundations but I can tell you Jesus is not among those foundations for a Christian he is the only foundation the Paul says he is the order and the finisher in every aspect of your life as a Christian whether at a family level or for your business of for your Christian Journey Jesus is the author and the finisher he has everything a package for you he says I know the plans I have for you I knew you before you were born he is the one who is the originator The Source the fir foundation for anything you desire to do for Excellency and prosperity Jesus is supreme at any attempt to build life Faith or Ministry on any other Foundation rather than Christ will do what will crumble no Foundation is secure stable or Eternal except that only the one led by God himself that is Jesus Christ and so we want to talk about our families our marriages our children our relationship our young people building the their lives and the associations their relationship on the Firm Foundation of the one of God we are hoping by the end of this quarter or this particular quarter we will save a number of families we will build a number of relationship and there will be more peace and Tranquility within the families and the church and so the last quarter or maybe the okay just to show again a diagram for the third quarter um how it's going to look like the month of July foundations of love in Ephesians chter 3: 19 the month of August Bound By Grace we will be dwelling on the all issue of forgiveness what is it that you cannot forgive at a family level or in your relationship when you think about Grace God is say that you cannot be able to forgive and then the month of September we'll be looking at Family on Mission and we will be letting you know and understand that God establish you as a family for Mission God want you to sit at a family level and plan how to go and do Mission as a family family on Mission and for the all month that is four weeks there we'll be discussing about how a family can be involved in Mission that brings us to the last quarter of the year the fourth quarter we'll be talking about the church on move the church on move this is anchored on the text of Isaiah chapter 52 verse number 7 the bible says how beautiful upon the mountains are the feet of him who brings good news who proclaims peace who brings GL Tidings of good things who proclaims salvation who says to Zion your god reigns how beautiful on the mountains at the feet of him who brings good news and we will be looking And discussing about that beautiful feet the beautiful feet the the beautiful what feet the beautiful feet and this will Usher us into a robust activity in Mission every step taken in sharing the gospel is a step of Beauty in God's eye God instituted a church we exist we are here not for anything else after we've been built we then need to go and bring other people and build other congregation we exist for Mission purposes and you don't have to be a pastor like me to preach you don't have to be a pastor like Pastor T or Pastor amay no for you to have Beau feet no every believer is called to share the gospel in their unique way at work at home in every day in classrooms everywhere we are God has called each member of his family to be a witness evangelist in his lifetime so we'll be looking at whose feet will be beautiful and so the month the quarter will look like the diagram I I have here so the month of October we'll be talking about moving with vision habakuk chapter 2 verse number two please write down we have the hand bills shortly they are going to be distributed I hope they the people to distribute have been set properly so we are going to see all this in beautiful um handbills the month of November will be looking at compelled by compassion we don't do very well in terms of compassion Ministry we are trying but we have not done very well our potential is more than what we are doing and we'll be looking at how to move in Mission through compassion now we are going to discover that Jesus ministry was actually anchored on compassion he attracted people through what compassion and a church that is compassionate a member that is compassionate is truly a disciple of Jesus and the last month of December then we'll be moving towards what eternity towards eternity now this is what you anticipate this year this is what your pastor were able to sit and do and is my prayer that you will Embrace this Vision align yourself with this focus and together as a people grow being rooted in Christ you see we are living in an age where we cannot avoid but talk about rooting in a time when people are running away from sound Doctrine as Paul said and prophesied we need rooting in a time when every pillar of faith is being eroded all broad marks of faith and righteousness are being eroded we need rooting at a time where marriage has been attacked and violated when the churches have joined hands with with the state the several human rights agencies crusading for samesex marriages against are very clear thus says the Lord we need routine when we find ourself in an age where right and wrong seem to be same we need Rootin when we are in a time in history where the laugh of many has grown cold people killing each other people hurting each other people today even those in church has have become so massless they sit they plan they plot to destroy one another in such an age we need rooting when friends today we see our people have loved the world and have dis dayed the word of God while we are raising a generation we need Rootin that invite you in the studious as a church that we may together by the spirit of God talk about rooting and growing I don't know how many of you today is your desire that by the grace of God we shall journey through this beam and focus and I desire through these two years to root myself family in the Lord I don't know who today is as a desire but this one in this two years I want to position myself strategically for growth you see a plant will never grow if it doesn't have roots and a plant will never grow and continue growing if it is not growing The Roots what you see from outside is a representation of what is taking place underground now when I was doing a study for this I discovered a tree very very interesting the babo tree the Bab tree I saw when I was studying that before you see the bab tree shooting up out of the soil it has taken years underground growing The Roots the day you see just a shoot of a bab tree from the ground this way coming up there are so many roots that bab tree began about two three years ago growing root it it's not interested in show off it's not interested in showing up is not interested in appearing it takes time to lay the foundation can somebody say Amen now that is what we need today in this age as a church at times we too quick to portray who we are but we have no base the slightest wind of do coming it sweeps us away we need to take two years as a church and behave like babo tree and take our Roots deep into the death of the word of God the time we start showing up we are so rooted no matter what comes our way we will be able to withstand the testing of the day this is our prayer for you as a church for us as your pastors and for all the church leaders of narobi Central Church we take this prly intentionally deliberately run it in our homes run it in our departmental Council meetings run it everywhere we do let us talk about rooting rooting rooting growing growing growing growing until when Jesus come is that your desire that the Lord to help us as a church to realize this dream do you propose to partner with heaven in prayer and commitment at a personal level to ensure that we all implement this trtic focus and see how much God is going to bless us that is my desire but if I have a witness here if I have somebody here who says even me Pastor that is what I need now I need to deepen my relationship my dependence on the Lord there are many things coming our way Winds of doctrines conflict afflictions of every kind we cannot stop them but we can be rooted even though the storms will come a tree that is family rooted doesn't fear storms and we will be sustained through the crisis hour that is ahead of us in the light of Prophecy that is your prayer and your desire may you stand as we pray

[460.5s] workplace everywhere you go in the
[463.1s] council meetings in The Breakfast
[465.9s] meetings in all Retreat meetings there
[469.1s] should be the verse to be read until it
[472.2s] gets in us as you have therefore
[474.9s] received Christ Jesus the Lord so walk
[476.9s] in him rooted and buil built up in him
[482.2s] now the concept of
[486.1s] rooting and growing for Nairobi Central
[490.5s] Church a church that has existed here
[493.1s] for number of years
[495.8s] now is not a New
[499.4s] Concept yes indeed we have established
[501.9s] ourselves as a church as a Congregation
[504.5s] of faith we have done a lot of things
[506.9s] for the Lord but yet we feel we need to
[510.4s] continue rooting and
[513.4s] growing this theme reminds us that a
[517.2s] strong foundation in Christ is not
[520.1s] only sustains US during life storms but
[524.7s] also equips us to thrive and fulfill our
[529.0s] god-given
[529.9s] purpose there is a need and urgency for
[533.6s] the church
[534.9s] today to
[537.3s] root and root and root because we are in
[542.2s] the very edge of
[545.2s] Eternity we are in a time when we are
[548.5s] being tested from every side you know
[550.7s] our doctrines our beliefs our standing
[553.3s] as a people in the society is being
[555.0s] tested every single
[559.0s] day we can't afford to say we have been
[563.5s] rooted we have to keep on checking the
[567.2s] length and the depth of our root in
[570.4s] Jesus that we may be able to withand the
[573.2s] pressure of the
[574.8s] day this Focus challenges us to
[578.6s] cultivate deeper spiritual disciplines a
[582.0s] blessing int intentional growth
[585.1s] and live lives that overflow with
[588.7s] gratitude and
[590.3s] service together let us press into the
[594.4s] richness of being rooted in Christ and
[597.6s] embrace the abundance life of G in
[601.1s] him we were blessed with the writings of
[607.0s] LG white the pen of inspiration drawn
[610.0s] from life and sketches of sesa
[616.3s] white page 1 and6 which was written
[621.6s] 1902 where she wrote the very beautiful
[624.3s] passage we like speaking about we have
[626.6s] nothing to fear for the future except
[629.3s] except as we shall forget the way the
[631.6s] Lord has led us and he's teaching in our
[635.4s] past history this is where we are
[638.2s] anchored that yes we are here as a as a
[641.6s] church there is a lot of things that are
[643.6s] waiting for us but we have nothing to
[645.9s] fear going forward except if we shall
[649.5s] forget how the Lord has led the church
[653.4s] so we have every reason to
[656.2s] introspect and see where we still need
[659.6s] to continue you know anchoring our faith
[662.5s] in Christ who is the author and the
[664.5s] finisher of our
[666.7s] faith we want to focus more on the
[669.5s] teaching of Jesus the teaching of the
[672.1s] word of God that has become the
[675.3s] Cornerstone the pillar for the Adventist
[677.5s] Church we have been known for many years
[679.5s] as the Church of the book but I'm not
[681.8s] very sure whether today we can become
[684.0s] called the people of the book I find
[687.0s] today the Bible is not Central in the
[690.1s] Christian church is not Central even in
[693.1s] many Adventist
[694.9s] homes yet we need now to come back and
[697.9s] go back to the book search the
[700.5s] scriptures train our children based on
[704.0s] the scriptures ground them in the word
[706.3s] of God so that we can be able to grow
[708.9s] the Next Generation that cannot be
[710.8s] bought or be sold men and women who are
[714.4s] strongly founded in the scriptures this
[717.5s] will not happen until we are inten
[719.8s] and as a church we need to focus the
[721.7s] next two years going back to our
[724.2s] fundamental beliefs teaching them every
[727.2s] day in our homes teach them every
[729.6s] Sabbath in our churches teaching them
[731.6s] every week in our Bible studies at home
[734.0s] and our prayer CS we need to go back to
[736.6s] our fundamental beliefs as though we
[738.9s] never heard about them and teach them AR
[741.3s] fresh to grow the Next Generation that
[743.6s] is founded in the
[745.7s] scriptures
[747.5s] so quarter one that we have starting
[750.5s] today we'll be looking at fir rooting
[754.0s] fir rooting and we'll be guided by the
[756.4s] text of Jeremiah chap 17 verse number
[759.8s] 7-8 the Bible says here blessed is the
[762.8s] man who trust in the Lord and whose hope
[766.1s] is the
[768.7s] Lord for he shall be like a tree planted
[773.5s] By the
[777.3s] Waters that tree will sprads out its
[780.6s] roots by the river now that concept of
[784.6s] spreading the roots By the
[787.8s] Waters by the river is the concept of
[793.4s] rooting so blessed is the man who trust
[797.8s] in the Lord whose hope is in the Lord
[802.0s] because such a person who has trust in
[804.4s] the Lord and his hope is in the Lord is
[807.1s] a man who is root putting in the
[811.6s] Lord and because of that the promise is
[815.5s] In this
[816.5s] passage he will not
[820.3s] fear can somebody say Amen any man who
[824.0s] trust in the Lord and whose hope is in
[827.2s] the Lord is len to a tree that is
[830.4s] rooting straight to the waters even when
[833.6s] advanc weather conditions come that tree
[836.2s] will fear
[837.6s] nothing you see the Bible says and will
[839.8s] not fear when heat comes but its leaves
[843.4s] will be green and will not be
[846.8s] anxious let me pause your friends and
[849.3s] say as a care student of
[853.0s] Prophecy I see the heat is
[856.8s] coming I don't know how many of you see
[858.9s] what I see but I can tell you for sure
[861.4s] from the prophecy the heat is coming and
[865.4s] only tree that is rooted and is root
[869.3s] have gone all the way to the river so
[872.2s] with stand the Heat of the Moment it's
[875.4s] only that tree that is root are deeply
[878.1s] into the water that her leaves or its
[880.4s] leaves shall keep being green when the
[883.4s] Sun is hot and the weather is scorching
[886.8s] everywhere that tree is a Christian
[890.6s] whose belief and hope is sounded on God
[894.7s] and God
[895.6s] Alone this is the kind of a church I
[898.4s] want to see see in the next two years a
[901.6s] church that has nothing but God and God
[905.6s] Alone this is what I admire to see
[908.1s] happening in the lives of our young
[909.7s] people our children and all that we
[912.2s] bring to the fold let them know that
[915.4s] they are only safe when their faith and
[918.6s] their belief is anchored in the word of
[923.8s] God the Bible says blessed is the
[928.0s] man I want to say here blessed is the
[931.6s] church that will root in
[938.9s] Jesus you see
[941.1s] friends we were thinking through what
[944.3s] happens the science behind the biology
[947.5s] behind the tree and the
[952.7s] growth and we comp a number of
[957.0s] trees you know there are trees
[959.6s] when the rain
[963.2s] ceases they immediately start dying
[969.2s] away I have come from the
[973.3s] village and we have come from the rains
[975.7s] were not enough for this
[979.0s] season so I've seen a number of plants
[981.6s] now are drying
[983.4s] up it has taken about three or so weeks
[986.9s] without rins and and already the plants
[990.6s] are drying away why because they had
[996.2s] they didn't have enough time to take
[999.1s] Roots deep to where they can find source
[1002.6s] of water without depending the in water
[1005.6s] but when I looked around the other trees
[1008.7s] they are so
[1011.0s] green the mango trees by the way have
[1013.5s] come with so many mango so who you my
[1015.1s] friend you can see me after this
[1019.8s] the mango are so ripe and so green the
[1022.3s] trees but the crops are drying
[1025.8s] up I kept on thinking you know this
[1028.0s] because that thing was in my mind I kept
[1029.3s] on asking no how comes that the mango
[1033.2s] trees the orange trees and these other
[1036.6s] fruit treat are very green but the maze
[1040.1s] is drying
[1041.7s] up and what came to my mind is the
[1045.4s] science behind the
[1047.6s] root the tree has been there long enough
[1052.0s] and they have known how to take their
[1054.2s] Roots deep deep deep to the levels of
[1057.2s] water
[1058.0s] underground no matter what weather
[1060.2s] conditions are there the mango tree is
[1062.5s] always
[1065.3s] green yes I say you can thrive in every
[1067.9s] season and never cease to bear fruit no
[1071.6s] matter the heat of Trials or the drought
[1074.9s] of the insanes if you root in Christ
[1082.0s] and so that's how the first go going to
[1083.6s] look
[1085.4s] like so the first
[1087.9s] month that is this month
[1090.7s] January we'll be looking at planted in
[1093.9s] Christ and the text that is going to
[1095.9s] guide us is Ephesians chapter 3 verse
[1097.9s] number
[1098.8s] 17 the old month from today we will be
[1102.6s] discussing about being planted in who in
[1106.2s] Christ
[1108.9s] the second month of February we'll be
[1110.8s] looking at nourished by the
[1114.8s] word we anchor ourselves the text of
[1117.2s] Proverbs chapter 4 verse number
[1120.0s] 20 the month of March that brings the
[1123.6s] end the first quarter we'll be looking
[1125.6s] at strengthened in Fai strengthened in
[1130.0s] Fai 2 Corinthians chapter 15 verse
[1133.1s] number
[1134.4s] 38 then the second
[1136.8s] quarter we will
[1139.5s] having
[1141.4s] rooted having rooted in
[1145.9s] Christ having been nourished through the
[1148.2s] word of God and having been strengthened
[1151.9s] in
[1153.4s] faith now we can
[1156.2s] function so the second quarter we'll be
[1158.4s] talking about rise and
[1161.1s] build rise and
[1163.5s] build and the key verse that will be
[1165.8s] guiding Us in the second quarter will be
[1167.9s] nemiah chapter
[1171.2s] 2:8 the Bible
[1174.8s] says in nemiah chapter 2:8 it's a very
[1178.8s] beautiful story here there when nemiah
[1182.0s] desired to rebuild the walls of
[1185.3s] Jerusalem and he cast The Vision to the
[1188.9s] people and the people said we shall rise
[1192.5s] and
[1193.8s] build we shall rise and build
[1199.5s] having been rooted in Christ we desire
[1202.9s] the church to say we shall rise and
[1208.3s] build rise and build is a providential
[1211.4s] call to step out in faith to restore to
[1216.2s] strengthen and to create what has been
[1219.4s] broken or left undone now the N Central
[1223.4s] Church we have been here for a
[1226.2s] while it is could be possible that in
[1229.2s] the course of our existence as a
[1233.3s] people some things have been
[1236.0s] destroyed some faith has been destroyed
[1239.4s] some commitment has been
[1241.5s] destroyed some dreams have been
[1244.1s] destroyed we need to pause for 3 months
[1247.4s] and look at how we can
[1250.4s] restore some people have been weakened
[1252.8s] by many afflictions of this life we need
[1255.8s] to be intentional and strengthen one
[1258.6s] another in the
[1260.7s] Lord but maybe there are some areas we
[1264.1s] never ventured
[1265.5s] into and we need to go there in
[1270.2s] faith most of us as we s sit here
[1273.8s] today we met the sanctuary have been
[1279.2s] constructed we didn't we not participate
[1281.6s] in the own Sanctuary we did not
[1283.9s] participate in building this new
[1285.9s] Sanctuary we even don't we don't
[1288.3s] understand what it means to build a
[1290.0s] house of prayer for the
[1293.3s] Lord and seemingly we feel that we are
[1297.1s] very comfortable in this
[1300.2s] Sanctuary but we want to challenge us
[1302.9s] today there's still a lot to be done for
[1306.6s] the Lord in this
[1309.2s] place we still need to have a faith that
[1313.2s] was with the people who put up this big
[1316.5s] Sanctuary we need to be in the Spirit of
[1319.2s] sacrifice that was with our forefathers
[1321.8s] who built the
[1326.2s] sanctuary we are to move Beyond Comfort
[1329.8s] align with God's Will and labor with
[1332.8s] faith to give God's house Beauty and
[1336.3s] magnificen worth his
[1338.2s] glory as well as we labor for our
[1341.2s] eternity now let me prepare you this
[1344.5s] theme is very targeted because i' I've
[1347.2s] sympathized with you I've have seen how
[1349.5s] you struggle walking in here every
[1352.0s] Sabbath and the g is a hell of its kind
[1357.3s] we have very small space for parking
[1360.2s] here most of you have difficulties in
[1362.8s] coming here on supper now some of you
[1365.2s] wake very early in the morning to come
[1367.5s] and park and you take your breakfast
[1369.7s] here in church not because you really
[1371.4s] wanted to come in church very is because
[1373.4s] we are looking for packing
[1379.5s] am I talking to
[1382.4s] somebody and I'm looking at you people
[1384.6s] I'm asking what's wrong with
[1387.7s] us I mean we've got to do something with
[1391.3s] this problem it has been here for two
[1394.1s] and we are buying cars we are buying
[1395.8s] cars we are not reducing terms of cars
[1397.8s] we are we increasing cars every now
[1399.6s] where are they going where are we
[1400.8s] parking
[1403.6s] them can I tell you something
[1409.0s] we can't expand this church this way you
[1411.8s] also know that there's no space
[1414.1s] here neither can we go this way there's
[1416.9s] no space neither can we go that way
[1420.2s] there's no space neither can we go this
[1423.0s] way there's no space we have only two
[1428.6s] options this way or that
[1435.1s] way and we've got to Brave our our s and
[1439.6s] face
[1442.3s] it in these two
[1444.7s] years is our commitment as
[1447.7s] pastorate and the head
[1450.4s] Elders that we are going to go this way
[1455.3s] for
[1458.8s] you I want you to come to church
[1462.1s] comfortably drive yourself anytime you
[1464.6s] want to come to the
[1466.1s] Lord park your car and work Worship the
[1469.2s] Lord though in a
[1471.5s] struggle we have a dream very soon you
[1474.0s] come to unveil it of a five
[1477.7s] level parking space
[1481.4s] underground right now the plan is
[1484.6s] almost at the level of compession in
[1486.8s] terms of planning and soon we coming to
[1489.0s] bring it to you and that cannot happen
[1493.1s] until we all agree with Nehemiah and his
[1496.5s] people we will rise and
[1501.1s] build thank you for that who said amen
[1503.2s] out
[1505.0s] there so this quarter looks like
[1508.6s] this the month of
[1512.6s] April are you with
[1514.6s] me
[1516.4s] unveiling the
[1519.0s] vision that's what we'll be dealing with
[1520.8s] in the month of of of of April we are
[1523.1s] going to unveil the vision that God has
[1525.3s] for the church based on the book of
[1527.0s] nemiah chapter 2 verse number 17 and for
[1529.7s] the whole month we will be looking at
[1532.4s] what really happened what was behind the
[1535.0s] the the force and the
[1537.7s] conviction and the strategy of Nehemiah
[1540.4s] and his people that we can learn and
[1541.9s] apply it in Central Church now the month
[1543.8s] of May will be looking at clearing the
[1546.5s] rbls and and and and there are many rbls
[1550.0s] in this
[1551.7s] church rbls of
[1554.2s] Faith people who are so much fragmented
[1557.6s] in terms of faith
[1558.9s] that you will say Pastor will tell you
[1560.7s] let us let us let us pick this
[1562.2s] microphone and take it there and you get
[1565.0s] a thousand
[1566.9s] complaints my pastor
[1571.8s] why we are going to clear the rbl can
[1574.9s] somebody say
[1576.4s] Amen until we all come into one Unity
[1581.5s] Unity of one faith and one purpose as a
[1584.4s] people the month of June we'll be
[1587.4s] looking at finishing the walls and you
[1590.7s] can be very sure this is very timed
[1592.8s] because by this particular time the
[1594.3s] works will have
[1596.8s] started if God is on our side and we
[1599.5s] believe in him when we pray we feel him
[1601.9s] speaking to us we know this is happening
[1604.6s] this year it's our prayer that before
[1607.5s] the end of this
[1609.3s] year we are done with this project of
[1612.6s] parking I know you're looking at me and
[1614.5s] saying pastor are you out of your
[1617.2s] mind I'm not out of my
[1620.9s] mind I am a little faith because he said
[1624.6s] even that little faith can make
[1626.8s] mountains move can somebody say
[1628.8s] Amen yes so the fourth quarter that
[1632.5s] brings the end of this year
[1636.4s] is I mean the thir quarter rather the
[1638.5s] thir quarter is faithful foundations
[1641.6s] faithful
[1642.6s] foundations now I remember when we were
[1645.0s] thinking through the th
[1646.9s] quarter one of our Pastor
[1654.1s] said families are
[1659.2s] struggling and if the family is not okay
[1662.4s] we continue struggling in
[1664.4s] church and so we chose to dedicate an
[1667.2s] entire quarter talking
[1671.2s] about relationship at the family
[1674.6s] level the family leader Elder Ela should
[1678.5s] be very happy because we will do a
[1680.8s] crusade for 3
[1682.4s] months for
[1685.2s] families Faith what foundations and the
[1689.2s] text is 1 Corinthians chapter 3 verse
[1691.0s] number 11 for no other Foundation can
[1694.2s] anyone lay than that which is laid which
[1698.1s] is that Jesus
[1700.5s] Christ every
[1703.6s] relationship must be founded on the
[1707.6s] principles
[1709.0s] of Jesus
[1711.1s] Christ and we'll be looking at the
[1713.0s] supremacy of Christ as the foundation
[1716.0s] the Cornerstone of our
[1718.6s] building I I say here this
[1722.1s] morning
[1724.0s] Jesus can we read that statement
[1732.6s] Jesus let's read again Jesus
[1741.6s] he is the only
[1745.9s] foundation you know there are so many
[1749.6s] foundations but I can tell you Jesus is
[1753.6s] not among those
[1755.5s] foundations for a Christian he is the
[1759.8s] only
[1761.8s] foundation the Paul says he is the order
[1765.0s] and the finisher
[1768.7s] in every aspect of your life as a
[1772.1s] Christian whether at a family level or
[1774.7s] for your business of for your Christian
[1777.4s] Journey Jesus is the author and the
[1780.4s] finisher he has everything a package for
[1783.8s] you he says I know the plans I have for
[1786.1s] you I knew you before you were born he
[1788.5s] is the one who is the originator The
[1792.3s] Source the fir foundation for anything
[1796.0s] you desire to do for Excellency and
[1799.6s] prosperity Jesus is
[1802.3s] supreme at any attempt to build life
[1805.0s] Faith or Ministry on any other
[1807.3s] Foundation rather than Christ will do
[1809.5s] what will
[1812.4s] crumble no Foundation is secure stable
[1816.2s] or Eternal except that only the one led
[1819.2s] by God himself that is Jesus Christ and
[1821.8s] so we want to talk about our families
[1823.6s] our marriages our children our
[1825.4s] relationship our young people building
[1827.8s] the their lives and the associations
[1829.9s] their relationship on the Firm
[1833.1s] Foundation of the one of God we are
[1836.5s] hoping by the end of this quarter or
[1839.0s] this particular quarter we will save a
[1842.3s] number of families we will build a
[1845.4s] number of relationship and there will be
[1847.8s] more peace and Tranquility within the
[1850.8s] families and the
[1853.6s] church and so the last
[1856.4s] quarter or maybe the okay just to show
[1859.1s] again a diagram for the third quarter um
[1862.8s] how it's going to look like the month
[1865.6s] of July foundations of
[1869.3s] love in Ephesians chter 3: 19 the month
[1873.1s] of
[1873.9s] August Bound By Grace we will be
[1876.9s] dwelling on the all issue of forgiveness
[1879.0s] what is it that you cannot forgive at a
[1881.6s] family level or in your relationship
[1884.4s] when you think about Grace God is say
[1886.1s] that you cannot be able to forgive and
[1888.0s] then the month of September we'll be
[1889.4s] looking at Family on Mission and we will
[1892.9s] be letting you know and understand that
[1895.7s] God establish you as a family for
[1899.5s] Mission God want you to sit at a family
[1902.2s] level and plan how to go and do Mission
[1906.1s] as a
[1908.2s] family family on Mission and for the all
[1912.0s] month that is four weeks there we'll be
[1914.2s] discussing about how a family can be
[1917.4s] involved in
[1920.0s] Mission that brings us to the last
[1922.3s] quarter of the year the fourth
[1925.0s] quarter we'll be talking about the
[1926.9s] church on move the church on move this
[1931.8s] is anchored on the text of Isaiah
[1933.4s] chapter 52 verse number
[1936.2s] 7 the bible says how
[1939.6s] beautiful upon the
[1942.3s] mountains are the feet of him who brings
[1946.6s] good news
[1949.0s] who proclaims peace who brings GL
[1953.0s] Tidings of good things who proclaims
[1955.2s] salvation who says to Zion your god
[1960.4s] reigns how beautiful on the mountains at
[1964.7s] the feet of him who brings good news and
[1968.3s] we will be looking And discussing about
[1972.0s] that beautiful
[1973.5s] feet the beautiful
[1976.7s] feet the the beautiful what
[1980.7s] feet the beautiful
[1984.3s] feet and
[1986.9s] this will Usher us into a
[1990.7s] robust activity in
[1994.6s] Mission every step taken in sharing the
[1997.9s] gospel is a step of Beauty in God's
[2002.3s] eye God instituted a church we exist we
[2005.6s] are here not for anything else after
[2008.2s] we've been built we then need to go and
[2010.9s] bring other people and build other
[2012.8s] congregation we exist for Mission
[2017.4s] purposes and you don't have to be a
[2019.4s] pastor like me to
[2022.6s] preach you don't have to be a pastor
[2025.1s] like Pastor T or Pastor amay no for you
[2028.6s] to have Beau feet no every
[2032.0s] believer is called to share the gospel
[2036.1s] in their unique way
[2038.3s] at work at home in every day in
[2041.9s] classrooms everywhere we are God has
[2044.8s] called each member of his family to be a
[2049.2s] witness
[2052.8s] evangelist in his
[2055.0s] lifetime so we'll be looking at whose
[2058.3s] feet will be
[2062.3s] beautiful and so the month the quarter
[2064.6s] will look
[2066.1s] like the diagram
[2069.0s] I I have here so the month of
[2072.8s] October we'll be talking about moving
[2075.4s] with
[2077.2s] vision habakuk chapter 2 verse number
[2079.7s] two please write
[2083.1s] down we have the hand bills shortly they
[2085.8s] are going to be distributed I hope they
[2088.6s] the people to distribute have been set
[2090.2s] properly so we are going to see all this
[2092.8s] in beautiful um handbills the month of
[2096.4s] November will be looking at compelled by
[2102.1s] compassion we don't do very
[2106.7s] well in terms of compassion
[2110.4s] Ministry we are trying but we have not
[2113.7s] done very well our potential is more
[2117.6s] than what we are
[2119.3s] doing and we'll be looking at how to
[2122.3s] move in Mission through compassion now
[2125.6s] we are going to discover that Jesus
[2126.8s] ministry was actually anchored on
[2130.0s] compassion he attracted people through
[2133.7s] what compassion and a church that is
[2137.0s] compassionate a member that is
[2138.9s] compassionate is truly a disciple of
[2142.7s] Jesus and the last month of December
[2145.7s] then we'll be moving towards what
[2149.1s] eternity towards eternity now this is
[2151.9s] what you
[2153.5s] anticipate this year this is what your
[2156.2s] pastor were able to sit and do and is my
[2159.4s] prayer that you
[2162.2s] will Embrace this
[2164.8s] Vision align yourself with this focus
[2169.0s] and together as a
[2170.7s] people
[2173.4s] grow being rooted in
[2176.6s] Christ you
[2182.6s] see we are living in an age
[2187.8s] where we cannot avoid but talk about
[2193.4s] rooting in a time
[2196.4s] when people are running away from sound
[2200.6s] Doctrine as Paul said and
[2203.3s] prophesied we need
[2205.4s] rooting in a time when every pillar of
[2209.6s] faith is being eroded
[2213.0s] all broad marks of faith and
[2216.7s] righteousness are being eroded we need
[2220.6s] rooting at a time
[2223.0s] where marriage has been attacked and
[2226.8s] violated when the
[2229.1s] churches have joined hands with with the
[2233.0s] state the several human rights agencies
[2237.2s] crusading for samesex marriages against
[2240.9s] are very clear thus says the
[2244.8s] Lord we need routine
[2249.2s] when we find
[2250.8s] ourself in an
[2253.1s] age where right and wrong seem to be
[2258.6s] same we need
[2262.0s] Rootin when we are in a time in
[2265.4s] history where the laugh of many has
[2269.0s] grown
[2270.2s] cold people killing each other people
[2273.4s] hurting each other people today even
[2276.3s] those in church has have become so
[2278.9s] massless they sit they plan they plot to
[2282.6s] destroy one another in such an age we
[2286.8s] need
[2289.1s] rooting when friends
[2291.6s] today we see our people have loved the
[2295.4s] world and have dis dayed the word of
[2300.5s] God while we are raising a generation we
[2304.6s] need
[2306.3s] Rootin that invite you in the studious
[2309.8s] as a church that we may together by the
[2313.8s] spirit of God talk about rooting and
[2318.9s] growing I don't know how many of you
[2321.1s] today is your
[2323.3s] desire that by the grace of
[2326.0s] God we shall journey through this beam
[2331.2s] and
[2332.4s] focus and I desire through these two
[2335.4s] years
[2340.3s] to root myself family in the
[2345.0s] Lord I don't know who today is as a
[2349.1s] desire but this one in this two years I
[2352.6s] want to position myself strategically
[2356.4s] for
[2358.9s] growth you
[2361.6s] see a plant will never grow if it
[2365.4s] doesn't have roots
[2369.0s] and a plant will never grow and continue
[2373.8s] growing if it is not growing The
[2379.6s] Roots what you see from
[2383.8s] outside is a representation of what is
[2386.6s] taking place
[2388.8s] underground now when I was doing a study
[2391.1s] for this I discovered a tree very very
[2394.0s] interesting the babo tree the Bab tree I
[2398.3s] saw when I was
[2399.6s] studying that before you see the bab
[2401.9s] tree shooting up out of the
[2405.3s] soil it has taken years
[2409.6s] underground growing The
[2411.8s] Roots the day you see just a shoot of a
[2414.6s] bab tree from the ground this way coming
[2417.3s] up there are so many roots that bab tree
[2420.5s] began about two three years ago growing
[2423.2s] root it it's not interested in show off
[2425.9s] it's not interested in showing up is not
[2428.1s] interested in appearing it takes time to
[2431.6s] lay the foundation can somebody say Amen
[2435.0s] now that is what we need today in this
[2438.0s] age as a
[2440.1s] church at times we too
[2443.1s] quick to portray who we are but we have
[2446.5s] no
[2447.8s] base the slightest wind of do coming it
[2451.7s] sweeps us
[2453.9s] away we need to take two years as a
[2456.8s] church
[2459.3s] and behave like babo
[2461.3s] tree and take our Roots deep into the
[2465.3s] death of the word of
[2466.8s] God the time we start showing
[2469.6s] up we are so
[2472.3s] rooted no matter what comes our way we
[2475.8s] will be able to withstand the testing of
[2478.6s] the
[2479.6s] day this is our
[2482.6s] prayer for you as a church for us as
[2486.4s] your pastors and for all the church
[2488.7s] leaders of narobi Central Church we take
[2491.5s] this prly intentionally deliberately run
[2496.0s] it in our homes run it in our
[2498.7s] departmental Council meetings run it
[2501.3s] everywhere we do let us talk about
[2503.4s] rooting rooting rooting growing growing
[2507.1s] growing growing until when Jesus
[2512.8s] come is that your desire that the Lord
[2515.0s] to help us as a church to realize this
[2516.8s] dream
[2518.3s] do you propose to partner with heaven in
[2521.4s] prayer and commitment at a personal
[2523.8s] level to ensure that we all implement
[2526.6s] this trtic focus and see how much God is
[2530.6s] going to bless us that is my
[2533.6s] desire but if I have a witness here if I
[2536.8s] have somebody here who says even me
[2538.4s] Pastor that is what I need now I need to
[2542.3s] deepen my relationship my dependence on
[2545.6s] the Lord there are many things coming
[2547.6s] our way Winds of doctrines conflict
[2550.8s] afflictions of every kind we cannot stop
[2553.8s] them but we can be rooted even though
[2556.8s] the storms will come a tree that is
[2559.2s] family rooted doesn't fear
[2562.6s] storms and we will be sustained through
[2567.8s] the crisis hour that is ahead of us in
[2570.7s] the light of
[2572.6s] Prophecy that is your prayer and your
[2574.8s] desire may you stand as we pray
