welcome to the teens Cornerstone connection lesson 9 of the fourth quarter the theme of this quarter is deliverance and the title of the lesson is getting it right today's panelists are teacher mesent Omi Natasha Whitney and Winston today's Mission will be read by me kandra aora and we'll hear a special item by Angie and natal today's Mission comes straight out of Alaska it's a story of a camp count who lost a boy 7-year-old Liam ran up and down the seventh day ADV Adventist summer camp in Alaska it was hard to put the boy to bed and it was even harder to know the boy's whereabouts Midway through the week Liam ran away the trouble began when his camp counselor aan confronted the boy you can't just run away you have to tell your Camp counselors where you are because if you get lost it'll be our problem Midway of Ain speaking Liam ran away Ain and other staff of the camp began to look for the boy they searched and they searched but still no aen they prayed but still no aen iin decided to go to the camp director and tell him I've lost a boy and I don't know where he is when all of them were about to give up about 40 minutes later Liam appeared he came out of some bushes with a huge smile on his face but aan wasn't smiling back but aan wasn't smiling back Avan yelled at the boy you can't just run away this is not okay but the boy's smile dropped again while avin was speaking Liam ran away but this time Avid knew where he was Avid in another camp counselor Jacob followed him into the woods they saw him scramble up a tree John John on the other camp counselor called up to him and said come down we would love it if you come down and don't get hurt Ain from the bushes looked up and yelled I hate aan I wish you were dead Ain was shocked by what the boy said but he was determined to show the boy God's love so he yelled back I love you and I want you to be safe so please come down from the tree but the boy wouldn't budge the boy yelled out I don't care if I die and I don't care if I get hurt Ain was sad he saw that the boy probably had a rough life at home and at seven year years old the boy has already given up on life Ain and Johnson waited and they waited and they waited it seemed like an eternity of waiting but they saw the boy coming down when the boy reached the bottom of the tree Ain told him you are going to stay by me for the rest of the night they wanted Liam to know that they have lost all trust in him when they were walking back to worship nights Ain and Liam had a heart to heart you H me what you said I'm not telling you this so you can feel bad about yourself I'm telling you this so you can know your words hurt my feeling I'm your camp counselor I want you to know God and feel safe you don't have to like me he said do you understand what I'm saying the boy said I understand for the rest of the week everything went well Avid and Liam were like two peas in a pod when Avid was eating lunch the boy was by his side when Avid was by the fire the boy was by his side Avid doesn't know what happened to Liam after Camp he knows that he did lose the boy and he hopes that through Camp the boy learns to know Christ and year for him the Seventh Day Adventist Church operates eight summer camps in ataska each year one of those camp out side of delham receives 2015 2015 Sabbath offerings to build real cabins and washrooms the offering that will be given will go to another Camp to keep on building cabin washrooms and showers okay let's pray God thank you for this day thank you for the gift of life and the gift of Salvation as we've gone over this Mission open our hearts the holy spirit for those to give to this camp in Alaska help the students to know what they're learning and to yearn for Christ more amen if you need a steady hand to guide you if you feel you've somehow lost your way if you feel there's no one you can turn to just look to God and pray on your knees or standing at a Crossroads laid at night or in the light of day in a crowd a closet or a chapel just look to God and praise he is there when you're searching for the answers he is there when you need a little Grace any time anywhere

to lesson N9 of Corner Stone Connections thank you so much kandra for that uh wonderful Mission story and thank you for the special item I have a wonderful panel here with me I'll start from my um left hi everyone my name is Whitney coner and welcome hello my name is Om hello my name is Natasha auya welcome hi everyone my name is Winston welcome thank you so much Winston Natasha muy and uh Whitney my name is ment and uh I'll be moderating today and our lesson is entitled getting it right and I just want to ask each of our panelists you know what went wrong why are we talking about getting it right shall we start with uh Whitney what went wrong um according to the story today the issue that went wrong was actually from the grade of the people from the leaders so it is part of money issues generational uh greed and everything that was happening during that time of Nehemiah so we'll just continue with it and we'll see how they resolved the issues and how we should not be accounted for the issues that come with money problems exactly thank you so much uh Whitney yes there were some issues going on there some money issues as well om what went wrong I think what went wrong is the people of Israel especially the rich ones they forgot that Society then just consist of them they also have to care for their their brothers who who aren't as wealthy as them so you just forgot about them and as you see they just they were greedy exactly so that yeah money issues the rich people were greedy thank you I'm Mar Winston what went wrong um for me what I feel went wrong is according to what we see in the story we see that um God's blessing wasn't lying upon his people and I feel like yeah that's what that's what went wrong yeah they lost the blessing yeah okay that's Natasha what went wrong to me what I see what went what went wrong was that there was Injustice in in the society the the rich taking being greedy and taking the little that was from the poor yeah there's the lawyer yes those was Injustice that went wrong the lesson writer um points us to uh fundamental belief number 21 we are God's Steward and the and the and the belief is is uh stewardship we are God's stewards entrusted by him with time and opportunities abilities and possessions and the blessings of the earth and its resources we are responsible to him for their proper use we acknowledge God's worship ownership by faithful service to him and our fellow human beings and by returning tithe and giving offerings for the proclamation of his gospel and the support and growth of his church stewardship is a privilege given to us by God for nurture in love and the victory over selfishness and covetousness you've heard the young people talk about greed you've heard the young people talk about money you've heard that young people talk about Injustice the way to overcome this is to become a good Steward and a story is told a very interesting story by um a gentleman called TR Roy he says that his wife actually was working in a remedial program for students and he went to visit and it was so interesting lunchtime came and it and um one of the the kids shouted that one of them did not have lunch and he was like oh my goodness why would he embarrass this person so much but interestingly what happened is a tray was quickly passed around them and everybody cut a piece of their lunch and put it on the treay and so this one child who did not had forgotten his lunch ended up with so much food he was a little embarrassed but at the same time a little excited to have so much food and Troy says why didn't I forget my lunch so that people could help me out like this and the question that lingered in his head is who gave the first food where did it all start look at that Spirit getting it right the spirit of of sharing and I'll I'll ask um Mary can you read our key text for today the key text today is from the book of Deuteronomy 15:1 it says for the poor will never cease from the land therefore I command you saying you shall open your hand wide to your brother to your poor and your needy in in your land absolutely I think as you said in in the introduction what went wrong is that people just did not care about others okay and the Bible is telling us that we should open our hands wide to our brothers and to the needy in the land let's go to what do you think what do you think um um Natasha you know we should devote ourselves to acts of kindness and Good Deeds especially to Believers or nonbelievers what do you think well what I think personally is that the acts of kindness and Good Deeds we should devote them to both the Believers and the non-believers but especially to the Believers because we need to because we if we show them the acts of kindness and the Good Deeds the non-believers looking at how we treat the our fellow Believers will be will be brought by the fa will be brought to the faith and they'll want to join in the church cuz they also want to be treated kindly and with good deeds so I think we should show it mostly to the Believers because it will draw the non-believers closer amen it will be a witness how wonderful but Galatians 610 actually is like a command what what what then what does Galatians 610 tell us Galatians 610 mhm it says therefore as we have opportunity let us do good to all especially to those who are of the household of faith exactly so so why and I think you've talked a little bit about it you know that it is a witness okay what else is there anything else that we should you know take out from that verse the okay the question here being asked is is Paul's is what Paul is asking backwards or right on well I believe it's right on because the Bible what's written in the Bible none of it is wrong first of all cuz it was in it was written by authors who were inspired by the holy spirit so what I can say is we have to yeah just as I've said before we have to show kindness to the Believers mostly cuz it draws them and also if we don't show the kindness to the Believers it will chase them away from the church and we will lose people instead of bringing people people closer to God amen amen and and also I think the other thing is we've said it's a command it's a command from God and and and and the reason that God commands it is because it help us helps us to overcome selfishness it helps us to overcome greed you know so it's it's it's not a it's it's it's not backward because if we don't do it then we we we lose our morality so that's why uh uh um we need this is one of the things we need to get right yeah and and and uh Winston maybe read for us the did you know section um okay the did you know section of today's lesson says um he who truly fears God would rather toil day and night and eat the bread of poverty than to indulge the passion for gain that oppresses the Widow and fatherless or turns the stranger from his right exactly exactly so that's uh that that that's really the essence of it because it it it it's it's um uh it's a call to do the right thing getting it right and and you know let's look at the the text this really is about Nehemiah and and um it's interesting that Nehemiah uh the lesson the lesson actually the lesson writer actually says that NE nehemiah's work on the walls and the gates of the city had progressed amidst in interpersonal challenges as well as adversity from the outside camp okay through it all the faithful governor and the prophet to the people managed to negotiate through the problems and but one particular issue surface that stands out as a lesson for all of us okay and so let's let's look at the the story in in Nehemiah chapter uh chapter 5 uh Whitney can you take us through it uh yes uh we'll just read into the story from the lesson and it says it's from Nehemiah 5: 1-13 it says now the men and their wives raised a great outcry against their fellow Jews some was saying we and our sons and our daughters are numerous in order for us to eat and to stay alive we must get grein others are saying we are mortgaging our Fields our Vineyards our homes to get grain during the fine still others were saying we have to borrow money to pay the for the king's tax and on the fields and The Vineyards although we are of the same Flesh and Blood our fellow Jews and though our children are as good as theirs yet we are to subject our sons and daughters to slavery some of our daughters have already been enslaved but we are powerless because our fails and our vard belong to others when I when I heard the outcry and these charges I was very angry I pondered them in my mind and then accused the Noels and the officials I told them you are charging your own people interest so I call I called together a large meeting to deal with them and said as far as possible we have to both as far as possible we have brought back our fellow Jews who were so to the Gentiles now you are selling your own people only for them to be sold back to us they they kept quiet because they couldn't find nothing to say so I continued for what you are doing is not right you should not walk in the fear of our God to avoid you shouldn't walk in the fear of our God to avoid the reproach of our of our Gentile enemies I and my brothers and my men are also then in the people money and grain but let us stop charging interest using back to them stop charging interest give back to them immediately their fields their vard their Olive Groves their houses and also interest for charging them 1% of the money grein new wine and Olive we will give it back they said and we will not demand anything more from them we will do as we see then I summoned the priests and made the Nobles and the offic officials take an oath to do what they had promised I shook out the folds of my robe and said in this way may God shake off their house and possessions anyone who does not keep this promise so as much so may such a person be shaken out emptied and emptied and this this was the whole assembly and this the whole assembly said amen and the and praised the Lord and the people did as they promised amen so so the lesson uh talks about uh or even the Bible talks about um nemiah being so angry in fact some some uh translations say he was indignant you know is is it sometimes Justified for us to be angry Natasha you look like you want to say something well okay being angry sometimes as I may say may lead us to sin but sometimes you're angry for the right reason let's say they take the example of Jesus when he saw people selling selling things at the temple he was angry because people are taking advantage of okay they were using the house of God in in a very terrible way so being angry can be justified as long as you're angry for the right reason and don't let it get to you cuz it can lead you to sin exactly exactly yes just to add something on what she said um I think I might not look at it as being angry but sometimes we might look at it as being somehow bold cuz we see like Nehemiah stood up out for what what was right um we see that the officials and all those people are oppressing the poor um since they had nothing literally nothing so I think I might look at it as being bold and not just being angry I like that I like that reframing Winson that it's really not about being angry as much as it is being bold to call out Injustice okay especially against leadership and you know when when the leaders are actually cuz they had they were really doing some wrong things they they they they they took the land and they were charging the fellow Israelites High interests and it was becoming very expensive they were not able to feed their own they had mortgaged their land they had sold their children and it was it was a nightmare but nemiah said no this has to stop and I want to ask Natasha you know um what is more surprising the horrible slavery the rich engaged in or the fact that they obey Obed the command of God and immediately made it right um I think they knew they were wrong from the start so they had no cause of saying no you see it was not like that from the start they already knew they were wrong so when it was pointed out to them they knew they had to correct it so there was no room for complaining to them so it was not as shocking as CU they already knew what they were doing was not right they just needed someone to point it out for them cuz it's like a conscious thing they were saying many people are doing it so I'm not alone so if I do it in a group they are not seeing it as such a bad thing so when it was pointed out they saw that yeah we are doing something wrong let's just correct it before more people start noticing it exactly I think I like what Winston said that what they needed was a bold Nehemiah to say no no no no no this is not right and then they their conscience was pricked and they decided to change I mean they they you know the the how what had they disobeyed what had God told them marri you know what God had said to them that they had to do to avoid a situation where the the poor were too poor uh every third year they charged a TI that went to the poor exactly Moses's time yeah every third year I think it was a it was such a great lesson that every third year they would take a tithe that was specifically dedicated towards towards the poor and every seventh year what were they supposed to do every seventh year as well you know every seventh year they were to leave the land fallow so that anybody who was walking by actually when you read the book of Ruth you see it anybody who was walking by could actually glean and take they were not supposed to take everything from the from the the the uh the Harvest so God has made a provision you know uh and and I think the the the the next question I would ask here to um Omi if we come now to um the positive way the people of God responded to him nehemiah's challenge is comforting is there a cause of an you know a case or a cause for an opportunity to serve someone in need you know and and and what what can we do what can the teenagers do to to take some action against get I mean to ensure that they get it right in our society today today I think in the context of this story it's mainly talking about you know people who are struggling mainly financially so I would say as a teenager today what you can do if someone if you're working on the street and someone asks you for money I don't think I don't just say no before you think about it you know it can become like a habit just say no because you're thinking you want to go and get something like you should consider this other person's needs and I think go volunteer work is important cuz I mean not everyone has money to give out but then we all have been given time by God on this Earth so you can volunteer in places where you know in children homes or things like that where you can help people wow wow that's beautiful yes I like that like you know cuz our first Instinct normally is just to say no I don't I don't I'm not giving these people anything uh but then I like that that you can volunteer in a children's home in a hospital in a school many of you are here are very privileged you can volunteer in a school like you've just finished your exam somewhere isn't it instead of sitting home and just enjoying this whole season and saying you don't have any poor people around you you might be able to go to a school and just do a little teaching what was your best subject I take C cam I could have used you as a teacher so I'm sure there's so many people there's so many places where you can actually volunteer and teach uh uh as you have said so so uh Whitney what is the what is the message God has for you in this story um for me the message is you when you when we started you said about stewardship where we take care of the things that we have and not just holding things for ourselves we might also share our opportunities our talents it's not just about the financial gains but also the heart of volunteering heart of giving heart of sharing it's not us us us in this context it's about how do we help others how do we do this as a community yeah I think that's such a good point because one of the things that the lesson was asking us to reflect on is the we the US how many times did you find that you know uh uh the lesson used uh we our and Us in this text alone from verse 1 to 15 used it 15 times where the people are just saying us we our things you taking our things you want our things it's because of us you are getting rich somewhere else yes so there's an element of community as well that even as a community and I think as Asia said we can as every Community even as every action unit in Sabbath school we can find a way to be of help um to somebody else so what um Winston you have anything to add on the out of the story um I can speak on the prophets and Kings but yes let's let's let's look at that the the the Patriots and Kings part I think it's the the um the lesson is is is very good it's actually asking us you know to to read spiritual prophecy uh chapter 54 and um you know to connect it to to further Insight you know yeah yeah so chapter 54 on the prophets and Kings um the title is a rebuke against against extortion and it's actually what you see basically in the whole of the story and basically what's in the chapter is just everything that you've mentioned in the story and what I'd likely to I'd like to specifically point out is uh um the message time that is being spoken out to us here um where we see that L G white is connecting the way nemiah um and others purchased back their people from slavery slavery we see that um the Jews and the people in the low classes they are undergoing this hard time where they they were being forced to borrow on very large interests and connecting this story to how Ellen dght wants us to see it we see that um she says she tells us that we were all deps uh to Divine justice but we had nothing which to pay the debt then the Son of God who ped us paid the price for our Redemption he became poor that through his poverty we might be reached so it is through this selfless act that Jesus took that we were we receive this Redemption yeah somehow so Grace was given to us freely and we should extend the same to others but there is also an element of the Love of Money I think the spirit of Prophecy talks about the Love of Money what what lesson do we learn Mary from this story about The Love of Money the Love of Money I think see is the love of man is the root of all evils I think when you love something you know that much that like things like money it's going to like blind you to the the problems it's causing you're just following money you're going to forget that all this person that you're taking the money from that's also a human being cuz only focusing on the money and not you know the actual state of things I think the love of money in this story it's what caused these people to sin exactly exactly the Love of Money caused these people to sin so how can we tame uh ourselves uh Whitney so that we don't end up in the same situation you know um I think as just as the Lord said to them that every third year share it's not about it's not bad to earn money but it's about being content with what you have so if you had that contentment in ourselves there's no need for us to reach out for somebody it's your hard work you earn what you g work and earn what you have not work earn and get someone else's yes so so we we should avoid I mean let's let's let's avoid corruption let's avoid taking things which are not ours let us be more generous with the things that we have and the lesson the lesson continues to say that stewardship is a privilege given to us by God I think this is one of the key lessons that for nurture in love and the victory over selfishness and covetousness stewards rejoice in the blessings that come to others as a result of their faithfulness that's our fundamental belief number 21 so today's Bible verse as well asserts that we should be good to all people you know and and what might our church be like Winston if we started with Paul's words to be good to all people especially with to Believers you know how can the church be like you know um for me I feel like you know the church is supposed to be like let's say um it's supposed to be what what what motivates us you know to like be that person who like is selfless and something like that you know it's the church that brings people together and it's kind of what unites us to you know practice in the act of worshiping God and spreading this gospel and that so I feel like the church should be the light through which others even if they're unbelievers should get this you know the message yeah the church would be be more of a light but Natasha I also want you to emphasize based on what you said that we will attract more Believers I mean what will the church be like if we practice what you know the the a tith every third year every seventh year we we we we leave the Harvest to those who are poor what would the church be like okay how I see it the church will be will be will be extended more people will be brought into into the church and yeah we'll be able to to spread the word to more parts of the world to spread the word to more parts of the world exactly there would be more love isn't it there would be more love to go around there would be more joy there would be um more sharing there people would be happier in the church if if if we obeyed really the command of god so let's go to the punch lines um Natasha do you want to take us through the punch lines sure the first punch line comes from Deuteronomy 15: 7 to10 and it says if anyone is poor among your fellow Israelites in any of the towns of the land the Lord your God is giving you do not be hard-hearted or tightfisted toward them rather be open-handed and freely lend them whatever they need give generously to them and do so without a grudging heart then because of this the Lord your God will bless you in all your work and in everything you put your hand to the second one is Galatians 6: 2 and 10 and it says carry each other's burdens and in this way you will fulfill the law of Christ therefore as we have opportunity let us do good to all people especially to those who belong to the family of Believers and the last one comes from the book of Acts chapter 2 verse 1 and Chap and verse 42 and 47 it says when the day of Pentecost came they were all together together in one place they devoted themselves to the apostles teaching and to Fellowship to the breaking of bread and to prayer every day they continued to meet together in the temple courts they broke bread in their homes and ate together with glad and sincere Hearts praising God and enjoying the favor of all the people and the Lord added to their number daily those who were being saved so what I can say here the verse that I feel has has has talked to me here is Deuteronomy 15: 7 and 10 the part will give generously to them and do so without a grudging heart then because of this the Lord your God will bless you in all your work and in everything you put your hand to God doesn't want us to help people just because he said so go and help people he wants us to do it like willingly he wants you to go help someone willingly and that's his joy that you go help someone cuz you know what what's right you know that you have to help someone and not you're not doing it just because he said so it's because you know how it will help you too and God will bless you he will add to you add to you the work of your hands and yeah that's what I can say that's that's the verse that that really captured you I like that Winston you look like this what what really captured you here um in today's punch length I think the verse that stood out to me is Galatians 6 2:10 uh I'll just repeat it again it says carry each other's burdens and in this way you will fulfill the law of Christ therefore as have opportunity let us do good to all people especially to those who belong to the family of Believers um when I look at this verse it tells me that um there's that Unity uh among God's people and it calls us to like carry each other's burdens you know as for example here in church um we can't just look at someone who is having a hard time particularly having let's say let's say he or she is just struggling we can't just lay low and assume nothing is happening it calls us to like reach out and do something yeah and getting it right getting it right fulfilling the law of God what punched you Whitney um for me it's the same as wistone but mine is a capture from that between the verses it was from verse 6 and 7 it says let him who is taught the word share in all good things with him who teaches do not be deceived God is Not mocked for whatever a man SS that is what will he will rap so it's just about habit if you have a habit of doing good it will naturally come to you and it it will be easier for us to teach what we know you can't teach what you don't have so if we are good in our words in our deeds in everything it becomes an habit and teaching it is it's easier and God knows our heart cuz if it's it's an habit it's not something that ah today let me do good because somebody seeing me it just comes naturally cuz you are usually good at what you're doing yeah you got it right thank you what punched you it's the verse from Acts chapter 2 h I like this part of every day they continue to meet together in the temple courts they broke bread in their homes and ate together with glad and sincere Hearts praising God and enjoying the favor of all the people and the Lord added to their number daily those who are being saved this part it's reminding us that giving and sharing these are not burdens that God has placed on us it's it's a blessing that you're able to get something you share it with you know your fellow Believers as you're happy cuz this they that they were glad and happy and they enjoyed the favor of all people not just Christians so as you're doing that as Natasha said it's going to draw people to the T the church as they had favor with them and that's how the Lord added daily to the people who are being saved I really like that I really like that element of that these are not B it's not a burden that God has put on us it is something that is a blessing for us and and and just as we close I want us to look at um uh um nemiah and the fact that you know um there's a wonderful section over here if I can find it yes nehemiah's role in Judea was not simply that of a general contractor he functioned as a spiritual change agent and the locals responded well to his leadership nemiah had brought a radical transformation to the region and the attitudes and perceptions uh of the people had about god Jehovah okay so the timing of this story is difficult to Mark in the context of the rebuilding of the walls and Gates it is possible that this story took place during the building process but it is but it is hard to say Ellen White describes the incident in this week's lesson as taking place during the rebuilding process so it just shows I think the courage and boldness of n Maya and you know as we as we end I just want you to you know each one think about who else in the Bible did we see standing up with so much courage and boldness Winston who comes to mind um I think just a quick reference I'd say um someone like David David David definitely yeah where he like he was he was B enough and courageous just to Bear the burden of being king of Israel and taking those um participating those Wars and just standing out for his people yes he did bringing down Goliath yes Natasha who comes to mind uh who comes to mind is I can say Daniel Daniel cuz he's too up to the king saying that he won't eat the food that they were being provided with because they knew he knew that it was not good for them and yeah yes Daniel did yes and and he he he he he refused to bow down he refused the graen image you know if you put me in a lion's then I don't know I'm not sure I might think but that was the courage of Daniel yes so I think Elijah comes to mind Elijah is a good one yes he used to go and S sending up to the king king of Israel who hated him and hated the God that he served and I think that just takes it takes a lot of courage and also the contest at camel just standing alone against hundreds yeah that takes a lot of Courage Whitney who comes to mind uh for me it was Esther cuz Esther knew also her people needed help so she didn't go to the temple and just sit go ah I've already arrived so I don't need to think about the others but she took the time and told the king about her request for her people so yeah Esther can comes to mind yeah they they're beautiful Bible characters that stand out there you know uh Esther Elijah Daniel David Noah Moses the we we there's so much to choose from really and and Nehemiah now so so in get about getting it right you know getting it get getting it right and and and and and nehemiah's anger and nehemiah's call to the people the people's repentance and you know it is my prayer that that we will we will we will have courage to stand up for what is right we will seek Justice we will give and to avoid uh um poverty or more importantly we will not take advantage of the poor amongst but as we close then let me just ask each one of us to just give a parting short Whitney what's your takeaway uh for me there a quote I read that if you see something do something do something so for me it was an encouragement from Nehemiah that nemiah didn't only do something in public but also in private he did where he knew that what they were doing was wrong he called it called it out and it was not that he saw it wrong cuz he was not part of it he saw it wrong cuz it was wrong you see some people only know it's wrong when you're not part of the plan so if he knew it was wrong cuz he was not part of the plan but also his character knew that what they were doing it was not right so he spoke out if you see something do something if you see something say something do something very good Whitney yes I'm wor I think what what I'm leaving this lesson with is caring for your the people around you had a quote that said Christianity isn't about isn't thinking less about yourself it's about thinking about yourself less so now these people after they were corrected by nemiah they started considering the people around them I think that's something that we should all take into consideration thank you so much it's that sense of humility you know so just not thinking so much of yourself but considering others thank you so much om Mar yes Winston what's your takeaway um what I take home today uh what I've learned today I've quite learned a lot but I'll just mention a few um first um it's mentioned in the further insights where l g tells us that by Deeds of liberality toward his poor we may prove the sincerity of our gra of our gratitude for the mercy extended to us absolutely I mean when we look at everything that God has done in our lives and it's it's so much that we can't compare it to that act of liberality towards the poor like it should just be something like to just I mean prove that we actually gr great we actually grateful grateful for whatever God has done to us absolutely absolutely that extension would would come from our gratitude Natasha well this story reminds me of a quote I once read it said if you can't see the light be the light amen here nemiah shows a really great example that when he saw the poor were being mistreated he didn't sit back and say oh no I can't do anything now he became the light and went and told the leaders that what you're doing to the poor is wrong so what my takeaway is that when you see something is not going the way it's supposed to be take action cuz you know what is Right amen wow what a beautiful way to wrap up I've learned so much from these young people I'm so blessed that the the the teens are you know are energized for Jesus and they want to be like Nehemiah they are going to see wrong and they're going to do wrong they're going to show care they're going to be the light you know and and and they're going to show gratitude by helping others thank you so much uh for um being a part of this lesson and I pray that each one of us will get it right uh Omar can you pray with us let's close with a word of prayer Lord want to thank you that you're able to come here and go through this lesson Lord please help all those and even us who have who are going to watch this lesson that you able to keep something in our hearts Lord and to put what we have learned into action help us to care about the people in our lives more not just about those who are close to us but to everyone around us and as we go please Lord help us to go and even today to practice what you have learned just name we pray amen amen God bless you thank you for being with us

[26.0s] Mission comes straight out of Alaska
[28.6s] it's a story of a camp count who lost a
[31.0s] boy 7-year-old Liam ran up and down the
[34.3s] seventh day ADV Adventist summer camp in
[37.1s] Alaska it was hard to put the boy to bed
[40.1s] and it was even harder to know the boy's
[42.9s] whereabouts Midway through the week Liam
[45.6s] ran away the trouble began when his camp
[48.9s] counselor aan confronted the boy you
[51.8s] can't just run away you have to tell
[54.2s] your Camp counselors where you are
[56.5s] because if you get lost it'll be our
[59.2s] problem
[60.6s] Midway of Ain speaking Liam ran away Ain
[65.3s] and other staff of the camp began to
[67.7s] look for the boy they searched and they
[70.0s] searched but still no aen they prayed
[73.8s] but still no aen iin decided to go to
[77.3s] the camp director and tell him I've lost
[79.8s] a boy and I don't know where he is when
[82.1s] all of them were about to give up about
[84.3s] 40 minutes later Liam appeared he came
[87.7s] out of some bushes with a huge smile on
[90.2s] his face but aan wasn't smiling
[93.6s] back but aan wasn't smiling back Avan
[98.2s] yelled at the boy you can't just run
[100.2s] away this is not okay but the boy's
[103.0s] smile dropped again while avin was
[106.3s] speaking Liam ran away but this time
[110.1s] Avid knew where he was Avid in another
[112.6s] camp counselor Jacob followed him into
[115.0s] the woods they saw him scramble up a
[118.0s] tree John John on the other camp
[120.8s] counselor called up to him and said come
[123.6s] down we would love it if you come down
[125.3s] and don't get hurt Ain from the bushes
[128.4s] looked up and yelled I hate aan I wish
[131.3s] you were dead Ain was shocked by what
[134.0s] the boy said but he was determined to
[136.3s] show the boy God's love so he yelled
[138.8s] back I love you and I want you to be
[141.0s] safe so please come down from the tree
[143.7s] but the boy wouldn't budge the boy
[145.9s] yelled out I don't care if I die and I
[148.0s] don't care if I get hurt
[150.6s] Ain was sad he saw that the boy probably
[153.8s] had a rough life at home and at seven
[156.5s] year years old the boy has already given
[159.0s] up on
[160.2s] life Ain and Johnson waited and they
[163.8s] waited and they waited it seemed like an
[167.0s] eternity of waiting but they saw the boy
[170.3s] coming down when the boy reached the
[172.6s] bottom of the
[173.8s] tree Ain told him you are going to stay
[176.7s] by me for the rest of the night they
[179.2s] wanted Liam to know that they have lost
[181.7s] all trust in
[183.4s] him when they were walking back to
[185.8s] worship nights Ain and Liam had a heart
[188.7s] to heart you H me what you said I'm not
[191.7s] telling you this so you can feel bad
[193.3s] about yourself I'm telling you this so
[195.2s] you can know your words hurt my feeling
[198.1s] I'm your camp counselor I want you to
[200.2s] know God and feel safe you don't have to
[202.7s] like me he said do you understand what
[204.8s] I'm saying the boy said I understand for
[208.8s] the rest of the week everything went
[210.7s] well Avid and Liam were like two peas in
[213.7s] a pod when Avid was eating lunch the boy
[216.6s] was by his side when Avid was by the
[219.1s] fire the boy was by his side Avid
[222.2s] doesn't know what happened to Liam after
[224.0s] Camp he knows that he did lose the boy
[226.6s] and he hopes that through Camp the boy
[229.5s] learns to know Christ and year for him
[232.7s] the Seventh Day Adventist Church
[234.3s] operates eight summer camps in ataska
[237.2s] each year one of those camp out side of

[492.3s] Corner Stone Connections thank you so
[494.3s] much kandra for that uh wonderful
[496.0s] Mission story and thank you for the
[497.6s] special item I have a wonderful panel
[500.5s] here with me I'll start from my um left
[504.6s] hi everyone my name is Whitney coner and
[507.4s] welcome
[509.6s] hello my name is
[512.3s] Om hello my name is Natasha auya welcome
[517.1s] hi everyone my name is Winston welcome
[520.4s] thank you so much Winston
[522.9s] Natasha muy and uh Whitney my name is
[526.2s] ment and uh I'll be moderating today and
[529.5s] our lesson is entitled getting it right
[533.0s] and I just want to ask each of our
[534.5s] panelists you
[536.2s] know what went wrong why are we talking
[538.8s] about getting it right shall we start
[540.9s] with uh Whitney what went wrong um
[544.8s] according to the story today the issue
[547.9s] that went wrong was actually from the
[550.1s] grade of the people from the leaders so
[553.2s] it is part of money issues
[557.2s] generational uh greed and everything
[560.2s] that was happening during that time of
[562.2s] Nehemiah so we'll just continue with it
[565.0s] and we'll see how they resolved the
[567.2s] issues and how we should not be
[570.9s] accounted for the issues that come with
[573.8s] money problems exactly thank you so much
[576.8s] uh Whitney yes there were some issues
[579.7s] going on there some money issues as well
[582.3s] om what went wrong I think what went
[585.5s] wrong is the people of Israel especially
[589.6s] the rich ones they
[591.2s] forgot that Society then just consist of
[594.4s] them they also have to care for their
[596.4s] their brothers who who aren't as wealthy
[598.8s] as them so you just forgot about them
[601.1s] and as you see they just they were
[603.6s] greedy exactly so that yeah money issues
[607.6s] the rich people were greedy thank you
[609.8s] I'm Mar Winston what went wrong um for
[613.6s] me what I feel went wrong is according
[617.3s] to what we see in the story we see that
[620.0s] um God's blessing wasn't lying upon his
[623.6s] people and I feel like yeah that's what
[626.6s] that's what went wrong yeah they lost
[628.3s] the blessing yeah okay that's Natasha
[631.0s] what went wrong to me what I see what
[633.6s] went what went wrong was that there was
[638.0s] Injustice in in the society the the rich
[643.6s] taking being greedy and taking the
[646.9s] little that was from the poor yeah
[650.6s] there's the lawyer yes those was
[652.2s] Injustice that went wrong the lesson
[655.1s] writer um points us to uh fundamental
[659.3s] belief number 21 we are God's Steward
[662.5s] and the and the and the belief is is uh
[664.7s] stewardship we are God's stewards
[666.6s] entrusted by him with time and
[668.9s] opportunities abilities and possessions
[671.9s] and the blessings of the earth and its
[674.0s] resources we are responsible to him for
[676.6s] their proper use we acknowledge God's
[679.0s] worship ownership by faithful service to
[682.6s] him and our fellow human beings and by
[685.5s] returning tithe and giving offerings for
[687.8s] the proclamation of his gospel
[689.9s] and the support and growth of his church
[693.4s] stewardship is a privilege given to us
[696.4s] by God for nurture in love and the
[699.4s] victory over selfishness and
[702.1s] covetousness you've heard the young
[703.6s] people talk about greed you've heard the
[705.3s] young people talk about money you've
[707.4s] heard that young people talk about
[708.9s] Injustice the way to overcome this is to
[712.5s] become a good Steward and a story is
[715.6s] told a very interesting story by um a
[718.4s] gentleman called TR Roy he says that his
[720.4s] wife actually was working in a remedial
[723.0s] program for students and he went to
[725.6s] visit and it was so interesting
[728.4s] lunchtime came and it and um one of the
[732.1s] the kids shouted that one of them did
[735.5s] not have lunch and he was like oh my
[738.6s] goodness why would he embarrass this
[740.2s] person so much but interestingly what
[742.9s] happened is a tray was quickly passed
[745.1s] around them and everybody cut a piece of
[748.1s] their lunch and put it on the treay and
[750.7s] so this one child who did not had
[752.6s] forgotten his lunch ended up with so
[754.6s] much food he was a little embarrassed
[757.1s] but at the same time a little excited to
[758.6s] have so much food and Troy says why
[761.7s] didn't I forget my lunch so that people
[764.0s] could help me out like this and the
[766.2s] question that lingered in his head is
[768.8s] who gave the first
[771.5s] food where did it all start look at that
[775.3s] Spirit getting it right the spirit of of
[779.7s] sharing and I'll I'll ask um Mary can
[783.3s] you read our key text for today the key
[786.7s] text today is from the book of
[788.2s] Deuteronomy
[790.2s] 15:1 it says for the poor will never
[793.2s] cease from the land therefore I command
[795.7s] you saying you shall open your hand wide
[797.9s] to your brother to your poor and your
[800.8s] needy in in your land absolutely I think
[803.5s] as you said in in the introduction what
[805.3s] went wrong is that people just did not
[807.7s] care about others okay and the Bible is
[810.2s] telling us that we should open our hands
[812.9s] wide to our brothers and to the needy in
[816.5s] the land let's go to what do you think
[819.2s] what do you think um um Natasha you
[822.8s] know we should devote ourselves to acts
[826.0s] of kindness and Good Deeds especially to
[829.0s] Believers or
[830.7s] nonbelievers what do you
[832.7s] think well what I think personally is
[837.3s] that the acts of kindness and Good Deeds
[840.8s] we should devote them to both the
[844.3s] Believers and the
[846.2s] non-believers but especially to the
[848.4s] Believers because we need to because we
[852.0s] if we show them the acts of kindness and
[855.8s] the Good Deeds the non-believers looking
[859.4s] at how we treat the our fellow Believers
[862.6s] will be will be brought by the fa will
[865.9s] be brought to the faith and they'll want
[868.7s] to join in the church cuz they also want
[870.3s] to be treated kindly and with good deeds
[873.4s] so I think we should show it mostly to
[876.3s] the Believers because it will draw the
[878.7s] non-believers closer amen it will be a
[881.4s] witness how wonderful but Galatians 610
[884.6s] actually is like a command what what
[887.1s] what then what does Galatians 610 tell
[889.8s] us Galatians 610
[894.1s] mhm it says therefore as we have
[898.2s] opportunity let us do good to all
[901.2s] especially to those who are of the
[903.8s] household of faith exactly so so why and
[907.7s] I think you've talked a little bit about
[909.0s] it you know that it is a witness okay
[911.9s] what else is there anything else that we
[913.5s] should you know take out from that
[916.2s] verse the okay the question here being
[920.0s] asked is is Paul's is what Paul is
[923.3s] asking backwards or right on well I
[926.4s] believe it's right on because the Bible
[930.0s] what's written in the Bible none of it
[931.8s] is wrong first of all cuz it was in it
[935.6s] was written by authors who were inspired
[937.4s] by the holy spirit so what I can say
[941.9s] is we have to yeah just as I've said
[945.0s] before we have to show kindness to the
[947.1s] Believers mostly cuz it draws them and
[950.6s] also if we don't show the kindness to
[952.7s] the Believers it will chase them away
[955.2s] from the church and we will lose people
[957.9s] instead of bringing people people closer
[959.6s] to God amen amen and and also I think
[961.8s] the other thing is we've said it's a
[963.6s] command it's a command from God and and
[966.3s] and and the reason that God commands it
[968.7s] is because it help us helps us to
[970.4s] overcome
[971.5s] selfishness it helps us to overcome
[974.4s] greed you know so it's it's it's not a
[977.1s] it's it's it's not backward because if
[979.2s] we don't do it then we we we lose our
[983.7s] morality so that's why uh uh um we need
[987.1s] this is one of the things we need to get
[988.5s] right
[989.5s] yeah and and and uh Winston maybe read
[992.4s] for us the did you know section um okay
[996.2s] the did you know section of today's
[997.7s] lesson says um he who truly fears God
[1001.7s] would rather toil day and night and eat
[1004.1s] the bread of poverty than to indulge the
[1007.1s] passion for gain that oppresses the
[1009.2s] Widow and fatherless or turns the
[1011.5s] stranger from his right exactly exactly
[1015.2s] so that's uh that that that's really the
[1017.2s] essence of it because it
[1020.0s] it it it's it's um uh it's a call to do
[1025.0s] the right thing getting it right and and
[1027.7s] you know let's look at the the text this
[1029.8s] really is about Nehemiah and and um it's
[1032.8s] interesting that Nehemiah uh the lesson
[1035.9s] the lesson actually the lesson writer
[1038.3s] actually says that NE nehemiah's work on
[1040.3s] the walls and the gates of the city had
[1043.2s] progressed amidst in interpersonal
[1045.3s] challenges as well as adversity from the
[1047.8s] outside camp
[1049.4s] okay through it all the faithful
[1051.8s] governor and the prophet to the people
[1054.0s] managed to negotiate through the
[1056.8s] problems and but one particular issue
[1060.0s] surface that stands out as a lesson for
[1062.5s] all of us okay and so let's let's look
[1066.1s] at the the story in in Nehemiah chapter
[1069.7s] uh chapter 5 uh Whitney can you take us
[1072.7s] through it uh yes uh we'll just read
[1076.5s] into the story from the lesson and it
[1079.0s] says it's from Nehemiah 5: 1-13 it says
[1084.3s] now the men and their wives raised a
[1086.5s] great outcry against their fellow Jews
[1089.1s] some was saying we and our sons and our
[1091.9s] daughters are numerous in order for us
[1094.9s] to eat and to stay alive we must get
[1097.2s] grein others are saying we are
[1100.7s] mortgaging our Fields our Vineyards our
[1103.3s] homes to get grain during the fine still
[1106.5s] others were saying we have to borrow
[1108.8s] money to pay the for the king's tax and
[1112.4s] on the fields and The Vineyards although
[1115.2s] we are of the same Flesh and Blood our
[1117.9s] fellow Jews and though our children are
[1121.2s] as good as theirs yet we are to subject
[1124.8s] our sons and daughters to slavery some
[1127.4s] of our daughters have already been
[1129.6s] enslaved but we are powerless because
[1132.0s] our fails and our vard belong to others
[1136.0s] when I when I heard the outcry
[1139.5s] and these charges I was very angry I
[1142.7s] pondered them in my mind and then
[1145.8s] accused the Noels and the officials I
[1148.5s] told them you are charging your own
[1151.7s] people interest so I call I called
[1155.7s] together a large meeting to deal with
[1158.3s] them and said as far as possible we have
[1161.7s] to both as far as possible we have
[1165.8s] brought back our fellow Jews who were so
[1168.9s] to the Gentiles now you are selling your
[1171.0s] own people only for them to be sold back
[1173.3s] to us they they kept quiet because they
[1177.2s] couldn't find nothing to say so I
[1179.6s] continued for what you are doing is not
[1182.9s] right you should not walk in the fear of
[1185.5s] our God to avoid you shouldn't walk in
[1189.1s] the fear of our God to avoid the
[1191.3s] reproach of our of our Gentile enemies I
[1194.9s] and my brothers and my men are also then
[1198.8s] in the people money and grain but let us
[1201.8s] stop charging interest using back to
[1206.1s] them stop charging interest give back to
[1209.4s] them immediately their fields their vard
[1212.1s] their Olive Groves their houses and also
[1215.4s] interest for charging them 1% of the
[1218.8s] money grein new wine and Olive we will
[1222.8s] give it back they said and we will not
[1225.6s] demand anything more from them we will
[1227.9s] do as we see
[1229.4s] then I summoned the priests and made the
[1232.0s] Nobles and the offic officials take an
[1235.5s] oath to do what they had promised I
[1238.2s] shook out the folds of my robe and said
[1242.1s] in this way may God shake off their
[1245.7s] house and possessions anyone who does
[1248.6s] not keep this promise
[1250.8s] so as much so may such a person be
[1255.1s] shaken out emptied and emptied and this
[1258.6s] this was the whole assembly and this the
[1261.0s] whole assembly said amen and the and
[1264.3s] praised the Lord and the people did as
[1266.9s] they promised amen so so the lesson uh
[1270.7s] talks about uh or even the Bible talks
[1273.7s] about um nemiah being so angry in fact
[1276.5s] some some uh translations say he was
[1279.0s] indignant you know is is it sometimes
[1282.3s] Justified for us to be
[1284.5s] angry Natasha you look like you want to
[1287.1s] say something
[1291.3s] well okay being angry sometimes as I may
[1296.3s] say may lead us to sin but sometimes
[1300.0s] you're angry for the right reason let's
[1302.4s] say they take the example of Jesus when
[1305.3s] he saw people selling selling things at
[1308.2s] the temple he was angry because people
[1310.9s] are taking advantage
[1313.3s] of okay they were using the house of God
[1317.4s] in in a very terrible way so being angry
[1322.2s] can be
[1323.5s] justified as long as you're angry for
[1326.9s] the right reason and don't let it get to
[1329.5s] you cuz it can lead you to sin exactly
[1332.6s] exactly yes just to add something on
[1335.2s] what she said um I think I might not
[1338.4s] look at it as being angry but sometimes
[1342.0s] we might look at it as being somehow
[1344.6s] bold cuz we see like Nehemiah stood up
[1348.6s] out for what what was right um we see
[1351.2s] that the officials and all those people
[1353.7s] are oppressing the poor um since they
[1357.0s] had nothing literally nothing so I think
[1359.4s] I might look at it as being bold and not
[1363.1s] just being angry I like that I like that
[1365.4s] reframing Winson that it's really not
[1367.0s] about being angry as much as it is being
[1368.5s] bold to call out Injustice okay
[1371.4s] especially against leadership and you
[1373.2s] know when when the leaders are actually
[1375.3s] cuz they had they were really doing some
[1378.0s] wrong things they they they they they
[1380.2s] took the land and they were charging the
[1382.0s] fellow Israelites High interests and it
[1385.0s] was becoming very expensive they were
[1386.9s] not able to feed their own they had
[1389.8s] mortgaged their land they had sold their
[1392.0s] children and it was it was a nightmare
[1395.4s] but nemiah said no this has to stop and
[1398.3s] I want to ask Natasha you know um what
[1402.0s] is more
[1403.3s] surprising the horrible slavery the rich
[1406.2s] engaged in or the fact that they obey
[1408.5s] Obed the command of God and
[1411.2s] immediately made it
[1413.2s] right um I think they knew they were
[1416.6s] wrong from the start so they had
[1419.4s] no cause of saying no you see it was not
[1423.4s] like that from the start they already
[1425.4s] knew they were wrong so when it was
[1428.0s] pointed out to them they knew they had
[1430.5s] to correct it so there was no room for
[1432.4s] complaining to them so it was not as
[1435.0s] shocking as CU they already knew what
[1439.0s] they were doing was not right they just
[1440.9s] needed someone to point it out for them
[1443.1s] cuz it's like a conscious thing they
[1445.3s] were saying many people are doing it so
[1448.0s] I'm not alone so if I do it in a group
[1450.8s] they are not seeing it as such a bad
[1453.8s] thing so when it was pointed out they
[1456.5s] saw
[1458.5s] that yeah we are doing something wrong
[1461.6s] let's just correct it before more people
[1464.1s] start noticing it exactly I think I like
[1466.7s] what Winston said that what they needed
[1468.7s] was a bold Nehemiah to say no no no no
[1471.0s] no this is not right and then they their
[1473.4s] conscience was pricked and they decided
[1475.5s] to change I mean they they you know the
[1478.2s] the how what had
[1480.4s] they disobeyed what had God told them
[1483.7s] marri you know what God had said to them
[1485.5s] that they had to do to avoid a situation
[1487.7s] where the the poor were too
[1489.6s] poor uh every third year they charged a
[1493.4s] TI that went to the poor exactly Moses's
[1496.2s] time yeah every third year I think it
[1498.4s] was a it was such a great lesson that
[1500.3s] every third year they would take a tithe
[1502.8s] that was specifically dedicated towards
[1505.8s] towards the poor and every seventh year
[1508.1s] what were they supposed to do every
[1509.3s] seventh year as well you know every
[1511.8s] seventh year they were to leave the land
[1513.6s] fallow so that anybody who was walking
[1516.5s] by actually when you read the book of
[1518.2s] Ruth you see it anybody who was walking
[1520.5s] by could actually glean and take they
[1522.5s] were not supposed to take everything
[1524.2s] from the from the the the uh the Harvest
[1528.4s] so God has made a provision you know uh
[1531.7s] and and I think the the the the next
[1534.9s] question I would ask here to um Omi if
[1539.0s] we come now
[1541.8s] to um the positive way the people of God
[1544.8s] responded to him nehemiah's challenge is
[1548.0s] comforting is there a cause of an you
[1551.5s] know a case or a cause for an
[1552.9s] opportunity to serve someone in need you
[1556.3s] know and and and what what can we do
[1558.9s] what can the teenagers do to to take
[1561.4s] some action against get I mean to ensure
[1564.1s] that they get it right in our society
[1567.4s] today today I think in the context of
[1570.8s] this story it's mainly talking about you
[1573.1s] know people who are struggling mainly
[1575.9s] financially so I would say as a teenager
[1579.1s] today what you can do if someone if
[1582.6s] you're working on the street and someone
[1583.7s] asks you for money I don't think I don't
[1586.6s] just say no before you think about it
[1588.3s] you know it can become like a habit just
[1590.7s] say no because you're thinking you want
[1593.0s] to go and get something like you should
[1595.1s] consider this other person's
[1596.9s] needs and I think go volunteer work is
[1599.8s] important cuz I mean not everyone has
[1602.2s] money to give out but then we all have
[1604.0s] been given time by God on this Earth so
[1606.7s] you can volunteer in places where you
[1609.0s] know in children homes or things like
[1610.9s] that where you can help
[1613.0s] people wow wow that's beautiful yes I
[1615.8s] like that like you know cuz our first
[1618.4s] Instinct normally is just to say no I
[1620.5s] don't I don't I'm not giving these
[1621.9s] people anything uh but then I like that
[1624.9s] that you can volunteer in a children's
[1627.3s] home in a hospital in a school many of
[1630.7s] you are here are very privileged you can
[1633.1s] volunteer in a school like you've just
[1634.8s] finished your exam somewhere isn't it
[1636.8s] instead of sitting home and just
[1638.0s] enjoying this whole season and saying
[1640.0s] you don't have any poor people around
[1641.5s] you you might be able to go to a school
[1644.0s] and just do a little teaching what was
[1646.0s] your best subject I take C
[1649.4s] cam I could have used you as a teacher
[1652.4s] so I'm sure there's so many people
[1653.9s] there's so many places where you can
[1655.3s] actually volunteer and teach uh uh as
[1657.5s] you have said so so uh Whitney what is
[1660.6s] the what is the message God has for you
[1663.2s] in this
[1664.4s] story um for me the message is you when
[1668.4s] you when we started you said about
[1669.9s] stewardship where we take care of the
[1672.2s] things that we have and not just holding
[1675.6s] things for ourselves we might also share
[1678.3s] our opportunities our talents it's not
[1681.0s] just about the financial gains but also
[1685.2s] the heart of volunteering heart of
[1688.1s] giving heart of sharing it's not us us
[1691.2s] us in this context it's about how do we
[1694.3s] help others how do we do this as a
[1696.9s] community yeah I think that's such a
[1698.8s] good point because one of the things
[1700.3s] that the lesson was asking us to reflect
[1701.8s] on is the we the US how many times did
[1704.5s] you find that you know uh uh the lesson
[1707.4s] used uh we our and Us in this text alone
[1711.7s] from verse 1 to 15 used it 15 times
[1716.6s] where the people are just saying us we
[1719.7s] our things you taking our things you
[1723.0s] want our things it's because of us you
[1726.2s] are getting rich somewhere else yes so
[1729.4s] there's an element of community as well
[1731.6s] that even as a community and I think as
[1733.3s] Asia said we can as every Community even
[1736.5s] as every action unit in Sabbath school
[1739.0s] we can find a way to be of help um to
[1742.9s] somebody else so what um Winston you
[1747.0s] have anything to add on the out of the
[1749.2s] story um I can speak on the prophets and
[1752.6s] Kings but yes let's let's let's look at
[1755.0s] that the the the Patriots and Kings part
[1757.4s] I think it's the the um the lesson is is
[1760.8s] is very good it's actually asking us you
[1763.4s] know to to read spiritual prophecy uh
[1766.0s] chapter 54 and um
[1768.7s] you know to connect it to to further
[1771.3s] Insight you know yeah yeah so chapter 54
[1775.2s] on the prophets and Kings um the title
[1778.3s] is a rebuke against against extortion
[1782.0s] and it's actually what you see basically
[1784.5s] in the whole of the story and basically
[1787.6s] what's in the chapter is just everything
[1790.8s] that you've mentioned in the story and
[1793.5s] what I'd likely to I'd like to
[1795.7s] specifically point out is uh um the
[1798.5s] message time that is being spoken out to
[1801.4s] us here um where we see that L G white
[1804.8s] is connecting the way
[1807.6s] nemiah um and others purchased back
[1812.1s] their people from slavery slavery we see
[1815.2s] that um the Jews and the people in the
[1818.8s] low classes they are undergoing this
[1821.2s] hard time where they they were being
[1824.3s] forced to borrow on very large interests
[1827.6s] and connecting this story to how Ellen
[1831.4s] dght wants us to see it we see that um
[1836.6s] she says she tells us that we were all
[1839.5s] deps uh to Divine justice but we had
[1842.8s] nothing which to pay the debt then the
[1846.0s] Son of God who ped us paid the price for
[1849.1s] our Redemption he became poor that
[1851.6s] through his poverty we might be reached
[1854.2s] so it is through this selfless act that
[1857.6s] Jesus took that we were we receive this
[1861.1s] Redemption yeah somehow so Grace was
[1864.3s] given to us freely and we should extend
[1866.3s] the same to others but there is also an
[1868.3s] element of the Love of Money I think the
[1870.4s] spirit of Prophecy talks about the Love
[1872.0s] of Money what what lesson do we learn
[1874.1s] Mary from this story about The Love of
[1878.1s] Money the Love of Money I think see is
[1882.7s] the love of man is the root of all evils
[1885.3s] I think when you love something you know
[1887.7s] that much that like things like money
[1890.4s] it's going to like blind you to the the
[1894.1s] problems it's causing you're just
[1896.1s] following money you're going to forget
[1898.2s] that all this person that you're taking
[1900.3s] the money from that's also a human being
[1903.2s] cuz only focusing on the money and not
[1905.8s] you know the actual state of things I
[1908.7s] think the love of money in this story
[1912.3s] it's what caused these people to sin
[1914.6s] exactly exactly the Love of Money caused
[1916.6s] these people to sin so how can we
[1918.9s] tame uh ourselves uh Whitney so that we
[1922.1s] don't end up in the same situation you
[1925.7s] know um I think as just as the Lord said
[1930.2s] to them that every third year share it's
[1934.6s] not about it's not bad to earn money but
[1938.3s] it's about being content with what you
[1941.4s] have so if you had that contentment in
[1944.4s] ourselves there's no need for us to
[1946.8s] reach out for somebody
[1948.6s] it's your hard work you earn what you g
[1951.7s] work and earn what you have not work
[1954.3s] earn and get someone
[1956.2s] else's yes so so we we should avoid I
[1959.7s] mean let's let's let's avoid corruption
[1961.7s] let's avoid taking things which are not
[1963.3s] ours let us be more generous with the
[1965.5s] things that we have and the lesson the
[1967.9s] lesson continues to say that stewardship
[1969.8s] is a privilege given to us by God I
[1972.0s] think this is one of the key lessons
[1973.4s] that for nurture in love and the victory
[1976.6s] over selfishness and covetousness
[1979.2s] stewards rejoice in the blessings that
[1981.4s] come to others as a result of their
[1983.5s] faithfulness that's our fundamental
[1985.3s] belief number 21 so today's Bible verse
[1988.5s] as well asserts that we should be good
[1990.3s] to all
[1991.6s] people you know and and what might our
[1995.6s] church be like Winston if we started
[1998.6s] with Paul's words to be good to all
[2000.9s] people especially with to Believers you
[2003.0s] know how can the church be like you
[2006.3s] know um for me I feel like you know the
[2010.0s] church is supposed to be like let's say
[2014.3s] um it's supposed to be what what what
[2017.3s] motivates us you know to
[2019.8s] like be that person who like is selfless
[2023.3s] and something like that you know it's
[2025.3s] the church that brings people together
[2028.2s] and it's kind of what unites us to you
[2033.0s] know practice in the act of worshiping
[2035.5s] God and spreading this gospel and that
[2038.2s] so I feel like the church should be the
[2040.1s] light through which others even if
[2042.7s] they're unbelievers should get this you
[2045.3s] know the message yeah the church would
[2047.9s] be be more of a light but Natasha I also
[2050.4s] want you to emphasize based on what you
[2051.9s] said that we will attract more Believers
[2053.8s] I mean what will the church be like if
[2055.8s] we practice what you know the the a tith
[2059.6s] every third year every seventh year we
[2062.0s] we we we leave the Harvest to those who
[2063.9s] are poor what would the church be
[2066.5s] like okay how I see it the church will
[2069.2s] be will be will be extended more people
[2072.8s] will be brought into into the church and
[2078.0s] yeah we'll be able to to spread the word
[2081.1s] to more parts of the world to spread the
[2084.3s] word to more parts of the world exactly
[2087.4s] there would be more love isn't it there
[2089.5s] would be more love to go around there
[2091.5s] would be more joy there would be um more
[2095.9s] sharing there people would be happier in
[2098.5s] the church if if if we obeyed really the
[2101.0s] command of god so let's go to the punch
[2103.5s] lines um Natasha do you want to take us
[2106.5s] through the punch lines
[2112.9s] sure the first punch line comes from
[2118.0s] Deuteronomy 15: 7 to10 and it says if
[2123.4s] anyone is poor among your fellow
[2125.6s] Israelites in any of the towns of the
[2127.8s] land the Lord your God is giving you do
[2130.5s] not be hard-hearted or tightfisted
[2133.5s] toward them rather be open-handed and
[2136.5s] freely lend them whatever they need give
[2139.2s] generously to them and do so without a
[2142.1s] grudging heart then because of this the
[2144.8s] Lord your God will bless you in all your
[2147.6s] work and in everything you put your hand
[2152.4s] to the second one is Galatians 6: 2 and
[2157.3s] 10
[2158.3s] and it says carry each other's burdens
[2161.3s] and in this way you will fulfill the law
[2164.1s] of Christ therefore as we have
[2167.4s] opportunity let us do good to all people
[2170.7s] especially to those who belong to the
[2173.0s] family of Believers and the last one
[2175.6s] comes from the book of Acts chapter 2
[2178.3s] verse 1 and Chap and verse 42 and 47 it
[2183.9s] says when the day of Pentecost came they
[2186.8s] were all together together in one place
[2189.1s] they devoted themselves to the apostles
[2191.6s] teaching and to Fellowship to the
[2194.6s] breaking of bread and to prayer every
[2197.3s] day they continued to meet together in
[2199.6s] the temple courts they broke bread in
[2202.8s] their homes and ate together with glad
[2205.2s] and sincere Hearts praising God and
[2207.8s] enjoying the favor of all the people and
[2210.8s] the Lord added to their number daily
[2213.6s] those who were being saved
[2218.2s] so what I can say here the verse that I
[2221.6s] feel
[2223.7s] has has has talked to me here is
[2226.9s] Deuteronomy 15: 7 and 10 the part will
[2231.4s] give generously to them and do so
[2234.6s] without a grudging heart then because of
[2237.8s] this the Lord your God will bless you in
[2240.0s] all your work and in everything you put
[2241.7s] your hand to God doesn't want us to help
[2244.9s] people just because he said so go and
[2248.1s] help people he wants us to do
[2251.0s] it like willingly he wants you to go
[2254.4s] help someone willingly and that's his
[2256.6s] joy that you go help someone cuz you
[2261.4s] know what what's right you know that you
[2264.4s] have to help someone and not you're not
[2266.6s] doing it just because he said so it's
[2269.4s] because you know how it will help you
[2272.3s] too and God will bless you he will add
[2275.9s] to you add to you the work of your hands
[2280.8s] and yeah that's what I can say that's
[2283.9s] that's the verse that that really
[2285.8s] captured you I like that Winston you
[2288.0s] look like this what what really captured
[2290.0s] you here um in today's punch length I
[2293.4s] think the verse that stood out to me is
[2296.4s] Galatians 6
[2298.4s] 2:10 uh I'll just repeat it again it
[2301.2s] says carry each other's burdens and in
[2303.7s] this way you will fulfill the law of
[2305.8s] Christ therefore as have opportunity let
[2308.6s] us do good to all people especially to
[2310.8s] those who belong to the family of
[2313.0s] Believers um when I look at this verse
[2316.0s] it tells me that um there's that Unity
[2320.6s] uh among God's people and it calls us to
[2324.6s] like carry each other's burdens you know
[2327.8s] as for example here in church um we
[2330.7s] can't just look at someone who is having
[2333.4s] a hard time particularly having let's
[2337.9s] say let's say he or she is just
[2340.2s] struggling we can't just lay low and
[2343.2s] assume nothing is happening it calls us
[2345.4s] to like reach out and do something yeah
[2350.5s] and getting it right getting it right
[2352.4s] fulfilling the law of God what punched
[2355.0s] you Whitney um for me it's the same as
[2357.7s] wistone but mine is a capture from that
[2361.2s] between the verses it was from verse 6
[2364.4s] and 7 it says let him who is taught the
[2368.1s] word share in all good things with him
[2370.9s] who teaches do not be deceived God is
[2373.6s] Not mocked for whatever a man SS that is
[2376.7s] what will he will rap so it's just about
[2380.5s] habit if you have a habit of doing good
[2383.5s] it will naturally come to you and it it
[2387.0s] will be easier for us to teach what we
[2389.6s] know you can't teach what you don't have
[2392.6s] so if we are good in our words in our
[2396.3s] deeds in everything it becomes an habit
[2399.4s] and teaching
[2400.7s] it is it's easier and God knows our
[2404.2s] heart cuz if it's it's an habit it's not
[2407.2s] something that ah today let me do good
[2410.1s] because somebody seeing me it just comes
[2413.0s] naturally cuz you are usually good at
[2416.4s] what you're doing yeah you got it right
[2419.0s] thank
[2419.9s] you what punched you it's the verse from
[2424.9s] Acts chapter 2 h I like this part of
[2429.7s] every day they continue to meet together
[2431.7s] in the temple courts they broke bread in
[2434.0s] their homes and ate together with glad
[2436.8s] and sincere Hearts praising God and
[2439.6s] enjoying the favor of all the people and
[2441.9s] the Lord added to their number daily
[2444.4s] those who are being
[2446.0s] saved this part it's reminding us that
[2449.8s] giving and sharing these are not burdens
[2452.6s] that God has placed on us it's it's a
[2454.7s] blessing that you're able to get
[2456.1s] something you share it with you know
[2459.7s] your fellow Believers as you're happy
[2461.7s] cuz this they that they were glad and
[2464.1s] happy and they enjoyed the favor of all
[2467.0s] people not just Christians so as you're
[2469.8s] doing
[2470.9s] that as Natasha said it's going to draw
[2473.5s] people to the T the church as they had
[2476.0s] favor with them and that's how the Lord
[2478.6s] added daily to the people who are being
[2480.8s] saved I really like that I really like
[2483.2s] that element of that these are not B
[2484.8s] it's not a burden that God has put on us
[2487.0s] it is something that is a blessing for
[2488.8s] us and and and just as we close I want
[2491.3s] us to look at um uh um nemiah and the
[2495.6s] fact that you know
[2497.7s] um there's a wonderful section over here
[2500.9s] if I can find it yes nehemiah's role in
[2504.5s] Judea was not simply that of a general
[2508.2s] contractor he functioned as a spiritual
[2511.0s] change agent and the locals responded
[2514.0s] well to his leadership nemiah had
[2516.7s] brought a radical transformation to the
[2518.7s] region and the attitudes and
[2521.5s] perceptions uh of the people had about
[2524.9s] god Jehovah okay so the timing of this
[2528.1s] story is difficult to Mark in the
[2529.6s] context of the rebuilding of the walls
[2531.1s] and Gates it is possible that this story
[2532.8s] took place during the building process
[2535.0s] but it is but it is hard to say Ellen
[2538.3s] White describes the incident in this
[2540.0s] week's lesson as taking place during the
[2542.5s] rebuilding process so it just shows I
[2545.2s] think the courage and boldness of n Maya
[2547.8s] and you know as we as we end I just want
[2550.1s] you to you know each one think about who
[2553.0s] else in the Bible did we see standing up
[2556.0s] with so much courage and
[2559.2s] boldness Winston who comes to
[2562.1s] mind
[2564.2s] um I think just a quick reference I'd
[2569.9s] say um someone like David David David
[2573.1s] definitely yeah where he like he was he
[2576.6s] was B enough and courageous just to Bear
[2579.3s] the burden of being king of Israel and
[2582.6s] taking those um participating those Wars
[2586.5s] and just standing out for his people yes
[2589.6s] he did bringing down Goliath yes Natasha
[2592.3s] who comes to
[2593.4s] mind uh who comes to mind is I can say
[2597.8s] Daniel Daniel cuz he's too up to the
[2602.2s] king saying that he won't eat the food
[2605.8s] that they were being provided with
[2607.2s] because they knew he knew that it was
[2609.7s] not good for them and yeah yes Daniel
[2614.6s] did yes and and he he he he he refused
[2618.0s] to bow down he refused the graen image
[2620.8s] you know if you put me in a lion's then
[2623.2s] I don't know I'm not sure I might think
[2626.2s] but that was the courage of Daniel yes
[2628.5s] so I
[2630.2s] think Elijah comes to mind Elijah is a
[2633.5s] good one yes he used to go and S sending
[2635.9s] up to the king king of Israel who hated
[2638.4s] him and hated the God that he
[2640.8s] served and I think that just takes it
[2643.4s] takes a lot of courage and also the
[2645.8s] contest at camel just standing alone
[2648.0s] against hundreds yeah that takes a lot
[2650.7s] of Courage Whitney who comes to mind uh
[2653.6s] for me it was Esther cuz Esther knew
[2657.0s] also her people needed help so she
[2660.4s] didn't go to the temple and just sit go
[2663.3s] ah I've already arrived so I don't need
[2666.1s] to think about the others but she took
[2668.9s] the time and told the king about her
[2671.8s] request for her people so yeah Esther
[2674.8s] can comes to mind yeah they they're
[2676.7s] beautiful Bible characters that stand
[2678.6s] out there you know uh Esther Elijah
[2682.9s] Daniel David Noah Moses the we we
[2689.2s] there's so much to choose from really
[2690.9s] and and Nehemiah now so so in get about
[2694.2s] getting it right you know getting it get
[2697.0s] getting it right and and and and and
[2699.3s] nehemiah's anger and nehemiah's call to
[2702.3s] the people the people's repentance and
[2705.3s] you know it is my prayer that that we
[2707.4s] will we will we will have courage to
[2711.0s] stand up for what is right we will seek
[2713.6s] Justice we will give and to avoid
[2718.2s] uh um poverty or more importantly we
[2723.2s] will not take
[2724.4s] advantage of the poor amongst
[2727.8s] but as we close then let me just ask
[2729.6s] each one of us to just give a parting
[2731.3s] short Whitney what's your takeaway uh
[2734.4s] for me there a quote I read that if you
[2737.7s] see something do something do something
[2740.4s] so for me it was an encouragement from
[2743.3s] Nehemiah that nemiah didn't only do
[2746.3s] something in public but also in private
[2749.2s] he did where he knew that what they were
[2751.8s] doing was wrong he called it called it
[2754.6s] out and it was not that he saw it wrong
[2757.4s] cuz he was not part of it he saw it
[2759.8s] wrong cuz it was wrong you see some
[2762.1s] people only know it's wrong when you're
[2764.3s] not part of the plan so if he knew it
[2767.7s] was wrong cuz he was not part of the
[2769.2s] plan but also his character knew that
[2773.0s] what they were doing it was not right so
[2775.3s] he spoke out if you see something do
[2778.0s] something if you see something say
[2780.0s] something do something very good Whitney
[2782.5s] yes I'm wor I think what what I'm
[2786.2s] leaving this lesson with is caring for
[2789.9s] your the people around you had a quote
[2792.9s] that said Christianity isn't about isn't
[2795.2s] thinking less about yourself it's about
[2798.3s] thinking about yourself less so now
[2801.1s] these people after they were corrected
[2802.6s] by nemiah they started considering the
[2805.2s] people around them I think that's
[2807.0s] something that we should all take into
[2809.2s] consideration thank you so much it's
[2810.8s] that sense of humility you know so just
[2814.9s] not thinking so much of yourself but
[2816.3s] considering others thank you so much om
[2818.6s] Mar yes Winston what's your takeaway um
[2823.0s] what I take home today uh what I've
[2825.2s] learned today I've quite learned a lot
[2828.1s] but I'll just mention a few um first um
[2832.8s] it's mentioned in the further insights
[2835.0s] where l g tells us that by Deeds of
[2838.6s] liberality toward his poor we may prove
[2841.8s] the sincerity of our gra of our
[2844.7s] gratitude for the mercy extended to us
[2847.5s] absolutely I mean when we look at
[2850.0s] everything that God has done in our
[2852.4s] lives and it's it's so much that we
[2855.8s] can't compare it
[2857.8s] to that act of liberality towards the
[2860.8s] poor like it should just be something
[2864.3s] like to just I mean prove that we
[2868.6s] actually gr great we actually grateful
[2872.0s] grateful for whatever God has done to us
[2874.8s] absolutely absolutely that extension
[2876.6s] would would come from our gratitude
[2879.2s] Natasha well this story reminds me of a
[2881.8s] quote I once read it said if you can't
[2884.8s] see the light be the light amen here
[2888.2s] nemiah shows a really great example that
[2890.7s] when he saw the poor were being
[2892.5s] mistreated he didn't sit back and say oh
[2895.5s] no I can't do anything now he became the
[2898.8s] light and went and told the leaders that
[2903.6s] what you're doing to the poor is wrong
[2906.0s] so what my takeaway is that when you see
[2908.8s] something is not going the way it's
[2910.6s] supposed to be take action cuz you know
[2913.7s] what is Right amen wow what a beautiful
[2916.9s] way to wrap up I've learned so much from
[2918.8s] these young people I'm so blessed that
[2921.2s] the the the teens are you know are
[2924.0s] energized for Jesus and they want to be
[2926.2s] like Nehemiah they are going to see
[2928.8s] wrong and they're going to do wrong
[2930.4s] they're going to show care they're going
[2932.2s] to be the light you know and and and
[2935.1s] they're going to show gratitude by
[2936.8s] helping others thank you so much uh for
[2940.0s] um being a part of this lesson and I
[2942.8s] pray that each one of us will get it
[2945.2s] right uh Omar can you pray with
