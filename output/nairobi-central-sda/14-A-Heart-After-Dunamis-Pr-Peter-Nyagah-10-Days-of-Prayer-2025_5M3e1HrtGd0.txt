FULL TRANSCRIPT:
now we are talking about um claiming dunamis and uh we began a pastor brought out that very very powerfully uh This Hour of the day we are looking at a heart after dunamis a heart after dunames this was supposed to come at around 10 and but because of so many you know activities we've had it's coming at this particular time when we have supposed to be having uh a different program with Pastor trop has come Pastor please can you stand and greet Pastor stepen has been running 10 days of Prayer at Fountain of Hope every every evening and thank you Pastor because you were able to come join us uh in this night of prayer Pastor Amayo is also running a night of prayer where he's been running 10 days of prayer together with his wife in Jah and so when you don't see them here don't wonder what happened with a good pastor he's busy busy helping God's people in the part of this uh City now um a heart after dunamis now we've been talking about dunamis dunamis and of course we know now it's anchored in the text of Acts of apostle chapter one verse number 8 the promise that Jesus gave but you shall receive power when the Holy Spirit has come upon you and you shall be my Witnesses in Jerusalem in all Judea in Samaria and to the ends of the Earth now the term power used here by Jesus is actually was is called dunamis in Greek is power and our guest speaker has been really talking about God who is awesome if you are counting how many times he repeated God is awesome God is powerful I mean there were so many times that he repeated that I think it has sun in our minds that God is all powerful but this term conveys more than mere strength it refers to Dynamic Supernatural power power that comes directly from God power that cannot be gotten from any other source it can only come from God we we've gathered here this night seeking or claiming this power but this very unique power that comes only from God now the power of the holy spirit is Wonder working power but then we need to look at what kind of a heart receives this power we are here throughout the night we've been talking about this power but what kind of a heart do you need to have to receive this power a heart after dunamis now what to for me to be to bring all this in the next few minutes I will take us to the people who received the promise of the father that is the disciples then we look at who they were before the Pentecost or before the out departing of the holy spirit that is disciples pre Pentecostal state then we look at the disciples post Pentecostal State and then we will look at our context in this 10 days of prayer and why we are here this night now that can take a whole week but I'll do it in the next very few minutes I'll try to summarize all that because these are things you know just to uh speak to our hearts and prepare us for the outp of the Holy Spirit let's pray our gracious Father in Heaven thank you so much for the privilege of this Fellowship this night of prayer we thank you because we are feeling your presence speak to us now oh my father may we see what you require of us that this power may be our experience take over this segment in Jesus name I pray amen now Jesus in act chapter 1 verse number 4 the Bible says and being ass assembled together with them he commanded them not to depart from Jerusalem but wait for the promise of the father now Jesus spoke to his disciples and he told them oh well you need not to move from Jerusalem because you need first to receive the power stay in Jerusalem I wait for the promise of the father now the promise of the father of course is what is in verse number eight that the coming of the holy spirit so Jesus instructed his disciples to wait and we are talking about the 10 days of prayer from this passage now the waiting the disciples head is actually what has given birth to what the Adventist Church lost the 10 days of prayer now the Disciples of Jesus then stayed in Jerusalem for 10 days of intense prayer in the upper room and on the 10th Day of Prayer the Holy Spirit was poured upon them now if we would put that into a context it is this night the Holy Spirit was poured is somebody with me so they began the 10 days of prayer the way we began last week Wednesday and they Jed through in the upper room praying and upon the 10th day 10 day of their praying then the Holy Spirit came upon them so it is intended that a church that will truly run these programs in the spirit of the Pentecost the culmination of the 10 days of prayer will be the Showers of Blessings from the Holy Spirit there is my prayer that as you go through this night Before Dawn we shall receive the showers of the Holy Spirit now the disciples needed this experience because when you check through the disciples experience with Jesus we see a people that were not ready for the Holy Spirit people who misunderstood the ministry of Jesus while they lived with Jesus they served with Jesus Jesus and assigned the Ministries but they did not fully understand the ministry of Jesus and you know friends it is very true that even as today we could be in church we could be serving we could have spent so many years in the church but we have not understood the mission of God for the church very very true so when you look at the disciples before Pentecost they often displayed misunderstandings among them themselves there was a lot of fear among them a lot of selfish ambition this is a team Jesus is about to leave now just to remind you especially in Luke chapter 22 that day when they were arguing about who is the greatest in the kingdom of God and you know when you check in the Bible in fact this was the Last Supper they were having with Jesus even at the Last Supper the they having with Jesus they are still struggling and arguing who is the greatest Among Us well of course you can check the Book of Matthew chapter 26 and verse number 56 you see even during the passion week when Jesus was being you know tried and you know persecuted and everything some disciples would not be bold enough to defend Jesus they they took off they fled you know one of them still argued what was happening with him he V out of fear and um his clothes fell off running for his life they were so fearful so fearful now of course you remember somewhere like Peter who then would deny Jesus how many times three times so this is the team that Jesus is having now I want you to pause and imagine if Jesus left this team in that state and then they're supposed to go into all the world how long would this have taken not even talk about that who they have managed they needed some special thing to transform their thinking empow them in a unique way for them to be able to carry on the ministry of Jesus that they believed in him they loved him they served him but they were not ready for the mission and so Jesus tells them you've got to wait until when the holy spirit will be brought to you now one of the things that they struggled with was the self sentent Ambitions and I want to pause you and say friends any Christian whose heart is so full of self centeredness self virtuousness is a heart that is not ready for dunamis the Bible says now there was also a dispute among them as to which of them should be considered the greatest is this a concern in the Christian church today hello is the church suffering from this problem I think so is a human problem is a problem of a heart that is not converted and what surprises me is actually how one is able to serve the Lord when he is not converted and God allows it so they served the Jesus for so many years and they were not converted they having arguments but they also end an issue with personal status you remember when he's watching them the feet and they are also having argument no you cannot do this to me like Peter was there and Jesus intentionally went down to wash their feet even though that was not the tradition because he was dealing with a deeper problem that they possessed in their hearts they were not humble self-exaltation that was a problem that needed to be removed from their hearts before the Holy Spirit would be given to [Music] them and I P here to say tonight Jesus is still speaking to us on this respect that you may search your heart to see whether it's humble enough to receive the holy spirit because self centeredness hinders the Holy Spirit now they also had a problem they so much relied on human strength John 18 verse number 10 through 11 the Bible says th then Simon Peter having a sword drew it and struck the high priest's servant and cut off his right ear now we know the story now Peter is with Jesus and by way Jesus had warn them before but Peter is carrying what sword I I don't know how many SWS you've carried you know you know there a selfdefense you know is relying on you your human strength and power you've not let yourself in the hands of you do not trust fully that actually God can take care of your life you know Peter said I know he's Jesus but but let me car mind let me carry man for a bad day for a bad day not a bad day and just looking at their lives and their heart says no such kind of hearts are not ready for the Holy Spirit now look the pastor next to you ask him or her what kind of a sword are you carry [Laughter] I I don't know I don't know how many how many SS Peter had because Peter knew that night was not an easy night I I I I I think he enced a number of them and you know people speculate they say he was not aiming at the ear H you know this is typically how we are do you see how easily we turn on each other hello are you with me uhhuh we look very good we look very good but wait until I'll do something to you until something is done to your to to your relative or to your your tribemates or to then we know the kind of a person you are now there is a problem Jesus is dealing with and he tells them before you receive the power you need to remove the things in your heart that hinders the entry of the holy spirit so so so the 10 days of prayer that the disciples are having the upper room I have nothing else to do than to deal with the issues that have been bearing all through as they were with Jesus and I want to pose and say we too need to have the upper room experience this night you need to have the upper room experience where Jesus can point out to you the things that he [Music] finds as hindrance to the power so human power strength is what was hindering them so this the kind of a team you're dealing with but let's see what happened after they went to the upper room now the Bible says in the upper room they stand there in prayer they were repenting they were confessing their sins they were preparing their hearts they were removing every sin every bitterness they were removing things that swell their hearts they they they were they were preparing their hearts to receive the power and until Heaven saw that the heart were ready the Holy Spirit would not come the promise was there but the promise was being hindered by the state of the hearts of the disciples and I want to say here the pro promise is still there but the state of our heart could be hindering the Fulfillment of the promise let me also tell you here friends unlike of the apostolic church that the Holy Spirit was brought upon the church at large today the holy spirit is being poured on individuals not collectively that day it was a collective outpouring of the Holy Spirit today the holy spirit is being poured on individual people members and hearts that are V so it means if today your heart is ready for the Holy Spirit you will not be delayed by a sister or a brother who is struggling God will pour the Holy Spirit upon you at a personal level but how beautiful this be if we all as a church came into a level of this pre preparedness and then the Holy Spirit would be poured Upon Us collectively like the Pentecostal day so the heart needed to be transformed through repentance surrender that they can be restored into a genuine relationship with Jesus this is a prequisite to the pouring of the Holy Spirit there were issues of differences and they needed to be unified Unity among Believers is a prequisite for the outpouring of the Holy Spirit the Bible says in verse number 14 this all continued with one ACC called in prayer and supplication God was also looking out for the unity of purpose the unity and when they continued in the spirit of unity and the heaven saw that they were not United they had removed all the differences that they had then the Holy Spirit was Bor let me also pause here tonight and say friends this night is also a night of removing all differences among us don't expect the Holy Spirit to be pointed upon you tonight when you still Hing bitterness toward somebody in the church until you remove that bitterness until you remove that anger until you allow yourself to love the unlovable until you allow yourself to Bear the pain of accepting those that you chose not to accept because of both done to you until when you remove that pain and embrace your enemy the holy spirit will still be a story to be told tonight a heart after dunamis is a heart that is seeking for reconciliation forgiveness acceptance and I pray at the personal level you may search your heart so they need to be United the Bible says the disciples waited for the Fulfillment of the promise they humbled their hearts in true repentance and confess their unbelief as they meditated upon his pure holy life they felt that not toil would be too hard nor sacrifice too too great if only they could bear witness in their lives to the lovelyness of Christ character that is from apostles the Actos main page number 37 by Sister white now having SE that friends allow me then to bring this to our experience of course after they spent 10 days in prayer confessing their sins one to the other when the Holy Spirit was brought upon them Peter who was very fearful became very bold you see the promise that we find in the Book of John is that this spirit this power is not the spirit of fear is somebody with me no no no no no that the holy spirit is not one of fear but is of Love is of sound mind is somebody with me MH now when the Holy Spirit came upon the disciples even those who are very fearful they became very bold they loved each other so dearly they forgot about their self ambition they they were out for Jesus no matter what happened no one would stop them not not even the gates of hell not prison nothing would stop them when the power Came Upon them you know the tsunamis is Unstoppable power Unstoppable power Untamed power and any believer any Christian any church that has received the showers of the holy spirit is a Wonder working Church so tonight this is what God want from us the text of osah CH 10 vers 12 hoseah CH 10 verse number 12 that was for disciples this is for us hoseah CH 10 verse number 12 the Bible says s for yourselves righteousness reap in Mercy break up your fellow ground for it is time to seek the Lord till he comes and Reigns righteousness on you so for yourself righteousness I wish that we could have that text on the screen as in hoseah chapter 10 verse number 12 so for yourself ousness reap in Mercy break up your follow ground why should we do all this for it is time to seek who the Lord and we will seek the Lord till he comes to re righteousness on us we are here tonight because this is what God is is appealing for every single believer now let me just break this quickly before we go to the next segment of prayer and I say it is the time in this night this 10 days of prayer this night of prayer is a time to break up your follow ground this night you sat here from 8:00 p.m. to this morning because it is the time for you to break up your fellow ground you see fell ground friends refers to soil that was once productive but has been left uncultivated over time it becomes hard and yielding and suitable for any planting and so spiritually F ground represent a heart that was grown that has grown hard you know you believed it was soft for the Lord but over time your heart has become so much harded because of issues of Life levels of backsliding growing cold in your faith your ground has become follow and a need to be be broken we are here tonight because we need to break the Farrow grounds of our hearts that then they can be softened and be ready to receive the Holy Spirit now oah says s your self righteousness by breaking the F ground of your heart you know God calls us to examine our hearts and break up the hardened areas of this Earth so that his word and his Spirit can work effectively in our lives I say tonight friends it is time to break the follow of your ground he says s in righteousness now sowing in righteousness prepares the heart for dunamis sowing in righteousness prepares the heart for dunamis now soing inous simply means self-examination we are here tonight for self-examination we shall receive the power of the Holy Spirit as you do self-examination to identify areas of hardness areas of sin areas that you have neglected areas that we need to change and transform areas we need Jesus to bear for us we are here tonight at a personal level to self-examine to see whether we are standing in faith if there is not done we will have wasted our sleep I pray as you sit here tonight you may do self-examination and see whether you are in faith Ephesians 4: number 3 I mean 31 through 32 the Bible say is one of the things that stays in the heart and destroys the spirit just read that that particular text Ephesians 4: 31 through 32 let all bitterness wrath anger clamor and evil speaking be put away from you with all malays and be kind to one another tenderhearted forgiving one another even as God in Christ forgive us this one must be dealt with tonight before we can receive the Holy Spirit I'm going to make a very serious request which is the hardest thing to be implemented in any CH Church setup that look out for your enemy in this church tonight don't pretend to not have enemies I say this is the the hardest thing to be done in a in a church seter but just look out for that that considers an enemy go to that person and tell that person but I've discovered I've discovered you are the problem I'm not receiving the Holy Spirit I I I need I need to remove you from my heart and take you at the feet of Jesus because tonight I want to receive the power of the Holy Spirit now that is what it means to have a heart after what dunam so have you seen your enemy you're all looking at me I'm your enemy but but because you know them please look out for them just do a text just take your phone and do a text and say say time brother I forgiven you tonight and wait and see how transformed your life is going to be so it says break the phoh break the phoh break the follow number two he says s s for yourself not for any other person so for yourself you're here tonight for yourself for your salvation whatever you're doing you're doing it for your own self righteousness cannot grow in unprepared SW a heart committed to righteousness becomes a vessel for dunamis to take place and I say here a heart after dunamis reaps in Mercy a heart after dunamis reaps after reaps Mercy you says reap in Mercy after you saw righteousness you reap in what in Mercy and this simply to mean God is gracious everyone who is going to confess their sins tonight God is gracious he shall receive you in his abundance of his Mercy tonight we've got a very unique precious moment when every sin no matter how ugly it looks like will be forgiven he says those who saw in who saw righteousness they will reap in what in Mercy in Grace God will be gracious tonight before we leave this Sanctuary somebody's sin will be forgiven tonight before we leave this Sanctuary because of how you have committed your heart to the Lord in prayer God's Grace will be sufficient those who sow righteousness they reap in what in Mercy so M includes God's forgiveness God's kindness in your life God blessings upon your life those who s righteousness they will reap in what in Mercy and I he the good book saying in the book of lamentation CH 3 verse number 22 through 23 that verse that we love so much his Mercy you know the man of God says through the Lord's mercies we are not what consumed because his compassions fail not and the next segment of this vers is the most beautiful one for me this mercy and compassion of God mercy and compassion of God they are new Every Morning can somebody say Amen Every [Music] Morning Fresh every morning new brand new from the Lord mercy and what compassion they are new every morning so you can start claiming mercy and compassion from the Lord this morning you walked in here with some mercy it has expired God is giving you new this morning claim it in this house today his mes are new every morning great is what and so friends says we do this because it is time to seek the Lord It's the time to seek the Lord It's the time to seek the Lord It's the time to seek the Lord and says we seek the Lord till he comes to re what righteousness righteousness Is His Holy Spirit and I end by saying I want to give you about nine statements and after every statement I want you to respond and say Amen we are here to seek the Lord and we will not Tire even after today we shall continue seeking the Lord because this is the time to seek who the Lord we will keep pressing until the FL Gates of Heaven open we will persevere in prayer until the heavens pour out Their Blessings we will stand firm until the drought is over and the rain of the Holy Spirit refreshes us every day we will not give up in prayer until the dry ground is socked with its outpouring we will seek relentlessly until God's Reigns righteousness Upon Us amen is dying off will you sick relentlessly now those who are sleeping wake up because we are not tiing we will seek this outpouring of the Holy Spirit until the rain of righteousness is poured upon us we will wait in faith until the showers of Revival cover every single one of us in this land we will pray through the night until the morning due turns to showers of Grace we will not stop until the r brings renewal restoration and Revival we will not not

TIMESTAMPED TRANSCRIPT:
[0.8s] now we are talking about
[5.5s] um
[7.5s] claiming
[11.7s] dunamis and uh we began a pastor brought
[15.2s] out that very very
[17.1s] powerfully uh This Hour of the day we
[21.8s] are looking
[24.1s] at a heart after
[28.4s] dunamis a heart after
[31.9s] dunames this was supposed to come at
[33.9s] around
[36.0s] 10 and but because of so many you know
[39.8s] activities we've had it's coming at this
[42.5s] particular time when we have supposed to
[45.2s] be having uh a different program with
[48.1s] Pastor trop has come Pastor please can
[51.0s] you stand and
[55.5s] greet Pastor stepen has been running 10
[58.2s] days of Prayer

[61.7s] Hope every every evening and thank you

[68.0s] join us uh in this night of prayer
[71.3s] Pastor Amayo is also running a night of
[74.3s] prayer where he's been running 10 days
[76.6s] of prayer together with his wife in
[80.5s] Jah and so when you don't see them here
[84.0s] don't wonder what happened with a good
[86.8s] pastor he's busy busy helping
[90.5s] God's people in the part of this uh
[94.2s] City now
[98.2s] um a heart
[100.4s] after
[104.0s] dunamis now we've been talking about
[107.6s] dunamis dunamis and of course we know
[110.8s] now it's anchored in the text of Acts of
[113.1s] apostle chapter one verse number 8 the
[115.8s] promise that Jesus gave but you shall
[118.4s] receive power when the Holy Spirit has
[121.5s] come upon you and you shall be my
[127.2s] Witnesses in Jerusalem in all Judea in
[132.8s] Samaria and to the ends of the Earth now
[136.2s] the term power used here by Jesus is
[140.6s] actually was is called dunamis in
[144.4s] Greek is power and our guest speaker has
[147.9s] been really talking about God who is
[151.1s] awesome if you are counting how many
[153.4s] times he repeated God is awesome God is
[157.8s] powerful I mean there were so many times
[160.5s] that he repeated that I think it has sun
[162.1s] in our minds that God is all
[166.2s] powerful but this term conveys more than
[170.6s] mere
[172.4s] strength it refers
[174.8s] to Dynamic
[178.2s] Supernatural power
[182.0s] power that comes directly from God power
[187.0s] that cannot be gotten from any other
[190.6s] source it can only come from God we
[193.7s] we've gathered here this night seeking
[196.7s] or claiming this
[199.1s] power but this very unique power that
[202.0s] comes only from God now the power of the
[204.2s] holy
[205.0s] spirit is Wonder working power
[210.8s] but then we need to look
[213.6s] at what kind of a
[217.5s] heart receives this
[220.5s] power we are here throughout the night
[222.8s] we've been talking about this power but
[225.1s] what kind of a heart do you need to have
[227.2s] to receive this
[231.1s] power a
[233.0s] heart after
[237.3s] dunamis now what to for me to be to
[240.4s] bring all this in the next few
[243.1s] minutes I will take us
[245.6s] to the people who received the
[250.3s] promise of the
[252.6s] father that is the
[254.8s] disciples then we look at who they were
[259.1s] before the Pentecost or before the out
[263.0s] departing of the holy spirit that is
[266.5s] disciples pre Pentecostal state
[271.5s] then we look at the disciples post
[275.0s] Pentecostal
[276.4s] State and then we will look at our
[279.9s] context in this 10 days of prayer and
[283.0s] why we are here this
[284.8s] night now that can take a whole week but
[289.0s] I'll do it in the next very few minutes
[291.1s] I'll try to summarize all that because
[293.5s] these are things you know just to uh
[296.2s] speak to our hearts and prepare us for
[299.0s] the outp of the Holy
[302.9s] Spirit let's
[304.9s] pray our gracious Father in Heaven thank
[307.2s] you so much for the privilege of this
[308.9s] Fellowship this night of prayer we thank
[312.5s] you because we are feeling your
[315.5s] presence speak to us now oh my
[319.0s] father may we
[321.2s] see what you
[324.2s] require of
[326.4s] us that this power
[330.2s] may be our
[332.5s] experience take over this
[335.1s] segment in Jesus name I pray
[342.8s] amen
[346.5s] now
[349.6s] Jesus in act chapter 1 verse number
[356.2s] 4 the Bible says and being ass assembled
[360.6s] together with them he commanded them not
[364.4s] to depart from Jerusalem but wait for
[368.4s] the promise of the father now Jesus
[372.4s] spoke to his disciples and he told them
[374.2s] oh
[375.1s] well you need not to move from
[378.8s] Jerusalem because you
[381.8s] need first to receive the
[386.9s] power stay in Jerusalem
[391.7s] I wait for the promise of the father now
[394.2s] the promise of the father of course is
[395.8s] what is in verse number eight that the
[398.0s] coming of the holy
[400.6s] spirit so Jesus instructed his disciples
[403.6s] to
[406.1s] wait and we are talking about the 10
[409.7s] days of prayer from this passage now the
[412.4s] waiting the disciples head is actually
[415.4s] what has given birth to what the
[418.3s] Adventist Church lost the 10 days of
[420.8s] prayer now the Disciples of Jesus then
[423.0s] stayed in Jerusalem for 10 days of
[425.3s] intense prayer in the upper room and on
[428.0s] the 10th Day of Prayer the Holy Spirit
[430.6s] was poured upon them now if we would put
[433.4s] that into a context it is this night the
[437.4s] Holy Spirit was poured is somebody with
[440.4s] me so they began the 10 days of prayer
[443.0s] the way we began last week Wednesday and
[445.0s] they Jed through in the upper room
[447.2s] praying and upon the 10th day 10 day of
[450.4s] their praying then the Holy Spirit came
[453.2s] upon
[454.2s] them so it is intended that a church
[459.2s] that will
[460.5s] truly run these programs in the spirit
[465.0s] of the
[467.0s] Pentecost the culmination of the 10 days
[469.6s] of prayer will be the Showers of
[472.2s] Blessings from the Holy Spirit there is
[475.0s] my prayer that as you go through this
[477.3s] night Before Dawn
[479.7s] we shall receive the showers of the Holy
[484.1s] Spirit now the disciples needed this
[487.4s] experience
[488.8s] because when you check through the
[491.1s] disciples experience with Jesus we see a
[495.3s] people that were not ready for the Holy
[499.2s] Spirit people who misunderstood the
[501.7s] ministry of Jesus while they lived with
[504.0s] Jesus they served with Jesus Jesus and
[507.0s] assigned the Ministries but they did not
[510.1s] fully understand the ministry of Jesus
[513.3s] and you know friends it is very true
[515.6s] that even as today we could be in church
[518.6s] we could be serving we could have spent
[520.5s] so many years in the church but we have
[522.6s] not
[524.6s] understood the mission of God for the
[527.8s] church very very
[529.8s] true so when you look at the disciples
[533.9s] before
[535.6s] Pentecost they often displayed
[538.0s] misunderstandings among them
[540.2s] themselves there was a lot of fear among
[543.1s] them a lot of selfish
[546.8s] ambition this is a team Jesus is about
[549.4s] to
[551.0s] leave now just to remind you especially
[554.0s] in Luke chapter
[555.6s] 22 that day when they were arguing about
[559.0s] who is the greatest in the kingdom of
[561.6s] God and you know when you check in the
[563.0s] Bible in fact this was the Last Supper
[565.4s] they were having with Jesus even at the
[567.2s] Last
[568.2s] Supper the they having with Jesus they
[570.4s] are still struggling and arguing who is
[573.6s] the greatest Among
[576.3s] Us well of course you can check the Book
[579.4s] of Matthew chapter 26 and verse number
[581.1s] 56 you see even during the passion week
[583.9s] when Jesus was being you know tried and
[585.7s] you know persecuted and
[587.5s] everything some disciples would not be
[591.4s] bold enough to defend Jesus they they
[593.4s] took off they fled you know one of them
[596.3s] still argued what was happening with him
[600.4s] he V out of
[603.9s] fear and
[606.4s] um his
[608.5s] clothes fell
[610.4s] off running for his
[612.9s] life they were so
[615.2s] fearful so
[617.2s] fearful now of course you remember
[619.0s] somewhere like Peter who then would deny
[621.6s] Jesus how many times three times so this
[625.5s] is the team that Jesus is having
[632.6s] now I want you to pause and
[635.6s] imagine if Jesus left this team in that
[640.6s] state and then they're supposed to go
[642.8s] into all the
[645.2s] world how long would this have
[649.9s] taken not even talk about that who they
[652.6s] have
[655.6s] managed they needed some special thing
[659.8s] to transform their thinking empow them
[663.4s] in a unique way for them to be able to
[665.6s] carry on the ministry of
[669.4s] Jesus that they believed in him they
[672.0s] loved him they served him but they were
[675.0s] not ready for the
[677.7s] mission and
[679.6s] so Jesus tells them you've got to
[686.8s] wait until when
[690.2s] the holy spirit will be brought to
[693.9s] you
[697.7s] now one of the things that they
[700.2s] struggled
[702.6s] with was the self sentent
[708.5s] Ambitions and I want to pause you and
[710.5s] say
[713.2s] friends any
[716.0s] Christian whose heart is so full of self
[722.4s] centeredness self
[726.1s] virtuousness is a heart that is not
[728.6s] ready for
[733.0s] dunamis the Bible says now there was
[735.4s] also a dispute among them as to which of
[739.4s] them should be considered the
[744.0s] greatest is this a concern in the
[746.5s] Christian church
[747.8s] today hello
[750.8s] is the church suffering from this
[753.0s] problem I think
[758.1s] so is a human
[762.1s] problem is a problem of a heart that is
[765.0s] not converted and what surprises me is
[768.3s] actually how one is able to serve the
[771.5s] Lord when he is not
[773.7s] converted and God allows
[776.2s] it so they served the Jesus for so many
[779.4s] years and they were not
[784.1s] converted they having
[787.3s] arguments but they also end an issue
[790.4s] with personal
[792.8s] status you remember when he's watching
[795.0s] them the feet and they are also having
[797.4s] argument no you cannot do this to me
[799.8s] like Peter was
[803.0s] there and Jesus intentionally went down
[807.3s] to wash their feet even though that was
[809.6s] not the tradition because he was dealing
[811.9s] with a deeper problem that they
[813.8s] possessed in their
[816.2s] hearts they were not
[818.6s] humble self-exaltation
[821.8s] that was a problem that needed to be
[824.9s] removed from their hearts before the
[827.9s] Holy Spirit would be given to
[829.8s] [Music]
[831.8s] them and I P here to say
[835.2s] tonight Jesus is still speaking to us
[840.0s] on this respect that you may search your
[844.0s] heart to see whether it's humble enough
[847.6s] to receive the holy
[849.6s] spirit because self
[853.6s] centeredness
[856.4s] hinders the Holy
[859.9s] Spirit now they also had a
[864.1s] problem they so much relied on human
[867.2s] strength
[870.2s] John 18 verse number 10 through 11 the
[873.1s] Bible says th then Simon Peter having a
[876.8s] sword drew it and struck the high
[880.8s] priest's servant and cut off his right
[884.5s] ear
[885.5s] now we know the story now Peter is with
[891.8s] Jesus and by way Jesus had warn them
[894.3s] before but Peter is carrying
[897.6s] what sword
[908.6s] I I don't know how many SWS you've
[912.5s] carried you know you know there a
[914.8s] selfdefense you know is relying on you
[918.5s] your human strength and power you've not
[921.8s] let yourself in the hands of you do not
[924.5s] trust fully that actually God can take
[927.3s] care of your life you know Peter said I
[929.8s] know he's Jesus but but let me car mind
[933.5s] let me carry man for a bad day for a bad
[936.3s] day not a bad day and just looking at
[940.7s] their lives and their heart says no such
[942.7s] kind of hearts are not ready for the
[944.6s] Holy
[949.6s] Spirit now look the pastor next to you
[952.7s] ask him or her what kind of a sword are
[954.7s] you carry
[957.7s] [Laughter]
[967.8s] I I don't know I don't know how many how
[969.6s] many SS Peter had because Peter knew
[972.1s] that night was not an easy night I I I I
[976.0s] I think he enced a number of
[978.9s] them
[983.5s] and you know people speculate they say
[987.0s] he was not aiming at the ear
[993.4s] H you know this is typically how we
[997.3s] are do you see how easily we turn on
[999.6s] each other hello are you with me uhhuh
[1005.0s] we look very good we look very good but
[1007.2s] wait until I'll do something to
[1010.0s] you until something is done to your to
[1013.4s] to your relative or to your your
[1015.1s] tribemates or to then we know the kind
[1017.6s] of a person you are
[1020.2s] now there is a problem Jesus is dealing
[1021.8s] with and he tells them before you
[1025.1s] receive the
[1026.9s] power you need to remove the things in
[1030.1s] your heart
[1031.6s] that
[1033.2s] hinders the entry of the holy
[1036.7s] spirit so so so the 10 days of prayer
[1040.8s] that the disciples are having the upper
[1043.2s] room I have nothing else to do than to
[1046.1s] deal with the issues that have been
[1048.2s] bearing all through as they were with
[1053.7s] Jesus and I want to pose and
[1061.6s] say we
[1064.0s] too need to have the upper room
[1070.7s] experience this
[1072.9s] night you need to have the upper room
[1077.6s] experience where Jesus can point out to
[1081.0s] you the things that he
[1083.9s] [Music]
[1085.2s] finds as hindrance to the
[1090.4s] power
[1093.4s] so
[1095.5s] human power
[1103.7s] strength is what was hindering
[1107.4s] them so this the kind of a team you're
[1109.5s] dealing
[1111.3s] with but let's see what happened after
[1113.6s] they went to the upper room now the
[1115.6s] Bible says in the upper
[1118.3s] room they stand there in
[1126.1s] prayer they were repenting they were
[1129.1s] confessing their sins they were
[1131.7s] preparing their hearts they were
[1134.3s] removing every sin every bitterness they
[1137.2s] were removing things that swell their
[1140.1s] hearts they they they were they were
[1143.0s] preparing their hearts to receive the
[1145.3s] power and
[1146.6s] until Heaven saw that the heart were
[1150.0s] ready the Holy Spirit would not
[1153.5s] come the promise was there but the
[1156.7s] promise was being
[1160.0s] hindered by the state of the hearts of
[1163.7s] the
[1165.2s] disciples and I want to say here the pro
[1168.8s] promise is still
[1170.6s] there but the state of our heart could
[1173.5s] be hindering the Fulfillment of the
[1178.9s] promise let me also tell you here
[1182.4s] friends unlike of the apostolic
[1185.9s] church that the Holy Spirit was brought
[1188.6s] upon the church at large today the holy
[1193.0s] spirit is being poured on individuals
[1199.5s] not
[1200.4s] collectively that day it was a
[1202.4s] collective outpouring of the Holy Spirit
[1205.5s] today the holy spirit is being poured on
[1209.3s] individual people members and hearts
[1212.6s] that are V so it means if today your
[1216.2s] heart is ready for the Holy Spirit you
[1219.7s] will not be delayed by a sister or a
[1222.4s] brother who is struggling God will pour
[1225.2s] the Holy Spirit upon you at a personal
[1227.7s] level
[1231.6s] but how beautiful this be if we all as a
[1237.4s] church came into a level of this pre
[1240.4s] preparedness and then the Holy Spirit
[1242.4s] would be poured Upon Us collectively
[1244.9s] like the Pentecostal
[1247.5s] day so the heart needed to be
[1252.6s] transformed through repentance
[1255.6s] surrender that they can be restored into
[1259.2s] a genuine relationship with Jesus this
[1263.0s] is a
[1264.3s] prequisite to the pouring of the Holy
[1269.7s] Spirit there were issues of
[1272.3s] differences and they needed to be
[1275.0s] unified Unity among Believers is a
[1278.8s] prequisite for the outpouring of the
[1281.3s] Holy Spirit the Bible says in verse
[1283.8s] number 14 this all continued with one
[1288.7s] ACC called in prayer and
[1292.0s] supplication God was also looking out
[1294.4s] for the
[1296.2s] unity of purpose the
[1298.7s] unity and when they continued in the
[1302.6s] spirit of unity and the heaven saw that
[1306.0s] they were not United they had removed
[1308.3s] all the differences that they had then
[1311.6s] the Holy Spirit was
[1313.6s] Bor let me also pause here tonight and
[1315.8s] say friends this night is also a night
[1319.8s] of removing all differences among
[1323.2s] us don't expect the Holy Spirit to be
[1326.0s] pointed upon you tonight when you still
[1329.3s] Hing bitterness toward somebody in the
[1332.2s] church until you remove that bitterness
[1335.9s] until you remove that anger until you
[1339.0s] allow yourself to love the unlovable
[1342.7s] until you allow yourself to Bear the
[1344.7s] pain of accepting those that you chose
[1347.1s] not to accept because of both done to
[1349.2s] you until when you remove that pain and
[1352.6s] embrace your enemy the holy spirit will
[1355.6s] still be a story to be
[1357.6s] told tonight a heart after dunamis is a
[1362.2s] heart that is seeking for reconciliation
[1365.1s] forgiveness
[1367.6s] acceptance and I
[1370.0s] pray at the personal level you may
[1373.0s] search your
[1375.5s] heart so they need to be United
[1379.6s] the Bible says the disciples waited for
[1382.0s] the Fulfillment of the promise they
[1385.4s] humbled their hearts in true repentance
[1388.9s] and confess their unbelief as they
[1391.4s] meditated upon his pure holy life they
[1395.0s] felt that not toil would be too hard nor
[1398.8s] sacrifice too too great if only they
[1401.7s] could bear witness in their lives to the
[1405.0s] lovelyness of Christ character that is
[1407.2s] from apostles
[1409.9s] the Actos main page number 37 by Sister
[1413.4s] white now having SE that friends allow
[1416.0s] me then to bring this to our
[1421.2s] experience of course
[1423.8s] after
[1425.4s] they spent 10 days in prayer confessing
[1428.6s] their sins one to the
[1431.8s] other when the Holy Spirit was brought
[1434.2s] upon them Peter who was very fearful
[1440.3s] became very
[1442.5s] bold you see the promise that we find in
[1444.8s] the Book of John is
[1447.5s] that this spirit this
[1451.0s] power is not the spirit of fear is
[1454.1s] somebody with me no no no no no that the
[1457.5s] holy spirit is not one of
[1461.2s] fear but is of
[1464.6s] Love is of sound mind is somebody with
[1468.0s] me MH now when the Holy Spirit came upon
[1471.2s] the disciples even those who are very
[1473.6s] fearful they became very
[1480.0s] bold they loved each other so
[1484.5s] dearly they forgot about their self
[1487.5s] ambition they they were out for Jesus no
[1490.4s] matter what happened no one would stop
[1492.3s] them not not even the gates of hell not
[1494.6s] prison nothing would stop them when the
[1497.0s] power Came Upon them
[1502.2s] you know the
[1504.0s] tsunamis is Unstoppable
[1511.8s] power Unstoppable power Untamed
[1516.2s] power and any believer any Christian any
