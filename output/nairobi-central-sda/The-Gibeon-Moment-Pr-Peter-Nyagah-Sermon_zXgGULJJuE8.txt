FULL TRANSCRIPT:
Now today I want to go to the text of first kings. First kings chapter 3 verse number 3 and 5. Just go open there. The text of first kings chapter 3 verse number 3 and 5. That's where we're going to have our reading this morning. Chapter 3 of First Kings verse number three and five. The Bible says, "And Solomon loved the Lord, walking in the statues of his father David, except that he sacrificed and burned incense at the high places." Verse four. Now the king went to Gibon to sacrifice there for that was a great high place. Solomon offered a thousand burnt offerings on the altar. Verse 5. At Gabon, the Lord appeared to Solomon in a dream by night and God said, "Ask, ask, ask, what shall I give you?" Ask. At Gibon, the Lord appeared to Solomon in a dream by night and God said, "Ask, what shall I give to you?" This morning, our subject for this message is the Gibian moment. The Gibian moment. Let us pray. Gracious Father in heaven, hallowed be thy name, thy kingdom come. Thy will be done in this place and for this message as it is in heaven. For thine is the kingdom, the power, and the glory. You said, if you be lifted up, you shall draw all men unto yourself. And so, my father, this morning I pray that may I not be seen, may I not be heard, but may you be seen and heard as you speak to your children. as your servant and messenger. My request, Father, is that you may put your words into my mouth and order my thoughts and me lips to your will. In Jesus name I pray. Amen. The Gibon moment. Friends, this message is informed by the very brief message I've given you about your giving. I am preaching about you today. So if you don't like pastor preaching about you today, I'm preaching about you. And I don't know whether you've been in a situations where God and his presence broke through unexpectedly when you were just busy doing what you have to do for him and boom, the Lord appears to you not with judgment. but with the blessings. Solomon lives in some place in Jerusalem. And this is a boy, there's a gentleman's a man who has been brought up in a family that free as God has been introduced to the worship of true God. And of course, he knows that God had chosen him to to build the sanctuary because his father was not able to do that. Now his father must have taken a lot of time trying to educate this young man on the importance of worshiping but also importance of giving and sacrificing for the Lord. Now the Bible says that when Solomon came to power, the very onset of his reign, Solomon chose to go to a place not just to worship on a Sabbath but to go and offer sacrifice. You see those days friends know sacrifices was very central in terms of worship. And when we're talking about sacrifices in the Old Testament, we are not just talking about you know giving tithe and offering that we do these days. It was serious sacrifice where you would take animals your possession go and lay on altar and burn you know you know these days these days you give your offerings you give your tithes we don't go and burn them but we go and use them perhaps like you have given your offering you're waiting to see some pains who are coming up you you expecting to see pews changing you're expecting to see a number of things happening by those days you gave you went and sacrificed and All that you did was actually to burn your resources in fire. Now, well, now Solomon, the Bible shows that Solomon decided to go and sacrifice for the Lord because the Lord has given him a privilege out of grace to become a king. Well, so Solomon chose to go to a place called Gibon. Now, Gabon refers to a profound moment of divine visitation today in my message and directions that occurs when a person driven by sincere love and sacrificial worship possessions himself or themselves in a place of encounter with God. Now, Solomon chose to go to a place called Gibon, not because there were no other places, because as I'm going to review to you, there were other places that Solomon could have gone, but Solomon chooses to go all the way to Gibon, which was seven miles away northwest of Jerusalem just to go and sacrifice there. Solomon is possessioning himself to have an encounter with the Lord. This particular time Solomon is not looking for blessings. Solomon is going to thank the Lord for the blessings the Lord has given him. Now Solomon comes all the way. He climbs a hill to Gibon and there Solomon sacrifices to the Lord. The Bible says when Solomon sacrifice and of course you check in verse number four you the kind of sacrifice Solomon is giving. The Bible says he gave a thousand band offering. Now when you see this thing being recorded in the Bible, you've got to know it is not something to joke about. You know, just one sacrifice, just one lump, just one goat, just one bull was enough to enable you to worship the Lord and receive acceptance from the Lord. God never expected you to do more than just one sacrifice. Now this particular time Solomon decides to go all the way to Gibon. Seven miles walking to go to sacrifice. Not one bull, not two bulls, a thousand bulls, slaying them one after the other, laying them on the altar, burning, slaughtering another one, laying on the fire, burning, slaughtering another one, laying on the altar, burning. One to a thousand bulls are burnt on the altar just because of the love Solomon has for the Lord. Now let me tell us friends today I'm talking about the Gibian moment and I am going to show you what is going to happen in the church because of what you have done for the Lord. Wait a minute. Just sit and relax because today you may also have your Gibian moment. You see friends, now the Bible says in verse number five, while Solomon was burning the offerings in Gibon after he was done with a thousand bull, burning it in the altar, he retreated. He went back and slept. Of course he slept in Gibon because it was uh no the seven miles those days the kind of animals Solomon is walking a thousand boos and servants is having to go there. You can imagine the kind of the place they were walking in. So the historians said it was about a whole day walk. There's no way Solomon would have gone back the same day to Jerusalem. So he slept at Gabriel. Now while sleeping there the Bible says the Lord appeared to Solomon in Gibon. Can somebody say amen? And when the Lord appeared to Solomon in Gibon the Bible says and God said to Solomon ask Solomon I have been witnessing what you've been doing the whole day in my altar. I have seen the sacrifice. I've seen the kind of sacrifice Solomon I could not sit in heaven when you are out for me in this big way I have been prompted to come to ask you what troubles you Solomon what makes you do this kind of things what makes you go to such kind of loss Solomon ask anything you want Solomon shall satisfy your heart today well it is in that context Solomon asked for wisdom. Can somebody say amen? Today we talk about Solomon as man of wisdom. But not many people pay attention to the events that led to Solomon asking wisdom. Now Solomon never intended, never planned to ask wisdom from the Lord. Solomon was moved by the overflowing of his love as he saw the grace of God in his life and he went out of his way to sacrifice for the Lord. But let me tell you friends, there are some sacrifices you make. They prompt God. That is what I've seen the church. Such kind of sacrifices cannot be just a sacrifice. They they touch God somewhere that he cannot sit. They touch God somewhere that he has to rise and work not to to see but to come. He will never send an angel. When you do such kind of a sacrifice, the Lord himself does not speak from heaven. He comes to you. Bible tells me Solomon was visitant in the night because of the sacrifice he made to the Lord. Let me pause here and say somebody in that church going to be visited one of these nights by the Lord just because of the pain you went through the sacrifice. I know some of you and to postpone paying bills, make your family comfortable. Some of you and and to go all the way to borrowing money just to bring to the house of the Lord. And I see the Lord wherever is sitting in heaven is asking what troubles you my child? What troubles you my daughter? What troubles you my son? Oh, when you do such kind of things, I can't assume this is business as usual. I must come and have a little conversation with you. a given moment the Lord comes down. You see friends, verse number three. H as I was studying this particular passage you know I was asking myself what what made what made Solomon you know I I I I went and was searching to see in in in equivalent of our today's currency in this country how much would have been this refund as a thousand sacrifice and you can check everywhere the internet they'll talk about about 150 million Kenyan sharings. That is what Solomon carried from his palace all the way to the dirt street going up the hill of Gibon and he lay 150 Kenyan chillion lay them on the fire and burnt them. Who does that in the name of God? who carries 150 million and lay them on fire and light them up and sit watching them burning burning smoke is going up and become ashes and then you smile say oh my heart is satisfied who does that Solomon hallelujah somebody Solomon will do that for the Lord now you see friends so verse number three answered my question what was pushing Solomon the Bible says Read with me. And Solomon loved the Lord. And Solomon loved the Lord. And Solomon loved the Lord. Friends, let me tell you. Let me tell you that love is the purest motive in the kingdom of God. There is nothing that matches with love. No wonder for so much God loved the world. And it was because of love that God gave all that he had his only son. Where there is love, there is no counting of cost. Where there is true love, there's no counting of expense. Where there's true love, everything is appropriate. I can do it because I love the Bible tells me Solomon loved the Lord. And because of that love, Solomon poured 150 million on fire and sat watching them burn and praising the Lord. When you love, nothing will be difficult for you when you come to the house of the Lord. Can somebody say amen? You see, friends, love transforms sacrifice from a burden to a privilege. When you love someone, even in our associations today, we go far and wide extra miles. We spend, we cross continents, we fly up high in the skies, we go through the seas in the name of love. When you laugh, you become crazy. Have you loved? Have you loved? Did you see how crazy you became? And now look to that person next to you at them. Ask them, "Have you loved?" I don't know whether it's me. At times love troubles me. I don't know. I don't know. You You look like you are never bothered when when when when when but but but I love to be loved. I love to be loved. Love is sweet. And when you're loved, you also can't just sit there looking someone I love you. And no. When Solomon demon, you know, Solomon did not tell God, God, you know, I love you. You know, God, you're so good. No, Solomon moved from the lips ministry to a serious ministry. He came to demonstrate his love to God by offering what everyone thought was crazy to the Lord. Because how much can you say as much when you give to the Lord? Deon says, "What shall I give unto the Lord for his goodness and benefit to me?" He said, "Nothing. And you remember Solomon is a son of David. There is something about love because we spoke here last Sabbath. pastor preach about it Sabbath and I also mentioned about the Sabbath in the book of 1 Chronicles chapter 29 and we saw in especially verse number three where the Bible was speaking about David and the Bible says and David set his heart he says I have set my affection in the house of the Lord the things I'm going to do don't ask me why I'm doing These things I am doing them in the name of love. Is somebody with me? And the Bible showed us that Sabbath that says way and above what I had committed myself to do now because of love out of love I am going to give out of my special treasure all that is needed in the house of the Lord. Love is the principle that motivate us to come before the Lord. He says, "I have set my heart. May affection my affection in the house of the Lord." You see friends, the Hebrew phrase affection has a deep meaning for deep love, longing and desire. Now, sometimes when you feel like you're pushed to give, when you feel like you're being pressured and necessary to give, when you feel like you need to resist, there's giving, maybe the problem is not in the words that were used to tell you how to give. But no, no, no. Maybe the problem is not in the messaging. Maybe maybe the problem could be in your heart. Maybe maybe maybe maybe maybe your love for God is too cold. You you've not been warmed up inside to see because those who have been warmed up by the love of God, they don't wear to be told to give. They always look for opportunities. Even when there seem to be no opportunity. No, no. Let me remind you that no one asked Solomon to give. God never asked Solomon to go and sacrifice. Solomon sat in his house. He saw the blessings. He saw the benefits the Lord has for his life and he chose to go out of his way not just to sacrifice but to give a fat extravagant sacrifice. And the Lord says no no these things can only be done by God or some angels in heaven. When a man does this, he invites God to come down on earth. You see friends, what I'm finding here this morning is that the given moment is the desired experience God is looking for in his sanctuary today. God is looking for a spirit that will agitate people, ignite their commitment that they will be sacrificially, you know, a person of the voluntary, you know, come before the Lord without coercion, without being pushed just to come not to give to be seen, but to give to glorify the father in heaven. Now when such a giving has been done, God comes down. So it is love and Solomon loved the Lord. I ask person next to you look at them ask them do you love God? No, no, no, no, no, no, no. You, just just help me to preach the sermon. Just look at them. Just look at Don't fear. Don't fear. They won't do anything to you. By the way, these people are good. So, don't fear them. Don't fear them. Just look straight on their eyes and ask them, "Did you love God?" Now, they may not respond to you, but I want to let you know now I know that you love the Lord. How I saw you come in big numbers and with your sacrifices in the house of the Lord. that manner you brought that's a testament that indeed you love the Lord and because you love the Lord something is going to happen let me just talk about a few things that love will always do in your life shifts perspectives love shift perspectives Solomon was deeply engaged in love for his God and because of that it has shifted his perspective of worship and of giving and sacrificing he said I know They have access to give just one sacrifice but for me no I will go all the way out on my way I'm going to give a thousand boos and burn them in fire for my Lord when you are deeply in love it changes a shift perspective where love takes over your vision clears what once felt burdensome now feels beautiful and easy what once seemed foolish now makes perfect sense have you seen how we struggle with young people. They know you know you know I don't think I need to say this. I don't need let me say it. Let me say it. But I'll answer what I'm saying. So I I I took I took a girlfriend to my father. Is somebody with me? You know what I'm talking about? So I went and I made sure it was a perfect evening and everyone had gone to sleep. So it was I had a date with him. So it was me and my dad and uh you know I so what is it? So I told him you know that um I feel um I need to make that step. So and calmly he asked me and so who is she? And I told her him the name and and it says but but that that name does does sound like like anyone from our community here. I said yes yes yes she's not from this place but but but I I I I love her. And my dad asked me uh uh uh are you sure of what you saying? Uh-huh. All these girls here. And then you know this is what he did. This was sitting all these girls here. All it is is in the night. It's in the night. All these girls here. All these girls here. All the All these girls. You mean you have not seen anyone? You have gone all the way. And I told him, "Daddy, there's no girl here. Which girl are you seeing? This you see one once you're in love once once you're in love it it changes your perspective you you see seeing things the way people are seeing them you can only appreciate them in the context of love and I was telling my father I am in love my father allow me to do this when you are in love as a way of shifting perspective so Solomon come before the Lord with an immense extravagant offering people wondering who does And because at that particular time the love that Solomon shares with his father with God has shifted the perspective. Is somebody with me? He will do it what people cannot see. Those who saw and I just remind you of that that woman who came and that that evening she interrupted the meeting. There was a dinner that evening Jesus was somewhere for a party and people were there dining and the woman comes in and she's carrying a bottle. She's carrying a bottle. comes and she kneels down at the feet of Jesus and then she breaks the the bottle and she pours all the oil on the on the feet of Jesus and people are watching and people you know their eyes saw the bottle this is an expensive st and this woman comes tonight to break it before and pour on the feet of Jesus who does this in fact somebody quickly said this one is worthy w for all how can you come and waste hm H. Oh, you have no idea. That woman was boiling inside. She was in love with Jesus. Doesn't matter how you look at it. Her perspective and shift hand. There's nothing expensive when you're giving it to the Lord. She poured and she poured. She poured and Jesus was there enjoying the massaging hands of this beautiful woman. She was there and the disciples were murmuring and complaining. And when it was enough, Jesus said, "Sh, enough is enough. She loves much. If you want to know why she and all this that appears west is because that how much her love for me is she loves much. Love changes perspective. Love number two, love is never minimal. Love is never min. I'm explain to you why you had to come and do the things you did. Where you to stop paying school fees for your daughter? Where you and to delay your landlord? Tell wait wait wait wait. The Lord has requested us to go to the sanctuary and give her this month my landlord. I'm not paying you. I am taking it to my now where I met. Why? Because love is never minimal. Is somebody with me this morning? You see this particular woman as she interrupted this meeting? She was simply telling them to always do what is enough in your own eyes. But by the way, did you know is isn't what so amazing? Is this something that you need to learn that Jesus never resisted? Hello somebody. Okay, this is what I mean. Even if you brought your entire estate, all your savings that you have ever put in place since you began walking and you bring them to the house of the Lord, God, you never say, "No, no, no. What are you doing? How you planning to leave and feed your family?" God will receive. Is somebody with me this morning? God will receive gladly rejoicing. And anyone who want to stop that blessing God will say no leave them because they have such love. Now the woman pours everything. But you know what? Before she left that place, the woman who was condemned, the woman who was approached, who was branded, who had no space in the sanctuary in the kingdom of God, that very moment, her all our sins were forgiven. Can somebody say amen? All our sins were forgiven. Now the time Jesus has done from appreciating an offering, she was the only righteous person from Jesus in that room. She walked back home not only forgiven her sins but her life transformed and never again did this woman go back to her industry. That's why today we have got to go back talking about her because she has an influence in the kingdom. love much and the Lord will come in a big way because love never looks for the lowest requirement. It is it aims for the highest expression. So Solomon he's going to do the highest expression on the great high place. You know the phrase the great high place makes reference to the fact that there were other high places. Gideon was the great high place. He would have gone to other high places but Gideon was the only great high praise. You you you know you know you know you know you know friends you know friends you know friends I wish I had time to let you know what Gibon was and how it came to be a place of worship. you you'd have appreciate more. But but God always love greatness. You are not with me. God always identifies with good things. God always identifies with greatness. Do not have a mindset of bringing leftovers to God. I'm glad that I've witnessed that today. You understand God does not take leftovers. God always rejoices when you give him the best. Solomon goes to the great high place and he brings great sacrifice. When you know that God dwells in a great high place, you will always bring to him a great sacrifice. Can somebody say amen? So what happened after this? Love empties bank accounts. Love goes extra mile. Love closes mountains. breaks cultural boundaries, empties bank accounts and silences pride all to reach the one it desires. If that's what we can do as human being, how much God is willing to go out of his way for you. I see in the strength he came in a big way for Solomon. Now I said this this day that God is going to come in a big way for you and your family. That's because of the sacrifice you have done. You see, Solomon went up the hill. Go. Solomon went up the hill. Love always pushes you upwards. Love always pushes you upwards. Love goes up. Love goes up. Love goes up. And when God sees love has left the pews, love has gone to the bank account. When God sees love has left the pews, love is going up. God does not sit to wait for your love to go all the way. God comes down. Can somebody say amen? When the love is going up, God is coming all the way. And you meet somewhere with the Lord. Solomon climbs high the mountain. God comes down to the hill. And that night was a wonderful experience. And and and did did you also notice that the Bible says God came to Solomon in the night when Solomon was dreaming. This is not for nothing. You see, God came, God did not want anything to interrupt this moment. This is not about what Solomon you gave. This is about a relationship. Solomon, I have come that we we may cement this relationship. And I come at a time in a moment when no one can interrupt you. I'm coming when you are silent, when you're reflecting. I'm coming when everything is silent on you. I want to have you and you alone. Solomon, this is not for the next door. This is for you, Solomon. Ask I've come. The Bible tells me. So my friend, I've just said three. I'm excited. So, so, so, so, so imagine, imagine, imagine child of God. God coming with a blank check. Says an answer. God comes with what? An open check. And he comes to the youth say, I saw how oh how this saw how you were selling baskets for me. Hey, no, no, no. Write any figure here. Hallelujah. Somebody write any favor here. Just just it's an open check. It's an open check. He came to Solomon asked Solomon ask anything. I don't know what Solomon asked whether it was good enough. But I think it was good enough. I don't know what you would have asked. May maybe I would have said uh God by for for us the Lord for for Rua. I don't know what I would have said. I don't I don't know. I don't know what I could have said. I don't know what you could have said. But but this morning I want to let you know God is coming down for you with an open check and I want to tell you watch my words. You will be here to witness. Maybe I will have left but watch this sermon today the things that are going to happen in this church. Just wait because God does not say things he does not mean. God does not play games with his people. When you go out of your way in a big way that you have done, God must come. I'm excited today that I'm praying and saying God as you come whether I have been somewhere in Meu or somewhere where I'll be gone. Please don't forgive forget me. Remember I was part of this congregation. Just God just come come to my door. And as you're asking people, I also want to write I know the figures. I know the figures. I know the figures. My figure is written eternity. Hallelujah. My figure is written eternity. I want to have God give me the privilege after laboring all the way to be found in his kingdom. God is asking church after you have come out of your way for him. What do you want from him? Somebody has been struggling with his sickness for too long, but it has been waiting this moment. Now the Lord is not listening to your prayer from heaven. God is coming to your prayer room. And as soon when you're done praying, he's asking you ask. I don't know how true this is. I had a preacher preaching. So I'm online. If this is not true, just don't don't take it against me. So those days during the first president of this country there was a man from Nakuru who used to play codia you know codian and and and every state function he would go I said I don't know whether it's true I just want to preach preaching used to go and entertain the the president accordion so so one day the president jokinata was touched and and said can can you can you have that man come to state house so that man was invited to the state house and he sat there it was him and the president and the president asked him, "My friend, you've been entertaining me. You you you you're an expert in cion, what can I do for you?" Anyone who knows that story? Well, the preacher was preaching. Give me the story. He said, "That man said, the cordonion you see me playing, I always borrow it. I want you to buy me my personal accordion. Are you okay? And he happens to be a kiku. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. Are you you go before the president of the state of this country and he asking you what do you want from me? And you say give me a call. Are you foolish? So the story goes them died playing what? I don't know. I don't know. I'm simply feeling the Gibian moment in their sanctuary. The Lord is coming because of what you have done to him and he's coming with an open check and is asking you ask write any figure. Write any figure. Please do not write codian. Please please please please do not write code. Do you see? Look at this. Look at this. Look at this. Look at this. Look at this. Let's let's go finish this message. No. The Bible says Solomon asked for what? For wisdom. Read from verse number 11. Go there. Verse number 11. The Bible says, "Then God said to him, because you have asked this thing and have not asked for long life for yourself, nor have asked riches for yourself, nor have asked the life of your enemies, but have asked for yourself understanding to discern justice. Behold, I have done according to your words." See, I have given you a wise and understanding hurt, so that there has not been anyone like you before you, nor shall anyone like you arise after you. And I have also given you what you have not asked, both riches and honor, so that there shall not be anyone like you among the kings all your days. So if you walk in my ways to keep my statutes and my commandments as your father David walked then I will lengthen your days. God says Solomon what you have requested I have granted. He didn't say I'm going to think about it granted. Hallelujah somebody. What you are requesting today because of what you have done to the Lord God says granted. Look that person next to you and tell him or her granted. Granted. Granted. I've been asking for a spouse for too long. Granted. I've been asking for a business idea for too long. Granted. I've been asking for a promotion. My workstation is not a good place. I've been pushing you, God, that you may do something for me. Granted, I've been asking. What have you been asking? The God says, granted. And the Bible goes on to say, not just that, I'm giving you wisdom. But there's wisdom is different. Hallelujah. somebody this wisdom is different there will be no one with such kind of wisdom you have no idea there will be no the quality the quality of this wisdom that I've come to give you no one on earth will come in our clothes listen to me God when he gives his gift all his gifts are perfect when God comes to bless you no one will compete with you. No one will compare with you. When God comes to give you the breakthroughs that it could be your finances, God is going to bless you in a way no one listen to me. No one will come anywhere near you in terms of your blessedness. Bible goes on to say, "And God told him where over and above." Hallelujah. Somebody over and above what you have asked me. You went out of your way for me. You went an extra mile for me. You climbed the hill for me. I to reciprocate. I will go an extra mile for you. Not just wisdom but also wealth. I am giving you wealth. I'm giving you status. There will be no a king like you in all the days. This was a straight ticket to excellence. Solomon left the hill of Gibon assured that he's the greatest man in the universe. And so no wonder No wonder. No wonder the guy has the largest numbers of women. You know, you know, you don't you know the the kind of blessings that Solomon is enjoying. You see, listen to me. God is going to bless you. God is going to bless you. And those kind of blessings, you've never seen them before. They are coming. They are coming. The Lord is on his way from his throne. The Lord is descending to the mountain of Gib. Maybe maybe you have gone back to sleep, Solomon. After doing all that beautiful thing for the Lord, he went to sleep. Maybe you have also gone back to sleep. But the Lord will wake you to bless you even though you're sleeping. He does not need you to be wakeful when you have done such kind of a thing. Before you do it, he says, "Keep alert. Do not sleep. Do not sleep. Do not sleep. But when you have done it, it doesn't matter whether you're awake or sleeping. He shall come anywhere to bless you. The Gibian moment is what I now see in spirit coming to Nairobi Central Church. Are you ready for the Gideon moment? Are you ready for the blessings? Are you ready? Ask your sister, your brother next to you, say, ask them, are you ready? Are you ready? You know, one day he told the story in the book of duty, he told them, I'm going to bless you and the blessing shall overtake you. No, no, no, no. The the the Gibian moment is where No, no, not just normal blessing. It has experience where the blessings overtakes God's people. Watch this. Before we close this year, the testimonies we are going to get in this place, they will be extraordinary blessings. Extraordinary. I wish I'm the one who is blessing you, my elder. I would have already I don't know how much you would have blessed, but but I'm feeling I need to do it right now. But I wonder how God is feeling. If this is what I'm feeling, I wonder how much God is feeling and I can't wait. I'm agitated because I see the blessings are coming. They are not coming alone. They're not dropped like rain. No. You know, he says when you give t and offering, you open the doors and the windows what? Of heaven and do what? No. That is the normal giving of 10% that he just pour. He open the doors and he pours. There's nothing there. Everyone should be giving. But when you've gone out of your way, God closes all the doors in heaven. Closes all the windows of heaven so that no blessing escape and then he comes out from one door with every blessing he has in heaven. He comes all the way to you. It comes Lord and has tears you ask. All the treasure of heaven is here right with you today. Ask before I go. Ask. Do you know what I'm talking about? My friend Elder, are you understanding what I'm talking about? Now, I want to give you time today here. You go on your knees because the Lord is telling you, ask. Solomon didn't say, "I'm going to think about it." So, don't say that right now. I want to give you time. You can kneel down or you can see it. You can stand and respond to the Gibian moment. Ask, you may write that request. You may verbalize it in your mind, in your heart, but tell the Lord, just take a moment. I'm ask you to go into prayer and observe a moment and ask the Lord not for two things, for one thing. Because he says, when you have done that, I shall bless you and the blessing shall come, they shall be compressed, they shall be pressed together that they will be pressed together. He did not just ask for everything. He asked for wisdom. But God brought all the things that Solomon needed. Even those he didn't know that he needed. Take a moment. Take a moment. Take a moment.

TIMESTAMPED TRANSCRIPT:
[0.6s] Now
[5.9s] today I want to go to the text of first
[10.9s] kings. First kings chapter 3 verse
[13.9s] number 3 and 5. Just go open there. The
[17.0s] text of first kings chapter 3 verse
[19.0s] number 3 and 5. That's where we're going
[20.8s] to have our reading this morning.
[26.2s] Chapter 3 of First Kings verse number
[29.4s] three and
[32.5s] five. The Bible says, "And
[36.3s] Solomon loved the
[39.0s] Lord, walking in the statues of his
[42.7s] father David, except that he sacrificed
[47.2s] and burned incense at the high
[51.2s] places." Verse four. Now the king went
[54.3s] to Gibon to sacrifice there for that was
[58.8s] a great high
[61.2s] place. Solomon offered a thousand burnt
[64.8s] offerings on the altar. Verse 5. At
[70.1s] Gabon, the Lord appeared to Solomon in a
[75.9s] dream by
[77.6s] night and God
[79.7s] said,
[82.4s] "Ask,
[84.9s] ask, ask,
[88.2s] what shall I give
[92.4s] you?" Ask.
[96.3s] At Gibon, the Lord appeared to Solomon
[99.2s] in a
[100.8s] dream by night and God said,
[104.7s] "Ask, what shall I give to you?" This
[110.0s] morning, our subject for this message is
[113.6s] the Gibian
[116.0s] moment. The Gibian moment. Let us pray.
[121.2s] Gracious Father in heaven, hallowed be
[123.9s] thy name, thy kingdom come.
[126.4s] Thy will be done in this place and for
[128.8s] this message as it is in heaven. For
[131.8s] thine is the kingdom, the power, and the
[134.8s] glory. You said, if you be lifted up,
[137.3s] you shall draw all men unto
[139.5s] yourself. And so, my father, this
[141.7s] morning I pray that may I not be
[144.3s] seen, may I not be heard, but may you be
[148.2s] seen and heard as you speak to your
[150.8s] children. as your servant and messenger.
[153.5s] My request, Father, is that you may put
[155.2s] your words into my
[156.7s] mouth and order my thoughts and me lips
[159.4s] to your will. In Jesus name I pray.
[164.0s] Amen. The
[166.0s] Gibon
[168.8s] moment. Friends, this message is
[172.3s] informed by the very brief message I've
[175.4s] given you about your
[177.8s] giving. I am preaching about you today.
[181.8s] So if you don't like pastor preaching
[183.3s] about you today, I'm preaching about
[184.7s] you.
[188.8s] And I don't know whether you've been in
[191.7s] a situations
[195.0s] where
[199.0s] God and his
[202.3s] presence broke
[205.1s] through unexpectedly when you were just
[208.0s] busy doing what you have to do for him
[210.6s] and boom, the Lord appears to
[213.9s] you not with judgment.
[216.8s] but with the
[219.3s] blessings.
[221.7s] Solomon lives in some place in
[226.5s] Jerusalem. And this is a boy, there's a
[229.2s] gentleman's a man who has been brought
[231.0s] up in a family that free as God has been
[234.2s] introduced to the worship of true God.
[237.0s] And of course, he knows that God had
[238.6s] chosen him to to build the sanctuary
[241.6s] because his father was not able to do
[243.9s] that. Now his father must have taken a
[246.2s] lot of time trying to educate this young
[248.2s] man on the importance of worshiping but
[250.9s] also importance of giving and
[252.9s] sacrificing for the Lord. Now the Bible
[256.6s] says that when Solomon came to
[260.3s] power, the very onset of his
[264.4s] reign, Solomon chose to go to a place
[268.7s] not just to worship on a Sabbath but to
[272.1s] go and offer
[274.2s] sacrifice. You see those days friends
[277.2s] know sacrifices was very central in
[280.8s] terms of worship. And when we're talking
[283.3s] about sacrifices in the Old Testament,
[285.6s] we are not just talking about you know
[287.8s] giving tithe and offering that we do
[289.4s] these days. It was serious sacrifice
[292.5s] where you would take animals your
[295.3s] possession go and lay on altar and burn
[299.4s] you know you know these days these days
[301.7s] you give your offerings you give your
[303.3s] tithes we don't go and burn them but we
[306.5s] go and use them perhaps like you have
[308.3s] given your offering you're waiting to
[309.9s] see some pains who are coming up you you
[312.3s] expecting to see pews changing you're
[314.1s] expecting to see a number of things
[315.5s] happening by those days you gave you
[318.1s] went and sacrificed and All that you did
[320.6s] was actually to burn your resources in
[324.1s] fire. Now, well, now Solomon, the Bible
[327.7s] shows that Solomon decided to go and
[329.7s] sacrifice for the Lord because the Lord
[332.3s] has given him a privilege out of grace
[335.7s] to become a
[337.5s] king. Well, so Solomon chose to go to a
[342.2s] place called Gibon.
[347.3s] Now,
[349.6s] Gabon refers to a profound moment of
[353.5s] divine visitation today in my
[356.4s] message and directions that occurs when
[360.9s] a person driven by sincere love and
[364.6s] sacrificial worship possessions himself
[367.6s] or themselves in a place of encounter
[370.9s] with God. Now, Solomon chose to go to a
[375.0s] place called Gibon, not because there
[377.0s] were no other places, because as I'm
[379.1s] going to review to you, there were other
[380.9s] places that Solomon could have gone, but
[383.2s] Solomon chooses to go all the way to
[385.7s] Gibon, which was seven miles away
[388.8s] northwest of Jerusalem just to go and
[391.4s] sacrifice there. Solomon is
[393.9s] possessioning himself to have an
[396.8s] encounter with the Lord. This particular
[399.7s] time Solomon is not looking for
[402.5s] blessings. Solomon is going to thank the
[405.4s] Lord for the blessings the Lord has
[407.3s] given him. Now Solomon comes all the
[410.5s] way. He climbs a hill to Gibon and there
[414.0s] Solomon sacrifices to the Lord. The
[417.7s] Bible says when Solomon sacrifice and of
[421.2s] course you check in verse number four
[423.2s] you the kind of sacrifice Solomon is
[425.6s] giving. The Bible says he gave a
[428.0s] thousand band offering. Now when you see
[432.2s] this thing being recorded in the Bible,
[434.0s] you've got to know it is not something
[435.8s] to joke about. You know, just one
[439.3s] sacrifice, just one lump, just one goat,
[443.4s] just one bull was enough to enable you
[446.8s] to worship the Lord and receive
[449.6s] acceptance from the Lord. God never
[452.8s] expected you to do more than just one
[454.9s] sacrifice. Now this particular time
[457.5s] Solomon decides to go all the way to
[460.4s] Gibon. Seven miles walking to go to
[464.2s] sacrifice. Not one bull, not two bulls,
[467.6s] a thousand bulls, slaying them one after
[470.6s] the other, laying them on the altar,
[473.0s] burning, slaughtering another one,
[475.1s] laying on the fire, burning,
[476.9s] slaughtering another one, laying on the
[478.6s] altar, burning. One to a thousand bulls
[483.3s] are burnt on the altar just because of
[487.3s] the love Solomon has for the Lord. Now
[490.6s] let me tell us
[491.7s] friends today I'm talking about the
[494.5s] Gibian moment and I am going to show you
[497.4s] what is going to happen in the church
[500.1s] because of what you have done for the
[502.5s] Lord. Wait a minute. Just sit and relax
[504.6s] because today you may also have your
[507.0s] Gibian moment. You see
[510.0s] friends, now the Bible says in verse
[512.7s] number five, while Solomon was burning
[517.0s] the
[518.0s] offerings in Gibon after he was done
[521.8s] with a thousand bull, burning it in the
[525.4s] altar, he retreated. He went back and
[529.4s] slept. Of course he slept in Gibon
[531.8s] because it was uh no the seven miles
[534.6s] those days the kind of animals Solomon
[537.8s] is walking a thousand boos and servants
[540.5s] is having to go there. You can imagine
[542.2s] the kind of the place they were walking
[543.7s] in. So the historians said it was about
[546.2s] a whole day walk. There's no way Solomon
[548.6s] would have gone back the same day to
[550.2s] Jerusalem. So he slept at Gabriel. Now
[553.0s] while sleeping there the Bible says the
[555.8s] Lord appeared to Solomon in Gibon. Can
[560.1s] somebody say amen? And when the Lord
[562.1s] appeared to Solomon in Gibon the Bible
[564.6s] says and God said to
[568.2s] Solomon
[571.2s] ask Solomon I have been witnessing what
[573.9s] you've been doing the whole day in my
[576.0s] altar. I have seen the sacrifice. I've
[578.7s] seen the kind of sacrifice Solomon I
[581.7s] could not sit in heaven when you are out
[585.2s] for me in this big way I have been
[588.0s] prompted to come to ask you what
[590.8s] troubles you Solomon what makes you do
[593.0s] this kind of things what makes you go to
[594.9s] such kind of loss Solomon ask anything
[598.1s] you want Solomon shall satisfy your
[601.4s] heart
[603.0s] today
[604.6s] well it is in that context Solomon asked
[609.9s] for wisdom. Can somebody say amen? Today
[612.9s] we talk about Solomon as man of wisdom.
[615.0s] But not many people pay attention to the
[617.7s] events that led to Solomon asking
[621.4s] wisdom. Now Solomon never intended,
[625.0s] never planned to ask wisdom from the
[627.0s] Lord. Solomon was moved by the
[630.0s] overflowing of his love as he saw the
[633.0s] grace of God in his life and he went out
[635.8s] of his way to sacrifice for the Lord.
[638.6s] But let me tell you friends, there are
[640.6s] some sacrifices you
[642.8s] make. They prompt
[646.2s] God. That is what I've seen the church.
[650.1s] Such kind of
[651.6s] sacrifices cannot be just a sacrifice.
[654.8s] They they touch God somewhere that he
[657.4s] cannot sit. They touch God somewhere
[659.7s] that he has to rise and work not to to
[662.3s] see but to come. He will never send an
[665.0s] angel. When you do such kind of a
[666.9s] sacrifice, the Lord himself does not
[669.9s] speak from heaven. He comes to you.
[674.3s] Bible tells me
[676.8s] Solomon was visitant in the night
[680.3s] because of the sacrifice he made to the
[684.4s] Lord. Let me pause here and say
[688.1s] somebody in that
[690.7s] church going to be visited one of these
[693.5s] nights by the Lord just because of the
[696.1s] pain you went through the sacrifice. I
[698.7s] know some of you and to postpone paying
[702.3s] bills, make your family comfortable.
[705.0s] Some of you and and to go all the way to
[707.6s] borrowing money just to bring to the
[710.0s] house of the Lord. And I see the Lord
[712.2s] wherever is sitting in heaven is asking
[714.4s] what troubles you my child? What
[716.6s] troubles you my daughter? What troubles
[718.6s] you my son? Oh, when you do such kind of
[721.2s] things, I can't assume this is business
[723.5s] as usual. I must come and have a little
[726.0s] conversation with you.
[729.0s] a given
[730.2s] moment the Lord comes down. You see
[735.2s] friends, verse number three.
[739.1s] H as I was studying this particular
[741.4s] passage you know I was asking myself
[742.9s] what what made what made
[746.4s] Solomon you know I I I I went and was
[749.2s] searching to
[750.4s] see in in in equivalent of our today's
[754.2s] currency in this country how much would
[757.4s] have been this refund as a thousand
[760.1s] sacrifice and you can check everywhere
[762.5s] the internet they'll talk about
[765.5s] about 150 million
[768.0s] Kenyan sharings. That is what Solomon
[770.6s] carried from his palace all the way to
[774.0s] the dirt street going up the hill of
[776.4s] Gibon and he
[778.7s] lay 150 Kenyan chillion lay them on the
[782.9s] fire and burnt them. Who does
[787.2s] that in the name of
[790.0s] God? who carries 150 million and lay
[794.0s] them on fire and light them up and sit
[797.6s] watching them burning burning smoke is
[801.0s] going up and become ashes and then you
[803.1s] smile say oh my heart is satisfied who
[806.1s] does
[808.5s] that Solomon hallelujah somebody Solomon
[812.9s] will do that for the Lord now you see
[815.6s] friends so verse number three answered
[818.1s] my question what was pushing Solomon the
[820.3s] Bible says Read with me. And Solomon
[823.9s] loved the Lord. And Solomon loved the
[829.6s] Lord. And Solomon loved the Lord.
[833.3s] Friends, let me tell you. Let me tell
[835.5s] you that love is the purest motive in
[840.2s] the kingdom of God. There is nothing
[843.4s] that matches with love. No wonder for so
[846.9s] much God loved the world. And it was
[849.1s] because of love that God gave all that
[852.1s] he had his only son. Where there is
[855.3s] love, there is no counting of cost.
[858.3s] Where there is true love, there's no
[860.6s] counting of expense. Where there's true
[863.0s] love, everything is appropriate. I can
[866.6s] do it because I love the Bible tells me
[869.8s] Solomon loved the Lord. And because of
[873.0s] that love, Solomon
[875.2s] poured 150 million on fire and sat
[879.4s] watching them burn and praising the
[882.4s] Lord. When you
[884.8s] love,
[886.4s] nothing will be difficult for you when
[889.4s] you come to the house of the Lord. Can
[890.6s] somebody say amen? You see, friends,
[893.3s] love transforms sacrifice from a burden
[896.7s] to a privilege. When you love someone,
[899.8s] even in our associations today, we go
[903.2s] far and wide extra miles. We spend, we
[906.4s] cross continents, we fly up high in the
[908.9s] skies, we go through the seas in the
[911.2s] name of love. When you laugh, you become
[915.7s] crazy. Have you
[918.3s] loved? Have you
[920.5s] loved? Did you see how crazy you
[923.3s] became? And now look to that person next
[925.6s] to you at them.
[928.2s] Ask them, "Have you
[932.0s] loved?" I don't know whether it's me. At
[934.6s] times love troubles me. I don't know. I
[936.9s] don't know. You You look like you are
[938.3s] never
[939.0s] bothered when when when when when but
[941.8s] but but I love to be
[943.9s] loved. I love to be loved. Love is
[947.2s] sweet. And when you're loved, you also
[950.4s] can't just sit there looking someone I
[952.4s] love you.
[953.6s] And no. When Solomon demon, you know,
[957.4s] Solomon did not tell God, God, you know,
[959.3s] I love you. You know, God, you're so
[961.6s] good. No, Solomon moved from the lips
[965.0s] ministry to a serious ministry. He came
[968.0s] to demonstrate his love to God by
[971.8s] offering what everyone thought was crazy
[974.6s] to the Lord. Because how much can you
[977.3s] say as much when you give to the Lord?
[979.1s] Deon says, "What shall I give unto the
[980.8s] Lord for his goodness and benefit to
[982.4s] me?" He said, "Nothing.
[987.4s] And you
[989.5s] remember
[991.6s] Solomon is a son of David. There is
[995.0s] something about love because we spoke
[997.5s] here last Sabbath. pastor preach about
[999.0s] it Sabbath and I also mentioned about
[1000.6s] the Sabbath in the book of 1 Chronicles
[1002.5s] chapter 29 and we saw in especially
[1005.4s] verse number three where the Bible was
[1007.1s] speaking about David and the Bible says
[1009.4s] and David
[1012.6s] set his
[1016.4s] heart he says I have set my affection in
[1021.4s] the house of the Lord the things I'm
[1024.9s] going to do don't ask me why I'm doing
[1027.8s] These things I am doing them in the name
[1031.2s] of love. Is somebody with me? And the
[1033.5s] Bible showed us that Sabbath that says
[1037.7s] way and above what I had committed
[1040.2s] myself to do now because of love out of
[1043.2s] love I am going to give out of my
[1045.8s] special treasure all that is needed in
[1049.4s] the house of the Lord. Love is the
[1052.3s] principle that motivate us to come
[1054.8s] before the Lord.
[1057.6s] He says, "I have set my heart. May
[1059.1s] affection my affection in the house of
[1061.0s] the Lord." You see friends, the Hebrew
[1064.7s] phrase affection has a deep meaning for
[1068.3s] deep love, longing and desire.
[1072.6s] Now, sometimes when you feel like you're
[1075.0s] pushed to
[1076.7s] give, when you feel like you're being
[1078.8s] pressured and necessary to give, when
[1081.6s] you feel like you need to resist,
[1084.2s] there's
[1086.8s] giving, maybe the problem is not in the
[1089.6s] words that were used to tell you how to
[1091.8s] give. But no, no, no. Maybe the problem
[1094.2s] is not in the messaging. Maybe maybe the
[1097.4s] problem could be in your heart. Maybe
[1100.0s] maybe maybe maybe maybe your love for
[1102.3s] God is too cold. You you've not been
[1105.0s] warmed up inside to see because those
[1107.8s] who have been warmed up by the love of
[1109.6s] God, they don't wear to be told to give.
[1112.7s] They always look for opportunities. Even
[1115.0s] when there seem to be no opportunity.
[1116.6s] No, no. Let me remind you that no one
[1118.6s] asked Solomon to give. God never asked
[1121.6s] Solomon to go and sacrifice. Solomon sat
[1124.3s] in his house. He saw the blessings. He
[1126.6s] saw the benefits the Lord has for his
[1128.4s] life and he chose to go out of his way
[1130.8s] not just to sacrifice but to give a fat
[1134.9s] extravagant sacrifice. And the Lord says
[1138.9s] no no these things can only be done by
[1142.2s] God or some angels in heaven. When a man
[1145.3s] does this, he invites God to come down
[1148.5s] on earth. You see friends, what I'm
[1151.0s] finding here this morning is that the
[1153.8s] given moment is the desired experience
[1158.2s] God is looking for in his sanctuary
[1160.6s] today. God is looking for a spirit that
[1164.5s] will agitate people, ignite their
[1167.7s] commitment that they will be
[1170.0s] sacrificially, you know, a person of the
[1172.5s] voluntary, you know, come before the
[1174.4s] Lord without coercion, without being
[1176.6s] pushed just to come not to give to be
[1179.4s] seen, but to give to glorify the father
[1182.8s] in
[1183.5s] heaven. Now when such a giving has been
[1187.4s] done, God comes down. So it is love and
[1192.1s] Solomon loved the Lord. I ask person
[1196.2s] next to you look at them ask them do you
[1198.2s] love God?
[1202.0s] No, no, no, no, no, no, no. You, just
[1203.1s] just help me to preach the sermon. Just
[1204.6s] look at them. Just look at Don't fear.
[1206.0s] Don't fear. They won't do anything to
[1207.4s] you. By the way, these people are good.
[1208.9s] So, don't fear them. Don't fear them.
[1210.6s] Just look straight on their eyes and ask
[1212.2s] them, "Did you love
[1217.1s] God?" Now, they may not respond to you,
[1219.8s] but I want to let you know now I know
[1221.8s] that you love the Lord. How I saw you
[1224.9s] come in big numbers and with your
[1227.0s] sacrifices in the house of the Lord.
[1229.6s] that manner you brought that's a
[1232.2s] testament that indeed you love the
[1236.0s] Lord and because you love the Lord
[1238.4s] something is going to happen let me just
[1239.8s] talk about a few things that love will
[1241.4s] always do in your life shifts
[1244.8s] perspectives love shift perspectives
[1247.9s] Solomon was deeply engaged in love for
[1251.6s] his God and because of that it has
[1253.9s] shifted his perspective of worship and
[1256.2s] of giving and sacrificing he said I know
[1259.2s] They have access to give just one
[1261.0s] sacrifice but for me no I will go all
[1264.6s] the way out on my way I'm going to give
[1267.4s] a thousand boos and burn them in fire
[1270.8s] for my Lord when you are deeply in love
[1274.7s] it changes a shift perspective where
[1277.2s] love takes over your vision clears what
[1280.0s] once felt burdensome now feels beautiful
[1283.1s] and easy what once seemed foolish now
[1285.8s] makes perfect sense have you seen how we
[1289.0s] struggle with young people. They know
[1290.2s] you know you
[1293.5s] know I don't think I need to say
[1298.0s] this. I don't need let me say it. Let me
[1300.6s] say it. But I'll answer what I'm saying.
[1304.5s] So I I I took I took a girlfriend to my
[1310.4s] father. Is somebody with me? You know
[1313.4s] what I'm talking about?
[1315.5s] So I went and I made sure it was a
[1317.8s] perfect evening and everyone had gone to
[1319.7s] sleep. So it was I had a date with him.
[1321.6s] So it was me and my dad and uh you know
[1323.8s] I so what is it? So I told him you know
[1326.4s] that um I feel um I need to make that
[1329.4s] step. So and calmly he asked me and so
[1333.0s] who is
[1334.4s] she? And I told her him the name and and
[1338.7s] it says but but that that name does does
[1341.5s] sound like like anyone from our
[1345.8s] community
[1347.3s] here. I said yes yes yes she's not from
[1350.8s] this place but but but I I I I love her.
[1354.3s] And my dad asked me uh uh uh are you
[1358.1s] sure of what you saying? Uh-huh. All
[1360.6s] these girls here. And then you know this
[1362.2s] is what he did. This was sitting all
[1364.6s] these girls here. All it is is in the
[1366.7s] night. It's in the night. All these
[1369.0s] girls here. All these girls here. All
[1374.0s] the All these girls. You mean you have
[1377.0s] not seen anyone? You have gone all the
[1379.6s] way. And I told him, "Daddy, there's no
[1381.8s] girl here. Which girl are you seeing?
[1383.8s] This you see one once you're in love
[1386.9s] once once you're in love it it changes
[1390.4s] your perspective you you see seeing
[1392.8s] things the way people are seeing them
[1394.6s] you can only appreciate them in the
[1396.6s] context of love and I was telling my
[1398.6s] father I am in love my father allow me
[1401.4s] to do this when you are in love as a way
[1405.2s] of shifting perspective so Solomon come
[1408.0s] before the Lord with an immense
[1409.9s] extravagant offering people wondering
[1412.3s] who does And because at that particular
[1414.8s] time the love that Solomon shares with
[1417.7s] his father with God has shifted the
[1420.2s] perspective. Is somebody with me? He
[1422.4s] will do it what people cannot see. Those
[1425.5s] who saw and I just remind you of that
[1428.1s] that woman who came and that that
[1429.4s] evening she interrupted the meeting.
[1431.4s] There was a dinner that evening Jesus
[1433.8s] was somewhere for a party and people
[1435.7s] were there dining and the woman comes in
[1438.4s] and she's carrying a bottle. She's
[1440.0s] carrying a bottle. comes and she kneels
[1442.0s] down at the feet of Jesus and then she
[1444.1s] breaks the the bottle and she pours all
[1447.4s] the oil on the on the feet of Jesus and
[1449.9s] people are watching and people you know
[1451.8s] their eyes saw the bottle this is an
[1454.2s] expensive st and this woman comes
[1456.4s] tonight to break it before and pour on
[1458.7s] the feet of Jesus who does this in fact
[1461.8s] somebody quickly said this one is worthy
[1464.6s] w for all how can you come and
[1469.2s] waste hm H. Oh, you have no idea. That
[1473.3s] woman was boiling inside. She was in
[1475.8s] love with Jesus. Doesn't matter how you
[1477.9s] look at it. Her perspective and shift
[1480.0s] hand. There's nothing expensive when
[1482.1s] you're giving it to the Lord. She poured
[1484.6s] and she poured. She poured and Jesus was
[1487.8s] there enjoying the massaging hands of
[1490.4s] this beautiful woman. She was there and
[1492.7s] the disciples were murmuring and
[1494.6s] complaining. And when it was enough,
[1496.9s] Jesus said, "Sh, enough is enough.
[1500.6s] She loves
[1503.0s] much. If you want to know why she and
[1505.8s] all this that appears west is because
[1508.9s] that how much her love for me is she
[1512.5s] loves
[1516.7s] much. Love changes
[1520.0s] perspective. Love number two, love is
[1523.0s] never minimal. Love is never min. I'm
[1525.8s] explain to you why you had to come and
[1527.5s] do the things you did. Where you to stop
[1529.8s] paying school fees for your daughter?
[1531.5s] Where you and to delay your landlord?
[1533.1s] Tell wait wait wait wait. The Lord has
[1535.1s] requested us to go to the sanctuary and
[1537.0s] give her this month my landlord. I'm not
[1538.9s] paying you. I am taking it to my now
[1541.0s] where I met. Why? Because love is never
[1545.4s] minimal. Is somebody with me this
[1546.6s] morning? You see this particular woman
[1550.5s] as she interrupted this meeting? She was
[1553.4s] simply telling
[1556.4s] them to always do what is enough in your
[1560.1s] own eyes. But by the way, did you know
[1563.4s] is isn't what so amazing? Is this
[1565.3s] something that you need to learn that
[1567.0s] Jesus never
[1569.4s] resisted? Hello
[1572.8s] somebody. Okay, this is what I
[1575.6s] mean. Even if you brought your entire
[1579.9s] estate, all your savings that you have
[1582.9s] ever put in place since you began
[1584.9s] walking and you bring them to the house
[1587.1s] of the Lord, God, you never say, "No,
[1588.6s] no, no. What are you
[1589.7s] doing? How you planning to leave and
[1592.2s] feed your family?" God will receive. Is
[1595.3s] somebody with me this morning? God will
[1597.7s] receive gladly rejoicing. And anyone who
[1600.8s] want to stop that blessing God will say
[1602.5s] no leave them because they have
[1606.7s] such love. Now the woman pours
[1609.4s] everything. But you know what? Before
[1611.4s] she left that place, the woman who was
[1614.0s] condemned, the woman who was approached,
[1616.4s] who was branded, who had no space in the
[1619.0s] sanctuary in the kingdom of God, that
[1621.4s] very moment, her all our sins were
[1625.0s] forgiven. Can somebody say amen? All our
[1627.8s] sins were forgiven. Now the time Jesus
[1630.8s] has done from appreciating an offering,
[1633.9s] she was the only righteous person from
[1637.0s] Jesus in that
[1639.6s] room. She walked back home not only
[1643.4s] forgiven her sins but her life
[1646.5s] transformed and never again did this
[1650.2s] woman go back to her industry. That's
[1652.7s] why today we have got to go back talking
[1654.7s] about her because she has an influence
[1656.7s] in the kingdom.
[1660.8s] love much and the Lord will come in a
[1666.9s] big
[1667.6s] way because love never looks for the
[1670.2s] lowest requirement. It is it aims for
[1674.0s] the highest expression. So Solomon he's
[1677.4s] going to do the highest expression on
[1679.9s] the great high place. You know the
[1681.9s] phrase the great high place makes
[1684.4s] reference to the fact that there were
[1686.4s] other high places. Gideon was the great
[1691.0s] high place. He would have gone to other
[1694.3s] high places but Gideon was the only
[1697.4s] great high praise. You you you know you
[1700.2s] know you know you know you know friends
[1701.5s] you know friends you know friends I wish
[1702.6s] I had time to let you know what Gibon
[1705.0s] was and how it came to be a place of
[1707.1s] worship. you you'd have appreciate more.
[1709.7s] But but God always love
[1714.9s] greatness. You are not with me. God
[1718.1s] always identifies with good things. God
[1721.4s] always identifies with greatness. Do not
[1725.7s] have a mindset of bringing leftovers to
[1728.2s] God. I'm glad that I've witnessed that
[1730.9s] today. You understand God does not take
[1733.8s] leftovers. God always rejoices when you
[1736.8s] give him the best. Solomon goes to the
[1739.7s] great high place and he brings great
[1743.2s] sacrifice. When you know that God dwells
[1746.5s] in a great high place, you will always
[1748.7s] bring to him a great sacrifice. Can
[1751.0s] somebody say
[1752.0s] amen? So what happened after
[1755.6s] this? Love empties bank accounts. Love
[1759.8s] goes extra mile. Love closes mountains.
[1764.3s] breaks cultural boundaries, empties bank
[1766.6s] accounts and silences
[1769.3s] pride all to reach the one it desires.
[1772.3s] If that's what we can do as human being,
[1775.1s] how much God is willing to go out of his
[1777.4s] way for you. I see in the strength he
[1779.9s] came in a big way for Solomon. Now I
[1782.6s] said this this day that God is going to
[1786.2s] come in a big way for you and your
[1789.4s] family. That's because of the sacrifice
[1791.2s] you have done. You see, Solomon went up
[1793.7s] the
[1795.1s] hill. Go. Solomon went up the
[1798.2s] hill. Love always pushes you upwards.
[1802.1s] Love always pushes you upwards. Love
[1804.9s] goes up. Love goes up. Love goes up. And
[1810.0s] when God sees love has left the pews,
[1814.2s] love has gone to the bank account. When
[1816.7s] God sees love has left the pews, love is
[1820.3s] going up. God does not sit to wait for
[1824.0s] your love to go all the way. God comes
[1827.8s] down. Can somebody say amen? When the
[1830.1s] love is going up, God is coming all the
[1833.0s] way. And you meet somewhere with the
[1835.5s] Lord. Solomon climbs high the mountain.
[1838.5s] God comes down to the
[1840.9s] hill. And that
[1842.9s] night was a wonderful experience. And
[1847.3s] and and did did you also notice that the
[1849.7s] Bible says God came to
[1852.4s] Solomon in the night when Solomon was
[1858.0s] dreaming. This is not for nothing. You
[1860.6s] see, God came, God did not want anything
[1864.5s] to interrupt this moment. This is not
[1867.5s] about what Solomon you gave. This is
[1869.5s] about a relationship. Solomon, I have
[1871.5s] come that we we may cement this
[1874.2s] relationship. And I come at a time in a
[1876.2s] moment when no one can interrupt you.
[1878.1s] I'm coming when you are silent, when
[1880.3s] you're reflecting. I'm coming when
[1882.2s] everything is silent on you. I want to
[1884.5s] have you and you alone. Solomon, this is
[1887.0s] not for the next door. This is for you,
[1889.4s] Solomon. Ask I've
[1893.0s] come. The Bible tells me.
[1902.2s] So my
[1904.4s] friend, I've just said three. I'm
[1906.4s] excited. So, so, so, so, so imagine,
[1908.5s] imagine, imagine child of God. God
[1911.0s] coming with a blank
[1912.9s] check. Says an answer. God comes with
[1916.3s] what? An open
[1919.2s] check. And he comes to the youth say, I
[1921.8s] saw how oh how this saw how you were
[1924.3s] selling baskets for me. Hey, no, no,
[1927.7s] no. Write any figure here. Hallelujah.
[1930.3s] Somebody write any favor here. Just just
[1934.6s] it's an open check. It's an open check.
[1936.4s] He came to Solomon asked Solomon ask
[1939.8s] anything. I don't know what Solomon
[1941.6s] asked whether it was good enough. But I
[1943.0s] think it was good enough. I don't know
[1944.6s] what you would have asked. May maybe I
[1946.2s] would have said uh God by for for us the
[1949.8s] Lord for for Rua. I don't know what I
[1951.8s] would have said. I don't I don't know. I
[1953.3s] don't know what I could have said. I
[1954.6s] don't know what you could have said. But
[1956.0s] but this morning I want to let you know
[1958.3s] God is coming down for you with an open
[1962.8s] check and I want to tell you watch my
[1967.1s] words. You will be here to witness.
[1970.1s] Maybe I will have left but watch this
[1973.0s] sermon today the things that are going
[1975.7s] to happen in this church. Just wait
[1979.8s] because God does not say things he does
[1982.8s] not mean. God does not play games with
[1985.1s] his people. When you go out of your way
[1987.7s] in a big way that you have done, God
[1990.4s] must
[1992.9s] come. I'm excited
[1995.3s] today that I'm praying and saying God as
[1997.8s] you come whether I have been somewhere
[2000.0s] in Meu or somewhere where I'll be gone.
[2002.8s] Please don't forgive forget me. Remember
[2004.6s] I was part of this congregation. Just
[2007.0s] God just come come to my door. And as
[2009.4s] you're asking people, I also want to
[2011.3s] write I know the figures. I know the
[2013.4s] figures. I know the figures. My figure
[2016.1s] is written eternity. Hallelujah. My
[2019.0s] figure is written eternity. I want to
[2020.9s] have God give me the privilege after
[2023.1s] laboring all the way to be found in his
[2025.8s] kingdom. God is asking church after you
[2030.2s] have come out of your way for him. What
[2032.8s] do you want from
[2034.8s] him? Somebody has been struggling with
[2037.5s] his sickness for too long, but it has
[2040.4s] been waiting this moment.
[2042.6s] Now the Lord is not listening to your
[2046.0s] prayer from heaven. God is coming to
[2049.8s] your prayer room. And as soon when
[2051.7s] you're done praying, he's asking you
[2059.3s] ask. I don't know how true this is. I
[2062.7s] had a preacher preaching. So I'm online.
[2064.6s] If this is not true, just don't don't
[2065.9s] take it against me. So those days during
[2068.2s] the first president of this country
[2069.9s] there was a man from Nakuru who used to
[2073.4s] play codia you know
[2076.8s] codian and and and every state function
[2079.4s] he would go I said I don't know whether
[2080.9s] it's true I just want to preach
[2081.9s] preaching used to go and entertain the
[2083.9s] the president accordion so so one day
[2086.2s] the president jokinata was touched and
[2088.9s] and said can can you can you have that
[2090.5s] man come to state house so that man was
[2092.6s] invited to the state house and he sat
[2094.5s] there it was him and the president and
[2096.8s] the president asked him, "My friend,
[2099.1s] you've been entertaining me. You you you
[2100.6s] you're an expert in cion, what can I do
[2103.0s] for
[2108.0s] you?" Anyone who knows that story? Well,
[2112.3s] the preacher was preaching. Give me the
[2113.8s] story. He said, "That man said, the
[2117.0s] cordonion you see me playing, I always
[2119.2s] borrow it. I want you to buy me my
[2121.7s] personal accordion.
[2127.4s] Are you
[2129.3s] okay? And he happens to be a kiku. No,
[2131.9s] no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,
[2133.8s] no. Are you you go before the president
[2135.9s] of the state of this country and he
[2137.8s] asking you what do you want from me? And
[2139.9s] you say give me a call. Are you
[2145.1s] foolish? So the story goes them died
[2147.8s] playing
[2152.0s] what? I don't know. I don't know. I'm
[2154.3s] simply feeling the Gibian moment in
[2157.0s] their sanctuary. The Lord is coming
[2159.4s] because of what you have done to him and
[2161.5s] he's coming with an open check and is
[2164.1s] asking you
[2167.7s] ask write any figure. Write any figure.
[2170.9s] Please do not write
[2173.0s] codian. Please please please please do
[2176.2s] not write code. Do you see? Look at
[2179.0s] this. Look at this. Look at this. Look
[2180.2s] at this. Look at this. Let's let's go
[2181.8s] finish this message. No. The Bible says
[2184.6s] Solomon asked for
[2186.8s] what? For
[2190.4s] wisdom. Read from verse number 11. Go
[2193.3s] there. Verse number 11. The Bible says,
[2195.0s] "Then God said to him, because you have
[2197.0s] asked this thing and have not asked for
[2199.4s] long life for yourself, nor have asked
[2201.2s] riches for yourself, nor have asked the
[2203.4s] life of your enemies, but have asked for
[2205.7s] yourself understanding to discern
[2207.8s] justice. Behold, I have done according
[2210.6s] to your words." See, I have given you a
[2213.9s] wise and understanding hurt, so that
[2216.4s] there has not been anyone like you
[2218.4s] before you, nor shall anyone like you
[2220.6s] arise after you. And I have also given
[2222.6s] you what you have not asked, both riches
[2225.6s] and honor, so that there shall not be
[2228.2s] anyone like you among the kings all your
[2231.4s] days. So if you walk in my ways to keep
[2234.5s] my statutes and my commandments as your
[2236.8s] father David walked then I will lengthen
[2240.4s] your days. God says Solomon what you
[2243.8s] have requested I have granted. He didn't
[2246.5s] say I'm going to think about it granted.
[2249.4s] Hallelujah somebody. What you are
[2251.9s] requesting today because of what you
[2254.2s] have done to the Lord God says granted.
[2257.7s] Look that person next to you and tell
[2258.9s] him or her granted.
[2261.2s] Granted. Granted. I've been asking for a
[2263.9s] spouse for too long. Granted. I've been
[2267.0s] asking for a business idea for too long.
[2270.2s] Granted. I've been asking for a
[2271.9s] promotion. My workstation is not a good
[2274.3s] place. I've been pushing you, God, that
[2276.2s] you may do something for me. Granted,
[2278.4s] I've been asking. What have you been
[2280.0s] asking? The God says, granted. And the
[2282.3s] Bible goes on to say, not just that, I'm
[2285.4s] giving you wisdom. But there's wisdom is
[2288.1s] different. Hallelujah. somebody this
[2290.1s] wisdom is different there will be no one
[2293.4s] with such kind of wisdom you have no
[2296.4s] idea there will be no the quality the
[2299.2s] quality of this wisdom that I've come to
[2301.9s] give you no one on earth will come in
[2305.8s] our clothes listen to me God when he
[2309.6s] gives his gift all his gifts are
[2313.8s] perfect when God comes to bless you no
[2317.8s] one will compete with you. No one will
[2321.4s] compare with you. When God comes to give
[2323.8s] you the breakthroughs that it could be
[2325.5s] your finances, God is going to bless you
[2328.0s] in a way no one listen to me. No one
[2331.5s] will come anywhere near you in terms of
[2334.4s] your blessedness.
[2337.2s] Bible goes on to say, "And God told
[2340.1s] him
[2342.0s] where over and above." Hallelujah.
[2345.1s] Somebody over and above what you have
[2348.6s] asked me. You went out of your way for
[2352.6s] me. You went an extra mile for me. You
[2356.3s] climbed the hill for me. I to
[2359.8s] reciprocate. I will go an extra mile for
[2363.2s] you. Not just wisdom but also
[2367.4s] wealth. I am giving you wealth. I'm
[2370.6s] giving you status. There will be no a
[2373.6s] king like you in all the days. This was
[2378.9s] a straight ticket to excellence. Solomon
[2383.3s] left the hill of Gibon assured that he's
[2386.5s] the greatest man in the universe. And so
[2389.0s] no wonder
[2393.5s] No wonder. No wonder the guy has the
[2397.6s] largest numbers of women. You know, you
[2399.8s] know, you
[2401.8s] don't you know the the kind of blessings
[2404.7s] that Solomon is enjoying. You
[2408.1s] see, listen to
[2412.1s] me. God is going to bless
[2416.0s] you. God is going to bless you. And
[2419.5s] those kind of blessings, you've never
[2421.7s] seen them
[2423.2s] before. They are
[2425.4s] coming. They are coming. The Lord is on
[2429.1s] his way from his throne. The Lord is
[2431.8s] descending to the mountain of Gib. Maybe
[2434.1s] maybe you have gone back to sleep,
[2436.4s] Solomon. After doing all that beautiful
[2438.2s] thing for the Lord, he went to sleep.
[2440.0s] Maybe you have also gone back to sleep.
[2442.0s] But the Lord will wake you to bless you
[2445.0s] even though you're sleeping. He does not
[2447.4s] need you to be wakeful when you have
[2449.4s] done such kind of a thing. Before you do
[2451.1s] it, he says, "Keep alert. Do not sleep.
[2453.6s] Do not sleep. Do not sleep. But when you
[2456.2s] have done it, it doesn't matter whether
[2458.2s] you're awake or sleeping. He shall come
[2460.6s] anywhere to bless
[2462.7s] you. The Gibian
[2465.5s] moment is what I now see in spirit
[2469.4s] coming to Nairobi Central Church. Are
[2473.0s] you ready for the Gideon moment?
[2475.6s] Are you ready for the
[2477.1s] blessings? Are you ready? Ask your
[2479.8s] sister, your brother next to you, say,
[2481.0s] ask them, are you ready? Are you ready?
[2484.5s] You know, one day he told the story in
[2486.0s] the book of duty, he told them, I'm
[2487.6s] going to bless you and the blessing
[2489.5s] shall overtake you. No, no, no, no. The
[2493.0s] the the Gibian moment is where No, no,
[2495.8s] not just normal blessing. It has
[2497.9s] experience where the blessings overtakes
[2500.5s] God's people. Watch
[2503.2s] this. Before we close this
[2506.9s] year, the testimonies we are going to
[2509.5s] get in this
[2511.6s] place, they will be extraordinary
[2515.7s] blessings.
[2517.7s] Extraordinary. I wish I'm the one who is
[2520.2s] blessing
[2521.7s] you, my elder. I would have already I
[2524.2s] don't know how much you would have
[2524.9s] blessed, but but I'm feeling I need to
[2526.5s] do it right now. But I wonder how God is
[2528.9s] feeling. If this is what I'm feeling, I
[2530.7s] wonder how much God is feeling and I
[2533.1s] can't wait. I'm agitated because I see
[2536.2s] the blessings are coming. They are not
[2539.4s] coming alone. They're not dropped like
[2541.0s] rain. No. You know, he says when you
[2543.7s] give t and offering, you open the doors
[2546.3s] and the windows what? Of heaven and do
[2549.3s] what? No. That is the normal giving of
[2552.6s] 10% that he just pour. He open the doors
[2555.1s] and he pours. There's nothing there.
[2556.4s] Everyone should be giving. But when
[2558.4s] you've gone out of your way, God closes
[2561.2s] all the doors in heaven. Closes all the
[2564.2s] windows of heaven so that no blessing
[2566.4s] escape and then he comes out from one
[2569.0s] door with every blessing he has in
[2571.6s] heaven. He comes all the way to you. It
[2574.0s] comes Lord and has tears you ask. All
[2576.8s] the treasure of heaven is here right
[2578.2s] with you today. Ask before I go.
[2583.9s] Ask. Do you know what I'm talking about?
[2588.1s] My friend Elder, are you understanding
[2590.1s] what I'm talking about? Now, I want to
[2592.3s] give you time today
[2595.2s] here. You go on your
[2597.7s] knees because the Lord is telling you,
[2601.1s] ask. Solomon didn't say, "I'm going to
[2604.2s] think about it." So, don't say that
[2607.0s] right now. I want to give you time. You
[2609.6s] can kneel down or you can see it. You
[2611.0s] can stand and respond to the Gibian
[2613.5s] moment.
[2615.3s] Ask, you may write that request. You may
[2618.6s] verbalize it in your mind, in your
[2620.1s] heart, but tell the Lord, just take a
[2621.4s] moment. I'm ask you to go into prayer
[2623.2s] and observe a moment and ask the Lord
[2626.5s] not for two things, for one thing.
[2628.6s] Because he says, when you have done
[2630.1s] that, I shall bless you and the blessing
[2632.6s] shall come, they shall be compressed,
[2634.0s] they shall be pressed together that they
[2635.8s] will be pressed together. He did not
[2637.5s] just ask for everything. He asked for
[2639.0s] wisdom. But God brought all the things
[2641.4s] that Solomon needed. Even those he
[2643.4s] didn't know that he needed. Take a
[2645.9s] moment. Take a
[2647.9s] moment. Take a moment. Lord, look at me.
[2650.2s] Take a moment. Take a moment and talk to
[2651.6s] the Lord. He's asking you. Ask.
[2655.0s] Ask. All those papers you've been
[2657.0s] bringing here. Now, demand the Lord.
[2659.6s] Lord, to me, this is the thing I want.
[2663.1s] Lord, do it for me. You see, you see
[2665.8s] Solomon did not give the lawn to be
[2668.1s] blessed. Solomon is being he God is
[2670.6s] blessing him because Solomon gave and so
[2672.9s] you you did not give to be blessed but
[2674.7s] because you gave the Lord is here to
[2677.3s] bless
[2678.0s] you.
[2680.1s] Challenge challenge your
[2682.9s] spirit. Ask
