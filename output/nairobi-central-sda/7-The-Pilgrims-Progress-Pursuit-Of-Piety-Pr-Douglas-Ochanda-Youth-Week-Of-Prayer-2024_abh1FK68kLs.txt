also for the physical audience I pray as we come closer to the understanding of your word may you fill us the grace and favor for we pray in Jesus name our topic is the Pilgrim's Progress pass of P it wants keep your mind having been raised in an African Community to discover and understand that there are many forms of worship of of people trying to find piety in their lives look around you look probably from your grandparents time at any age of time that you've lived you discover that the people invest every other resource or anything possible to seek to be Pious the Bible has many times of spoken of such people who sought for that in a nation that is filled with ATR African traditional religion we will not but fail to discover that there are many churches or religions or people who do anything to the extent just to be able to come close close to Christ therefore some people in their quest for this pety will jump and Skip fires some people will go for Hunger Strike I remember a woman who actually fasted for 40 days just trying to be like Jesus but she didn't make it she died along the way I know there people who go eat certain food to just to be pi and in African religion tradition it is so common that we may have been ra such people and I'm saying this because some will seek for piety but even on Sabbath day they will not even attempt to travel they will sit in certain places so that they don't break the Sabbath I'm telling you the Pharisees are known for having such kind of priety that on Friday evening because of their sins along the way they were known to having on Friday even they go get baptized themselves they had pools in their compound so they baptize thems so that perhaps they sinned they are forgiven ah not just the Pharisees another thing about the Pharisees is that they will not eat egg that is hatched on Sabbath because they're seeking for this Purity another one is that if perhaps they were pping their hair and an air it gets down they'll have broken a Sabbath oh beloved of God I'm saying another thing component of Pharisees is that they will not even want to spit down on Sabbath day because when it they spit down and the ground collects it it ised equated to probably someone who was probably trying to do far some farming are we Pi enough may I draw attention to a story that happened 514 years ago I'll be slow now it happened 514 years ago that's many years ago before you and I were born it's a story of that is narrated about this great hero who was seeking to be able to be p p you know this guy is called Martin Luther of course you know him Nathan records this wonderful piece about the personal Reformation journey of Martin Luther Martin Luther attempted and tried his best to be this kind of person who will be Pious and the Journey Begins in unlikely way because the father had opted for him to become a lawyer but one time as he'll be traveling across the streets probably from his law school he will get a thunder strike and during this thunder strike it'll call his attention to probably seek for other avenues of breakthrough and therefore because he's a young Catholic man he will pray to an and he'll say these word as he'll be praying he say so spare me and I'll become a monk Martin Luther said maybe what will help him is that if he spared for the thunderstorm he will become a monk the TR the true the story is that 15 years late 15 days later he will actually abandon his career of being a lawyer and he'll become a monk he will pursue this in Germany doing everything possible that he could attain the high highest level of things and beloved of God there's a point where Martin Luther strikes me because in his life he will engage with others and he'll do his best to be the best I want to say that this is just in my Sanctified imagination because of what Martin Luther was seeking whenever he walks people will say uhhuh did you see that's that's Luther that's Martin Luther very Pious you've not seen religious people guys those who probably will come in Sacred Space and tiptoe because they don't want to make noise in the church you want you've not seen religious people who will try everything possible to try to attain the greatest uh uh thing just to be seen to have made it therefore for this young man called Martin Luther one of the things that prompted him is that he feared death what prompts you or prompted you to be a Christian is it because people told you you will die this guy feared death and of course he feared the wrath of God and with this kind of fear he did everything possible to achieve the most fastidious way to articulate his agenda of becoming the best monk therefore he dedicated himself took sacraments he fasted of course the Penance he even performed Act of self-punishment maybe let me take a few minutes to explain this self punishment which is means he could go and surpass sleep he endured winter nights without covering himself with blanket hello yeah the people the things people do out here sometimes maybe outrageous but all this with the view of become the best the best fearing the wrath of God fearing that he fearing death therefore he will continue to tell anything possible to atone for his sins he even whipped himself Luther whipping himself so that he probably becomes more Pious in this preg journey he was taking he was right according to the his upbringing is it possible in this audience in this congregation we are actually repeating the very step mistakes that has been handed down from a people who probably were unconverted is possible maybe in our religious quest of seeking for things we have actually adopted a self-righteousness mechanism forgetting that our righteousness is made only by God beloved of God I'm suggesting that probably in our own examination we let as we look at ours introspectively we discover we may feel we have started walking the faith but we are not yet there perhaps because we are only but living according to other people now Martin Luther says if anyone could have earned Heaven by the little life of a monk it was I he from where he reached from the level what he achieved to him he could have been the best of the best or let me use a language that I can call bestest if there's an English like that and this was just but a youth he dropped his career to achieve to follow things that will make him better I have also observed in our U places of residence or even our country I have found ideas I've met young people who gave up their careers someone [Music] eventually he just disappears this young person continues to stop he dropped up of school I know of young people who began their Journey so well perhaps in medicine perhaps in in in engineering perhaps in any field of study but because of these false narratives they dropped out of the school to achieve some things some funny forms of piety and beloved God it gets worse that some of them are our beloved church members is it possible that you left something because of an idea someone sold for you to be honest even the supervisor who was under the over the authority of Luther was shocked he he was like this kind of righteousness is not the one that people are seeking for in the righteousness of God the Bible then this young man God did something God did something powerful he read the book of Romans chap 1 1: 17 I'm going to re I'm going to rephrase it for us to understand it says he let let me read from verse 16 says for God demonstrated his love towards us in that while Christ that um I'll take it again for God demonstrated his love to us e that while we are yet in sin Christ died for us he is a God who does not wait for you that's Romans 5:8 I must quoted I'm going to read that one is Romans 5:8 I'm going to 1:6 it says for I'm not ashamed of the gospel of Christ for is the power of God and to Salvation are we together Romans that's that's Romans 1 verse 16 I'm going to read it because it will lay Foundation of God I'm going to read I'm going to share with you it says this Romans 1:16 Romans 1:16 it says this uhhuh it says for I am not ashamed of the gospel thisel of Christ the gospel of Christ take note the gospel of Christ not of man for it is the power of God to what salvation to how many people everyone who does what believes for the Jews first and also the Greek praise God this is a powerful Proclamation that the gospel is about Jesus Christ and the gospel is for everyone who believes so if you sit next to someone who's a Greek who's a Jew the gospel is for you maybe you're watching in this virtual space whatever it is and you're wondering in what this is all about it's about Jesus Christ The Gospel is about Christ it's not man centered and therefore in verse 17 as this L Pious L Luther will read in verse 17 of Romans says for in it the righteousness of God is revealed from Faith to Faith as it is written the just shall live by what by faith not by works I'm tired and afraid of looking looking at people who are focusing so much on Works than the faith beloved I'm not saying that it's it's wrong to do certain things but you need to have met Jesus Christ to convict you convert you then you can live according to the way he desires praise God so this Luther comes to the conclusion that for sure maybe through his life he's pursued other careers by I don't blame him I don't blame him because he was raised in a church that believe in such such things but when he comes to meet Jesus Christ oh my goodness everything changes when we meet Jesus Christ Our Life does not remain the same so the things we used to do in ignorance changes once again and the things you have the guilt that you had disappears because now you are in Christ you are a new creature may I suggest to us that this is not where we are preaching from the book of Peter let's go to Peter Peter is is um is an interesting person not your pastor he is not only a vocal person but he's a proactive character have you met people who are so proactive in what they do they are here and there this guy is proactive he's always around Jesus he could have made it to the Walk of Fame you know for those who know about the Hollywood Walk of Fame if had he been there then this guy could have made it there the guy was everywhere proactive Jesus asked the question the other people are still chilling he asked them who who can walk here all of a sudden he says I'll walk in the Water by the the only person in history of the world that has walk on water he's who Peter I've not had anyone else and as he does this he is so proactive he is but again he's an absolute em embodiment of our inconsistency Peter is with you in this today again tomorrow he changes his mind Peter is here today inah thinks he is celebrated by the Vatican if you've been to the St Peter Square you'll see that they even say that suggest that he was buried there just there in at Vatican City this guy is so powerful that people know so much and actually he fought for Christ he walked on what who else is such powerful he was close to Jesus but then something interesting despite being so close to Christ he also denied Jesus Christ not everyone that calls the name of God is always this him some actually even sing and praying tongues but they're not with him they've rejected him already they have refus to allow him to make a change in their lives and most painful thing is that those people are found in our sacred spaces they live as though they are Christians but in their heart they have these things they've held so dear since childhood they cannot let go ah let me speak in your language the people who probably grandmother gave them some things of rituals in you know you open that you find something has been tied on the stomach they are they baptized but this one they cannot separate from I have baptized people that when I'm getting to the baptismal pool when I tell them to get rid of certain things are like pastor this for this this one it's never removed I know people who carry certain things wherever they go because the tradition told them this ought to be S carried but therefore they have a form of godliness but the power of God is denied Peter was so close to Jesus Peter was powerful Peter was famous Peter was like you and I very inconsistent today am with Christ tomorrow not let me use it an example watermelon in out but still he didn't he you know this guy's mouth run faster sometimes than his heart even his mind we have them we are there we are those people he's a longstanding disciple with irregular standings he he's he's been there but he's irregular I know we usually go for papers with you know regular standing but IR regular standing is very unpredictable he's there with us tomorrow is not the power of Christ overwhelmed him and led him to repentance praise God therefore this guy will be able to still meet Jesus Christ he was inconsistent but he still held on to Christ he didn't completely leave him actually as a pastor he will write this text now now I'm calling you Pastor now let's go to Second 1 Peter chapter 2 um as it begins I'm I'm I'm I'm going to chapter 1 verse one begins says Peter an apostle of Christ to the pilgrims of dispassion in countes galatia capoa Asia and bethia elect according to the for knowledge of the Lord sanctification Spirit of obedience and sprinkling of the blood of Jesus Christ that's how he begins his story he begins by saying that is an apostle of Jesus Christ this is not the inconsistent person we've known this is not the person that we've always looked at his problems and mistakes there is a person who has been able to meet Jesus Christ and he's writing to the pilgrims I now the book of First Peter chapter 2 as I mentioned has many powerful stories for example let me give you the most common verse that we all know it says but you are a chosen what generation a royal a holy his own special people that you may do What Proclaim his Praises of him who called you out of what Darkness into where His Marvelous who knew such a person could write a thing Peter wrote this he wrote it inspired by the Holy Spirit he's saying that you're chosen I wonder if you've been able to sit down and think about it what it means to be chosen actually the Bible say you not choose me but I chose you and I appointed you to go and bear fruit oh I'm boiling for Jesus he's saying that you do not choose me but I chose you and therefore when you sit in these spaces or when you're watching wherever you are just know that you're chosen you've been called your peculiar you are not just any other person therefore in chapter 2: 11 I'm just going to zero into our main text he will say this beloved I beg you as sers another word is I beseech you as sers and pilgrims abstain from fleshly lust which war against the what soul Peter has had an experience Peter has had trial Peter has gone through tribulation but now for him to speak in a language that he wants us to understand he say continues to say that in verse 12 having your conduct honorable among the Gentiles that they may speak against they speak against you as evil doers and they may uh they may by your good works which they observe glorify God in the day of visitation but I to say that Peter is so particular as he drives us to where he wants us to understand he call us beloved beloved is a language for people that are dear he is a language to remind these people that actually Christ loves you and I love you you to tell your neighbor I love you I know the last time you told someone it becomes so difficult the water has become so hard you're afraid of telling someone that what is so difficult about tell that I love you be SM tell someone that love them I'm just tell you okay but then if it's difficult tell I love you the love of God then because inside of you it is so difficult tell them I love you but you can see the love of God just put that because you know someone will tell but but you know you know young person these young people may follow up in the evening and say but you told me you love me in the morning church okay then let me put a rer I love you with the love of God I think that's better because maybe you're sitting next to someone you've had a beef with for many days you're like ah pastor I don't think the spirit is leading this love but but I'm saying here he begins his text by saying ah he says this therefore submit your no in verse 11 beloved I beg you the other language is I beseech you it says why would he be so deliberate in use this language why would he be so particular with using this this world therefore he tells them beloved beloved mean then say I beseech you this is a gentle way of an appeal it is a way you know it's a two word I'm going to get to the Greek words but I'm saying the two words that I used from the Greek word it means you calling someone aside not just calling someone aside but you call him for something important you want to say so what Peter is B basically saying here that he's calling them because of there's an important something to be use now the armies use this word they used to use it before go for war they'll be called and to be told two things to be warned of what will be happen when I tell you uh beloved I beseech you to beseech is because they will call them and warn them of the potential dangers of the world they're going to have Paul Peter as he speaks therefore he's like trying to sell them what I'm what I'm about to tell you it's not something easy it's like you're getting into war tell them the he tells them about the Glorious of Victory but there's a danger in the battle now it's for you to choose where your mind will be what I'm about to say there's a glory of being Victorious is what I'm going to say but there's also a burden of having struggles for what you'll choose to say now he invite them by saying I beseech you calling them aside telling them or preparing for them for whatever may happen so therefore tell someone something very particularly important you call them aside tell them man I need to meet you I need to see you it's like those many years when there was no internet and everything I remember my grandfather died 199 91 and and I remember the telegram that came was my dad's they go the telegram in the village was it was written dad dead that's a telegram just there's no there's no there's no there's no time to type beloved of God are you fine noways we write that on the are you fine how are you no no man I want to talk to the young people sometimes you don't have to spend so much time in writing many things goes to the point sh just say it stop stop being very uh pish introducing yourself that you a pilgrim go to the point just say um I love you the love of God and I'm seeing a fature with you turn there so tell me what's your answer some go go you know sometimes you take so much time and you always walk around someone these are young people you walk together in choir you sing you've not you're not even speaking you've never said anything I remember a young man telling me they used to walk from I think my former Church New Life all the way to town the man the lady came to me and told me this man has never said anything I'm imagining he loves me I'm imagining you're building something but it was an assumption but because the man never did anything so I was to intervene and tell the man by the way you're taking so many long walks with this lady can you just say something now Paul has warn these people and he's telling I beseech you why he's telling the besch is making them to have in a mind that this whatever you're engaging with you have to have a Warfare mentality and now who are these people who are these people that he's particular looking to I beg you as serers and pilgrims this the word for seras is actually uh supposed to mean aliens an alien is not is a visor it's not he not a resident it's someone who lives among other people but this is not their home you know let me tell you the pilgrims and serers are different a sera is someone who is not he's not this is not home for him for example when you go to a foreign country you can do everything eat as they're doing and they do everything but when it comes to voting you don't vote because that's for the right of those who stay there therefore he's telling these people remember chapter one chapter 1 verse one I told you to the pilgrims of dispassion he that he was writing to these people he say you guys you know what you visitors you living around these people but you you don't enjoy the same privilege as these people let me speak in a language that you get it clear but we are in this world as visitors I know it's difficult for us to accept the fact that we have we to affect that this is not home but it's not home by the way it's not it's not let me take a commercial break for you to understand those who come from nanza especially yanza in this country when when when when when someone dies you'll hear the way they mo they will tell you they'll tell the person why you've let me alone you've let me here alone wake up talk to me let them I'm praying one day this person wakes up wake up like like it becomes so difficult to accept that you are a serer you are you are an alien here my Elder you are you you're not supposed to be here you should be like okay now that this person rest perhaps it's time for me to prepare for the soon return thank you so much go for bringing it close to us that for sure we are but serers in this land and he's telling there stop stainless if you a you're a member of this place and a surgeoner is different from a pilgrim a pilgrim is someone who just passes shows up he passes like I not the pastor of this church I'm just about a pilgrim you you catching what I'm throwing I'm a p I'm just passing by therefore this is not my final territory but I have a destination now in your mind as a Christian you ought to live as you have a final destination this is not home for you therefore when you discover that you it's not home for you you don't eat like people eat you do not dress like people dress you do not speak like these people speak because this is not home you'll invest Millions to land or he but eventually you go back to a country where you not speak I always like learning languages in every country I go but after some time they disappear because I have no one to speak with I always remember there's home now Christians we've been called as pilgrims we are called to know that we are here temporarily we are called to live as as though this is not home it's like someone who rents an Airbnb and calls his friends to live in that house and tells them this is my home this not your home man it's not your home even for us who live in rented houses it's not our home we have a final destination and this cannot be home a country that is a world that is full of sicknesses I've just sat here and here heard so many feral announcement in the prayer no this cannot be home where they struggle this cannot be home where every time there's a heartbreak this cannot be home where one man takes care of 400 ladies it cannot be home it's not home I know some wondering what I'm talking about I'm talking about Solomon and this can't be home there's a better home in heaven for us praise God and therefore and therefore listen listen listen and therefore listen listen how do how how they to live when this is not home he uses the word abstain abstain is that put a gap between me and you there should be a space because you can't by the way don't play on the devil playground it's like ah devil devil what's the short form of devil devil yeah no you can't you can't attempt to play around or flat around certain the G has experience one time an old man told me he parted my back and told me you're not the devil's AG mate you're not his agement this this this creature has been there even before we will be here therefore he knows how to bring you it says it says then it says to abstain in a other language means to consciously deliberately withraw from certain things which means if I know this path is leading me to death I withdraw you this other path it means if I know this may lead to death just put a the vacation oh but he looks like a Christian he dresses like a Christian H so does the devil even the devil I wish I had a text I could have shown you a verse where he so he looks so awesome from outside but you see I can change him you change him if youve not changed yourself all these years how can you change someone else you know you've been messed up in your heart for many years but you're saying I will change you are you the Holy Spirit beloved of God abstain now it says from fleshy lusts I know in our mind you quickly think about sexual lust but fleshy lust has many things it has many connotations here there are many things that appeal to us sometimes even the addictions that you wake up in the morning before you even spend time with Christ you want to check who liked my Ig page who liked my photo how many people who is am I trending fleshy it appeals temporarily but complet completely disappears beloved I want not only I'm not only speaking to I'm not only speaking to the young people we know even as older generation we've gratified the things of the heart and we've given those things a priority in our lives beloved and says this fleshy last get rid of them why fleshy last never get satisfied Never by the way never you can never be satisfied you know you try like this actually the flesh will only let go until it has it has completely consumed you it will not let you go it will not it comes creeping slowly haven't you read in the Bible the story of Samson it began so well uh Mom Dad excuse me I've seen a woman down there in Tima get for me for a wife dadd is like ah haven't you seen people from our own place no my my eyes are amazing just bring her get get her for me slowly but sure Bible says God was his Samson God was his Samson but there's a point where it reaches and you had he did not know the spirit of God had left him a point you can always play around Devil's Playground but it reaches a point I usually say even the devil says Ah this even the devil says you you have a PhD you've exceeded me let you do your thing and the Bible says therefore this experience is a experience of War it Wars about you it wrestles with you which Wars against thy Soul your mind your character your personality it wages with you slowly progressively you start going down know so difficult sometimes when someone it's so difficult to disc to sometimes even convince someone who was who is in love have you evered to talk to someone's in love but but he he he he but he WR he calls me every day till midnight but uh but we in love but we the same we the same un we share the same units and maybe you're saying H but they're Christians they look Christians who who told you beloved we are all at war in this congregation we are War in this world and the quicker we know the quicker we abstain from sin says this wrestles with the mind I'm just going to take a few points here then I I I make my point home Peter though he struggle he's a testament of sanctification when I look at Peter's life I discovered that Christ is not done with that yet he's just getting started what am I saying that you know the people who sell the idea of one saved always saved no this guy he met Christ at some point but he went up and down but the beautiful story is Christ never gave up on him and today I'm telling you Christ has not given up on you he has made a way for you today the fact that you can hear this voice today is an indication that he's giving you a second chance today you know there's someone here who doesn't know what you're saying he's somewhere in some refrigerator maybe across the road in one of the mugs around may have been powerful but now lying there cold and responsive and I want to say that Peter had a chance he may may have denied Jesus Christ three times actually I like one of the narrative in the Book of Matthew 26 I'm going to read this few text then I come to the conclusion Matthew 26 um I think it's verse 69 listen to this story this is Peter now Peter sat outside the CED this is now Jesus had told Jes remember in in chapter 26 Jesus had told him man you'll deny me three times I'm going to I'm sorry just allow me to just take you back 26 26:3 31 says then Jesus said to them of that's Matthew 26:31 says when Jesus said to them all of you all of you uh will be made to stumble because of me this night for it is written I will sack the shepherd and the sheep of the flock will be scattered verse 232 but after I have been raised I will go before you to Galilee but Peter answered and said to him even if all they made all are made to stumble because of you I will never I will never do what be made to stumble his mouth is always ahead look at vers 34 Jesus said to him assuredly I say to you that this night before the the rooster cross you will do what deny me how many times three times Peter said to him even if I have to die with you I will not deny you and so said all the disciples they said I will not me I cannot I cannot I cannot abandon the church I cannot abandon the faith that is how proud he is but what he didn't know he was still wrestling playing around the Devil's Playground the young people we do that like I and but I'm inan Church look at verse look at now let's let's go to chapter the same same chapter verse 699 now Peter sat outside in the courtyard and a servant girl who came to him saying you also were with Jesus of Galilee but denied it before men all saying I do not know what you are saying these guys is used to denying things I know what you're saying and when he had gone out of the Gateway another girl saw him and said said to those who were there this fellow also was Jesus of Nazareth a but again he denied with an O How do we I remember do all the things I do not know the man we do that damn I can't look at verse3 and a little later those who stood by came and said to Peter surely you also also are one of them for your speech does what betrays you this guy had a heavy and even his speech betrayed him then he began to curse you know he curing this guy used to be used to work where work as fisherman you know how they curse Cur and so saying I do not know the man immediately a rooster C and Peter remembered the word of Jesus who had said to him before the RO the cross you deny me through three times so he went out and wept bitterly the GU just figured out man he said I cannot deny this man three times now three times he's denying it was Pro it was prophesied it was sa he did it but his life doesn't end there that's the good news he doesn't end at the point where he has denied Jesus Christ because we serve a god of Second Chances you know the Book of Proverbs 24:16 makes this amazing thing I'm going to read it this I cannot this one I have to give you man I if I'd rather leave the rest but this one I have to give you this one maybe maybe I came this for this um I have to read this proverb 24 16 says this for a righteous man may fall how many times seven times and Rise Again the point is are you still down we fall down but we get up you're here you've Fallen my challenge to you is get up and walk get up don't stay because even russes me people fall Peter urges his readers do not open doors for Warf fares that you cannot sustain he tell them he tells them abstain from flesh last he he tells them stay away maybe sometimes it's it's it's an online thing you you you it draws you close says abstain we all know the story in the Book of John chap 20 before Jesus when before you know in the Book of John CH 20 these are I'm going to tell you and and I'm going to read it fully but when you have time go read John chter 20 towards the end from verse 15 to 18 go read it when you have time we find a story where Jesus restores Peter and when he's restored he will become a powerful preacher we know it's the same Peter who denied Jesus three times who will be able to preach in Acts 2 and over 3,000 people accept Jesus Christ you too God can use it today to change this Narrative of the story what am I telling the young people as they conclude one of the things I want to put do not tamper with the temple the book of 1 Corinthians 6: 19 tells us verse 20 you've been bought you've been bought you've been bought it means you belong to God that's why they call you a chosen people a royal royal priesthood are people peculiar who belong to God and when you know you belong to God you don't live like the world you live for the glory of God beloved of God the your journey may have been insignificant in the past but Christ has made a way for you today you can still have it a fresh today I'm making an appeal to you as before I I'll pray eventually maybe your path has been rugged but we serve a Christ who comes closer to us when Peter seems as if he was falling at some point when he was walking on the water Jesus showed up and held his hand and he walked in the very water he's here to hold your hand to walk with you may God bless us all in Jesus name

[130.0s] Jesus
[131.0s] name our topic is the Pilgrim's Progress
[134.6s] pass of P it wants keep your mind having
[138.8s] been raised in an African Community to
[141.5s] discover and understand that there are
[143.5s] many forms of worship of of people
[146.6s] trying to find piety in their lives look
[149.6s] around you look probably from your
[151.5s] grandparents time at any age of time
[153.6s] that you've lived you discover that the
[155.8s] people invest every other resource or
[158.4s] anything possible to seek to be Pious
[161.6s] the Bible has many times of spoken of
[164.4s] such people who sought for that in a
[166.9s] nation that is filled with ATR African
[169.3s] traditional religion we will not but
[172.2s] fail to discover that there are many
[175.1s] churches or religions or people who do
[177.3s] anything to the extent just to be able
[179.2s] to come close close to Christ therefore
[181.4s] some people in their quest for this pety
[184.4s] will jump and Skip fires some people
[186.9s] will go for Hunger Strike I remember a
[189.0s] woman who actually fasted for 40 days
[191.3s] just trying to be like Jesus but she
[193.0s] didn't make it she died along the way I
[195.3s] know there people who go eat certain
[197.4s] food to just to be pi and in African
[200.4s] religion tradition it is so common that
[203.4s] we may have been ra such people and I'm
[205.8s] saying this because some will seek for
[208.2s] piety but even on Sabbath day they will
[210.6s] not even attempt to travel they will sit
[213.2s] in certain places so that they don't
[215.0s] break the Sabbath I'm telling you the
[217.4s] Pharisees are known for having such kind
[219.5s] of priety that on Friday evening because
[222.2s] of their sins along the way they were
[224.4s] known to having on Friday even they go
[226.7s] get baptized themselves they had pools
[228.4s] in their compound so they baptize thems
[230.6s] so that perhaps they sinned they are
[232.6s] forgiven ah not just the Pharisees
[234.8s] another thing about the Pharisees is
[236.6s] that they will not eat egg that is
[238.7s] hatched on Sabbath because they're
[240.4s] seeking for this Purity another one is
[242.6s] that if perhaps they were pping their
[245.8s] hair and an air it gets down they'll
[248.4s] have broken a Sabbath oh beloved of God
[250.6s] I'm saying another thing component of
[253.0s] Pharisees is that they will not even
[255.0s] want to spit down on Sabbath day because
[257.3s] when it they spit down and the ground
[259.9s] collects it it ised equated to probably
[263.0s] someone who was probably trying to do
[265.1s] far some farming are we Pi enough may I
[269.4s] draw attention to a story that happened
[272.1s] 514 years ago I'll be slow now it
[276.7s] happened 514 years ago that's many years
[279.3s] ago before you and I were born it's a
[281.6s] story of that is narrated about this
[284.1s] great hero who was seeking to be able to
[286.9s] be p p you know this guy is called
[289.5s] Martin Luther of course you know him
[291.0s] Nathan records this wonderful piece
[293.6s] about the personal Reformation journey
[296.0s] of Martin Luther Martin Luther attempted
[298.8s] and tried his best to be this kind of
[301.8s] person who will be Pious and the Journey
[304.5s] Begins in unlikely way because the
[306.8s] father had opted for him to become a
[308.6s] lawyer but one time as he'll be
[310.7s] traveling across the streets probably
[313.0s] from his law school he will get a
[315.3s] thunder strike and during this thunder
[317.2s] strike it'll call his attention to
[319.3s] probably seek for other avenues of
[321.3s] breakthrough and therefore because he's
[323.4s] a young Catholic man he will pray to an
[327.7s] and he'll say these word as he'll be
[329.3s] praying he say so spare me and I'll
[332.2s] become a monk Martin Luther said maybe
[335.9s] what will help him is that if he spared
[339.1s] for the thunderstorm he will become a
[341.5s] monk the TR the true the story is that
[343.8s] 15 years late 15 days later he will
[346.6s] actually abandon his career of being a
[351.4s] lawyer and he'll become a monk he will
[354.4s] pursue this in Germany doing everything
[357.5s] possible that he could attain the high
[359.6s] highest level of things and beloved of
[361.8s] God there's a point where Martin Luther
[365.0s] strikes me because in his life he will
[367.3s] engage with others and he'll do his best
[369.9s] to be the best I want to say that this
[372.9s] is just in my Sanctified imagination
[375.1s] because of what Martin Luther was
[376.8s] seeking whenever he walks people will
[379.2s] say uhhuh did you see that's that's
[381.6s] Luther that's Martin Luther very Pious
[384.7s] you've not seen religious people guys
[386.8s] those who probably will come in Sacred
[389.2s] Space and tiptoe because they don't want
[391.8s] to make noise in the church you want
[393.5s] you've not seen religious people who
[395.4s] will try everything possible to try to
[398.9s] attain the greatest uh uh thing just to
[401.7s] be seen to have made it therefore for
[404.1s] this young man called Martin Luther one
[406.0s] of the things that prompted him is that
[408.0s] he feared death what prompts you or
[411.2s] prompted you to be a Christian is it
[413.2s] because people told you you will die
[415.9s] this guy feared death and of course he
[418.9s] feared the wrath of God and with this
[421.2s] kind of fear he did everything possible
[424.0s] to achieve the most fastidious way to
[426.8s] articulate his agenda of becoming the
[428.9s] best monk therefore he dedicated himself
[432.6s] took sacraments he fasted of course the
[435.6s] Penance he even performed Act of
[438.8s] self-punishment maybe let me take a few
[440.9s] minutes to explain this self punishment
[444.5s] which is means he could go and surpass
[448.0s] sleep he endured winter nights without
[451.4s] covering himself with
[453.4s] blanket hello yeah the people the things
[457.2s] people do out here sometimes maybe
[459.2s] outrageous but all this with the view of
[462.4s] become the best the best fearing the
[465.0s] wrath of God fearing that he fearing
[468.0s] death therefore he will continue to tell
[471.5s] anything possible to atone for his sins
[475.0s] he even whipped himself Luther whipping
[477.3s] himself so that he probably becomes more
[480.2s] Pious in this preg journey he was taking
[483.3s] he was right according to the his
[485.3s] upbringing is it possible in this
[487.9s] audience in this congregation we are
[490.4s] actually repeating the very step
[492.6s] mistakes that has been handed down from
[495.2s] a people who probably were unconverted
[498.1s] is possible maybe in our religious quest
[501.2s] of seeking for things we have actually
[503.6s] adopted a
[505.5s] self-righteousness mechanism forgetting
[508.3s] that our righteousness is made only by
[510.5s] God beloved of God I'm suggesting that
[513.2s] probably in our own examination we let
[516.5s] as we look at ours introspectively we
[519.2s] discover we may feel we have started
[521.8s] walking the faith but we are not yet
[524.0s] there perhaps because we are only but
[526.6s] living according to other people now
[529.8s] Martin Luther says if anyone could have
[532.0s] earned Heaven by the little life of a
[534.1s] monk it was I he from where he reached
[538.6s] from the level what he achieved to him
[542.0s] he could have been the best of the best
[544.6s] or let me use a language that I can call
[546.4s] bestest if there's an English like that
[549.2s] and this was just but a youth he dropped
[552.0s] his career to achieve to follow things
[555.6s] that will make him better I have also
[558.0s] observed in our U places of residence or
[561.3s] even our country I have found ideas I've
[564.4s] met young people who gave up their
[567.0s] careers someone
[568.9s] [Music]
[572.6s] eventually he just disappears this young
[575.5s] person continues to stop he dropped up
[578.2s] of school I know of young people who
[580.8s] began their Journey so well perhaps in
[582.9s] medicine perhaps in in in engineering
[585.7s] perhaps in any field of study but
[588.2s] because of these false narratives they
[591.8s] dropped out of the school to achieve
[594.2s] some things some funny forms of piety
[598.1s] and beloved God it gets worse that some
[600.8s] of them are our beloved church members
[604.0s] is it possible that you left something
[606.6s] because of an idea someone sold for you
[609.3s] to be honest even the supervisor who was
[612.6s] under the over the authority of Luther
[614.9s] was shocked he he was like this kind of
[617.6s] righteousness is not the one that people
[619.4s] are seeking for in the righteousness of
[621.4s] God the Bible then this young man God
[623.7s] did something God did something powerful
[627.3s] he read the book of Romans chap 1 1: 17
[630.8s] I'm going to re I'm going to rephrase it
[632.8s] for us to understand it says he let let
[635.9s] me read from verse 16 says for God
[638.6s] demonstrated his love towards us in that
[641.5s] while
[642.6s] Christ that um I'll take it again for
[646.0s] God demonstrated his love to us e that
[648.0s] while we are yet in sin Christ died for
[650.3s] us he is a God who does not wait for you
[655.1s] that's Romans 5:8 I must quoted I'm
[657.2s] going to read that one is Romans 5:8 I'm
[658.9s] going to 1:6 it says for I'm not ashamed
[661.8s] of the gospel of Christ for is the power
[663.8s] of God and to Salvation are we together
[666.3s] Romans that's that's Romans 1 verse 16
[669.5s] I'm going to read it because it will lay
[671.4s] Foundation of God I'm going to read I'm
[672.8s] going to share with you it says this
[674.4s] Romans 1:16 Romans 1:16 it says this
[679.2s] uhhuh it says for I am not ashamed of
[682.5s] the gospel thisel of Christ the gospel
[686.4s] of Christ take note the gospel of Christ
[688.8s] not of man
[689.8s] for it is the power of God to what
[693.3s] salvation to how many people everyone
[697.6s] who does what believes for the Jews
[701.0s] first and also the Greek praise God this
[703.9s] is a powerful Proclamation that the
[706.1s] gospel is about Jesus Christ and the
[708.5s] gospel is for everyone who believes so
[711.4s] if you sit next to someone who's a Greek
[713.4s] who's a Jew the gospel is for you maybe
[715.7s] you're watching in this virtual space
[717.6s] whatever it is and you're wondering in
[719.6s] what this is all about it's about Jesus
[721.3s] Christ The Gospel is about Christ it's
[724.1s] not man centered and therefore in verse
[726.8s] 17 as this L Pious L Luther will read in
[730.0s] verse 17 of Romans says for in it the
[733.0s] righteousness of God is revealed from
[737.3s] Faith to Faith as it is written the just
[741.1s] shall live by what by faith not by
[745.0s] works I'm tired and afraid of looking
[749.2s] looking at people who are focusing so
[751.0s] much on Works than the faith beloved I'm
[754.9s] not saying that it's it's wrong to do
[757.6s] certain things but you need to have met
[760.2s] Jesus Christ to convict you convert you
[763.3s] then you can live according to the way
[764.8s] he desires praise God so this Luther
[768.6s] comes to the conclusion that for sure
[771.8s] maybe through his life he's pursued
[775.0s] other careers by I don't blame him I
[777.8s] don't blame him because he was raised in
[780.3s] a church that believe in such such
[781.9s] things but when he comes to meet Jesus
[784.2s] Christ oh my goodness everything changes
[787.4s] when we meet Jesus Christ Our Life does
[790.5s] not remain the same so the things we
[792.7s] used to do in ignorance changes once
[795.2s] again and the things you have the guilt
[797.8s] that you had disappears because now you
[800.4s] are in Christ you are a new creature may
[803.5s] I suggest to us that this is not where
[805.4s] we are preaching from the book of Peter
[807.6s] let's go to Peter Peter is is um is an
[811.1s] interesting person not your pastor he is
[813.5s] not only a vocal person but he's a
[816.4s] proactive character have you met people
[818.5s] who are so proactive in what they do
[820.9s] they are here and there this guy is
[822.9s] proactive he's always around Jesus he
[825.5s] could have made it to the Walk of Fame
[827.6s] you know for those who know about the
[829.2s] Hollywood Walk of Fame if had he been
[831.6s] there then this guy could have made it
[833.0s] there the guy was everywhere proactive
[835.9s] Jesus asked the question the other
[837.2s] people are still chilling he asked them
[839.4s] who who can walk here all of a sudden he
[841.2s] says I'll walk in the Water by the the
[843.7s] only person in history of the world that
[846.2s] has walk on water he's who Peter I've
[849.8s] not had anyone else and as he does this
[852.6s] he is so proactive he is but again he's
[855.3s] an absolute em embodiment of our
[859.3s] inconsistency Peter is with you in this
[861.8s] today again tomorrow he changes his mind
[864.1s] Peter is here today inah thinks he is
[866.5s] celebrated by the Vatican if you've been
[868.4s] to the St Peter Square you'll see that
[870.8s] they even say that suggest that he was
[872.7s] buried there just there in at Vatican
[874.8s] City this guy is so powerful that people
[877.9s] know so much and actually he fought for
[882.0s] Christ he walked on what who else is
[885.2s] such powerful he was close to Jesus but
[888.8s] then something interesting despite being
[891.1s] so close to Christ he also denied Jesus
[894.7s] Christ not everyone that calls the name
[897.5s] of God is always this him some actually
[900.5s] even sing and praying tongues but
[902.6s] they're not with him they've rejected
[904.7s] him already they have refus to allow him
[908.3s] to make a change in their lives and most
[911.6s] painful thing is that those people are
[913.6s] found in our sacred spaces they live as
[917.2s] though they are Christians but in their
[919.6s] heart they have these things they've
[921.3s] held so dear since childhood they cannot
[924.2s] let
[925.1s] go ah let me speak in your language the
[928.0s] people who probably grandmother gave
[929.7s] them some things of rituals in you know
[932.5s] you open that you find something has
[934.0s] been tied on the stomach they are they
[937.0s] baptized but this one they cannot
[938.7s] separate from I have baptized people
[941.2s] that when I'm getting to the baptismal
[942.8s] pool when I tell them to get rid of
[944.8s] certain things are like pastor this for
[947.0s] this this one it's never
[950.7s] removed I know people who carry certain
[954.2s] things wherever they go because the
[955.8s] tradition told them this ought to be S
[958.4s] carried but therefore they have a form
[960.9s] of godliness but the power of God is
[964.0s] denied Peter was so close to Jesus Peter
[967.6s] was powerful Peter was famous Peter was
[971.3s] like you and I very
[973.8s] inconsistent today am with Christ
[976.1s] tomorrow
[977.2s] not let me use it an example
[980.0s] watermelon in
[982.8s] out but still he didn't he you know this
[988.3s] guy's mouth run faster
[990.4s] sometimes than his heart even his mind
[993.3s] we have them we are there we are those
[995.6s] people he's a longstanding disciple with
[999.8s] irregular
[1002.0s] standings he he's he's been there but
[1004.5s] he's irregular I know we usually go for
[1006.4s] papers with you know regular standing
[1008.6s] but IR regular standing is very
[1011.7s] unpredictable he's there with us
[1013.2s] tomorrow is not the power of Christ
[1015.6s] overwhelmed him and led him to
[1017.6s] repentance praise God
[1019.6s] therefore this guy will be able to still
[1023.0s] meet Jesus Christ he was inconsistent
[1025.2s] but he still held on to Christ he didn't
[1028.8s] completely leave him actually as a
[1031.0s] pastor he will write this text now now
[1034.2s] I'm calling you Pastor now let's go to
[1036.9s] Second 1 Peter chapter
[1039.0s] 2 um as it begins I'm I'm I'm I'm going
[1042.1s] to chapter 1 verse one begins says Peter
[1044.4s] an apostle of Christ to the pilgrims of
[1047.8s] dispassion in countes galatia capoa Asia
[1052.0s] and bethia elect according to the for
[1054.4s] knowledge of the Lord sanctification
[1056.2s] Spirit of obedience and sprinkling of
[1058.3s] the blood of Jesus Christ that's how he
[1060.4s] begins his story he begins by
[1063.7s] saying that is an apostle of Jesus
[1067.3s] Christ this is not the inconsistent
[1069.6s] person we've known this is not the
[1071.4s] person that we've always looked at his
[1073.3s] problems and mistakes there is a person
[1075.4s] who has been able to meet Jesus Christ
[1078.2s] and he's writing to the
[1081.1s] pilgrims I now the book of First Peter
[1084.7s] chapter 2 as I mentioned has many
[1087.3s] powerful stories for example let me give
[1089.3s] you the most common verse that we all
[1091.0s] know it says but you are a chosen what
[1094.0s] generation a royal a holy his own
[1098.3s] special people that you may do What
[1101.0s] Proclaim his Praises of him who called
[1103.8s] you out of what Darkness into where His
[1107.2s] Marvelous who knew such a person could
[1109.5s] write a thing Peter wrote this he wrote
[1113.0s] it inspired by the Holy Spirit he's
[1116.0s] saying that you're chosen I wonder if
[1118.6s] you've been able to sit down and think
[1121.0s] about it what it means to be chosen
[1123.6s] actually the Bible say you not choose me
[1125.7s] but I chose you and I appointed you to
[1127.9s] go and bear fruit oh I'm boiling for
[1130.7s] Jesus he's saying that you do not choose
[1132.5s] me but I chose you and therefore when
[1134.4s] you sit in these spaces or when you're
[1136.8s] watching wherever you are just know that
[1138.3s] you're chosen
[1139.5s] you've been called your peculiar you are
[1142.0s] not just any other person therefore in
[1144.0s] chapter 2: 11 I'm just going to zero
[1145.8s] into our main
[1147.3s] text he will say this
[1151.0s] beloved I beg you as sers another word
[1155.0s] is I beseech you as sers and pilgrims
[1158.7s] abstain from fleshly lust
[1162.4s] which war against the what
[1165.7s] soul Peter
[1169.3s] has had an experience Peter has had
[1173.1s] trial Peter has gone through tribulation
[1176.0s] but now for him to speak in a language
[1178.4s] that he wants us to understand he say
[1180.3s] continues to say that in verse 12 having
[1183.2s] your conduct honorable among the
[1185.0s] Gentiles that they may speak against
[1188.4s] they speak against you as evil doers and
[1190.7s] they may uh they may by your good works
[1194.5s] which they observe glorify God in the
[1196.5s] day of
[1197.3s] visitation but I to say that Peter is so
[1200.1s] particular as he drives us to where he
[1202.6s] wants us to understand he call us
[1205.1s] beloved beloved is a language for people
[1207.8s] that are dear he is a language to remind
[1210.9s] these people that actually Christ loves
[1213.5s] you and I love you you to tell your
[1216.6s] neighbor I love
[1218.4s] you I know the last time you told
[1220.5s] someone it becomes so difficult the
[1222.3s] water has become so hard you're afraid
[1224.6s] of telling someone that what is so
[1226.2s] difficult about tell that I love you be
[1227.7s] SM tell someone that love them I'm just
[1230.6s] tell you okay but then if it's difficult
[1232.6s] tell I love you the love of God then
[1234.5s] because inside of you it is so difficult
[1237.3s] tell them I love you but you can see the
[1238.7s] love of God just put that because you
[1240.2s] know someone will tell but but you know
[1241.7s] you know young person these young people
[1243.1s] may follow up in the evening and say but
[1244.7s] you told me you love me in the morning
[1246.9s] church okay then let me put a rer I love
[1249.8s] you with the love of
[1251.7s] God I think that's better because maybe
[1254.2s] you're sitting next to someone you've
[1255.4s] had a beef with for many days you're
[1257.0s] like ah pastor I don't think the spirit
[1259.4s] is leading this love but but I'm saying
[1262.2s] here he begins his text by saying ah he
[1265.3s] says this therefore submit your no in
[1269.0s] verse 11 beloved I beg you the other
[1271.9s] language is I beseech you it says why
[1275.6s] would he be so deliberate in use this
[1278.6s] language why would he be so particular
[1281.3s] with using this this world therefore he
[1283.7s] tells them beloved beloved mean then say
[1286.4s] I beseech you this is a gentle way of an
[1290.6s] appeal it is a way you know it's a two
[1293.3s] word I'm going to get to the Greek words
[1294.6s] but I'm saying the two words that I used
[1296.1s] from the Greek word it means you calling
[1298.2s] someone aside not just calling someone
[1300.5s] aside but you call him for something
[1302.5s] important you want to say so what Peter
[1304.6s] is B basically saying here that he's
[1306.7s] calling them because of there's an
[1308.4s] important something to be use now the
[1310.7s] armies use this word they used to use it
[1313.6s] before go for war they'll be called and
[1316.0s] to be told two things to be warned of
[1318.3s] what will be happen when I tell you uh
[1321.2s] beloved I beseech you to beseech is
[1323.6s] because they will call them and warn
[1325.5s] them of the potential dangers of the
[1327.3s] world they're going to have Paul Peter
[1330.2s] as he speaks therefore he's like trying
[1332.5s] to sell them what I'm what I'm about to
[1334.2s] tell you it's not something easy it's
[1336.9s] like you're getting into war tell them
[1339.2s] the he tells them about the Glorious of
[1341.0s] Victory but there's a danger in the
[1342.8s] battle now it's for you to choose where
[1346.0s] your mind will be what I'm about to say
[1348.5s] there's a glory of being Victorious is
[1350.4s] what I'm going to say but there's also a
[1352.0s] burden of having struggles for what
[1353.8s] you'll choose to say now he invite them
[1357.5s] by saying I beseech you calling them
[1360.2s] aside telling them or preparing for them
[1363.1s] for whatever may happen so therefore
[1366.3s] tell someone something very particularly
[1368.0s] important you call them aside tell them
[1369.8s] man I need to meet you I need to see you
[1372.4s] it's like those many years when there
[1374.3s] was no internet and everything I
[1376.9s] remember my grandfather died 199 91 and
[1379.8s] and I remember the telegram that came
[1382.1s] was my dad's they go the telegram in the
[1384.4s] village was it was written dad
[1387.8s] dead that's a telegram just there's no
[1391.0s] there's no there's no there's no time to
[1393.4s] type beloved of God are you fine noways
[1396.4s] we write that on the are you fine how
[1398.8s] are you no no man I want to talk to the
[1401.0s] young people sometimes you don't have to
[1403.4s] spend so much time in writing many
[1404.7s] things goes to the point sh
[1409.2s] just say it stop stop being very uh pish
[1413.3s] introducing yourself that you a pilgrim
[1415.6s] go to the point just say um I love you
[1419.3s] the love of God and I'm seeing a fature
[1421.2s] with you turn there so tell me what's
[1424.3s] your answer some go go you know
[1429.1s] sometimes you take so much time and you
[1431.2s] always walk around someone these are
[1433.2s] young people you walk together in choir
[1435.3s] you sing you've not you're not even
[1437.0s] speaking you've never said anything I
[1439.4s] remember a young man telling me they
[1440.5s] used to walk from I think my former
[1442.1s] Church New Life all the way to town the
[1443.8s] man the lady came to me and told me this
[1445.4s] man has never said
[1447.0s] anything I'm imagining he loves me I'm
[1450.0s] imagining you're building something but
[1451.6s] it was an assumption but because the man
[1453.8s] never did anything so I was to intervene
[1456.2s] and tell the man by the way you're
[1458.0s] taking so many long walks with this lady
[1460.1s] can you just say
[1461.7s] something now Paul has warn these people
[1465.5s] and he's telling I beseech you why he's
[1468.6s] telling the besch is making them to have
[1471.8s] in a mind that this whatever you're
[1473.3s] engaging with you have to have a Warfare
[1475.4s] mentality and now who are these people
[1478.0s] who are these people that he's
[1479.2s] particular looking to I beg you as
[1481.8s] serers and pilgrims this the word for
[1484.7s] seras is actually uh supposed to mean
[1487.9s] aliens an alien is not is a visor it's
[1491.3s] not he not a resident it's someone who
[1494.1s] lives among other people but this is not
[1497.4s] their home you know let me tell you the
[1500.1s] pilgrims and serers are different a sera
[1503.2s] is someone who is not he's not this is
[1507.0s] not home for him for example when you go
[1509.2s] to a foreign country you can do
[1511.6s] everything eat as they're doing and they
[1513.1s] do everything but when it comes to
[1514.4s] voting you don't vote because that's for
[1516.9s] the right of those who stay there
[1518.6s] therefore he's telling these people
[1520.0s] remember chapter one chapter 1 verse one
[1522.0s] I told you to the pilgrims of dispassion
[1525.7s] he that he was writing to these people
[1527.7s] he say you guys you know what you
[1529.9s] visitors you living around these people
[1533.6s] but you you don't enjoy the same
[1535.7s] privilege as these people let me speak
[1538.3s] in a language that you get it clear but
[1540.3s] we are in this world as
[1543.0s] visitors I know it's difficult for us to
[1545.8s] accept the fact that we have we to
[1548.2s] affect that this is not home but it's
[1550.0s] not home by the way it's
[1552.6s] not it's not let me take a commercial
[1555.6s] break for you to understand those who
[1558.0s] come from nanza especially yanza in this
[1560.6s] country when when when when when someone
[1563.1s] dies you'll hear the way they mo they
[1566.4s] will tell you they'll tell the
[1568.3s] person why you've let me alone you've
[1571.1s] let me here alone wake up talk to me let
[1574.6s] them I'm praying one day this person
[1576.7s] wakes
[1578.4s] up wake up like like it becomes so
[1581.6s] difficult to accept that you are a serer
[1583.8s] you are you are an alien here my Elder
[1586.0s] you are you you're not supposed to be
[1587.7s] here
[1589.2s] you should be like okay now that this
[1591.6s] person rest perhaps it's time for me to
[1593.8s] prepare for the soon return thank you so
[1596.0s] much go for bringing it close to us that
[1598.2s] for sure we are but serers in this land
[1601.8s] and he's telling there stop stainless if
[1604.4s] you a you're a member of this place and
[1606.8s] a surgeoner is different from a pilgrim
[1609.5s] a pilgrim is someone who just passes
[1611.7s] shows up he passes like I not the pastor
[1614.8s] of this church I'm just about a
[1617.1s] pilgrim you you catching what I'm
[1618.9s] throwing I'm a p I'm just passing by
[1622.0s] therefore this is not my final territory
[1626.5s] but I have a destination now in your
[1629.1s] mind as a Christian you ought to live as
[1631.4s] you have a final destination this is not
[1633.4s] home for you therefore when you discover
[1635.8s] that you it's not home for you you don't
[1637.5s] eat like people eat you do not dress
[1639.4s] like people dress you do not speak like
[1641.0s] these people speak because this is not
[1642.8s] home you'll invest Millions to land or
[1645.7s] he but eventually you go back to a
[1647.5s] country where you not speak
[1649.3s] I always like learning languages in
[1650.7s] every country I go but after some time
[1652.4s] they disappear because I have no one to
[1653.8s] speak with I always remember there's
[1655.9s] home now Christians we've been called as
[1658.4s] pilgrims we are called to know that we
[1661.0s] are here temporarily we are called to
[1663.4s] live as as though this is not home it's
[1666.8s] like someone who rents an Airbnb and
[1669.8s] calls his friends to live in that house
[1671.8s] and tells them this is my home this not
[1673.0s] your home
[1673.9s] man it's not your home even for us who
[1676.2s] live in rented houses it's not our home
[1678.5s] we have a final destination and this
[1681.5s] cannot be home a country that is a world
[1684.4s] that is full of sicknesses I've just sat
[1686.8s] here and here heard so many feral
[1688.9s] announcement in the prayer no this
[1691.8s] cannot be home where they struggle this
[1693.9s] cannot be home where every time there's
[1695.8s] a heartbreak this cannot be home where
[1698.7s] one man takes care of 400 ladies it
[1702.1s] cannot be
[1704.4s] home it's not home I know some wondering
[1707.9s] what I'm talking
[1709.0s] about I'm talking about
[1711.6s] Solomon and this can't be home there's a
[1715.9s] better home in heaven for us praise God
[1718.4s] and therefore and therefore listen
[1720.0s] listen listen and therefore listen
[1721.3s] listen how do how how they to live when
[1725.4s] this is not home he uses the word
[1727.5s] abstain abstain is that put a gap
[1730.9s] between me and you there should be a
[1733.6s] space because you can't by the way don't
[1737.0s] play on the devil
[1738.8s] playground it's like ah devil devil
[1742.8s] what's the short form of devil devil
[1745.2s] yeah no you can't you can't attempt to
[1750.5s] play around or flat around certain the G
[1754.0s] has experience one time an old man told
[1756.7s] me he parted my back and told me you're
[1759.0s] not the devil's AG
[1760.4s] mate you're not his
[1762.7s] agement this this this creature has been
[1765.8s] there even before we will be here
[1769.8s] therefore he knows how to bring you it
[1772.8s] says it says then it says to abstain in
[1778.6s] a other language means to consciously
[1782.8s] deliberately withraw from certain things
[1786.5s] which means if I know this path is
[1788.7s] leading me to death I withdraw you this
[1790.9s] other path it means if I know this may
[1794.3s] lead to death just put a the vacation oh
[1799.5s] but he looks like a Christian he dresses
[1801.6s] like a Christian
[1803.7s] H so does the
[1805.9s] devil even the devil I wish I had a text
[1809.2s] I could have shown you a verse where he
[1811.0s] so he looks so awesome from outside but
[1813.8s] you see I can change him you change him
[1815.4s] if youve not changed yourself all these
[1816.8s] years how can you change someone else
[1818.6s] you know you've been messed up in your
[1820.2s] heart for many years but you're saying I
[1822.4s] will change you are you the Holy
[1825.0s] Spirit beloved of God abstain now it
[1828.4s] says from fleshy lusts I know in our
[1832.2s] mind you quickly think about sexual lust
[1834.9s] but fleshy lust has many things it has
[1837.3s] many connotations here there are many
[1839.2s] things that appeal to us sometimes even
[1841.0s] the addictions that you wake up in the
[1843.0s] morning before you even spend time with
[1845.1s] Christ you want to check who liked my Ig
[1847.8s] page who liked my photo how many people
[1851.3s] who is am I trending fleshy it appeals
[1856.2s] temporarily but complet completely
[1859.0s] disappears beloved I want not only I'm
[1861.3s] not only speaking to I'm not only
[1863.3s] speaking to the young people we know
[1864.8s] even as older generation we've gratified
[1867.2s] the things of the heart and we've given
[1869.2s] those things a priority in our lives
[1871.1s] beloved and says this fleshy last get
[1875.7s] rid of them why fleshy last never get
[1879.4s] satisfied Never by the way never you can
[1883.5s] never be satisfied you know you try like
[1885.8s] this actually the flesh will only let go
[1889.1s] until it has it has completely consumed
[1892.2s] you it will not let you go it will not
[1897.2s] it comes creeping slowly haven't you
[1901.0s] read in the Bible the story of Samson it
[1904.0s] began so well uh Mom Dad excuse me I've
[1908.7s] seen a woman down there in Tima get for
[1912.2s] me for a wife dadd is like ah haven't
[1915.3s] you seen people from our own place no
[1919.0s] my my eyes are amazing just bring her
[1922.1s] get get her for me slowly but sure Bible
[1926.3s] says God was his Samson God was his
[1928.3s] Samson but there's a point where it
[1930.4s] reaches and you had he did not know the
[1932.8s] spirit of God had left
[1934.3s] him a point you can always play around
[1937.4s] Devil's Playground but it reaches a
[1939.4s] point I usually say even the devil says
[1941.3s] Ah
[1943.9s] this even the devil says you
[1948.0s] you have a PhD you've exceeded me let
[1951.6s] you do your thing and the Bible says
[1953.6s] therefore this experience is a
[1956.7s] experience of War it Wars about you it
[1960.6s] wrestles with you which Wars against thy
[1963.6s] Soul your mind your character your
[1967.6s] personality it wages with you slowly
[1971.8s] progressively you start going
[1974.7s] down
[1976.4s] know so difficult sometimes when someone
[1979.2s] it's so difficult to disc to sometimes
[1981.0s] even convince someone who was who is in
[1983.4s] love have you evered to talk to
[1985.3s] someone's in
[1986.6s] love but but he he he he but he WR he
[1990.5s] calls me every day till
[1993.4s] midnight but uh but we in love but we
[1998.1s] the same we the same un we share the
[1999.9s] same
[2001.4s] units and maybe you're saying H but
[2003.4s] they're Christians they look Christians
[2005.0s] who who told
[2006.2s] you beloved we are all at war in this
[2009.9s] congregation we are War in this world
[2013.0s] and the quicker we know the quicker we
[2015.8s] abstain from sin says this wrestles with
[2019.9s] the mind I'm just going to take a few
[2022.3s] points here then I I I make my point
[2024.7s] home Peter though he struggle he's a
[2028.8s] testament of sanctification when I look
[2031.8s] at Peter's life I discovered that Christ
[2034.6s] is not done with that yet he's just
[2037.0s] getting started what am I saying that
[2039.0s] you know the people who sell the idea of
[2041.5s] one saved always saved no this guy he
[2046.0s] met Christ at some point but he went up
[2049.5s] and down but the beautiful story is
[2052.1s] Christ never gave up on him and today
[2054.5s] I'm telling you Christ has not given up
[2056.4s] on you he has made a way for you today
[2059.8s] the fact that you can hear this voice
[2062.2s] today is an indication that he's giving
[2065.1s] you a second chance today you know
[2067.1s] there's someone here who doesn't know
[2068.8s] what you're saying he's somewhere in
[2070.8s] some refrigerator maybe across the road
[2073.4s] in one of the mugs
[2075.5s] around may have been
[2077.5s] powerful but now lying there cold and
[2083.0s] responsive and I want to say that Peter
[2086.1s] had a chance he may may have denied
[2088.6s] Jesus Christ three times actually I like
[2090.0s] one of the narrative in the Book of
[2091.5s] Matthew 26 I'm going to read this few
[2093.4s] text then I come to the conclusion
[2094.9s] Matthew 26 um I think it's verse
[2098.6s] 69 listen to this story this is Peter
[2101.6s] now Peter sat outside the CED this is
[2105.0s] now Jesus had told Jes remember in in
[2108.2s] chapter 26 Jesus had told him man you'll
[2111.1s] deny me three times I'm going to I'm
[2113.5s] sorry just allow me to just take you
[2115.1s] back 26
[2118.6s] 26:3 31 says then Jesus said to them of
[2121.8s] that's Matthew 26:31 says when Jesus
[2124.5s] said to them all of you all of you uh
[2127.8s] will be made to stumble because of me
[2130.0s] this night for it is written I will sack
[2131.9s] the shepherd and the sheep of the flock
[2133.9s] will be scattered verse 232 but after I
[2137.6s] have been raised I will go before you to
[2139.3s] Galilee but Peter answered and said to
[2140.8s] him even if all they made all are made
[2144.1s] to stumble because of you I will never I
[2147.4s] will never do what be made to stumble
[2149.9s] his mouth is always
[2151.4s] ahead look at vers 34 Jesus said to him
[2154.6s] assuredly I say to you that this night
[2157.2s] before the the rooster cross you will do
[2159.2s] what deny me how many times three times
[2163.0s] Peter said to him even if I have to die
[2165.8s] with you I will not deny you and so said
[2170.1s] all the disciples they said I will not
[2172.2s] me I cannot I cannot I cannot abandon
[2174.8s] the church I cannot abandon the faith
[2176.4s] that is how proud he is but what he
[2178.2s] didn't know he was still wrestling
[2181.6s] playing around the Devil's Playground
[2184.9s] the young people we do that like I and
[2188.3s] but I'm inan Church look at verse look
[2190.2s] at now let's let's go to chapter the
[2192.2s] same same chapter verse 699 now Peter
[2196.0s] sat outside in the courtyard and a
[2198.3s] servant girl who came to him saying you
[2201.7s] also were with Jesus of Galilee but
[2205.2s] denied it before men all saying I do not
[2208.4s] know what you are saying these guys is
[2210.4s] used to denying things I know what
[2212.9s] you're saying and when he had gone out
[2215.0s] of the Gateway another girl saw him and
[2217.4s] said said to those who were there this
[2220.2s] fellow also was Jesus of Nazareth a but
[2224.4s] again he denied with an O How do
[2229.9s] we I remember do all the things I do not
[2233.3s] know the man we do
[2236.1s] that damn I can't look at verse3 and a
[2240.6s] little later those who stood by came and
[2243.6s] said to Peter surely
[2246.2s] you also also are one of them for your
[2250.3s] speech does what betrays
[2255.5s] you this guy had a heavy and even his
[2258.4s] speech betrayed him then he began to
[2261.8s] curse you know he curing this guy used
[2263.6s] to be used to work where work as
[2266.8s] fisherman you know how they curse Cur
[2268.8s] and so saying I do not know the man
[2270.2s] immediately a rooster C and Peter
[2272.3s] remembered the word of Jesus who had
[2274.4s] said to him before the RO the cross you
[2276.9s] deny me through three times so he went
[2279.5s] out and wept bitterly the GU just
[2283.0s] figured out man he said I cannot deny
[2284.8s] this man three times now three times
[2286.9s] he's denying it was Pro it was
[2288.8s] prophesied it was sa he did it but his
[2291.8s] life doesn't end there that's the good
[2293.6s] news he doesn't end at the point where
