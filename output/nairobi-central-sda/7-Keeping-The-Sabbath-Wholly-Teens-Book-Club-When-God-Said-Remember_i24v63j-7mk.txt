FULL TRANSCRIPT:
uh my name is Bish M lumumba and today we're reading the book When God Says remember but before we get into it let's say a prayer dear father in Heaven oh Lord God we come before you at this time father please help us oh father as we continually discuss this book save us keep us in Jesus name I pray amen amen well ladies and gentlemen today we are discussing chapter 7 keeping the Sabbath holy keeping the Sabbath holy that's holy with a W all right and just to give us a a quick introduction to the same I'll invite uh saira to introduce herself and give us that introduction hello my name is saira I'm a te and today we're going to look at chapter 7 as teacher bismar noted the title is keeping the Sabbath day holy okay so quick summary on what this chapter is about the first point is that God blesses faithfulness we see that in first samel 2:30 it says for those who honor me I will honor and those who despise me shall be lightly esteemed and so what this verse is communicating that if we truly are faithful to God he will esteem us highly secondly we need to understand what obedience entails see obedience unlocks Divine blessings so if you follow in the way of God we are walking into his promises but this idea of blessing When God says the Sabbath day is blessed this means that the blessing is forever and this eternal blessing is available to you to me to every single person who decides to keep the Sabbath day holy I would like to share a verse with you Isaiah CH 56:2 and I'll be referring back to it it says since God's Eternal blessing is in the seventh day Sabbath we are richly blessed as we keep it I'll repeat it one more time since God's Eternal blessing is in the 7eventh day or the Sabbath we are richly blessed as we keep it I'd like to pose a question to teacher Bismark so the chapter notes that God blesses faithfulness where does consistency meet blessing in our relationship with Christ yes yes that's a very good question siber and it's it's very accurate you know we are talking about keeping the Sabbath holy keeping the Sabbath holy you see God gave us this sabbath for perpetuity um in the book of uh Genesis when God creates the world he actually blesses that day you know and in the book of Exodus he then tells us to remember that day uh and then further on in the book of Isaiah he notes that even when the new world is to come that we will still be keeping that Sabbath from New Moon to New Moon we shall join in keeping that Sabbath and so God has given us sabbaths for eternity and expects us to keep them for eternity and consistently and constantly have those sabbaths uh with him ideally so in terms of consistency uh as your question dictates that this consistency is to enable us to experience God on a Perpetual basis throughout our lives all right this consistent basis is to allow us to build that relationship you know if you are in a relationship with somebody you want to consistently talk to them you want to be able to have a conversation with them constantly you know you want to ask them how was your day you know you want to be checking up with them I don't know if you guys have ever seen longdistance uh relationships they're always finding ways to communicate with one another and simply God has done that with the Sabbath as well he has put it there as a memorial for us to constantly and consistently uh talk to him to constantly and consistently reach out to him as well okay so you have spoken about the consistency of God and the provision of the Sabbath allows a weekly dialogue if you will away from the prayer that we are encouraged to have God is recognizing that we do have work but a moment to rest in the form of a day but could you also touch on the consistency of our keeping of the Sabbath MH see blessings mhm in some way in some thought are conditional in the sense of we have to keep our end of the bargain Christ is steadfast in giving us sabbaths but are we steadfast in keeping those sabbaths yeah yeah you know that's that's a very good question um so there are various texts that actually talk about the consistency of man keeping that Sabbath in Deuteronomy CH 28:2 God actually promises his richest blessings to those who obey the Sabbath you know those people who actually constantly keep it you know uh God promises his richest you can imagine God's richest blessings in the book of Isaiah Chapter 58 he actually tells the people that if you turn away your foot from breaking my Sabbath that's consistently yeah so there's actually there actually is a blessing for us as well in keeping the Sabbath you know God blesses you he gives you that time to remind you of his creative power of his salvation and his eternity remember our our our conversation last time on an advance on eternity but there's also a personal blessing for you as well right yeah thank you so much um and the the book has principles on what Sabbath day keeping looks like the first principle is the Sabbath day is created to worshiping our creator and that's just giving us purpose like what is a Sabbath day for to worship ship our creator secondly the second principle is that the Sabbath day is exclusively set apart for physical mental and spiritual renewal I think we were looking on the implementation of holidays by the country by the world and all these things are good we want to have holidays to rest from the ton of work that we have to do whether it's school workor or in the corporate world but also let us know that God has actually created days for us yeah and that's the Sabbath day but if we don't keep the Sabbath day holy it's difficult for us to see rest in the rush yeah yeah the third principle is that the Sabbath is a day of building closer relationships with our family and friends it is also a blessing to those around us in service we can see that the Sabbath day whether we're engaging in potlucks it actually allows us to have family family relationships when you come to church with your family it is a moment of bond right but also God engaged in God Jesus in God incarnate or Jesus Christ engaged in service yeah he ensured to take care of the sick on the Sabbath day he visited those who were in prisons and all these things we encouraged to do are you engaging in service are you benefiting the people of God on the Sabbath day yeah but holy keeping the Sabbath day holy yeah when I think of holy especially with obedience the Bible enforces that we must serve God wholeheartedly wholeheartedly entails your full body Soul everything of your being is invested in obedience yeah and so I have this question does keeping the Sabbath halfheartedly am to not keeping the Sabbath at all yeah no that's a that's a wonderful question sair uh but even before I answer that I just wanted to make a comment on the principles of Sabbath keeping yes um now you know the way God has dictated uh the Sabbath law is that he hasn't given us a to-do list you know I wish he it would have been very easy if he had said you know this do this don't do yes but he hasn't done that essentially what he has done is that he has given us principles in which we are able to keep the Sabbath you know and he doesn't tell us you know exactly what we should do each minute all right of of of the day you know but these principles essentially guide us H uh uh to keep uh the Sabbath you know and you know those principles essentially are are a part of us having a relationship with God and I think SOA has touched on uh the particular principles you know to worship our creator you know to rest uh to to have some family time as well H uh now with the question of uh you know keeping the Sabbath half-heartedly in K we say Shing you know you're keeping it but you're keeping it you know shingo Pandi now I would say that the Sabbath is not drudgery you know the Sabbath is not about us you know uh H uh having a miserable time uh as it were the Sabbath essentially is an attitude you know you have to have the right attitude with the Sabbath you have to understand it as a delight you know you have think about it in terms of listen I'm actually having fun I'm resting I'm I have an advance on eternity I'm I'm learning more about God and what he wants for us and what he's going to do you know and to experience that joy in keeping the Sabbath uh I know earlier I had referenced uh the book of Isaiah Chapter 58 and I just like to read it you know it's such an important verse uh you know the book itself says that uh in verse 13 uh it says that if you turn away your food from my Sabbath from doing your pleasure on my holiday and now this is a part I'd like you to pay attention to and call the Sabbath a delight the holy day of the Lord honorable I shall honor you I shall honor him not doing your own ways not finding your own pleasure or seeking your own words right so you see it's all about an attitude you can imagine he's talking about speaking your own words can you imagine speaking your own words just talking about your own words it's all about an attitude what is the sort of attitude that you have approaching the Sabbath you know is it one of joy is it one of you know I'm actually happy to be spending time in God and then you know the verse goes on to say that the blessing is on the attitude you know if you look at uh verse 14 it says then you shall delight yourself in the Lord and I will cause you to ride on the high hills of the earth and feed you with the heritage of Jacob your father so the blessing is in the attitude can you imagine the bless bling is in you actually enjoying yourself on the Sabbath day and so when you say uh you know you're having a your your you're doing it half-heartedly you know you're you're doing it uh not wholly yeah then you know you miss the mark with keeping the Sabbath oh absolutely and when we see um just like you've noted the half-heartedness of keeping the Sabbath that look that can look like being forced to be here on the Sabbath day also I understand when you are younger to train children is important to get them into understanding what Sabbath is and your mother can force you out of bed to go and go to church on Saturday however it is very important to know that what makes the Christian worship authentic what makes Sabbath keeping authentic it comes with a willingness of the heart to abide in the rest of God and so once we achieve that authenticity we'll realize that the Sabbath is a joy to be in God's presence is the greatest thing that Humanity can attain if you will and I hope that can be realized World Wide amen amen amen and I just wanted to refer to a passage that Mark Finley has in the book and he says you know one of the greatest blessing God gives us is Sabbath rest you know and and you can't really put a price on it you know having renewed physical mental and spiritual rest uh that God gives us on the Sabbath you know and you can't really put a value on that um but having said that ladies and gentlemen I think we've come to the end of uh our analysis of chapter 7 keeping the Sabbath holy uh I just encourage you really to have a look at what insights the book has uh to pick up a copy and to read it I think you'll see that you know God actually blesses faithfulness God blesses Sabbath keeping and that there is a blessing an exponential blessing for to be had just by keeping the Sabbath you know and so having said that I'd invite us to pray as we close yes all right all right let's pray then dear father in Heaven oh Lord God we come before you at this time we'd like to thank you so much oh Father for the day that you have given us thank you so much oh Father for enabling us to read from your holy word now father be with us keep us and protect us save us for your kingdom when you come in Jesus name I pray amen amen and amen 

==================================================

TIMESTAMPED TRANSCRIPT:
[0.5s] uh my name is Bish M lumumba and today
[2.8s] we're reading the book When God Says
[4.8s] remember but before we get into it let's
[6.8s] say a prayer dear father in Heaven oh
[9.0s] Lord God we come before you at this time
[11.1s] father please help us oh father as we
[13.7s] continually discuss this book save us
[16.6s] keep us in Jesus name I pray amen amen
[19.7s] well ladies and gentlemen today we are
[21.1s] discussing chapter 7 keeping the Sabbath
[24.1s] holy keeping the Sabbath holy that's
[26.3s] holy with a W all right and just to give
[29.4s] us a a quick introduction to the same
[31.7s] I'll invite uh saira to introduce
[33.5s] herself and give us that introduction
[35.7s] hello my name is saira I'm a te and
[38.5s] today we're going to look at chapter 7
[41.2s] as teacher bismar noted the title is
[43.8s] keeping the Sabbath day holy okay so
[48.6s] quick summary on what this chapter is
[50.6s] about the first point is that God
[53.5s] blesses faithfulness we see that in
[56.2s] first samel 2:30 it says for those who
[59.5s] honor me I will honor and those who
[62.0s] despise me shall be lightly esteemed and
[65.9s] so what this verse is communicating that
[68.4s] if we truly are faithful to God he will
[72.2s] esteem us
[74.3s] highly secondly we need to understand
[76.8s] what obedience entails see obedience
[79.6s] unlocks Divine blessings so if you
[83.1s] follow in the way of God we are walking
[86.4s] into his promises but this idea of
[89.5s] blessing
[90.6s] When God says the Sabbath day is blessed
[94.1s] this means that the blessing is forever
[97.3s] and this eternal blessing is available
[99.4s] to you to me to every single person who
[103.4s] decides to keep the Sabbath day holy I
[107.4s] would like to share a verse with you
[108.8s] Isaiah CH
[110.4s] 56:2 and I'll be referring back to it it
[113.1s] says since God's Eternal blessing is in
[117.5s] the seventh day Sabbath we are richly
[121.2s] blessed as we keep it I'll repeat it one
[124.0s] more time since God's Eternal blessing
[127.2s] is in the 7eventh day or the Sabbath we
[129.8s] are richly blessed as we keep it I'd
[134.0s] like to pose a question to teacher
[135.6s] Bismark so the chapter notes that God
[138.8s] blesses
[140.4s] faithfulness where does consistency meet
[144.3s] blessing in our relationship with Christ
[148.3s] yes yes that's a very good question
[150.0s] siber and it's it's very accurate you
[151.7s] know we are talking about keeping the
[153.3s] Sabbath holy keeping the Sabbath holy
[155.7s] you see God gave us this sabbath for
[158.8s] perpetuity um in the book of uh Genesis
[162.4s] when God creates the world he actually
[164.8s] blesses that day you know and in the
[167.3s] book of Exodus he then tells us to
[169.6s] remember that day uh and then further on
[173.2s] in the book of Isaiah he notes that even
[176.4s] when the new world is to come that we
[180.2s] will still be keeping that Sabbath from
[182.4s] New Moon to New Moon we shall join in
[184.7s] keeping that Sabbath and so God has
[186.7s] given us sabbaths for eternity and
[190.0s] expects us to keep them for eternity and
[192.8s] consistently and constantly have those
[194.9s] sabbaths uh with him ideally so in terms
[198.7s] of consistency uh as your question
[200.8s] dictates that this consistency is to
[203.8s] enable us to experience God on a
[206.1s] Perpetual basis throughout our lives all
[209.4s] right this consistent basis is to allow
[211.8s] us to build that relationship you know
[213.8s] if you are in a relationship with
[215.1s] somebody you want to consistently talk
[217.4s] to them you want to be able to have a
[219.2s] conversation with them constantly you
[221.4s] know you want to ask them how was your
[222.8s] day you know you want to be checking up
[225.0s] with them I don't know if you guys have
[226.4s] ever seen longdistance uh relationships
[228.9s] they're always finding ways to
[230.3s] communicate with one another and simply
[232.8s] God has done that with the Sabbath as
[234.4s] well he has put it there as a memorial
[236.6s] for us to constantly and consistently uh
[240.3s] talk to him to constantly and
[242.1s] consistently reach out to him as well
[245.5s] okay so you have spoken about the
[247.6s] consistency of God and the provision of
[250.0s] the Sabbath allows a weekly dialogue if
[253.4s] you will away from the prayer that we
[256.0s] are encouraged to have God is
[258.9s] recognizing that we do have work but a
[261.6s] moment to rest in the form of a day but
[264.2s] could you also touch on the consistency
[267.0s] of our keeping of the Sabbath MH see
[270.1s] blessings
[272.1s] mhm in some way in some thought are
[275.9s] conditional in the sense of we have to
[278.5s] keep our end of the bargain Christ is
[280.9s] steadfast in giving us sabbaths but are
[283.9s] we steadfast in keeping those sabbaths
[287.6s] yeah yeah you know that's that's a very
[289.2s] good question um so there are various
[291.7s] texts that actually talk about the
[293.1s] consistency of man keeping that Sabbath
[295.5s] in Deuteronomy CH 28:2 God actually
[298.5s] promises his richest blessings to those
[301.6s] who obey the Sabbath you know those
[303.5s] people who actually constantly keep it
[306.0s] you know uh God promises his richest you
[308.9s] can imagine God's richest blessings in
[311.2s] the book of Isaiah Chapter 58 he
[313.2s] actually tells the people that if you
[315.7s] turn away your foot from breaking my
[318.3s] Sabbath that's consistently yeah so
[320.8s] there's actually there actually is a
[322.9s] blessing for us as well in keeping the
[325.5s] Sabbath you know God blesses you he
[328.5s] gives you that time to remind you of his
[330.8s] creative power of his salvation and his
[332.7s] eternity remember our our our
[334.9s] conversation last time on an advance on
[337.0s] eternity but there's also a personal
[339.6s] blessing for you as well right yeah
[343.0s] thank you so much um and the the book
[346.0s] has principles on what Sabbath day
[348.6s] keeping looks like the first principle
[350.8s] is the Sabbath day is
[352.8s] created to worshiping our creator and
[355.9s] that's just giving us purpose like what
[357.6s] is a Sabbath day for to worship ship our
[360.3s] creator secondly the second principle is
[363.2s] that the Sabbath day is exclusively set
[366.4s] apart for physical mental and spiritual
[370.2s] renewal I think we were looking on the
[372.6s] implementation of holidays by the
[374.8s] country by the world and all these
[377.0s] things are good we want to have holidays
[380.3s] to rest
[382.0s] from the ton of work that we have to do
[384.6s] whether it's school workor or in the
[386.4s] corporate world but also let us know
[389.1s] that God has actually created days for
[391.8s] us yeah and that's the Sabbath day but
[394.4s] if we don't keep the Sabbath day holy
[397.3s] it's difficult for us to see rest in the
[400.2s] rush yeah yeah the third principle is
[403.0s] that the Sabbath is a day of building
[405.6s] closer relationships with our family and
[408.8s] friends it is also a blessing to those
[412.3s] around us in service we can see that the
[415.1s] Sabbath day whether we're engaging in
[416.7s] potlucks it actually allows us to have
[419.2s] family family relationships when you
[421.3s] come to church with your family it is a
[423.4s] moment of bond right but also God
[427.3s] engaged in God Jesus in God incarnate or
[430.8s] Jesus Christ engaged in service yeah he
[433.8s] ensured to take care of the sick on the
[436.1s] Sabbath day he visited those who were in
[439.4s] prisons and all these things we
[441.0s] encouraged to do are you engaging in
[444.2s] service are you benefiting the people of
[447.2s] God on the Sabbath day yeah
[450.4s] but holy keeping the Sabbath day holy
[455.7s] yeah when I think of holy especially
[458.6s] with obedience the Bible enforces that
[461.4s] we must serve God
[464.0s] wholeheartedly wholeheartedly entails
[466.9s] your full body Soul everything of your
[469.6s] being is invested in obedience yeah and
[473.5s] so I have this question does keeping the
[476.4s] Sabbath
[478.2s] halfheartedly am to not keeping the
[481.3s] Sabbath at all yeah no that's a that's a
[484.0s] wonderful question sair uh but even
[486.3s] before I answer that I just wanted to
[487.6s] make a comment on the principles of
[489.4s] Sabbath keeping yes um now you know the
[492.1s] way God has dictated uh the Sabbath law
[494.8s] is that he hasn't given us a to-do list
[497.3s] you know I wish he it would have been
[499.2s] very easy if he had said you know this
[501.0s] do this don't do yes but he hasn't done
[503.8s] that essentially what he has done is
[505.0s] that he has given us principles in which
[507.5s] we are able to keep the Sabbath you know
[509.5s] and he doesn't tell us you know exactly
[511.7s] what we should do each minute all right
[514.2s] of of of the day you know but these
[516.3s] principles essentially guide us H uh uh
[519.8s] to keep uh the Sabbath you know and you
[523.0s] know those principles essentially are
[525.2s] are a part of us having a relationship
[527.7s] with God and I think SOA has touched on
[530.2s] uh the particular principles you know to
[531.7s] worship our creator you know to rest uh
[535.2s] to to have some family time as well H uh
[539.6s] now with the question of uh you know
[541.9s] keeping the Sabbath half-heartedly in K
[544.9s] we say Shing you know you're keeping it
[547.6s] but you're keeping it you know shingo
[549.5s] Pandi now I would say that the Sabbath
[552.2s] is not drudgery you know the Sabbath is
[554.4s] not about us you know uh H uh having a
[558.2s] miserable time uh as it were the Sabbath
[561.6s] essentially is an attitude you know you
[563.9s] have to have the right attitude with the
[565.8s] Sabbath you have to understand it as a
[567.8s] delight you know you have think about it
[570.1s] in terms of listen I'm actually having
[573.0s] fun I'm resting I'm I have an advance on
[575.7s] eternity I'm I'm learning more about God
[578.6s] and what he wants for us and what he's
[580.6s] going to do you know and to experience
[583.4s] that joy in keeping the Sabbath uh I
[586.6s] know earlier I had referenced uh the
[588.4s] book of Isaiah Chapter 58 and I just
[590.6s] like to read it you know it's such an
[592.1s] important verse uh you know the book
[595.4s] itself says that uh in verse 13 uh it
[599.4s] says that if you turn away your food
[600.9s] from my Sabbath from doing your pleasure
[602.8s] on my holiday and now this is a part I'd
[605.5s] like you to pay attention to and call
[607.4s] the Sabbath a
[609.5s] delight the holy day of the Lord
[612.2s] honorable I shall honor you I shall
[614.8s] honor him not doing your own ways not
[617.4s] finding your own pleasure or seeking
[618.8s] your own words right so you see it's all
[621.6s] about an attitude you can imagine he's
[623.8s] talking about speaking your own words
[626.0s] can you imagine speaking your own words
[627.6s] just talking about your own words it's
[629.4s] all about an attitude what is the sort
[630.9s] of attitude that you have approaching
[632.3s] the Sabbath you know is it one of joy is
[635.4s] it one of you know I'm actually happy to
[637.6s] be spending time in God and then you
[639.7s] know the verse goes on to say that the
[641.7s] blessing is on the attitude you know if
[644.1s] you look at uh verse 14 it says then you
[646.4s] shall delight yourself in the Lord and I
[649.0s] will cause you to ride on the high hills
[652.0s] of the earth and feed you with the
[654.2s] heritage of Jacob your father so the
[656.2s] blessing is in the attitude can you
[658.5s] imagine the bless bling is in you
[660.6s] actually enjoying yourself on the
[662.7s] Sabbath day and so when you say uh you
[665.4s] know you're having a your your you're
[667.5s] doing it half-heartedly you know you're
[669.8s] you're doing it uh not wholly yeah then
[672.7s] you know you miss the mark with keeping
[674.8s] the Sabbath oh absolutely and when we
[678.2s] see um just like you've noted the
[682.4s] half-heartedness of keeping the Sabbath
[684.9s] that look that can look like being
[686.2s] forced to be here on the Sabbath day
[689.5s] also I understand when you are younger
[692.2s] to train children is important to get
[695.8s] them into understanding what Sabbath is
[698.2s] and your mother can force you out of bed
[701.0s] to go and go to church on Saturday
[704.1s] however it is very important to know
[707.1s] that what makes the Christian worship
[709.5s] authentic what makes Sabbath keeping
[713.0s] authentic it comes with a willingness of
[716.1s] the heart to abide in the rest of God
[720.6s] and so once we achieve that authenticity
[724.2s] we'll realize that the Sabbath is a joy
[726.9s] to be in God's presence is the greatest
[729.7s] thing that Humanity can attain if you
[731.9s] will and I hope that can be realized
[734.7s] World Wide amen amen amen and I just
[738.5s] wanted to refer to a passage that Mark
[741.4s] Finley has in the book and he says you
[743.4s] know one of the greatest blessing God
[744.8s] gives us is Sabbath rest you know and
[748.0s] and you can't really put a price on it
[749.4s] you know having renewed physical mental
[751.6s] and spiritual rest uh that God gives us
[754.3s] on the Sabbath you know and you can't
[756.6s] really put a value on that um but having
[759.7s] said that ladies and gentlemen I think
[761.0s] we've come to the end of uh our analysis
[763.4s] of chapter 7 keeping the Sabbath holy uh
[766.6s] I just encourage you really to have a
[769.2s] look at what insights the book has uh to
[773.2s] pick up a copy and to read it I think
[775.4s] you'll see that you know God actually
[777.5s] blesses faithfulness God blesses Sabbath
[780.3s] keeping and that there is a blessing an
[782.9s] exponential blessing for to be had just
[785.8s] by keeping the Sabbath you know and so
[788.8s] having said that I'd invite us to pray
[791.2s] as we
[792.1s] close yes all right all right let's pray
[795.0s] then dear father in Heaven oh Lord God
[797.0s] we come before you at this time we'd
