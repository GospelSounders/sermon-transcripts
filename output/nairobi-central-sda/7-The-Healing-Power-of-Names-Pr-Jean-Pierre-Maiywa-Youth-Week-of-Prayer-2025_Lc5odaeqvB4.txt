FULL TRANSCRIPT:
I'd like to greet all of us this morning the lovely name of Jesus good morning and happy Sabbath God is good let me see your hands happy Sabbath happy thank you thank you so much it's so humbling to stand here this morning and at night I was a worried man I was a married man because uh you know this church has a very unique worship service that comes early because of uh what KBC um has offered to do for us so I was a worried man that I will be late for the KBC timing uh but thank God they are not here today uh I'm told they had to go and chase some Vehicles they they are taking care of the Safari rally event that said however I want to thank God for what they have done KBC if you are watching you have done a great job for us and we want to acknowledge your contribution to the great mission of the church the Lord continue to bless you in fact I just saw the newspapers the other day that one of us has been appointed the PS for uh is it ICT or what something like that so you're getting an Adventist who will work with you and we are happy to be one team uh this week has been a very a blessed week the Lord has been able to bless us in many ways we have been considering a theme that was given by the general conference uh it's right behind me with an acronym of act or act which really means a community transformed I'll not be able to go over what I've spoken about the whole week please find the presentations online this morning we will be looking at naming your future or uh in other words the healing power of names Joseph's Journey from Pain to purpose our text is in Genesis chapter number 41 Genesis number 41 and verse 50 through verse 52 I'd like us to read it together as our tradition has been uh at the end of the sermon I'll be making two apologies so let me not apologize up front I'll be apologizing later so uh kindly give us the text Isaiah sorry um Genesis chapter number 41 and verse 50 through verse 52 uh it's taking forever to come so I hope you found it you found the text in your Bible I want to show you how we have been reading so you read it together and help me to preach I read a portion of the text and you do two three words you don't go very far so we can do it together okay let's try and and to Joseph were born before whom as the priest of on oh yes you're doing so well you're doing so well then verse 51 Joseph called the name of the first born for God and all my fathers okay 52 and the name of the second which means to be fruitful the of Christ amen father we thank you this morning for the rare privilege that is ours to Fellowship one with another and to read your word to speak to our hearts I ask oh Lord Holy Spirit to help me to clarify what this message is about speak to each one and speak to me too we pray in Jesus name amen in both the African and biblical Traditions names carry profound meanings and significance they aren't merely labels but they are Declarations of identity purpose and Destiny throughout scripture we see how names capture pivotal moments Divine encounters and even life altering Revelations it's all over the Bible scan the whole landscape and you see it all the way to Revelation and few examples illustrate this more powerfully than Joseph's naming of his two sons in Egypt after years of betrayal slavery and false accusation and imprisonment and justly Joseph finally experiences a very powerful restoration experience yes a very powerful experience indeed so that when Pharaoh elevates him to the second in command in Egypt Joseph quickly settles down and decides to marry and with this woman from Egypt he has two sons the names he gives them reveal the inner healing a journey that he has done over some 20 years a journey of a man who has every right to remain bitter but instead has chosen the path of restoration you see in Genesis 41 5252 what we just read the Bible gives us a window into Joseph's healing experience this window has the names he gives his sons yes the Bible say before the years of femine came the two sons were born to Joseph asath the daughter of pipera of on a priest of on sorry and Who Bore him and Joseph called them the names we just said Manassa and Ephraim these names are are not just names they are powerful and I chose this intentionally for Sabbath yesterday we went to the end but we we're taking a step back to consider this powerful naming ritual that Joseph did but before we do that brothers and sisters I'd like us to look at this strange thing that the Bible has done in verse 50- 52 the strange thing is to mention the name of Joseph Joseph's wife so in order for us to understand the full power of Joseph's naming choices let's contrast them with another biblical naming story before we appreciate asath as a person of the story you see the Bible mentions the idea that names have spiritual connotation and so on but this a name that is given in 1 Chronicles 4 and verse 9 and 10 that I would wish to contrast with this with the Joseph naming in Genesis 41 in this chapter uh 4 of 1 Chronicles 4:9 and 10 we read about a man named jebus the Bible says what let's try and read it together now jabz was than and his mother saying then verse 10 and jez saying what and enlarge that your and that that I may not sorry that may not cause me pain powerful text powerful text I have preached I don't know if I preached in this church when I was here uh from this text but I just want to contrast these two stories for purposes of as appreciating the two naming stories represent opposite approaches to the pain and Trauma that we all go through in life Jeb's mother named her son from an heill pain she suffered trauma and pain but decided to name her son after the pain because the name jebus sounds like a Hebrew word pain actually it does mean pain distrust or sorry uh uh distress pain uh and so on it's a a wide variety of meaning meaning every time someone called the name of jabus they were literally calling him what pain this represents an unprocessed trauma that is passed on from a parent to a child you've heard of generational curses this is a type of a generational Cur you go through pain as a as a person as as an adult then get to the point of getting married and then you choose to pass that pain to your baby in other words you want to immortalize your experience in the life of your baby in other words you also want to say I want to see my child as long as of my life to remember my pain when par s haven't dealt with their own wounds they often transfer that pain to their children and sometimes even embedded or embedding it in their very identity let me pause here for a minute in 1995 1995 General Conference there was a report done by Sabbath School associate Sabbath School director Pastor Tom ashlock he asked the general conference a very pertinent question why is it that this church is losing children he contrasted us with Muslims and Catholics Muslim children permanently remain Muslim a Muslim Catholic children almost permanently remain Catholic you'll often see this play out in a football in a football match say those of you who are who are who are Keen to watch football you will see it Arsenal versus Manu or whatever you will notice a Catholic instantly you will notice a Muslim instantly and I dare say you also notice a 7eventh Adventist and pagans very instantly Muslims would score and they would bow and touch the ground with their forehead and when they rise up you see a finger which is a symbol to say Allah who abbar they associate the score with their God similarly Catholics would score or even at the time of what you call substitution substitution at the point of substitution before a Catholic steps into the into the pitch he would do that thing meaning I go in but with my God on the extreme end are Adventists and the pagans they will score and then run to the corner of the pitch and do some ritualistic dance this is because religion for us is Sabbath but religion for them is life I just came from India the other day last month and thank you for your prayers Church my wife and I were in India for a month initially it was me to be treated but turned out she was also sick and needed help I noticed I stayed long enough to notice enough stuff among the Indians I noticed that in the hotel where we ate at the corner near the Cashers there is a shrine where the money comes through there's a shrine with an idol I'm calling it an idol but with a God every often I would notice this man take the money and then turn remove his shoes go to that corner with his without shoes and light what do you call that thing that gives smoke insects I noticed even when I went in for surgery that at the corner was an idol a god with smoke permanently rising up I noticed that in the clinics where you would go to see the doctor in a corner there is a God and in the taxi that I rode in often there is a God right in front but the funny type that has a shaking head you know the type that shakes head and I asked them they said religion for us is our life so ashlock asked the general conference why are we losing Children and Youth and gave her a very sad very sad report he took the statistics of our church of all children that are dedicated born in church prayed for in church and therefore growing in church through Sabbath School through youth ministry Junior Youth and Senior Youth and so on he took from from 1948 and took the data of children all of them every time we pray for children that statistic is sent to the GC and counted all those children to 1960 12 years window and the numbers were mind blowing he found out that we had one 128 million children born between 20 1948 and 1960 in the 7day Adventist Church which means naturally they should have grown up to become members but instead comparing with the actual numbers of the register we were at 1 million. 55 members worldwide did you hear me 1 million .55 1, 550,000 and yet children are 128 million now I want to associate the 1.55 with evangelism that we preach so hard to win souls in marketplaces but we are busy bearing children and throwing them away now let me ask you if this church was a business we start with 128 million and we say let's invest it in whichever interest money market or whatever and after 12 years Let's do an audit a serious audit and we go ahead invest the 128 million and in 12 years we audit ourselves the report that comes is 1.55 million Shillings in our accounts what would you call this church talk to me a failed business it's not even failed it's a bankrupt business now respectfully respectfully that is what this church is we give birth pray for children and then sell them away a church that has a very Advanced and properly planned Sabbath school with specific needs met for children a church that has a powerful children Ministry I'm not talking about Nairobi Central Church alone I'm talking of 7th Day Adventist Church worldwide of which we are part a church that has a very properly planned for children Ministry and a church that has a powerfully planned Advent youth ministry and yet we lose children I leave you to think about it I don't need need you to answer me now but think about it as we go on with this story thus in this story we find a stark contrast Joseph names his sons from a place of processed pain and discovered purpose though he encourages Egypt sorry he acknowledges Egypt as the land of my affliction he doesn't Define his sons by that Affliction instead he names them based on God's Redemptive work in his life because Manassa means God who has made me forget my pain and epim God who has made me successful and fruitful in the land of my Affliction he is naming his children based on God's Redemptive power in his life the healing he says forget and the fruitfulness Ephraim yes this clearly shows that Joseph processed his pain and now I don't have enough time to dwell on that let's turn to asath his wife she is named asath the daughter of who potifa the priest of on now you must understand that Egyptians were very religious people notoriously so so much so that the priests was a very elaborate and developed system of priesthood they had a complete system that managed they even had their own supplies from government Joseph gets a daughter for a wife from that community and the Bible says asath the the daughter of a priest bore him two sons now you you probably have bypassed that that bit of the story in your reading but I want you to spend a few minutes with me on that question Joseph's healing Journey includes another crucial element the silent supportive presence of his PK wife I call her PK or priest's kid we call them here pastor's kids a priest kid wife ASA though mentioned only briefly her role is significant as the daughter of an Egyptian priest asenath came from an entirely different religious and cultural background in this background children are named carefully as you see Egyptians naming practices typically honor their deities so that the priests are the ones who perpetuated the culture of honoring their gods through the children and you would know children of priests through their names because they were given names of gods amot rames the name that was dedicated to a god and and here she's only named and not discussed a very important point I want to make it quickly her being mentioned intentionally speaks about her allowing things to be ordered in accordance with Hebrew Faith she allowed it she agreed with it she had a right to protest and say look I am a daughter of a priest at least you name one after your Hebrew stuffff I take the other one but instead scripture records no protest from asenath when Joseph gave his two sons their Hebrew names with deeply personal meanings tied to his traumatic past and God's Redemptive work this suggests he created a safe space where Joseph could process his trauma by accepting these names she participated in his healing Journey acknowledging the significance of his past while supporting his forward movement how often wives talking to you how often do you such do do such a thing to stand by your husband and to support him for the sake of turning their lives around how often do you become the supportive silent supportive spouse behind beside your spouse I don't know but you can answer yourself from a psychological perspective this demonstrates what therapists call a holding environment a holding environment a relationship where one feel safe enough to process the difficult emotions of Life Joseph's healing was wasn't a solo Journey as it were it was supported by a partner who respectfully acknowledged his spiritual ual Heritage in spite of our own for the sake of helping him to process his pain and so Genesis 41 again verse 51 and 52 we read Joseph called the name of his firstborn manasse for he God has made he said God had made me forget all my hardship and all my father's house the name of the second he called ephrahim for God has made me fruitful in the land of of my Affliction these two names manasse meaning causing to forget and Ephraim meaning fruitful provide us with a powerful road map for our own healing Journeys you see church we can acknowledge our past without being defined by it God has made me forget my pain in my hardship verse 51 Joseph's first son manasse doesn't suggest that Joseph developed Amnesia about his past rather it indicates that the painful sting of those memories had been removed from his heart Joseph could acknowledge what happened without being controlled by it the name represents a conscious Choice a choice not to let his identity be defined by his wounds this is where true Healing Begins church not in denying our pain but in naming it and then releasing it in order to get the power over what would otherwise get us stuck or fixated Joseph didn't pretend he wasn't sold into slavery he didn't act as if the years in Piper's house and prison didn't happen to him instead he acknowledges that God had helped team move beyond the defining power of those hateful and painful experiences and I ask this morning how many of us remain stuck or fixated because we haven't properly named our pain or perhaps we have named it but continue to let it Define us Joseph shows us there is another way when we bring our wounds into the right acknowledge them honestly and invite God into those spaces we can experience the forgetting that isn't about aasia but about emotional healing and so let's let's be honest Joseph is saying I am not forgetting what happened but I'm choosing to believe or sorry name or reframe but not be defined by it secondly he talks about being fruitful Beyond trauma in his second son if manasa represented acknowledging pain without being defined by it Ephraim takes us a stepf this second son name second son's name reveals that Joseph didn't merely survive his trauma he found unexpected fruitfulness in the very place of his suffering I should pose for that some of us hate hate our our our our our homes because of what may have happened in your home the gender based violence and all ugly things that are often behind closed doors and people end up hating their homes some even hit their country they leave this country go elsewhere and they get or want to adopt a new identity even change names because of what may have happened back home Joseph experiences some unexpected fruitfulness in the land of his suffering notice the profound Paradox in Joseph's regation he calls Egypt the land of my Affliction while simultaneously acknowledging it as at the place where his fruitfulness happened powerful powerful powerful Paradox how do you explain pain and fruitfulness at the same time Only God Can Explain This these teaches are something revolutionary about healing we can experience growth and abundance in the very context that once caused us pain yes I'm saying we can be in the same country and make Kenya a place of our fruitfulness and and and for for families let me say this in quick very very quickly children are a reflection of family narratives the names Joseph gave his children weren't just personal statements they became part of their boys identities and their family's ongoing story every time Joseph called manasa he reaffirmed God's healing power think about that by the way they pronounce it man not manasa as the English people man every time say man my boy it was a God who healed me what a powerful reminder God my healer God who erased in a manner that I can remember but not be defined by it in the African context text which is our context this naming tradition carries similar weight a child named aod in West Africa meaning Joy has come home speaks to the circumstances of their birth and their fam's hopes or the name tendai in southern Africa it gives giving thanks or Baraka in East Africa reflects the family spiritual perspective on the African uh continent these aren't just labels but they are Declarations of our child's life and it clicks in your mind I wish you well my baby I wish you blessings my baby every single day of his life bar bar but I can draw a reminder every day that I wish you blessings my baby it's an African thing so I think we resonate with this Hebrew tradition what what we name our children reveals our deepest values our spiritual understanding and often our own healing Journeys Joseph could have named his sons after his pain that was an option like the lady of First Chronicles a very good name would have been jbes from Manassa because I bore him when I was recovering from pain he could have named him betrayed because he remembered what his brothers did to him or even for he had that option instead he chooses names that pointed to healing and fruitfulness he was consciously creating a new narrative for the Next Generation in his life this speaks directly to how transformed people create transformed families when we experience healing we stop passing our wounds to our children and instead pass on Declarations of God's restoration and God's favor the cycle of pain is intentionally cut or broken and a new Legacy begins this is a choice every home has we don't have to carry our pain into the Next Generation I know most of us who grew in the 70s and 80s had a difficult background I often talk about mine and I talk about mine not because it defines me but to tell you that I have come a long way I mentioned this week that for the first three years of my life I didn't put on pants I had a long shirt that looked like a dress yes with a v on the sides it was a very nice shirt you would wash it in 5 minutes you put it on and in the night when you removed it it sparked You Know It produced spark at night I have looked for those kind of shirs in these days that technology seems to have to have disappeared and and I say it without without apprehension I miss those days you know when you walk in a long dress you feel the climate coming up you feel the climate coming up it's a good thing I don't understand why ladies have to struggle putting on trousers I don't understand psychologists have identified several key areas that we can take away as lessons from this story the first one is greater appreciation for life and change priorities Joseph recognizes God's hand in preserving life shifting his Focus from personal grievance to Divine Purpose we too can do that we can see a greater purpose in this life than the pain of the past secondly warmer more intimate relationships Joseph's capacity for forgiveness reconciliation with his brother others demonstrate emotional growth beyond what most could achieve yes a strong sense of personal strength Joseph's confidence H came not from the denying of the suffering but from recognizing how it had strengthened him yes and this recognition of new possibilities makes Joseph to see possibilities for good that he could have imagined when he in the pit or in the prison yes there something else Spiritual Development and this Spiritual Development psychology says perhaps the most significant Joseph developed a theological perspective that could see God's purposes even in painful circumstances yes I I I have you read Paul Paul says in First Corinthians wives who have husbands or spouses who are not Believers don't leave them I I I think this is what is Paul is talking about they are opportunities in difficulty that you don't get elsewhere and and and and Joseph teaches us this beautiful lessons what what's particularly remarkable is that research confirms Joseph's experience growth of often happens in the very context of suffering not by escaping it psychologists have found that people who try to avoid processing their own trauma typically experience less growth than those who engage with a constructive attempt to resolve them now one that they say in our age and time there are so many mental case or mental illnesses and thank God for the many therapies that we have today you can live a positive life out of the ashes of pain this understanding challenges our natural tendency to believe healing requires complete removal from situations associated without pain instead true healing often involves finding new meaning and purpose within those very contexts where you suffer you can stay in your in your marriage you don't have to divorce you don't have to divorce you don't have to break your children's life to Pieces because they are often the worst hit the worst hit and affected by divorce I know I've checked the records and a common statement in the records says irreconcilable differences and people Pathways but the people to suffer old children who for once believe that marriage never works it's a sham it's a waste of time Joseph didn't need to escape Egypt to thrive God made him fruitful right there yes in the Forgotten land sorry in the Forgotten foreign land of Egypt away from his family in the very Place connected to his suffering this challenges our tendency to believe that healing can only happen if we escape the difficult circumstances it can happen where you are the ultimate evidence of healing isn't just that we have S survived our past but that we have found purpose and productivity despite the pain and despite the hostile environment the toxic world we grew up in yes we have survived and thrived and often they become agents of healing for others creating healthful families and communities that break generational cycles of pain let cite one more or two ideas from psychology modern psychology strong strongly affirms this healing process cess that Joseph demonstrates number one they say there's something called narrative identity Theory taught by a psychologist Dan McAdams he explains that we construct our identities through the stories we tell about ourselves the things we repeat to our children over and over about your past these are stories that help to create a narrative about your legacy and your family when we name our painful experiences but refuse to let them become our our our identity and narrative our entire narrative we are practicing healthy identity formation yes Joseph named his trauma but created a new Narrative of a Divine Purpose and we read it today I mentioned this during the week that Joseph didn't have the benefit we have today you see for us we are looking at things from the window of God who inspired the the text the writing of the text and we see the beautiful blend from this end but from the other end Joseph didn't see what we are seeing but he built somebody has hit me below the belt to conclude naming our journey is important the name manasse and Ephraim reminds us healing is a process with distinct stages it begins with an honest naming of our pain while refusing to be defined by it it continues as we discover unexpected fruitfulness in our difficult places yes and it culminates in the possibility of reconciliation and restoration like Joseph we can use the powerful um uh C of naming to declare God's work in our lives we can acknowledge both our afflictions and the fruitfulness of God's bringing from uh uh in our lives and by so we participate in the Divine work of turning what was meant for evil into something good as Joseph said in chapter 20 not just for ourselves but for many years to come and many generations to follow and uh allow me allow me to use an illustration as I finish this um presentation one of history's most profound examples of naming as as therapy comes from somebody we all know and and often use in our in in our spiritual experiences his name is Horus spford Horus spford is a man who composed the song It Is Well with My Soul 530 Horus spford a successful lawyer and a bus businessman living in Chicago in the 1870s his story demonstrates how naming one's experience through a Redemptive lens can transform overwhelming grief into a blessing of immense proportions spafford's life collapsed into a series of devastating blows first he lost his young son to to to scarlet fever then he then he lost everything through what was called the Great Chicago Fire of 1871 he destroyed his real estate and destroyed his office seeking healing and a fresh start spafford planned a family trip to Europe in 1873 due to unexpected business he SP he sent his wife and children ahead head while he finished whatever business was tying him or holding him back his four daughters went ahead by a ship to Europe and while crossing the Atlantic the story says their ship collided with another vessel and sunk rapidly all four of of spafford's daughters drowned in the accident only his wife Hannah survived and sent him a telegram with two words saved alone as spford sailed to join his grieving wife the ship's Captain called him up to the bridge when they passed near where the accident had occurred and where his children had perished standing at the spot with Indescribable loss and pain spff overwhelmed by grief naturally would have expected him to cry and break down he said he sat down asked for a piece of paper and wrote those powerful words of our song that we sing today it Is Well with My Soul in those lyrics in those lyrics spafford essentially named his devastating experience not according to his pain but according to God's Redemptive perspective when peace he says when peace like a river attended my way when Sorrows like a sea belows rooll wherever my my Lord thou Hast taught me to say it is well it Is Well with My Soul like Joseph naming his sons Manas and Ephraim spafford chose to name his grief experienced through that powerful song that powerful song I end this sermon with a prayer but since we have a prayer session I just want us to transition into the prayer session so that I can make my appeal and offer the prayer at the same time yes so as we prepare to come it Is Well with My Soul it is well with your soul brothers and sisters it is well it will be okay however broken and however spread your pieces may be it is well it is well we will stand and sing that song and as we sing I want to invite you to come so we can pray together yes at this point we all rise kindly we'll all rise we'll all [Music] rise and at at this point before we sing before we sing I had promised to apologize today is a youth day I'm sorry I did not come in uniform I know young people are wondering why did our pastor not put on uniform I'm sorry I didn't put on uniform and secondly some last night we had an anointing service here in church for young people and some called me from other places in town and say Pastor can I come too and I was going to do that today but I'm sorry I'm not going to do it due to unavoidable circumstances I'm not going to do that service so let's sing and while you come I want to ask you to come we pray come we pray come we pray because is well with our souls come we pray if you feel you're broken and you you need you need an assurance that your Brokenness can be healed please come we pray come we pray if your hopelessness seem to overpower the desire for a miracle come we pray for God to turn your prospects come we pray yes come we pray if you feel lost and don't know where to go from here please come we pray it is well my sister It is Well my brother come we pray come home come home we pray home to start a fresh with God so that your experience cannot Define you but it can only express what God has done for you come let's have that beginning and finally come we pray if you need a healing for your family for your for your relationships come come let us pray it Is Well with our souls

[317.5s] identity
[319.5s] purpose and
[322.2s] Destiny throughout
[324.6s] scripture we see how names capture
[328.1s] pivotal moments
[330.7s] Divine
[333.0s] encounters and even life altering
[336.7s] Revelations it's all over the Bible scan
[339.6s] the whole landscape and you see it all
[342.7s] the way to
[343.9s] Revelation and few examples illustrate
[346.4s] this more powerfully than Joseph's
[349.0s] naming of his two sons in
[351.5s] Egypt after years of
[353.8s] betrayal slavery and false
[356.8s] accusation and imprisonment
[362.7s] and justly Joseph finally experiences a
[366.3s] very powerful restoration
[370.2s] experience yes a very powerful
[373.1s] experience
[374.2s] indeed so that when Pharaoh elevates him
[378.1s] to the second in command in Egypt Joseph
[381.5s] quickly settles down and decides to
[384.3s] marry and with this woman from Egypt he
[388.7s] has two sons
[392.7s] the names he gives them reveal the inner
[397.2s] healing a journey that he has done over
[401.3s] some 20
[405.7s] years a journey of a man who has every
[409.1s] right to remain bitter but instead has
[412.6s] chosen the path of
[417.0s] restoration you see in Genesis 41
[420.7s] 5252 what we just read the Bible gives
[423.8s] us a window into Joseph's healing
[427.2s] experience this window has the names he
[430.6s] gives his
[433.1s] sons yes the Bible say before the years
[435.8s] of femine came the two sons were born to
[438.3s] Joseph asath the daughter of pipera of
[441.3s] on a priest of on sorry and Who Bore him
[445.0s] and Joseph called them the names we just
[447.9s] said Manassa and
[450.8s] Ephraim these names are are not just
[455.7s] names they are powerful and I chose this
[459.6s] intentionally for
[461.3s] Sabbath yesterday we went to the end but
[463.9s] we we're taking a step back to consider
[466.2s] this powerful naming ritual that Joseph
[470.4s] did but before we do that brothers and
[473.6s] sisters I'd like us to look at this
[477.0s] strange thing that the Bible has done in
[479.7s] verse 50- 52 the strange thing is to
[482.9s] mention the name of Joseph Joseph's
[487.2s] wife so in order for us to understand
[489.8s] the full power of Joseph's naming
[491.3s] choices let's contrast
[493.9s] them with another biblical naming story
[497.8s] before we appreciate asath as a person
[501.0s] of the story you see the Bible mentions
[504.4s] the idea that
[506.0s] names have spiritual connotation and so
[508.8s] on but this a name that is given in 1
[513.1s] Chronicles 4 and verse 9 and 10 that I
[515.8s] would wish to contrast with this with
[518.3s] the Joseph naming in Genesis
[522.7s] 41 in this chapter uh 4 of 1 Chronicles
[526.8s] 4:9 and 10 we
[529.0s] read about a man named
[534.0s] jebus the Bible says what let's try and
[536.4s] read it together now jabz was
[542.1s] than and his
[545.4s] mother
[549.0s] saying then verse 10 and
[554.1s] jez saying
[558.3s] what and
[560.8s] enlarge that
[563.8s] your and
[566.9s] that that I may not
[570.1s] sorry that may not cause
[571.9s] me pain powerful text powerful text I
[576.7s] have preached I don't know if I preached
[578.7s] in this church when I was here uh from
[580.7s] this text but I just want to contrast
[582.5s] these two stories for purposes of as
[586.1s] appreciating the two naming stories
[588.1s] represent opposite approaches to the
[590.6s] pain and
[592.4s] Trauma that we all go through in
[596.4s] life Jeb's mother named her son from an
[601.0s] heill
[602.8s] pain she suffered trauma and pain but
[607.4s] decided to name her son after the
[613.4s] pain because the name jebus sounds like
[616.1s] a Hebrew word pain actually it does mean
[618.8s] pain distrust or sorry uh uh distress
[623.6s] pain uh and so on it's a a wide variety
[627.9s] of meaning meaning every time someone
[630.4s] called the name of jabus they were
[632.8s] literally calling him what
[637.8s] pain this represents an unprocessed
[641.7s] trauma that is passed on from a parent
[645.0s] to a
[649.1s] child you've heard of generational
[653.1s] curses this is a type of a generational
[655.9s] Cur you go through pain as a as a person
[660.6s] as as an adult then get to the point of
[663.2s] getting married and then you
[665.4s] choose to pass that pain to your
[669.2s] baby in other words you want to
[671.8s] immortalize your experience in the life
[674.4s] of your
[675.2s] baby in other words you also want to say
[678.2s] I want to see my child as long as of my
[681.0s] life to remember my
[687.8s] pain when par s haven't dealt with their
[690.7s] own wounds they often transfer that pain
[693.8s] to their
[695.0s] children and sometimes even
[698.1s] embedded or embedding it in their very
[704.0s] identity let me pause here for a
[707.4s] minute in
[711.4s] 1995 1995 General Conference there was a
[715.1s] report done by Sabbath School associate
[718.5s] Sabbath School director
[720.6s] Pastor Tom
[723.4s] ashlock he asked the general
[727.1s] conference a very pertinent question why
[729.8s] is it that this church is losing
[736.5s] children he contrasted us with Muslims
[739.9s] and
[741.4s] Catholics Muslim
[743.4s] children permanently remain
[746.2s] Muslim a Muslim
[750.1s] Catholic children almost permanently
[753.0s] remain
[754.2s] Catholic you'll often see this play out
[757.2s] in a football in a football match say
[759.9s] those of you who are who are who are
[761.5s] Keen to watch football you will see it
[763.9s] Arsenal versus Manu or whatever you will
[768.2s] notice a Catholic
[770.6s] instantly you will notice a Muslim
[775.2s] instantly and I dare say you also notice
[778.2s] a 7eventh Adventist and pagans very
[782.5s] instantly Muslims would
[785.0s] score and they would bow and touch the
[787.8s] ground with their forehead and when they
[790.6s] rise up you see a finger which is a
[793.2s] symbol to say Allah
[795.0s] who
[796.8s] abbar they associate the score with
[800.7s] their
[802.6s] God similarly Catholics would score or
[807.4s] even at the time of what you call
[811.1s] substitution substitution at the point
[813.2s] of substitution before a Catholic steps
[815.2s] into the into the pitch he would do that
[818.7s] thing meaning I go in but with my
[826.5s] God on the extreme end are Adventists
[829.6s] and the
[832.4s] pagans they will
[834.3s] score and then run to the corner of the
[837.0s] pitch
[841.0s] and do some ritualistic
[847.1s] dance this is because religion for us is
[854.1s] Sabbath but religion for them is
[861.1s] life I just came from India the other
[863.6s] day last
[865.4s] month and thank you for your prayers
[867.6s] Church my wife and I were in India for a
[870.4s] month initially it was me to be treated
[873.7s] but turned out she was also sick and
[876.8s] needed
[877.8s] help I noticed I stayed long enough to
[880.6s] notice enough stuff among the
[882.9s] Indians I noticed that in the hotel
[885.4s] where we ate at the corner near the
[890.0s] Cashers there is a
[893.6s] shrine where the money comes through
[895.8s] there's a shrine with an idol I'm
[899.2s] calling it an idol but with a
[902.4s] God every often I would notice this man
[905.7s] take the money and then turn remove his
[908.5s] shoes go to that corner with his without
[912.6s] shoes and
[915.5s] light what do you call that thing that
[917.6s] gives smoke
[920.9s] insects I noticed even when I went in
[923.8s] for surgery that at the corner was an
[926.8s] idol a god
[929.2s] with smoke
[932.9s] permanently rising up I noticed
[937.2s] that in the clinics where you would go
[940.0s] to see the doctor in a corner there is a
[944.3s] God and in the taxi that I rode in often
[948.0s] there is a God right in front but the
[950.2s] funny type that has a shaking head you
[952.2s] know the type that shakes
[954.9s] head and I asked them they said religion
[957.8s] for us is our life
[960.1s] so ashlock asked the general conference
[962.6s] why are we losing
[965.3s] Children and
[968.8s] Youth and gave her a very sad very sad
[974.2s] report he took the statistics of our
[977.0s] church of all children that are
[978.5s] dedicated born in church prayed for in
[981.7s] church and therefore growing in church
[984.4s] through Sabbath School through youth
[985.9s] ministry Junior Youth and Senior Youth
[987.5s] and so on he took from from
[990.8s] 1948 and took the data of children all
[994.8s] of them every time we pray for children
[997.8s] that statistic is sent to the
[1000.6s] GC and counted all those children to
[1005.9s] 1960 12 years
[1009.4s] window and the numbers were
[1012.9s] mind
[1015.0s] blowing he found out that we had one
[1019.5s] 128 million children born between 20
[1023.4s] 1948 and 1960 in the 7day Adventist
[1027.5s] Church which means naturally they should
[1030.0s] have grown up to become
[1032.4s] members but instead comparing with the
[1035.8s] actual numbers of the register we were
[1038.0s] at 1 million.
[1041.2s] 55 members
[1044.5s] worldwide did you hear
[1046.6s] me 1 million
[1051.2s] .55 1, 550,000
[1055.5s] and yet children are 128 million now I
[1060.5s] want to associate the 1.55 with
[1064.8s] evangelism that we preach so hard to win
[1067.8s] souls in
[1071.6s] marketplaces but we are busy bearing
[1074.4s] children and throwing them away
[1079.0s] now let me ask you if this church was a
[1081.8s] business we start with
[1084.1s] 128 million and we say let's invest it
[1089.0s] in whichever interest money market or
[1091.8s] whatever and after 12 years Let's do an
[1094.6s] audit a serious audit and we go ahead
[1097.9s] invest the 128 million and in 12 years
[1101.1s] we audit ourselves the report that comes
[1104.6s] is
[1106.9s] 1.55 million Shillings in our accounts
[1110.5s] what would you call this
[1115.2s] church talk to
[1120.2s] me a failed
[1122.6s] business it's not even failed it's a
[1124.9s] bankrupt
[1126.4s] business now respectfully
[1132.8s] respectfully that is what this church is
[1142.2s] we give birth pray for children and then
[1146.0s] sell them
[1156.9s] away a church that has a very Advanced
[1161.0s] and properly planned Sabbath
[1163.5s] school with specific needs met for
[1167.7s] children a church that has a powerful
[1170.4s] children Ministry I'm not talking about
[1173.4s] Nairobi Central Church alone I'm talking
[1175.2s] of 7th Day Adventist Church
[1177.2s] worldwide of which we are part a church
[1180.3s] that has a very properly planned for
[1183.8s] children Ministry and a church that has
[1187.2s] a powerfully planned Advent youth
[1190.4s] ministry and yet we lose
[1196.0s] children I leave you to think about it I
[1198.4s] don't need need you to answer me now but
[1199.9s] think about it as we go on with this
[1203.8s] story thus in this story we find a stark
[1209.9s] contrast Joseph names his sons from a
[1214.2s] place of processed
[1217.0s] pain and discovered
[1219.7s] purpose though he encourages Egypt sorry
[1222.8s] he acknowledges Egypt as the land of my
[1226.1s] affliction
[1229.1s] he doesn't Define his sons by that
[1234.8s] Affliction instead he names them based
[1238.0s] on God's Redemptive work in his
[1241.5s] life because Manassa means God who has
[1246.1s] made me forget my
[1248.8s] pain and epim God who has made me
[1252.9s] successful and fruitful in the land of
[1255.3s] my
[1256.3s] Affliction he is naming his children
[1260.0s] based on God's Redemptive power in his
[1264.0s] life the healing he says forget and the
[1268.9s] fruitfulness Ephraim yes this clearly
[1273.0s] shows that
[1274.8s] Joseph processed his
[1278.7s] pain and now I don't have enough time to
[1282.3s] dwell on that let's turn to asath his
[1286.2s] wife she is named asath the daughter of
[1291.8s] who
[1293.6s] potifa the priest of on now you must
[1298.5s] understand that Egyptians were very
[1299.9s] religious people notoriously
[1302.7s] so so much so that the priests was a
[1306.0s] very elaborate and developed system of
[1310.9s] priesthood they had a complete system
[1313.6s] that managed they even had their own
[1316.6s] supplies from government
[1320.2s] Joseph gets a daughter for a wife from
[1322.9s] that
[1324.2s] community and the Bible
[1328.7s] says
[1330.9s] asath the the daughter of a priest bore
[1334.1s] him two sons now you you probably have
[1337.4s] bypassed that that bit of the story in
[1340.5s] your reading but I want you to spend a
[1342.0s] few minutes with me on that question
[1344.6s] Joseph's healing Journey includes
[1346.7s] another crucial element the silent
[1349.4s] supportive presence of his PK wife I
[1352.8s] call her PK or priest's kid we call them
[1356.6s] here pastor's
[1358.4s] kids a priest kid wife
[1361.6s] ASA though mentioned only briefly her
[1364.8s] role is
[1366.4s] significant as the daughter of an
[1368.6s] Egyptian priest asenath came from an
[1371.5s] entirely different religious and
[1373.5s] cultural background in this background
[1376.2s] children are named carefully
[1380.8s] as you see Egyptians naming practices
[1384.4s] typically honor their
[1386.6s] deities so that the priests are the ones
[1388.8s] who perpetuated the culture of honoring
[1391.2s] their gods through the children and you
[1394.0s] would know children of priests through
[1395.6s] their names because they were given
[1397.3s] names of
[1399.9s] gods amot
[1403.4s] rames the name that was dedicated to a
[1406.4s] god
[1408.8s] and and
[1410.8s] here she's only
[1414.2s] named and not
[1416.5s] discussed a very important point I want
[1418.8s] to make it
[1420.2s] quickly her being mentioned
[1422.1s] intentionally speaks about her allowing
[1424.2s] things to be ordered in accordance with
[1426.6s] Hebrew Faith she allowed
[1429.5s] it she agreed with it she had a right to
[1433.6s] protest and say look I am a daughter of
[1436.4s] a priest at least you name one after
[1439.1s] your Hebrew stuffff I take the other one
[1442.6s] but instead scripture records no protest
[1446.5s] from asenath when Joseph gave his two
[1448.8s] sons their Hebrew names with deeply
[1451.6s] personal meanings tied to his traumatic
[1453.9s] past and God's Redemptive
[1457.2s] work this suggests he created a safe
[1460.5s] space where Joseph could process his
[1464.1s] trauma by accepting these names she
[1467.2s] participated in his healing Journey
[1470.4s] acknowledging the significance of his
[1472.3s] past while supporting his forward
[1476.2s] movement how
[1478.4s] often wives talking to you how
[1482.9s] often do you such do do such a thing to
[1486.6s] stand by your husband and to support him
[1489.5s] for the sake of turning their lives
[1491.7s] around how often do you become the
[1494.6s] supportive silent supportive spouse
[1497.7s] behind beside your
[1500.5s] spouse I don't know but you can answer
[1503.1s] yourself from a psychological
[1505.2s] perspective this demonstrates what
[1507.4s] therapists call a holding
[1510.3s] environment a holding environment a
[1513.1s] relationship where one feel safe enough
[1515.3s] to process the difficult emotions of
[1518.2s] Life Joseph's healing was wasn't a solo
[1521.3s] Journey as it were it was supported by a
[1523.9s] partner who
[1525.9s] respectfully acknowledged his spiritual
[1528.3s] ual
[1529.4s] Heritage in spite of our own for the
[1532.6s] sake of helping him to process his
[1537.5s] pain and so Genesis 41 again verse 51
[1540.8s] and 52 we read Joseph called the name of
[1543.3s] his firstborn manasse for he God has
[1546.7s] made he said God had made me forget all
[1550.0s] my hardship and all my father's
[1552.8s] house the name of the second he called
[1555.3s] ephrahim for God has made me fruitful in
[1557.9s] the land of of my Affliction these two
[1560.1s] names manasse meaning causing to forget
[1563.4s] and Ephraim meaning fruitful provide us
[1566.4s] with a powerful road map for our own
[1568.6s] healing
[1570.7s] Journeys you see
[1573.3s] church we can acknowledge our
[1576.6s] past without being defined by
[1581.0s] it God has made me forget my pain in my
[1586.2s] hardship verse 51 Joseph's first son
[1589.6s] manasse doesn't suggest that Joseph
[1591.6s] developed Amnesia about his past rather
[1595.6s] it indicates that the painful sting of
[1598.4s] those memories had been removed from his
[1600.7s] heart Joseph could acknowledge what
[1603.6s] happened without being controlled by
[1607.1s] it the name represents a conscious
[1611.4s] Choice a choice not to let his identity
[1614.6s] be defined by his
[1617.2s] wounds this is where true Healing Begins
[1620.7s] church not in denying our pain but in
[1624.0s] naming it and then releasing it in order
[1627.2s] to get the power over what would
[1630.4s] otherwise get us stuck or
[1635.5s] fixated Joseph didn't pretend he wasn't
[1638.7s] sold into slavery he didn't act as if
[1642.2s] the years in Piper's house and prison
[1644.2s] didn't happen to him instead he
[1646.3s] acknowledges that God had helped team
[1648.8s] move beyond the defining power of those
[1652.4s] hateful and painful
[1657.6s] experiences and I ask this morning how
[1660.3s] many of us remain stuck or fixated
[1663.1s] because we haven't properly named our
[1666.0s] pain or perhaps we have named it but
[1669.4s] continue to let it Define us Joseph
[1672.6s] shows us there is another way when we
[1676.4s] bring our wounds into the right
[1678.9s] acknowledge them honestly and invite God
[1682.0s] into those spaces we can experience the
[1684.9s] forgetting that isn't about aasia but
[1688.2s] about emotional
[1692.5s] healing and so let's let's be honest
[1697.0s] Joseph is
[1700.6s] saying I am not
[1702.7s] forgetting what happened but I'm
[1706.7s] choosing to believe or sorry name or
[1710.8s] reframe but not be defined by it
[1714.6s] secondly he talks about being
[1717.4s] fruitful Beyond trauma in his second son
[1721.2s] if manasa represented acknowledging pain
[1723.4s] without being defined by it Ephraim
[1725.7s] takes us a stepf this second son name
[1729.6s] second son's name reveals that Joseph
[1732.2s] didn't merely survive his
[1734.4s] trauma he found unexpected fruitfulness
[1738.6s] in the very place of his
[1742.8s] suffering I should pose for that some of
[1746.1s] us
[1747.1s] hate hate our our our our our
[1752.2s] homes because
[1754.2s] of what may have happened in your home
[1758.4s] the gender based violence and all ugly
[1760.8s] things that are often behind closed
[1763.2s] doors and people end up hating their
[1765.8s] homes
[1768.2s] some even hit their
[1770.3s] country they leave this country go
[1772.8s] elsewhere and they get or want to adopt
[1776.6s] a new identity even change
[1779.2s] names because of what may have happened
[1781.6s] back
[1782.7s] home Joseph experiences some unexpected
[1786.8s] fruitfulness in the land of his
[1788.6s] suffering notice the profound Paradox in
[1791.2s] Joseph's regation he calls Egypt the
[1793.9s] land of my Affliction while
[1796.0s] simultaneously acknowledging it as at
[1798.4s] the place where his fruitfulness
[1802.0s] happened powerful powerful powerful
[1804.7s] Paradox how do you explain pain and
[1807.0s] fruitfulness at the same time Only God
[1809.9s] Can Explain This these teaches are
[1812.2s] something revolutionary about healing we
[1815.1s] can experience growth and abundance in
[1818.1s] the very context that once caused us
[1821.1s] pain yes I'm saying we can be in the
[1824.1s] same country and make Kenya a place of
[1828.2s] our
[1830.6s] fruitfulness and and and for for
[1833.4s] families let me say this in quick very
[1836.4s] very quickly children are a reflection
[1839.3s] of family
[1840.5s] narratives the names Joseph gave his
[1842.7s] children weren't just personal
[1844.5s] statements they became part of their
[1846.7s] boys identities and their family's
[1848.9s] ongoing story every time Joseph called
[1851.8s] manasa he reaffirmed God's healing power
[1856.5s] think about that
[1858.8s] by the way they pronounce it man not
[1861.2s] manasa as the English people man every
[1864.0s] time say man my boy it was a God who
[1867.6s] healed me what a powerful
[1872.0s] reminder God my
[1875.1s] healer God who
[1878.1s] erased in a manner that I can remember
[1882.0s] but not be defined by
[1886.0s] it in the African context
[1890.7s] text which is our context this naming
[1894.0s] tradition carries similar
[1895.7s] weight a child named aod in West Africa
[1900.4s] meaning Joy has come home speaks to the
[1903.9s] circumstances of their birth and their
[1905.8s] fam's
[1907.8s] hopes or the name tendai in southern
[1911.6s] Africa it gives giving
[1915.8s] thanks or Baraka in East
[1919.3s] Africa reflects the family spiritual
[1922.5s] perspective on the African uh continent
[1926.1s] these aren't just labels but they are
[1928.9s] Declarations of our child's
[1934.3s] life and it clicks in your mind I wish
[1938.0s] you well my baby I wish you blessings my
[1941.3s] baby every single day of his
[1943.9s] life bar bar
[1948.0s] but I can draw a reminder every day that
[1951.7s] I wish you blessings my baby it's an
[1954.6s] African thing so I think we resonate
[1957.0s] with this Hebrew
[1958.4s] tradition what what we name our children
[1961.5s] reveals our deepest values our spiritual
[1964.5s] understanding and often our own healing
[1966.4s] Journeys Joseph could have named his
[1969.4s] sons after his pain that was an option
[1972.8s] like the lady of First
[1975.0s] Chronicles a very good name would have
[1977.1s] been
[1978.6s] jbes from
[1981.5s] Manassa because I bore
[1984.6s] him when I was recovering from
[1988.2s] pain he could have named him
[1992.4s] betrayed because he remembered what his
[1994.6s] brothers did to
[1996.6s] him or even
[1999.5s] for he had that option instead he
[2003.4s] chooses names that pointed to healing
[2006.5s] and fruitfulness
[2008.3s] he was consciously creating a new
[2010.8s] narrative for the Next Generation in his
[2016.1s] life this speaks directly to how
[2019.6s] transformed people create transformed
[2022.4s] families when we experience healing we
[2025.0s] stop passing our wounds to our children
[2027.2s] and instead pass on Declarations of
[2030.0s] God's restoration and God's favor the
[2032.8s] cycle of pain is intentionally cut or
[2035.6s] broken and a new Legacy begins this is a
[2038.7s] choice every home has we don't have to
[2042.7s] carry our pain into the Next
[2046.3s] Generation I know most of us who grew in
[2049.4s] the 70s and 80s had a difficult
[2053.6s] background I often talk about mine and I
[2056.5s] talk about mine not because it defines
[2058.4s] me but to tell you that I have come a
[2060.4s] long way I mentioned this week that for
[2063.7s] the first three years of my life I
[2065.2s] didn't put on pants I had a long shirt
[2068.1s] that looked like a
[2070.4s] dress yes with a v on the sides it was a
[2073.8s] very nice shirt you would wash it in 5
[2075.5s] minutes you put it
[2077.0s] on and in the night when you removed it
[2079.5s] it sparked You Know It produced spark at
[2083.9s] night I have looked for those kind of
[2086.0s] shirs in these days that technology
[2087.8s] seems to have to have
[2091.6s] disappeared and and I say it without
[2094.3s] without apprehension I miss those days
[2098.4s] you know when you walk in a long dress
[2100.5s] you feel the climate coming up you feel
[2102.4s] the climate coming up it's a good
[2106.4s] thing I don't understand why ladies have
[2108.7s] to struggle putting on
[2110.3s] trousers I don't
[2114.8s] understand psychologists have identified
[2118.1s] several key areas that we can take away
[2121.8s] as lessons from this
[2124.4s] story the first one is greater
[2127.8s] appreciation for life and change
[2130.7s] priorities Joseph recognizes God's hand
[2134.2s] in preserving life shifting his Focus
[2137.2s] from personal grievance to Divine
[2140.6s] Purpose we too can do
[2143.0s] that we can see a greater purpose in
[2146.5s] this life than the pain of the past
[2150.7s] secondly warmer more intimate
[2153.6s] relationships Joseph's capacity for
[2155.8s] forgiveness reconciliation with his
[2157.4s] brother others demonstrate emotional
[2159.8s] growth beyond what most could
[2164.8s] achieve yes a strong sense of personal
[2167.3s] strength Joseph's confidence H came not
[2170.5s] from the denying of the suffering but
[2173.0s] from recognizing how it had strengthened
[2177.1s] him yes and this recognition of new
[2179.6s] possibilities makes Joseph to see
[2182.3s] possibilities for good that he could
[2184.7s] have imagined when he in the pit or in
[2188.4s] the
[2189.8s] prison yes there something else
[2191.7s] Spiritual Development and this Spiritual
[2193.6s] Development psychology says perhaps the
[2195.1s] most significant Joseph developed a
[2197.4s] theological perspective that could see
[2200.4s] God's purposes even in painful
[2204.1s] circumstances yes I I I have you read
[2206.9s] Paul Paul says in First Corinthians
[2209.1s] wives who have husbands or spouses who
[2211.3s] are not Believers don't leave
[2213.6s] them I I I think this is what is Paul is
[2216.5s] talking about they are opportunities in
[2219.0s] difficulty that you don't get
[2221.5s] elsewhere and and and and Joseph teaches
[2224.6s] us this beautiful lessons what what's
[2228.0s] particularly remarkable is that research
[2231.7s] confirms Joseph's experience growth of
[2235.1s] often happens in the very context of
[2237.6s] suffering not by escaping it
[2240.1s] psychologists have found that people who
[2242.2s] try to avoid processing their own trauma
[2245.4s] typically experience less growth than
[2247.7s] those who engage with a constructive
[2250.4s] attempt to resolve
[2252.8s] them now one that they say in our age
[2255.2s] and time there are so many mental case
[2257.6s] or mental
[2259.3s] illnesses and thank God for the many
[2262.0s] therapies that we have today you can
[2265.1s] live a positive life out of the ashes of
[2270.1s] pain this understanding challenges our
[2272.7s] natural tendency to believe healing
[2274.5s] requires complete removal from
[2276.4s] situations associated without pain
[2278.5s] instead true healing often involves
[2280.9s] finding new meaning and purpose within
[2283.8s] those very contexts where you suffer you
[2286.6s] can stay in your in your marriage you
[2289.4s] don't have to
[2291.5s] divorce you don't have to
[2294.1s] divorce you don't have to break your
[2296.4s] children's life to
[2299.2s] Pieces because they are often the worst
[2302.0s] hit the worst hit and affected by
[2305.0s] divorce
[2307.8s] I know I've checked the records and a
[2310.3s] common statement in the records says
[2313.3s] irreconcilable
[2315.8s] differences and people
[2320.8s] Pathways but the people to suffer old
[2325.2s] children who for once believe that
[2327.9s] marriage never
[2330.6s] works it's a
[2333.0s] sham it's a waste of time
[2338.7s] Joseph didn't need to escape Egypt to
[2340.8s] thrive God made him fruitful right there
[2344.0s] yes in the Forgotten land sorry in the
[2346.8s] Forgotten foreign land of Egypt away
[2349.2s] from his family in the very Place
[2351.1s] connected to his suffering this
[2353.2s] challenges our tendency to believe that
[2355.5s] healing can only happen if we escape the
[2358.3s] difficult
[2359.1s] circumstances it can happen where you
[2361.2s] are the ultimate evidence of healing
[2364.0s] isn't just that we have S survived our
[2366.4s] past but that we have found purpose and
[2368.7s] productivity despite the pain and
[2371.4s] despite the hostile environment the
[2374.2s] toxic world we grew up in yes we have
[2376.7s] survived and thrived and often they
[2380.0s] become agents of healing for others
[2382.6s] creating healthful families and
[2384.5s] communities that break generational
[2386.2s] cycles of
[2388.3s] pain let cite one more or two ideas from
[2393.0s] psychology modern psychology strong
[2395.2s] strongly affirms this healing process
[2397.4s] cess that Joseph
[2399.5s] demonstrates number one they say there's
[2401.8s] something called narrative identity
[2405.2s] Theory taught by a psychologist Dan
[2408.7s] McAdams he explains that we construct
[2411.5s] our identities through the stories we
[2413.5s] tell about ourselves the things we
[2416.1s] repeat to our children over and over
[2418.2s] about your past these are stories that
[2421.6s] help to create a narrative about your
[2425.0s] legacy and your family
[2429.0s] when we name our painful experiences but
[2431.9s] refuse to let them become our our our
[2436.1s] identity and narrative our entire
[2438.0s] narrative we are practicing healthy
[2440.4s] identity formation yes Joseph named his
[2443.4s] trauma but created a new Narrative of a
[2446.8s] Divine
[2448.7s] Purpose and we read it
[2451.1s] today I mentioned this during the week
[2454.4s] that Joseph didn't have the benefit we
[2456.1s] have today you see for us we are looking
[2457.7s] at things from the window of God who
[2459.4s] inspired the the text the writing of the
[2461.7s] text and we see the beautiful blend from
[2463.6s] this end but from the other end Joseph
[2465.6s] didn't see what we are
[2467.2s] seeing but he
[2477.1s] built somebody has hit me below the
[2485.2s] belt to conclude
[2488.4s] naming our
[2492.5s] journey is
[2494.5s] important the name manasse and Ephraim
[2497.0s] reminds us healing is a process with
[2499.2s] distinct stages it begins with an honest
[2501.8s] naming of our pain while refusing to be
[2504.0s] defined by it it continues as we
[2506.9s] discover unexpected fruitfulness in our
[2509.0s] difficult places yes and it culminates
[2510.9s] in the possibility of reconciliation and
[2512.9s] restoration like Joseph we can use the
[2515.1s] powerful um uh C of naming to declare
[2519.1s] God's work in our lives we can
[2520.9s] acknowledge both our afflictions and the
[2523.1s] fruitfulness of God's bringing from uh
[2525.5s] uh in our lives and by so we participate
[2528.5s] in the Divine work of turning what was
[2531.1s] meant for evil into something good as
[2534.6s] Joseph said in chapter 20 not just for
[2537.1s] ourselves but for many years to come and
[2539.5s] many generations to follow and uh allow
[2543.4s] me allow me to use an illustration as I
[2546.7s] finish this um
[2561.8s] presentation one of history's most
[2564.6s] profound examples of
[2566.4s] naming as as therapy comes from somebody
[2571.0s] we all know and and
[2573.5s] often use in our in in our spiritual
[2577.2s] experiences his name is Horus spford
[2580.1s] Horus spford is a man who composed the
[2582.3s] song It Is Well with My Soul
[2586.6s] 530 Horus spford a successful lawyer and
[2589.6s] a bus businessman living in Chicago in
[2592.2s] the
[2593.7s] 1870s his story demonstrates how naming
[2596.4s] one's experience through a Redemptive
[2598.4s] lens can transform overwhelming grief
[2601.6s] into a blessing of immense proportions
[2605.1s] spafford's life collapsed into a series
[2607.4s] of devastating blows first he lost his
[2610.1s] young son to to to scarlet fever then
[2615.2s] he then
[2617.2s] he lost everything through what was
[2620.0s] called the Great Chicago Fire of 1871 he
[2623.4s] destroyed his real estate and destroyed
[2625.3s] his office seeking healing and a fresh
[2628.3s] start spafford planned a family trip to
[2630.8s] Europe in 1873 due to unexpected
[2633.8s] business he SP he sent his wife and
[2636.1s] children ahead head while he finished
[2638.3s] whatever business was tying him or
[2640.0s] holding him back his four daughters went
[2644.2s] ahead by a
[2646.8s] ship to Europe and while crossing the
[2649.9s] Atlantic the story says their ship
[2652.2s] collided with another vessel and sunk
[2655.6s] rapidly all four of of spafford's
[2659.1s] daughters drowned in the accident only
[2662.4s] his wife Hannah survived and sent him a
[2666.1s] telegram with two
[2668.4s] words saved
[2671.7s] alone as spford sailed to join his
[2674.4s] grieving wife the ship's
[2676.7s] Captain called him up to the bridge when
[2679.8s] they passed near where the accident had
[2682.0s] occurred and where his children had
[2684.0s] perished standing at the
[2687.1s] spot with Indescribable loss and pain
[2691.2s] spff overwhelmed by grief naturally
[2694.9s] would have expected him to cry and break
[2696.8s] down
[2697.8s] he said he sat down asked for a piece of
[2699.8s] paper and wrote those powerful words of
[2703.2s] our song that we sing
[2705.6s] today it Is Well with My Soul in those
[2709.1s] lyrics in those lyrics spafford
[2711.8s] essentially named his devastating
[2713.9s] experience not according to his pain but
[2716.2s] according to God's Redemptive
[2717.6s] perspective when peace he says when
[2720.3s] peace like a river attended my way when
[2722.8s] Sorrows like a sea belows rooll wherever
[2725.9s] my my Lord
[2727.6s] thou Hast taught me to say it is well it
[2732.2s] Is Well with My Soul like Joseph naming
[2734.8s] his sons Manas and Ephraim spafford
[2737.3s] chose to name his grief experienced
[2739.8s] through that powerful song that powerful
[2743.2s] song I end this sermon with a prayer but
[2747.4s] since we have a prayer session I just
[2749.9s] want us to transition into the prayer
[2751.9s] session so that I can make my appeal and
[2754.6s] offer the prayer at the same time
