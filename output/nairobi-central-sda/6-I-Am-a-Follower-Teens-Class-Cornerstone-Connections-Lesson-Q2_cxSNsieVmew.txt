FULL TRANSCRIPT:
Hi, my name is Immanol from cornerstone 1. Ready to tell you the mission story. Our mission story title is a good example. The story is from the country of Thailand. Serin loved her older sister Nehe and copied her actions. One night, one night Seren saw Nehe asked her about it. She really wanted to pray and learn about it. N explained that prayer is talking to the God of the universe. Following N's example, Serene learned how to pray for the first time and decided she wanted to talk to God every single day. Seren now studies at Korat Adventist International School in Thailand where many children like her come from families who have never heard about God. part of her part of a 13th Sabbath offering goes to help fixing the school and thank you for the offering again. Good morning, good afternoon, good evening from wherever you're watching us. Welcome to the teens cornerstone connections lesson number 6 of May 10th, 2025. Our lesson topic today is I am a follower and our amazing panelist will take us through. But before that, let's fellowship in a word of prayer from Tiffany. Let's pray. Dear Jesus, thank you for this day. Thank you for the gift of life. Lord, even as we want to discuss this lesson, may your presence be among us, oh God. May we learn something and may you uh do it in practical in Jesus name I pray. Amen. Amen. Amen. Thank you so much for watching this and we pray that after this you may be able to learn with us and you may be able to understand our lesson. I would request the amazing panelists to introduce themselves from my far right. My name is Stephanie Pal. Michio, my name is Wendy Louisa. And my name is Abigail Muga. And my name is Alvin Moses and I'll be your moderator today. So our topic lesson today as I have mentioned is I am a follower. And so we want to understand that what does it mean when somebody says that you are a follower? Who are you following? Why are you following? And what led you to following the person? So today we will be looking at uh key characters that is Jesus. We'll be looking at Peter, Andrew, James, and John. And they were fishermen as we know from past stories, but we want to dive in and dissect and understand the lesson and how the disciples became disciples from that. So I would ask uh Sean to please tell us when you look at the topic lesson I am a follower what what emotions does it evoke before we even read the lesson what are you anticipating to see inside the lesson? Um you're anticipating to see who like about who you follow and like how you follow Jesus cuz you anticipate it's about Jesus. Amen. And so if you look at our the picture at the cover page, you will see that it's a group of teenagers just like us who are following one of the teenagers. And so they identify them themselves as followers. So our key text today is coming from Luke 58:1. And Abigail will read that for us. And it says, "Simon Peter fell at Jesus knees and said, "Go away from me, Lord. I am a sinful man." Then Jesus said to Simon, "Do not be afraid. From now on, you will fish for people." So they pulled their boots up on the shore, left everything, and followed him. Amen. Could you please tell us like could you paraphrase that statement into an easier way for us to understand and know why why did why was Simon Peter hesitant to follow Christ? So that we have the basis of the lesson. Um I think he was he didn't want to follow Christ because he was scared and didn't know anything about him. True. That is very true. He Okay, maybe we can say that um he quite knew but he felt like he was not worthy. Right. Sometimes we feel like um am I worthy such a favor? Some favors are too huge. Some of them you're like is this the minimum standard? uh am I meeting the minimum standard to do such and such a thing? Like if Christ came today and he's like uh Wendy, come with me. You'll be like, why me? Why not the church pastor? Why not the church elders? Why is it specifically me? And that's what Simon Peter was going through. And you see, Simon Peter uh knew Jesus and he fell at Jesus and said that he was a sinful man. He identified himself as a sinful man. And this is evidence that no matter how sinful we are, Christ can actually take us over the righteous because he can see space for change in us. So before we go into the story, as we continue brainstorming about what we understand before going in, I'd like us to go through the what do you think section and uh and try to see what what we think about this. try to see what the basic understanding that we have so that when we go into the lesson we can uh better on our understanding. So Sean you take us through the what do you think section? Um if Jesus asked you to leave everything and follow him what would your response be Alvin? If Jesus came to me and he was like leave everything and follow him first I'd be like what is everything? What do I have as my everything? Maybe uh right now I'd say my family. I'd say my friends and I'd have to leave that. But then you try and begin that is it greater than Christ? Of course everything is greater than Christ. But then um you ask yourself why me? What has he seen in me? And so what what I would I'd leave everything and I'd follow him. Maybe Wendy, you can tell us your your thinking about it. So for me, um first I'll ask him what do you mean by it? Um and since I have believed in Jesus Christ, yes, I leave everything and go for him cuz he's my final goal. Yeah. What about you, Abigail? Um, I might be hesitant cuz I don't know him yet and I might leave some things and still follow him. That's my thought. What are these things that you would leave? Um, I'd leave school. I'd lose some friends. Yeah. Not all friends. Yes. Not all friends. Okay. Uh Tiffany I'll actually yes I'll I'll I think I'll do everything that they have said cuz how okay yeah we have already accepted Christ. Yes but how do you just leave everything and go? But yes I would absolutely say yes but then I'll give it a thought first. Yeah you' give it a thought. That is very wise. Um I mean uh there's there's the aspect of not being sure about it and then there's the aspect of not feeling worthy but then if you are sure that it's Christ cuz obate there's so many false prophets. If you are sure that it's Christ in relation to scripture then you would quite leave everything because the rest are vital. He's the most important thing. So that that is what we are thinking before going into the lesson. Now I'd like us to dive into the story and read the lesson, understand what the lesson is talking about and it's coming from Luke 5 from verses 1 to 11. Understand what it's it's talking about and then from there we can we can see if our thoughts are in relation to that or if we we've altered our thoughts towards that. So Wendy will take us through the story from Luke 5:1-11. You can follow through. Um so this is a story about the four fishermen called as disciples. So it was as the multitude pressed about him to hear the word of God that he stood by the lake of genear and saw two boats standing by the lake. But the fishermen had gone from them and were washing their nets. Then he got into one of the boats, which was Simon's, and asked him to put out a little from the land. And he sat down and taught the multitudes from the boat. When he had stopped speaking, he said to Simon, "Lunch out into the deep and let down your nets for a catch." But Simon answered and said to him, "Master, we have toiled all night and caught nothing. Nevertheless, at your word, I will let down the net." And when they had done this, they caught a great number of fish, and their net was breaking. So they signaled to their partners in the other boat to come and help them. And they came and filled both the boats, so that they began to sink. When Simon Peter saw it, he fell down at Jesus' knees, saying, "Depart from me, for I am a sinful man, O Lord." For he and all who were with him, were astonished at the catch of fish which they had taken. And so also were James and John, the sons of Zebedee, who were partners with Simon. And Jesus said to Simon, "Do not be afraid. From now on you will catch men. So when they had brought their boats to land, they forsook all and followed him. Amen. So tell us what what is he talking about? What is our key story today? We want now to have a deep dive into the lesson. What is our key story for today? What are you learning from what you've just read? So here is when the first four disciples were being called by Jesus Christ. And as we see Peter was Peter Peter um was saw Jesus and he fell down at his knees because he knew he was sinful and saw how great Jesus was. At first when they were going to um put their nets in the lake, they didn't believe it because they have been fishing all night and nothing happened. But when they placed their nets in the in the lake, they got a number a lot of fish and they were shocked and astonished about this. So they had faith and that's what I have learned from this story. Amen. That is very true and it's a very good summary because the four Peter, Andrew, James, and John witnessed something very incredible. It was more of an amazing display of the power that Christ beholds and also the ability to take care of them because this was their everyday job. And he came and he just told them something that they were quite unsure about. He just told them, "Throw back your nets and you'll catch fish." and they had already fished for a very long time and they didn't really catch anything. But this time they caught so many fish that their nets were even cracking and breaking. So it was more of a miracle. It was a very amazing display. It's if it happens in modern life, it would be something very incredible to witness. And this does not mean that Christ is telling us to necessarily leave home and go to him right now. What it means is that we need to live our everyday activities. He may not be asking us to leave where we are to leave church and go to leave school and go. It's all about living your commitments, putting your commitments aside. It's all about uh how your life is planned in relation to all the values. It's all about starting a life that is centered around him. And that comes from baptism. It it comes from spiritual rebirth and complete dedication to God and service to him and others. These are some of the things that identify you as a true Christian and a follower of Christ, more of a disciple because everything that happens in the Bible is a true revelation of what we as Christians should do, right? It is it is more of a an analogy of what we should do as Christians. And so anything that happened in the Bible does not mean that we do that literally that we go to the lake and fish. No, what he's trying to say is that leave aside your job, he will make it better. If it is your school grades, just study and leave everything to him, he will make them better. If it is anything that you're planning your commitments, he has all that at hand. And you'll have to work for yourself. And that will mean not that should not mean all in your life. And not all the disciples were called in the same way. Levi was called as a tax collector, right? Somebody else was called as a fisherman. So everybody has different commitments. Everybody has their own way of life. It doesn't mean that if you see somebody has become a Christian and maybe they uh treaded through a different path that does not mean that that is what you're supposed to do and you can never be too gone. You can always come back to Christ cuz he is a God of second chances. That is our into the story section. And the the gospel of Luke 5:1-11 has been very clear about how the story unfolded from when Jesus came to when uh he met the disciples and to when their disciple uh the disciples who were fishes who are fishermen became fishers of men. So I'd like to ask you um if you look at uh these disciples therefore Peter, Andrew, James, and John, do you think they knew Jesus before this? Before they met Jesus at the at the lake? Do you think Tiffany that they knew Jesus before? Yes, I think so. Because um when Jesus came, he did some miracles before he came personally to them. Yeah. So they knew Jesus only that they didn't know that Jesus would come personally to them, right? Yeah. Sean, what is your take about it? What do you think was uh going on in the minds of the disciples? What emotions did they have when Jesus was like leave your nets and follow me? Would you have done it? I mean somebody random just comes and tells you resign from your job or leave school and follow me. Would you do it? Um personally a random person. No. But you see um in the minds of King Simon and Peter um they were thinking uh they were scared and felt unworthy to be in Jesus's presence. Yes, correct. And that brings us back to the what do you think section. We had a question that uh Sean said to us and we gave various views about it. Some of us said um what exactly do you mean by everything? That's what they would ask Lord. Um, some people are like, I'll leave some things, some friends and some activities and still follow you, but some of them are too important for me to leave. Some people are like, you don't really mean that, do you? They don't really see the truthfulness in that. You know, the deal is too good. And some people are like, absolutely no problem. Let's go. Take me, Lord. And those were our our thoughts before this. Now we have a set of questions that will help us to align to the into the story part of which uh uh Wendy will take us through. But before that I'd like us to to um to to to have a small did you know section about Galilee and the Sea of Galilee so that we know the context of the story. So Abigail will take us through the did you know section. The Sea of Galilee has been a famous spot for fishermen since ancient times. Fishing methods used in Jesus' time probably included fishermen catching fish with their bare hands or in weaker baskets, trapping fish, fishing with hook and line or spearing fish with arrows or harpoons. But fishing with nets was by far the most popular way to fish. Peter, James, Andrew, and John were probably fishing with circular cast nets, which were weighted to allow the net to encircle the fish. They required great skill and also great dedication on the part of the fishermen. Jesus called Peter and his companions away from fishing to a task that would also require skill and total dedication, fishing for human beings to bring into the kingdom of God. Very interesting fact. Uh we could say that we could say that the major um economic activity in Galilee was fishing. What do you think? We could say that right? Yeah. because uh the did you the did you know section that she has read says that many people were fishing, people were skilled, people were using different ways of fishing and most probably the disciples were using um the harpoons and uh attached to floats and weights which required very hard skill. meaning that this is something that they had either done for a very long time or something that they really had to study for to understand the skill because it's a skill. So it means that it was a very important part of their life. In fact, it was like a way of life for them. It was not just an economic activity. It was more than just that. It was it was a their culture. It was their belief that when you wake up you have to fish in whatever time if it is night that is the only way to to find food. That is the only way to find shelter. That is the only way to to to be able to run your daily activities by fishing. And so we believe that in the sea um uh during the fishing activities there are very many people fishing. And so we we ask ourselves the question, why specifically, John, James, Peter, and Andrew? Why was it just them and not the other disciples? And why was it that the previous night they had really struggled fishing? Meaning that they were quite desperate. And meaning that they had, it means that there's some hope lost. You know, you know what I'm saying? It means that there was some hope that they lost since they have been trying to fish the whole night. There's no um reasonable catch. They have been trying to uh compete with other fishermen. But Jesus specifically chooses the four of them. And so Christ can come today and we are the whole congregation is in church and there's a particular trait that is in you. And it is the same thing that happened with Levi. Levi was a tax collector. But Christ came and Christ did not take the Pharisees. Christ did not um decide to uh to go with the church elders. Christ did not decide to go with the Russians. He actually picked the tax collector. And at that time the tax collectors were really the most hated people. You know the story of Zakius. The tax collectors were were like very cringe people that people did not like tax collectors because of what they were doing. And so these four disciples were doing something that it is not a bad activity. It's fishing. But then they were not the only ones fishing. That's what I'm trying to say. Christ saw something in them. And what is this thing? What do you think Christ saw in them? Sean, what do you think Christ will see in somebody and say that this one, no matter how sinful they may be, there's still a chance to uh to be saved. There's, you know, he's a God of second chances. What do you think are some of the traits that we should we should have as Christians so that when he comes, we may be able to go with him. Um because like God is merciful. Um he never saw only the bad side of people but also the good side. And one of the traits we need um uh is forgiving people. Forgiving people. The spirit of forgiveness. Yeah. You know the scripture actually says that if you have a fight with somebody, don't let the sun go down before settling it out. It's actually a sin when you have a grudge on somebody. And forgiveness leads to righteousness. It leads to the understanding that Christ also forgave us. And we have to also uh show that in return Christ loved us to forgive us. So we have to show love and also it's by grace that he forgives us. We also have to be graceful to other people. And it says we should forgive how many times? Seven. Seven times. Yes. So uh let's go to the out of the story section uh by Wendy. Wendy. Wendy you can take us through that. So uh sorry you will you will sort of paraphrase the questions because of time then we can give you our answers our thoughts about it. Okay. So the first question is did Simon Peter and the other fishermen already know Jesus before this event? How might that have made a difference in their response to Jesus Christ? Who can answer that question for me? I think I could go first and then maybe Abigail will follow. Uh we we we've talked about this question and I remember Tiffany was saying that yes they actually knew Jesus before because of what Jesus had done not necessarily to them but to other people and you know people heard the story about it. People knew about Jesus and so they knew Jesus as this as as a very nice person. They knew Jesus as, you know, not necessarily uh their everything because he hadn't take taken them as disciples yet. This is before they became disciples, but they knew him as the Messiah. And so uh knowing this and understanding, you know, when you know somebody and what they do, there's a set of standards that you set for them. Like today I may know uh somebody maybe called Michael but when tomorrow I'm told that Michael is the president there's a sort of standard that I'll put I won't expect to talk to Michael as I used to talk to Michael from before. I won't expect Michael to be available as he used to be. I won't expect Michael to do the things that he used to do. And and and above it I won't expect him to just come to random people and say I'm giving you a sponsorship. I'm giving you a scholarship. I'm giving you money. And there's many people that he can actually do that to if he decides to, but I would expect it to specifically narrow down to me. So, having known that he's the Messiah, it it made a response. It made two I would say it it had two impacts on their response. First of all is that they were flabbergasted that Jesus actually came to them. And second of second is that now they do Jesus is the Messiah. That's why they were able to say yes because they have the assurance that it's not a false prophet. It's not a random madman. It's not a random person. It's the Messiah who came to them. Uh Abigail, what do you think? Um I feel like it made a difference in their response to Jesus because they knew what Jesus was capable of doing. So they followed him. Yes. Okay. Yes. They knew what Jesus was capable of doing. Anybody else? Before we move to the next question. Okay. Let's move to the next question. Um the next question is why do you think Jesus performed the miracle of the great catch of fish before he asked the fisherman to follow him? Abigail please can you answer the question? Um, I feel like Jesus performed the miracle because he wanted them to see what he can do and accept to follow him. Yeah, I agree. Everything is possible. The next question, what impact did the miracle have on Simon Peter and the other fishermen? Um I think it was a positive impact because it was a show or a sign uh that they can equally and actually be fishes of men because just as um Elana has said um God used the miracle of the fish because Jesus teaches people with what they actually know. like if you know about bread, he'll use bread to teach you more uh something uh impactful. Um and basically he uses Jesus uses what is relatable to you. If you look throughout the Bible, the parables and what God has been doing, he uses things which are relatable to the common people around. Yeah, I agree. Why was Simon Peter's response to the miracle? Go away from me Lord. I am a sinful man. What was he thinking? What would you have been thinking at that point? Um personally what I'd have been thinking is uh cuz Jesus like um uh back in the times he was like um very high and that he like I'd be feeling unworthy and a bit scared that he's in my presence. Yeah. Because he was you know Yeah. Also, you know, uh Simon Peter was feeling unworthy. You know, we talked about the standards, the minimal standards and uh the standards that we set for our ourselves. There's this standard that people set that I am the most sinful person. You know, you always think your problems are big until you hear somebody else's problems. Simon thought that he was a sinful man. And that was what he was thinking. The only thing that was going around his head was now Christ has come to me. I am a sinful man. What do I do? Do I confess? Do I just run away? And he was thinking, am I worthy? You know, there's that question that you ask yourself. Uh somebody has invited you somewhere and you're like, am I worthy to attend that meeting? Am I in that uh social class or rather am I in their personal space? And it's it's a it's a psychological experience that everybody feels like they do not reach the particular limit that is needed. And that's what Simon Peter was going through. At that point, what I would have been thinking is that you know there's the way you study trends of past activities to tell uh future happenings. I would be like since he has helped people from before this is when you need to take the chance and give out your life to him because I mean there's no other thing that you can do other than it because the second coming will come and in the same spirit of understanding previous trends to know forthcoming events is when God promises something it has to happen and always say that he promised people that a son would be born and it happened. The son would die, would be crucified, and would resurrect. It happened. And now we have the promise that he's coming again a second time. There's no doubt that that will not happen. And so there's no way around it other than being spiritually reborn, confessing, being forgiven. And again, there is the whole uh aspect of revival that I would really take that in hand, and I would not let that chance slide. Yeah, that's what I would be thinking and I'll definitely take the offer. Um, why do you think the fisherman followed Jesus with without any questions? What do you think they expected from Jesus at that point? Um, I think uh they followed Jesus without questions because the miracle was just too marvelous for them because they they literally worked so hard the past nights and yeah then I think the miracle increased their faith in Christ because as I said the miracle was just relatable to the men and Jesus proved to them that they could actually be fishers of men. Yeah. Amen. Amen. Actually in relation to what she said is this is like a promotion. You know you are a fisherman and then somebody tells you come become fishes of men. You are uh how do I relate this? It's a promotion. It's like a work promotion. The boss comes and tells you that you you have been the receptionist uh welcoming people to the boss's office. Now become the boss and people will be coming to you. Now you'll become the one receiving the people not the one sending the people. It's like a promotion. Now they will they have the skill Jesus saw the skill that they had which is fishing which is attracting things towards them not necessarily people but they had the skill to know where to catch, who to catch and when to catch. and becoming fishers of men in relation to be to being a fisherman meant that they were able because of the skill that they were given. And this is where we need to use all our talents and uh god-given gifts. You need to use what you have to bring people to Christ. If it is singing, the the disciples were were able to fish. You are able to sing, you are able to preach, you are able to do recordings. That is what you should do to bring people to Christ. Because people not only read the Bible, but they also see what their counterparts are doing in relation to what the scripture is saying. Because when you invite somebody to come to church, you tell them go to church, this is the pin location. But then you don't come to church with them. All you're doing is just sending them to church. They'll be like why are you sending me to church and you're not coming? You know in ancient times uh in the book of Nehemiah 1 verse uh chapter 1 the cupbearer was supposed to uh I'm trying to relate this to what we are reading today is that the cup bearer was supposed to taste the king's food so that the king does not die. You know you go to some your friend's house then you're like what is in this uh uh drink? Have you put poison? Then you're like, "Drink it first, then I drink it." That is the same thing that non-Christians rather than Adventists or rather unbelievers want to see from you. They want to see how has your Christianhood changed you and why do you want to change me to become like you? You cannot be calling me to church and you take drugs. Are you bringing me to church to take drugs with you? No. But you are in church and I'm saying you're successful in school. You're getting all A's and B's. I want to be like you. They're looking up upon you. That is because of what you have and that's what the fishermen had the skill and that's why Christ chose them because of what he saw in them and it's a gift that it is only him who gives to people and it is only him who sees it and it is only him who teaches people how to use it. So um we are done with the with the out of the story section. Uh I I would like us to have a further insight from the desire of ages. Uh we this lesson we usually allude all our lessons uh the cornerstone lessons to the desire of ages and for this lesson we are doing the desire of ages or rather you can read it from the humble hero that is chapter 25 and the desire of ages is more of out of scripture context that uh brings us uh to the understanding of what it is like Now the desire of ages in page 250 will tell you that he who loves Christ the most will do the greatest amount of good. That is in relation to scripture. Scripture actually says that but it does not put it in this direct way. But we all know that the more you love Christ, the more you understand the fruits of the Holy Spirit, the more you have the fruits of the Holy Spirit and the more you are able to know what is good and what is bad, how to love your enemies. And the moment you start loving your wrongdoers, the moment you start uh knowing what to cherish and what is bad, that is when you start doing good. You start coming to church to do recordings because you love Christ. You don't just come to do recordings because the uh the lesson topic is there and you're in you're a class member or a church member. You come to do it because of your love to Christ. You come to church, you do good, you volunteer for church activities, you bring people to Christ, you spread the word. you know the three angels messages to all corners of the world. You're doing good because you love Christ and you understand who he is. So Tiffany will take us through uh this the father insight part of it that I am telling you about and then she would relate it to our lesson the desire of ages chapter 25. She won't really read the whole of it because of time but just read that. And then there's the LNG white steps to Christ page 16 the further insight and then there is the desire of ves page 250 also LG white a continuation of what I've read and the father insight. So take us through that section. So um the father uh the father insight uh desire of ages page 250 and it says he who love he who loves Christ the most will do greatest amount of good obedience the service of allegiance of love is the true sign of disciplehip. There is no limit to the usefulness of one who by putting self aside makes room for the work of the Holy Spirit upon his heart and lives the life wholly consecrated to God. So I can try to relate this um you see God um in okay let me God or rather Jesus in this case took uh the four disciples at first because he saw their ability and how they their determination in um what they do best. So he decided to take them and make them fishes of men. So um and also in the deserved ages it says God takes men as they are and educates them for his service if they will yield themselves to him. This means like if you are willing to do God's work, God is also willing to educate you and to make you a better person. Cuz you can ask yourself why didn't Jesus uh go ask the Pharisees cuz they were the bigger people at that time. Yeah. Thank you. So we want to connect that to life in our cornerstone connections. Every day we have a lesson to be studied and a scripture. We won't read the scripture because of time but we want to we want to understand how to connect this to life every day of the week. You know it is about setting time every day of the week to study. So our cornerstone connections lesson has a section of connecting to life where we get to read everyday scriptures and we get to read everyday key points. So take us to the what do you think section not the what do you think section the connecting to that section. We start with Sabbath. By his miracles, Jesus manifested God's power and was attested as God's promised Messiah, the son, 7th Day Adventist. Fundamental beliefs. Number four, as you read the story of Jesus calling Peter and the other fisherman by the sea. Imagine the scene vividly in your mind. Put yourself in Peter's place and try to imagine what you would be experiencing with your five senses as this scene unfolds. With your with our five senses, right? Yeah. That is the sense to see, hear, smell, touch. So I think we we we could take one each. I would start with see. Uh just looking at Jesus Christ in itself would leave me speechless. I would be like, "Huh, is this really Christ?" You know, when you see somebody that you've been wanting to see, I I'll be flabbergasted. What about you? When you hear from him? Um, when I hear from him, I'll be happy cuz he might be saying good words and talking to me about the kingdom of God. Okay. Um, and all the other senses. Of course, there's a way we react. There's the normal human reaction. So on Sunday we read from Romans 12:6-7. And the major question was what uh types of images might Jesus used today to bring people out uh to his kingdom? What images might he use if he was calling a teacher, a bus driver, a doctor, a teenager, a lawyer? You know, everybody has their own way of life. Everybody has the way they used to eat. the way he went to a fisherman, he went and helped them catch fish. If he went to a doctor, maybe he would heal a patient who's at the verge of dying. If he went to a teacher, maybe a teacher of the law, a teacher in school, a teacher of the Bible, a teacher of scripture, he would give them the spirit of the Holy Spirit to understand what they are reading. If it is a bus driver, if it is a lawyer, there's a way he approaches everyone and he knows how to approach everyone and make them spread the gospel. Then on Monday we read from Luke 5:8-11 and we we understood that Jesus helped Simon Peter and other fishermen to catch the miraculous amount of fish. And we've talked about that in the deeper part of the story of Luke 5:8-11. And then on Tuesday and Wednesday we were at the Gospel of Matthew. And that was from Matthew 119, Matthew 19:21 and Matthew 8:21-22. And those are examples of Jesus calling other disciples from their everyday life like Levi being a tax collector and all that. Then on Thursday, we moved to 2 Corinthians 12:9 and we think about things of life that may be standing on our in our way between us and Christ. How do we overcome our challenges that come in between? And then on Friday, we finish by reading the Gospel of Matthew 6:31-33. And we post the question to ourel that if Jesus were to come to you today and say leave anything behind, what would you leave? We looked at that from the what do you think section? Some of us would leave our friends, our phones, our families, our laptops. And that is in relation to life now. And even as the generations move on, the word will still be there and there will be upcoming events that people will have to surrender to follow Christ. So that has been our lesson for today and we thank you so much for uh uh taking part in our lesson today and learning how to become a follower, learning how to leave what you have behind so that you may be able to follow Jesus, to follow God and to follow the word. We pray that you may be able to to uh be able to dissect and to have the lesson and by God's grace and mercy we may be able to become disciples and we may be able to go with him for his second coming. Thank you so much to the amazing panel that has been with us today that has helped us to understand the lesson. We had the previous understanding of it and now we have the understanding of it in deeper context. So to you viewers back at home, thank you so much for following through with us. Thank you so much for being here with us and listening to us. So, we'll close by a word of prayer from Sean. Good. Okay, let's pray. Oh God, we thank you for the gifts of life. We thank you for protecting us throughout the day. Um, oh God, please help us put what you have learned today into our daily lives and help and help us become more like fishes of men. Help us bring our friends closer to God and in Jesus name we pray. Amen.

TIMESTAMPED TRANSCRIPT:
[0.6s] Hi, my name is Immanol from cornerstone
[3.0s] 1. Ready to tell you the mission story.
[5.7s] Our mission story title is a good
[8.4s] example. The story is from the country
[10.8s] of
[12.0s] Thailand. Serin loved her older sister
[14.7s] Nehe and copied her actions. One night,
[18.8s] one night Seren saw Nehe asked her about
[22.3s] it. She really wanted to pray and learn
[25.1s] about it. N explained that prayer is
[28.0s] talking to the God of the universe.
[30.9s] Following N's example, Serene learned
[33.6s] how to pray for the first time and
[35.7s] decided she wanted to talk to God every
[38.0s] single
[40.8s] day. Seren now studies at Korat
[43.7s] Adventist International School in
[45.5s] Thailand where many children like her
[48.7s] come from families who have never heard
[51.3s] about God.
[53.3s] part of her part of a 13th Sabbath
[58.1s] offering goes
[61.2s] to help fixing the school and thank you
[66.2s] for the offering again. Good morning,
[68.6s] good afternoon, good evening from
[70.1s] wherever you're watching us. Welcome to
[71.9s] the teens cornerstone connections lesson
[74.1s] number 6 of May 10th, 2025. Our lesson
[77.8s] topic today is I am a follower and our
[80.2s] amazing panelist will take us through.
[82.2s] But before that, let's fellowship in a
[85.0s] word of prayer from Tiffany. Let's pray.
[88.6s] Dear Jesus, thank you for this day.
[90.6s] Thank you for the gift of life. Lord,
[92.2s] even as we want to discuss this lesson,
[94.6s] may your presence be among us, oh God.
[97.2s] May we learn something and may you uh do
[99.8s] it in practical in Jesus name I pray.
[102.0s] Amen. Amen. Amen. Thank you so much for
[105.0s] watching this and we pray that after
[106.9s] this you may be able to learn with us
[108.8s] and you may be able to understand our
[110.7s] lesson. I would request the amazing
[112.5s] panelists to introduce themselves from
[114.5s] my far right.
[117.4s] My name is Stephanie Pal. Michio,
[121.6s] my name is Wendy Louisa. And my name is
[124.3s] Abigail Muga. And my name is Alvin Moses
[127.1s] and I'll be your moderator today. So our
[129.8s] topic lesson today as I have mentioned
[132.0s] is I am a follower. And so we want to
[134.9s] understand that what does it mean when
[137.9s] somebody says that you are a follower?
[139.8s] Who are you following? Why are you
[141.8s] following? And what led you to following
[143.9s] the person?
[145.6s] So today we will be looking at uh key
[149.3s] characters that is Jesus. We'll be
[151.9s] looking at Peter, Andrew, James, and
[154.1s] John. And they were fishermen as we know
[157.8s] from past stories, but we want to dive
[160.2s] in and dissect and understand the lesson
[163.0s] and how the disciples became disciples
[165.6s] from that. So I would ask uh Sean to
[169.2s] please tell us when you look at the
[172.6s] topic lesson I am a follower what what
[175.6s] emotions does it evoke before we even
[177.9s] read the lesson what are you
[179.4s] anticipating to see inside the lesson?
[181.6s] Um you're anticipating to see who like
[185.8s] about who you follow and like how you
[189.4s] follow Jesus cuz you anticipate it's
[191.3s] about Jesus. Amen. And so if you look at
[195.3s] our the picture at the cover page, you
[197.8s] will see that it's a group of teenagers
[200.0s] just like us who are following one of
[202.6s] the teenagers. And so they identify them
[205.9s] themselves as followers. So our key text
[209.0s] today is coming from Luke
[211.4s] 58:1. And Abigail will read that for us.
[215.5s] And it says, "Simon Peter fell at Jesus
[218.2s] knees and said, "Go away from me, Lord.
[220.9s] I am a sinful man." Then Jesus said to
[223.8s] Simon, "Do not be afraid. From now on,
[226.8s] you will fish for people." So they
[228.7s] pulled their boots up on the shore, left
[230.7s] everything, and followed him. Amen.
[233.4s] Could you please tell us like could you
[235.8s] paraphrase that statement into an easier
[238.2s] way for us to understand and know why
[240.8s] why did why was Simon Peter hesitant to
[243.2s] follow Christ? So that we have the basis
[245.6s] of the lesson.
[247.6s] Um I think he
[249.5s] was he didn't want to follow Christ
[251.9s] because he was scared and didn't know
[253.9s] anything about
[255.3s] him. True. That is very true. He Okay,
[259.2s] maybe we can say that um he quite knew
[262.5s] but he felt like he was not worthy.
[264.6s] Right. Sometimes we feel like um am I
[267.8s] worthy such a favor? Some favors are too
[269.8s] huge. Some of them you're like is this
[272.6s] the minimum standard? uh am I meeting
[274.5s] the minimum standard to do such and such
[276.5s] a thing? Like if Christ came today and
[278.7s] he's like uh Wendy, come with me. You'll
[282.3s] be like, why me? Why not the church
[284.5s] pastor? Why not the church elders? Why
[286.4s] is it specifically me? And that's what
[288.3s] Simon Peter was going through. And you
[290.2s] see, Simon Peter uh knew Jesus and he
[294.3s] fell at Jesus and said that he was a
[297.5s] sinful man. He identified himself as a
[299.7s] sinful man. And this is evidence that no
[303.0s] matter how sinful we are, Christ can
[305.0s] actually take us over the righteous
[307.0s] because he can see space for change in
[309.7s] us. So before we go into the story, as
[312.4s] we continue brainstorming about what we
[314.2s] understand before going in, I'd like us
[316.3s] to go through the what do you think
[318.3s] section and uh and try to see what what
[322.4s] we think about this. try to see what the
[325.1s] basic understanding that we have so that
[327.0s] when we go into the lesson we can uh
[330.6s] better on our understanding. So Sean you
[333.4s] take us through the what do you think
[334.7s] section? Um if Jesus asked you to leave
[338.5s] everything and follow him what would
[340.5s] your response be Alvin?
[343.5s] If Jesus came to me and he was like
[345.9s] leave everything and follow him first
[348.5s] I'd be like what is everything? What do
[351.0s] I have as my everything? Maybe uh right
[355.2s] now I'd say my family. I'd say my
[357.4s] friends and I'd have to leave
[360.3s] that. But then you try and begin that is
[364.4s] it greater than Christ? Of course
[366.0s] everything is greater than Christ. But
[367.8s] then um you ask yourself why me? What
[371.7s] has he seen in me? And so what what I
[375.2s] would I'd leave everything and I'd
[378.2s] follow him. Maybe Wendy, you can tell us
[380.9s] your your thinking about it.
[384.5s] So for me, um first I'll ask him what do
[388.3s] you mean by
[389.7s] it? Um and since I have believed in
[393.4s] Jesus Christ, yes, I leave everything
[395.6s] and go for him cuz he's my final goal.
[398.7s] Yeah.
[400.5s] What about you, Abigail?
[403.0s] Um, I might be hesitant cuz I don't know
[407.4s] him yet and I might leave some things
[409.9s] and still follow him. That's my thought.
[413.2s] What are these things that you would
[414.9s] leave?
[418.9s] Um, I'd leave school. I'd lose some
[422.2s] friends. Yeah. Not all friends. Yes. Not
[425.8s] all friends. Okay. Uh Tiffany
[432.8s] I'll actually yes I'll I'll I think I'll
[435.8s] do everything that they have said
[438.1s] cuz how okay yeah we have already
[441.3s] accepted Christ. Yes but
[444.6s] how do you just leave everything and go?
[447.3s] But yes I would absolutely say yes but
[450.2s] then I'll give it a thought first. Yeah
[453.8s] you' give it a thought. That is very
[455.8s] wise. Um I mean uh there's there's the
[460.2s] aspect of not being sure about it and
[462.1s] then there's the aspect of not feeling
[464.0s] worthy but then if you are sure that
[467.3s] it's Christ cuz obate there's so many
[469.4s] false prophets. If you are sure that
[471.4s] it's Christ in relation to scripture
[473.5s] then you would quite leave everything
[477.3s] because the rest are vital. He's the
[479.1s] most important thing. So that that is
[481.8s] what we are thinking before going into
[483.6s] the lesson. Now I'd like us to dive into
[485.8s] the story and read the lesson,
[488.4s] understand what the lesson is talking
[489.8s] about and it's coming from Luke 5 from
[493.2s] verses 1 to 11. Understand what it's
[496.6s] it's talking about and then from there
[499.4s] we can we can see if our thoughts are in
[502.1s] relation to that or if we we've altered
[504.5s] our thoughts towards that. So Wendy will
[507.0s] take us through the story from Luke
[509.2s] 5:1-11. You can follow through. Um so
[512.3s] this is a story about the four fishermen
[515.4s] called as disciples. So it was as the
[518.3s] multitude pressed about him to hear the
[521.2s] word of God that he stood by the lake of
[525.2s] genear and saw two boats standing by the
[528.6s] lake. But the fishermen had gone from
[531.3s] them and were washing their nets. Then
[534.6s] he got into one of the boats, which was
[537.2s] Simon's, and asked him to put out a
[540.4s] little from the land. And he sat down
[543.4s] and taught the multitudes from the boat.
[546.0s] When he had stopped speaking, he said to
[548.6s] Simon, "Lunch out into the deep and let
[552.2s] down your nets for a catch." But Simon
[555.0s] answered and said to him, "Master, we
[557.8s] have toiled all night and caught
[560.1s] nothing.
[561.3s] Nevertheless, at your word, I will let
[564.0s] down the net." And when they had done
[566.9s] this, they caught a great number of
[568.9s] fish, and their net was breaking. So
[572.6s] they signaled to their partners in the
[575.5s] other boat to come and help them. And
[578.1s] they came and filled both the boats, so
[580.7s] that they began to sink. When Simon
[584.2s] Peter saw it, he fell down at Jesus'
[586.3s] knees, saying, "Depart from me, for I am
[589.5s] a sinful man, O Lord." For he and all
[594.0s] who were with him, were astonished at
[596.6s] the catch of fish which they had taken.
[600.4s] And so also were James and John, the
[603.6s] sons of Zebedee, who were partners with
[607.4s] Simon. And Jesus said to Simon, "Do not
[610.2s] be afraid. From now on you will catch
[613.3s] men. So when they had brought their
[616.2s] boats to land, they forsook all and
[619.8s] followed him.
[621.7s] Amen. So tell us what what is he talking
[625.2s] about? What is our key story today? We
[627.7s] want now to have a deep dive into the
[629.6s] lesson. What is our key story for today?
[632.9s] What are you learning from what you've
[634.9s] just read? So here is when the first
[638.6s] four disciples were being called by
[640.3s] Jesus Christ. And as we see Peter was
[645.0s] Peter Peter um
[648.4s] was saw Jesus and he fell down at his
[651.8s] knees because he knew he was sinful and
[654.1s] saw how great Jesus was. At first when
[657.1s] they were going to um put their nets in
[660.5s] the lake, they didn't believe it because
[663.0s] they have been fishing all night and
[665.2s] nothing happened. But when they placed
[667.2s] their nets in the in the lake, they got
[670.3s] a number a lot of fish and they were
[673.6s] shocked and astonished about this. So
[675.8s] they had faith and that's what I have
[677.8s] learned from this story. Amen. That is
[680.7s] very true and it's a very good summary
[683.2s] because the four Peter, Andrew, James,
[686.3s] and John witnessed something very
[688.6s] incredible. It was more of an amazing
[690.6s] display of the power that Christ beholds
[694.6s] and also the ability to take care of
[697.1s] them because this was their everyday
[699.3s] job. And he came and he just told them
[702.8s] something that they were quite unsure
[704.6s] about. He just told them, "Throw back
[706.0s] your nets and you'll catch fish." and
[707.8s] they had already fished for a very long
[710.0s] time and they didn't really catch
[711.3s] anything. But this time they caught so
[713.6s] many fish that their nets were even
[715.3s] cracking and breaking. So it was more of
[718.7s] a miracle. It was a very amazing
[720.6s] display. It's if it happens in modern
[723.0s] life, it would be something very
[725.6s] incredible to witness. And this does not
[729.2s] mean that Christ is telling us to
[731.1s] necessarily leave home and go to him
[733.8s] right now. What it means is that we need
[737.0s] to live our everyday
[738.9s] activities. He may not be asking us to
[741.2s] leave where we are to leave church and
[742.6s] go to leave school and go. It's all
[744.7s] about living your commitments, putting
[747.5s] your commitments aside. It's all about
[750.5s] uh how your life is planned in relation
[752.8s] to all the values. It's all about
[754.9s] starting a life that is centered around
[756.9s] him. And that comes from baptism. It it
[759.4s] comes from spiritual rebirth and
[762.3s] complete dedication to God and service
[765.0s] to him and others. These are some of the
[766.9s] things that identify you as a true
[769.6s] Christian and a follower of Christ, more
[771.4s] of a disciple because everything that
[774.4s] happens in the Bible is a true
[776.0s] revelation of what we as Christians
[779.1s] should do, right? It is it is more of a
[783.3s] an analogy of what we should do as
[785.1s] Christians. And so anything that
[787.0s] happened in the Bible does not mean that
[788.7s] we do that literally that we go to the
[790.9s] lake and fish. No, what he's trying to
[793.4s] say is that leave aside your job, he
[796.2s] will make it better. If it is your
[797.8s] school grades, just study and leave
[799.8s] everything to him, he will make them
[801.3s] better. If it is anything that you're
[803.2s] planning your commitments, he has all
[805.8s] that at hand. And you'll have to work
[809.7s] for yourself. And that will mean not
[812.8s] that should not mean all in your life.
[814.9s] And not all the disciples were called in
[817.3s] the same way. Levi was called as a tax
[819.5s] collector, right? Somebody else was
[821.4s] called as a fisherman. So everybody has
[824.6s] different commitments. Everybody has
[826.4s] their own way of life. It doesn't mean
[828.2s] that if you see somebody has become a
[829.9s] Christian and maybe they uh treaded
[833.4s] through a different path that does not
[835.4s] mean that that is what you're supposed
[836.8s] to do and you can never be too gone. You
[839.2s] can always come back to Christ cuz he is
[841.0s] a God of second chances. That is our
[843.4s] into the story section.
[846.2s] And the the gospel of Luke 5:1-11 has
[850.5s] been very clear about how the story
[854.2s] unfolded from when Jesus came to when uh
[857.9s] he met the disciples and to when their
[861.2s] disciple uh the disciples who were
[863.2s] fishes who are fishermen became fishers
[865.4s] of men. So I'd like to ask you
[868.4s] um if you look at uh these disciples
[873.3s] therefore Peter, Andrew, James, and
[874.8s] John, do you think they knew Jesus
[876.2s] before this? Before they met Jesus at
[879.0s] the at the lake? Do you think Tiffany
[881.6s] that they knew Jesus before? Yes, I
[885.1s] think so. Because um when Jesus came, he
[888.4s] did some miracles before he came
[890.3s] personally to them. Yeah. So they knew
[893.0s] Jesus only that they didn't know that
[894.8s] Jesus would come personally to them,
[896.5s] right? Yeah. Sean, what is your take
[898.6s] about it? What do you think was uh going
[901.9s] on in the minds of the disciples? What
[903.6s] emotions did they have when Jesus was
[905.4s] like leave your nets and follow me?
[907.0s] Would you have done it? I mean somebody
[909.5s] random just comes and tells you resign
[911.4s] from your job or leave school and follow
[914.0s] me. Would you do it? Um personally a
[916.6s] random person. No. But you see um in the
[920.4s] minds of King Simon and Peter um they
[923.2s] were thinking uh they were scared and
[926.9s] felt unworthy to be in Jesus's presence.
[931.1s] Yes, correct. And that brings us back to
[933.4s] the what do you think section. We had a
[935.6s] question that uh Sean said to us and we
[939.2s] gave various views about it. Some of us
[941.3s] said um what exactly do you mean by
[943.7s] everything? That's what they would ask
[945.3s] Lord. Um, some people are like, I'll
[947.8s] leave some things, some friends and some
[949.7s] activities and still follow you, but
[951.7s] some of them are too important for me to
[953.8s] leave. Some people are like, you don't
[956.4s] really mean that, do you? They don't
[958.4s] really see the truthfulness in that. You
[960.5s] know, the deal is too good. And some
[962.2s] people are like, absolutely no problem.
[964.3s] Let's go. Take me, Lord.
[966.6s] And those were our our thoughts before
[969.3s] this. Now we have a set of questions
[973.0s] that will help us to align to the into
[975.9s] the story part of which uh uh Wendy will
[979.4s] take us through. But before that I'd
[982.2s] like us
[983.2s] to to um to to to have a small did you
[988.0s] know section about Galilee and the Sea
[991.0s] of Galilee so that we know the context
[994.0s] of the story. So Abigail will take us
[996.8s] through the did you know section.
[1000.2s] The Sea of Galilee has been a famous
[1002.2s] spot for fishermen since ancient times.
[1004.8s] Fishing methods used in Jesus' time
[1006.8s] probably included fishermen catching
[1008.7s] fish with their bare hands or in weaker
[1011.0s] baskets, trapping fish, fishing with
[1013.8s] hook and line or spearing fish with
[1015.6s] arrows or harpoons. But fishing with
[1018.4s] nets was by far the most popular way to
[1021.0s] fish. Peter, James, Andrew, and John
[1023.9s] were probably fishing with circular cast
[1026.2s] nets, which were weighted to allow the
[1028.4s] net to encircle the fish. They required
[1031.2s] great skill and also great dedication on
[1033.7s] the part of the fishermen. Jesus called
[1036.5s] Peter and his companions away from
[1038.6s] fishing to a task that would also
[1040.6s] require skill and total
[1042.5s] dedication, fishing for human beings to
[1044.9s] bring into the kingdom of God.
[1048.2s] Very interesting fact.
[1050.8s] Uh we could say that we could say that
[1054.0s] the major um economic activity in
[1056.5s] Galilee was fishing. What do you think?
[1060.4s] We could say that right? Yeah. because
[1063.2s] uh the did you the did you know section
[1066.2s] that she has read says that many people
[1068.9s] were fishing, people were skilled,
[1071.0s] people were using different ways of
[1072.6s] fishing and most probably the disciples
[1074.9s] were using um
[1077.6s] the harpoons and
[1081.7s] uh attached to floats and weights which
[1084.2s] required very hard skill. meaning that
[1087.1s] this is something that they had either
[1089.1s] done for a very long time or something
[1091.3s] that they really had to study for to
[1093.8s] understand the skill because it's a
[1095.4s] skill. So it means that it was a very
[1097.8s] important part of their life. In fact,
[1099.5s] it was like a way of life for them. It
[1103.4s] was not just an economic activity. It
[1106.0s] was more than just that. It was it was a
[1110.0s] their culture. It was their belief that
[1112.3s] when you wake up you have to fish in
[1114.6s] whatever time if it is night that is the
[1117.6s] only way to to find food. That is the
[1119.8s] only way to find shelter. That is the
[1121.8s] only way to to to be able to run your
[1124.9s] daily activities by
[1126.7s] fishing. And so we believe that in the
[1131.3s] sea um uh during the fishing activities
[1134.6s] there are very many people fishing. And
[1136.8s] so we we ask ourselves the question, why
[1140.4s] specifically, John, James, Peter, and
[1144.2s] Andrew? Why was it just them and not the
[1146.6s] other disciples? And why was it that the
[1149.1s] previous night they had really struggled
[1152.0s] fishing? Meaning that they were quite
[1155.0s] desperate. And meaning that they had, it
[1157.8s] means that there's some hope lost. You
[1160.2s] know, you know what I'm saying? It means
[1162.9s] that there was some hope that they lost
[1165.0s] since they have been trying to fish the
[1166.6s] whole night. There's no um reasonable
[1168.8s] catch. They have been trying to uh
[1172.1s] compete with other fishermen. But Jesus
[1174.2s] specifically chooses the four of them.
[1176.2s] And so Christ can come today and we are
[1178.7s] the whole congregation is in church and
[1180.9s] there's a particular trait that is in
[1183.6s] you. And it is the same thing that
[1185.8s] happened with Levi. Levi was a tax
[1188.4s] collector. But Christ came and Christ
[1191.2s] did not take the Pharisees. Christ did
[1193.4s] not um decide to uh to go with the
[1197.4s] church elders. Christ did not decide to
[1199.4s] go with the Russians. He actually picked
[1201.2s] the tax collector. And at that time the
[1203.6s] tax collectors were really the most
[1206.2s] hated people. You know the story of
[1207.8s] Zakius. The tax collectors were were
[1211.6s] like very cringe people that people did
[1215.0s] not like tax collectors because of what
[1216.9s] they were doing. And so these four
[1220.4s] disciples were doing something that it
[1223.4s] is not a bad activity. It's fishing. But
[1226.5s] then they were not the only ones
[1228.7s] fishing. That's what I'm trying to say.
[1230.6s] Christ saw something in them. And what
[1232.5s] is this thing? What do you think Christ
[1233.9s] saw in them? Sean, what do you think
[1236.6s] Christ will see in somebody and say that
[1239.3s] this one, no matter how sinful they may
[1241.8s] be, there's still a chance to uh to be
[1244.2s] saved. There's, you know, he's a God of
[1246.0s] second chances. What do you think are
[1247.8s] some of the traits that we should we
[1250.3s] should have as Christians so that when
[1252.9s] he comes, we may be able to go with him.
[1257.1s] Um because like God is merciful. Um he
[1261.7s] never saw only the bad side of people
[1264.3s] but also the good
[1266.0s] side. And one of the traits we need um
[1270.5s] uh is forgiving
[1273.8s] people. Forgiving people. The spirit of
[1276.5s] forgiveness. Yeah. You know the
[1278.6s] scripture actually says that if you have
[1280.8s] a fight with somebody, don't let the sun
[1283.0s] go down before settling it out. It's
[1284.8s] actually a sin when you have a grudge on
[1286.9s] somebody. And forgiveness leads to
[1289.5s] righteousness. It leads to the
[1291.0s] understanding that Christ also forgave
[1294.2s] us. And we have to also uh show that in
[1296.5s] return Christ loved us to forgive us. So
[1299.0s] we have to show love and also it's by
[1302.2s] grace that he forgives us. We also have
[1303.9s] to be graceful to other people. And it
[1306.0s] says we should forgive how many times?
[1308.9s] Seven. Seven times. Yes. So uh let's go
[1312.8s] to the out of the story section uh by
[1315.5s] Wendy. Wendy. Wendy you can take us
[1317.4s] through that. So uh sorry you will you
[1321.9s] will sort of paraphrase the questions
[1323.7s] because of time then we can give you our
[1326.1s] answers our thoughts about it. Okay. So
[1328.5s] the first question is did Simon Peter
[1331.1s] and the other fishermen already know
[1333.0s] Jesus before this event? How might that
[1335.8s] have made a difference in their response
[1338.1s] to Jesus Christ? Who can answer that
[1341.3s] question for me?
[1344.1s] I think I could go first and then maybe
[1346.3s] Abigail will follow. Uh we we we've
[1349.4s] talked about this question and I
[1350.8s] remember Tiffany was saying that yes
[1353.0s] they actually knew Jesus before because
[1355.3s] of what Jesus had done not necessarily
[1359.0s] to them but to other people and you
[1362.5s] know people heard the story about it.
[1365.0s] People knew about Jesus and
[1367.3s] so they knew Jesus as this as as a very
[1371.1s] nice person. They knew Jesus as, you
[1374.2s] know, not necessarily
[1377.1s] uh their everything because he hadn't
[1379.8s] take taken them as disciples yet. This
[1381.9s] is before they became disciples, but
[1383.8s] they knew him as the Messiah. And so
[1386.8s] uh knowing this and understanding, you
[1390.5s] know, when you know somebody and what
[1392.1s] they do, there's a set of standards that
[1394.2s] you set for them. Like today I may know
[1397.0s] uh somebody maybe called Michael but
[1399.5s] when tomorrow I'm told that Michael is
[1401.3s] the president there's a sort of standard
[1403.2s] that I'll put I won't expect to talk to
[1405.4s] Michael as I used to talk to Michael
[1407.4s] from before. I won't expect Michael to
[1409.8s] be available as he used to be. I won't
[1412.1s] expect Michael to do the things that he
[1414.7s] used to do. And and and above it I won't
[1417.8s] expect him
[1419.2s] to just come to random people and say
[1422.7s] I'm giving you a sponsorship. I'm giving
[1424.2s] you a scholarship. I'm giving you
[1426.2s] money. And there's many people that he
[1430.1s] can actually do that to if he decides
[1431.8s] to, but I would expect it to
[1434.3s] specifically narrow down to me. So,
[1436.6s] having known that he's the
[1438.3s] Messiah, it it made a response. It made
[1442.5s] two I would say it it had two impacts on
[1445.8s] their response. First of all is that
[1448.8s] they were flabbergasted that Jesus
[1450.8s] actually came to them. And second of
[1452.6s] second is that now they do Jesus is the
[1454.9s] Messiah. That's why they were able to
[1457.0s] say yes because they have the assurance
[1459.4s] that it's not a false prophet. It's not
[1461.4s] a random madman. It's not a random
[1463.4s] person. It's the Messiah who came to
[1465.3s] them. Uh Abigail, what do you think? Um
[1468.6s] I feel like it made a difference in
[1471.2s] their response to Jesus because they
[1474.0s] knew what Jesus was capable of doing. So
[1476.2s] they followed him. Yes.
[1479.7s] Okay. Yes. They knew what Jesus was
[1481.5s] capable of doing. Anybody else? Before
[1483.2s] we move to the next question.
[1487.1s] Okay. Let's move to the next question.
[1490.5s] Um the next question is why do you think
[1493.4s] Jesus performed the miracle of the great
[1495.9s] catch of fish before he asked the
[1499.0s] fisherman to follow him? Abigail please
[1502.3s] can you answer the question?
[1505.8s] Um, I feel like Jesus performed the
[1509.2s] miracle because he wanted them to see
[1511.8s] what he can do and accept to follow him.
[1516.2s] Yeah, I agree. Everything is
[1518.8s] possible. The next question, what impact
[1522.0s] did the miracle have on Simon Peter and
[1525.4s] the other fishermen?
[1527.5s] Um I think it was a positive impact
[1530.4s] because it was a show or a sign uh that
[1534.1s] they can equally and actually be fishes
[1536.9s] of men because just as um Elana has said
[1542.2s] um God used the miracle of the fish
[1546.2s] because Jesus teaches people with what
[1550.1s] they actually know. like if you know
[1553.8s] about bread, he'll use bread to teach
[1556.7s] you more uh something uh impactful. Um
[1561.4s] and basically he uses Jesus uses what is
[1565.3s] relatable to you. If you look throughout
[1567.8s] the Bible, the parables and what God has
[1570.3s] been doing, he uses things which are
[1572.6s] relatable to the common people around.
[1575.2s] Yeah, I agree.
[1577.2s] Why was Simon Peter's response to the
[1579.6s] miracle? Go away from me Lord. I am a
[1582.5s] sinful man. What was he thinking? What
[1585.9s] would you have been thinking at that
[1588.8s] point?
[1591.6s] Um personally what I'd have been
[1593.9s] thinking is uh cuz Jesus like um uh back
[1599.6s] in the times he was like um very high
[1603.4s] and that he like I'd be feeling unworthy
[1607.3s] and a bit scared that he's in my
[1610.0s] presence.
[1611.8s] Yeah. Because he was you know
[1615.0s] Yeah. Also, you know,
[1618.2s] uh Simon Peter was feeling unworthy. You
[1621.4s] know, we talked about the standards, the
[1623.0s] minimal standards and uh the standards
[1625.3s] that we set for our ourselves. There's
[1628.0s] this standard that people set that I am
[1630.1s] the most sinful person. You know, you
[1632.1s] always think your problems are big until
[1633.8s] you hear somebody else's problems. Simon
[1637.0s] thought that he was a sinful man. And
[1639.9s] that was what he was thinking. The only
[1641.6s] thing that was going around his head was
[1643.5s] now Christ has come to me. I am a sinful
[1646.3s] man. What do I do? Do I confess? Do I
[1650.0s] just run
[1651.2s] away? And he was thinking, am I worthy?
[1654.8s] You know, there's that question that you
[1656.1s] ask yourself. Uh somebody has invited
[1659.1s] you somewhere and you're like, am I
[1660.6s] worthy to attend that meeting? Am I in
[1662.9s] that uh social class or rather am I in
[1666.5s] their personal space? And it's it's a
[1670.6s] it's a psychological experience that
[1672.7s] everybody feels like they do not reach
[1676.1s] the particular limit that is needed. And
[1678.1s] that's what Simon Peter was going
[1680.4s] through. At that point, what I would
[1682.8s] have been thinking is that you know
[1685.7s] there's the way you study trends of past
[1688.6s] activities to tell uh future happenings.
[1693.0s] I would be like since he has helped
[1695.8s] people from before this is when you need
[1697.9s] to take the chance and give out your
[1699.4s] life to him because I mean there's no
[1702.3s] other thing that you can do other than
[1704.6s] it because the second coming will come
[1707.4s] and in the same spirit of understanding
[1709.9s] previous trends to know forthcoming
[1712.4s] events is when God promises something it
[1716.4s] has to happen and always say that he
[1719.5s] promised people that a son would be born
[1722.5s] and it happened. The son would die,
[1724.6s] would be crucified, and would resurrect.
[1726.6s] It happened. And now we have the promise
[1729.0s] that he's coming again a second time.
[1730.9s] There's no doubt that that will not
[1732.6s] happen. And so there's no way around it
[1735.7s] other than being spiritually reborn,
[1739.0s] confessing, being forgiven. And again,
[1742.0s] there is the whole uh aspect of revival
[1745.9s] that I would really take that in hand,
[1748.2s] and I would not let that chance slide.
[1750.8s] Yeah, that's what I would be thinking
[1752.6s] and I'll definitely take the offer.
[1757.5s] Um, why do you think the fisherman
[1760.1s] followed Jesus with without any
[1762.8s] questions? What do you think they
[1765.2s] expected from Jesus at that point?
[1769.6s] Um, I think uh they followed Jesus
[1773.4s] without questions because the miracle
[1775.9s] was just too marvelous for them because
[1777.9s] they they literally worked so hard the
[1781.3s] past nights and yeah then I think the
[1785.2s] miracle increased their faith in Christ
[1787.7s] because as I said the miracle was just
[1790.7s] relatable to the men and Jesus proved to
[1793.4s] them that they could actually be fishers
[1795.8s] of men. Yeah. Amen. Amen.
[1799.2s] Actually in relation to what she said is
[1801.8s] this is like a promotion. You know you
[1803.9s] are a fisherman and then somebody tells
[1805.8s] you come become fishes of men. You are
[1809.9s] uh how do I relate this? It's a
[1812.8s] promotion. It's like a work promotion.
[1815.1s] The boss comes and tells you that you
[1818.0s] you have been the receptionist uh
[1821.0s] welcoming people to the boss's office.
[1823.5s] Now become the boss and people will be
[1825.4s] coming to you. Now you'll become the one
[1827.9s] receiving the people not the one sending
[1829.9s] the people. It's like a promotion. Now
[1832.8s] they will they have the skill Jesus saw
[1835.4s] the skill that they had which is fishing
[1837.8s] which is attracting things towards them
[1840.7s] not necessarily people but they had the
[1843.0s] skill to know where to catch, who to
[1845.3s] catch and when to catch.
[1847.5s] and becoming fishers of men in relation
[1850.7s] to be to being a fisherman meant that
[1854.0s] they were able because of the skill that
[1856.7s] they were given. And this is where we
[1858.0s] need to use all our talents and uh
[1860.1s] god-given
[1861.3s] gifts. You need to use what you have to
[1863.9s] bring people to Christ. If it is
[1865.9s] singing, the the disciples were were
[1868.5s] able to fish. You are able to sing, you
[1871.0s] are able to preach, you are able to do
[1872.6s] recordings. That is what you should do
[1874.2s] to bring people to Christ. Because
[1876.3s] people not only read the Bible, but they
[1878.6s] also see what their counterparts are
[1880.4s] doing in relation to what the scripture
[1883.0s] is saying. Because when you invite
[1884.8s] somebody to come to church, you tell
[1887.4s] them go to church, this is the pin
[1889.7s] location. But then you don't come to
[1891.8s] church with them. All you're doing is
[1893.2s] just sending them to church. They'll be
[1894.8s] like why are you sending me to church
[1896.6s] and you're not coming? You know in
[1898.7s] ancient times uh in the book of Nehemiah
[1901.8s] 1 verse uh chapter
[1904.6s] 1 the
[1908.0s] cupbearer was supposed to uh I'm trying
[1911.9s] to relate this to what we are reading
[1913.7s] today is that the cup bearer was
[1915.9s] supposed to taste the king's food so
[1918.6s] that the king does not die. You know you
[1921.0s] go to some your friend's house then
[1922.3s] you're like what is in this uh uh drink?
[1925.4s] Have you put poison? Then you're like,
[1926.9s] "Drink it first, then I drink it." That
[1928.8s] is the same thing that non-Christians
[1931.8s] rather than Adventists or rather
[1933.4s] unbelievers want to see from you. They
[1935.6s] want to see how has your Christianhood
[1938.2s] changed you and why do you want to
[1940.0s] change me to become like you? You cannot
[1942.1s] be calling me to church and you take
[1943.6s] drugs. Are you bringing me to church to
[1945.1s] take drugs with you? No. But you are in
[1948.1s] church and I'm saying you're successful
[1949.9s] in school. You're getting all A's and
[1951.7s] B's. I want to be like you. They're
[1954.3s] looking up upon you. That is because of
[1957.0s] what you have and that's what the
[1958.2s] fishermen had the skill and that's why
[1960.6s] Christ chose them because of what he saw
[1962.3s] in them and it's a gift that it is only
[1964.9s] him who gives to people and it is only
[1967.5s] him who sees it and it is only him who
[1970.2s] teaches people how to use it. So um we
[1974.2s] are done with the with the out of the
[1975.8s] story section. Uh I I would like us to
[1978.4s] have a further insight from the desire
[1980.1s] of ages. Uh we this lesson we usually
[1984.2s] allude all our lessons uh the
[1986.2s] cornerstone lessons to the desire of
[1987.9s] ages and for this lesson we are doing
[1991.9s] the desire of ages or rather you can
[1994.6s] read it from the humble hero that is
[1996.8s] chapter
[1998.4s] 25 and the desire of ages is more of out
[2003.5s] of scripture context that uh brings us
[2008.3s] uh to the understanding of what it is
[2010.7s] like Now the desire of ages in page 250
[2013.8s] will tell you that he who loves Christ
[2016.9s] the most will do the greatest amount of
[2019.5s] good. That is in relation to scripture.
[2022.2s] Scripture actually says that but it does
[2024.0s] not put it in this direct way. But we
[2026.6s] all know that the more you love Christ,
[2030.2s] the more you understand the fruits of
[2031.7s] the Holy Spirit, the more you have the
[2033.8s] fruits of the Holy Spirit and the more
[2035.7s] you are able to know what is good and
[2037.5s] what is bad, how to love your enemies.
[2040.2s] And the moment you start loving your
[2042.0s] wrongdoers, the moment you start uh
[2044.6s] knowing what to cherish and what is bad,
[2047.4s] that is when you start doing good. You
[2049.7s] start coming to church to do recordings
[2051.8s] because you love Christ. You don't just
[2054.1s] come to do recordings because the uh the
[2056.0s] lesson topic is there and you're in
[2058.0s] you're a class member or a church
[2059.5s] member. You come to do it because of
[2061.1s] your love to Christ. You come to church,
[2063.4s] you do good, you volunteer for church
[2065.4s] activities, you bring people to Christ,
[2067.6s] you spread the word. you know the three
[2069.3s] angels messages to all corners of the
[2071.4s] world. You're doing good because you
[2073.3s] love Christ and you understand who he
[2075.4s] is. So Tiffany will take us through uh
[2079.4s] this the father insight part of it that
[2081.7s] I am telling you about and then she
[2084.2s] would relate it to our lesson the desire
[2086.6s] of ages chapter 25. She won't really
[2089.0s] read the whole of it because of time but
[2091.8s] just read that. And then there's the LNG
[2094.3s] white steps to Christ page 16 the
[2096.1s] further insight and then there is the
[2098.8s] desire of ves page 250 also LG white a
[2101.6s] continuation of what I've read and the
[2103.8s] father insight. So take us through that
[2105.4s] section.
[2107.0s] So um the father uh the father insight
[2110.6s] uh desire of ages page 250 and it says
[2115.0s] he who love he who loves Christ the most
[2118.0s] will do greatest amount of good
[2121.0s] obedience the service of allegiance of
[2123.6s] love is the true sign of disciplehip.
[2126.5s] There is no limit to the usefulness of
[2129.2s] one who by putting self aside makes room
[2132.3s] for the work of the Holy Spirit upon his
[2135.0s] heart and lives the life wholly
[2137.3s] consecrated to God.
[2139.8s] So I can try to relate this um you see
[2144.2s] God um in okay let me
[2148.8s] God or rather Jesus in this case took uh
[2152.3s] the four disciples at first because he
[2155.8s] saw their ability and how they their
[2159.4s] determination in um what they do best.
[2163.4s] So he decided to take them and make them
[2166.2s] fishes of men. So um and also in the
[2169.7s] deserved ages it says God takes men as
[2173.9s] they are and educates them for his
[2176.2s] service if they will yield themselves to
[2178.4s] him. This means like if you are willing
[2183.0s] to do God's work, God is also willing to
[2186.2s] educate you and to make you a better
[2188.0s] person. Cuz you can ask yourself why
[2190.4s] didn't Jesus uh go ask the Pharisees cuz
[2193.4s] they were the bigger people at that
[2194.7s] time. Yeah.
[2197.5s] Thank you. So we want to connect that to
[2199.8s] life in our cornerstone connections.
[2202.6s] Every day we have a lesson to be studied
[2204.6s] and a scripture. We won't read the
[2207.0s] scripture because of time but we want to
[2209.8s] we want to understand how to connect
[2212.1s] this to life every day of the week. You
[2214.2s] know it is about setting time every day
[2216.0s] of the week to study. So our cornerstone
[2218.4s] connections lesson has a section of
[2221.4s] connecting to life where we get to read
[2223.8s] everyday scriptures and we get to read
[2226.2s] everyday key points. So take us to the
[2229.0s] what do you think section not the what
[2231.4s] do you think section the connecting to
[2233.6s] that section. We start with Sabbath.
[2236.1s] By his miracles, Jesus manifested God's
[2239.3s] power and was attested as God's promised
[2242.4s] Messiah, the son, 7th Day Adventist.
[2246.4s] Fundamental beliefs. Number four, as you
[2249.4s] read the story of Jesus calling Peter
[2251.8s] and the other fisherman by the sea.
[2254.2s] Imagine the scene vividly in your mind.
[2256.8s] Put yourself in Peter's place and try to
[2260.3s] imagine what you would be
[2262.3s] experiencing with your five senses as
[2264.9s] this scene unfolds.
[2267.8s] With your with our five senses, right?
[2269.8s] Yeah. That is the sense to see, hear,
[2273.8s] smell, touch. So I think we we we could
[2278.2s] take one each. I would start with see.
[2280.7s] Uh just looking at Jesus Christ in
[2283.3s] itself would leave me speechless. I
[2285.4s] would be like, "Huh, is this really
[2287.6s] Christ?" You know, when you see somebody
[2289.4s] that you've been wanting to see, I I'll
[2291.8s] be flabbergasted. What about you?
[2295.4s] When you hear from him? Um, when I hear
[2297.8s] from him, I'll be happy cuz he might be
[2300.8s] saying good words and talking to me
[2303.7s] about the kingdom of God. Okay. Um, and
[2308.0s] all the other senses. Of course, there's
[2309.8s] a way we react. There's the normal human
[2312.0s] reaction. So on Sunday we read from
[2315.4s] Romans
[2317.0s] 12:6-7. And the major question
[2320.4s] was what uh types of images might Jesus
[2324.7s] used today to bring people out uh to his
[2328.1s] kingdom? What images might he use if he
[2330.7s] was calling a teacher, a bus driver, a
[2333.2s] doctor, a teenager, a lawyer? You know,
[2335.6s] everybody has their own way of life.
[2337.4s] Everybody has the way they used to eat.
[2339.3s] the way he went to a fisherman, he went
[2341.8s] and helped them catch fish. If he went
[2343.8s] to a doctor, maybe he would heal a
[2345.7s] patient who's at the verge of dying. If
[2347.4s] he went to a teacher, maybe a teacher of
[2349.0s] the law, a teacher in school, a teacher
[2351.0s] of the Bible, a teacher of scripture, he
[2353.3s] would give them the spirit of the Holy
[2355.0s] Spirit to understand what they are
[2356.6s] reading. If it is a bus driver, if it is
[2358.7s] a lawyer, there's a way he approaches
[2361.0s] everyone and he knows how to approach
[2363.4s] everyone and make them spread the
[2365.2s] gospel.
[2366.5s] Then on Monday we read from Luke
[2370.4s] 5:8-11 and we we understood that Jesus
[2374.0s] helped Simon Peter and other fishermen
[2376.3s] to catch the miraculous amount of fish.
[2378.7s] And we've talked about that in the
[2380.4s] deeper part of the story of Luke
[2383.2s] 5:8-11. And then on Tuesday and
[2386.1s] Wednesday we were at the Gospel of
[2388.4s] Matthew. And that was from Matthew
[2393.1s] 119, Matthew 19:21 and Matthew
[2397.7s] 8:21-22. And those are examples of Jesus
[2400.2s] calling other disciples from their
[2402.1s] everyday life like Levi being a tax
[2404.7s] collector and all that. Then on
[2406.8s] Thursday, we moved to 2 Corinthians
[2409.7s] 12:9 and we think about things of life
[2413.4s] that may be standing on our in our way
[2416.6s] between us and Christ. How do we
[2418.4s] overcome our challenges that come in
[2420.2s] between? And then on Friday, we finish
[2422.8s] by reading the Gospel of Matthew
[2427.4s] 6:31-33. And we post the question to
[2429.5s] ourel that if Jesus were to come to you
[2431.5s] today and say
[2432.9s] leave anything behind, what would you
[2435.4s] leave? We looked at that from the what
[2436.6s] do you think section? Some of us would
[2438.7s] leave our friends, our phones, our
[2440.6s] families, our laptops. And that is in
[2444.1s] relation to life now. And even as the
[2446.0s] generations move on, the word will still
[2448.1s] be there and there will be upcoming
[2449.5s] events that people will have to
[2450.8s] surrender to follow Christ. So that has
[2454.2s] been our lesson for today and we thank
[2457.0s] you so much for uh uh taking part in our
[2460.7s] lesson today and learning how to become
[2462.5s] a follower, learning how to leave what
[2464.6s] you have behind so that you may be able
[2466.6s] to follow Jesus, to follow God and to
[2469.0s] follow the word.
[2470.9s] We pray that you may be able to to uh be
[2473.8s] able to dissect and to have the lesson
[2476.0s] and by God's grace and mercy we may be
[2479.0s] able to become disciples and we may be
[2481.1s] able to go with him for his second
[2482.8s] coming. Thank you so much to the amazing
[2484.9s] panel that has been with us today that
[2487.2s] has helped us to understand the lesson.
[2489.6s] We had the previous understanding of it
[2491.3s] and now we have the understanding of it
[2493.4s] in deeper context. So to you viewers
[2496.5s] back at home, thank you so much for
[2497.8s] following through with us. Thank you so
[2499.5s] much for being here with us and
[2500.6s] listening to us. So, we'll close by a
[2502.6s] word of prayer from Sean.
[2505.4s] Good. Okay, let's pray. Oh God, we thank
[2508.6s] you for the gifts of life. We thank you
[2510.1s] for protecting us throughout the day.
[2511.9s] Um, oh God, please help us put what you
[2515.6s] have learned today into our daily lives
[2519.2s] and help and help us become more like
[2524.6s] fishes of men. Help us bring our friends
[2527.0s] closer to God and in Jesus name we pray.
[2530.9s] Amen.
