FULL TRANSCRIPT:
welcome again to our session which will be reviewing the book through Revival as always we have our team here with me on my right we have brother opata and on my left we have brother Steven muger and I'll be a moderator for today my name is Niko opio and uh as we go through the book true Revival as you may have noticed if you've been following the series we are right now in chapter 5 in chapter 1 we understood what that God is actually calling us to to be revived which is the greatest and most urgent need of the church secondly we talked about conversion fake or real then thirdly we talked about how to be a born again Christian and in chapter 4 we spoke about the rules that God has to and in this chapter for today we'll be talking about the balance in faith and works so before we begin discussing this I'd like to invite my brother Steve to say a short word of prayer for us as we begin okay welcome let us pray father once again we come before your presence to discuss your word Holy Spirit come down Minister unto us as you redu us as God increases may all we say that comes from our lips bring glory and honor to your name it is in Jesus name we pray amen amen amen so we'll be talking about the balance in faith and works the first thing I'd like us to do even as we start this off is to read a verse from the book of Hebrews 11: 6 Hebrews 11: 6 the Bible says that but without faith it is impossible to please him this is in reference to God for he that comes to God must believe that he is and that he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek him there are many in the Christian world who claim that all that is necessary to Salvation is to have faith works are nothing faith is the only essential thing but God's word tells us that faith without works is dead according to James chapter 2 so it means that if we expect to be saved without works then we are grossly mistaken because Works need to accompany Faith I'd like to say that God does not bless us in Disobedience for example if I go and kill my friend today then I say God will still save me because I claim to be saved then say it's okay just have faith only have faith and everything is okay the answer should come strictly from the Bible where it says faith without works is dead so you have nothing to do with what the world will think of you this is from this book we're reading true Revival let your words your spirit your actions be a living testimony to Jesus and the Lord will take care that the testimony for his glory fished in a well ordered life and a Godly conversation shall deepen and intensifying power which actually means that we should live our lives in such a way that when we have faith in God our works are showing that God is in our hearts and sometimes the actions we take may be misconstrued for example when Jesus went to the temple and he saw people desecrating it and he actually had to drive out the people who are doing the wrong things in the temple for somebody who came in there for the first time they might have said what is this violent man doing here but God was acting in accord with God's will because Christ went I mean Jesus was acting in accordance with God's will because Christ say said I came to do my father's will so that's why it says that we have nothing to do with what the word will think of us as long as we are obeying God now this just doesn't mean that we can just go and do anything and claim God to be the one guiding Us in it because the Bible also says that we shall not take the name of the Lord in vain so we need to be careful ful and certain that it is God who is leading us so what truly is the part that I have and what is it that I'm supposed to do when I'm to have a balance between faith and works here's what we told in the book true Revival page 43 the true worker will have divine power to Aid him but the idler will not be sustained by the spirit of God the bible teach say that everything regarding our Salvation depends upon our own course of action if we perish the responsibility will rest wholly upon ourselves now I think about this deeply and it actually comes clear to me that we have something to do in our Salvation just having faith in itself is even a work that we need to exercise because sometimes you might choose not to exercise Faith it's self so this is something that we need to do to ensure that we are not thinking that there's no responsibility that we have so the fact that we are saved will mean that we have accepted the merits of Christ Saving Grace and I'd like to pass this now to my fellow panelists is there something such as a do nothing faith is it possible for us to just say the moment I claim to be born again after being put in that baptismal pool I am saved because I've had some people say I've already done all that it's is needed what next is there something such as a do nothing fa maybe I'll start with you brother Steve then I'll go to my brother P um thank you very much uh brother niik again you bring out very pertinent questions um I'm inan faith what what and and brother niiko you have truly defined what faith is we've spoken in the previous weeks we spoke about um faith without works we spoke about what we are required as Christians in terms of Faith how faithful are we to be and you know if we are faithful and and if if we are truly faithful and we ask God um to Pardon us of our sins indeed he will and of of course that is a p realization that we are sinful and also what sin is because we sometimes we repent but we really don't know what sin is we don't know how much we've sinned and I remember also brother mentioned that the spirit also helps us to identify the depth of our sins and after that I do nothing faith I I there's there's nothing like a do nothing Fai I think that's the best I could I could uh bring it out because if you Faithful we have you know we cannot ever overemphasize or the Bible actually not we cannot overemphasize enough um the principle of faith without works because you cannot claim to have faith and you just sit back you know and you you you don't express uh um your your your faithfulness or you don't express your salvation through works because once you know we remember we say that once you've repented once you've been revived once you've been reformed and what comes next is what growing in Christ how do you grow in Christ through study um through prayer through Mission both in reach and Outreach because you cannot just hold on to this faith we are called to be disciples and as a disciple remember we cannot be lazy M because also brings our part what is our part we cannot be slothful yes and on our Strife to Perfection of course or or our strive to to to Merit heaven we have to wrestle it is a wrestle we have to labor we have to strive and we have to agonize in our faith because we otherwise we will not see the Straight Gate okay I think that is what I wanted to summarize or bring out in terms of of uh you know of um I do nothing Faith so I'll take it back to you n thank you thank you brother Steve how about you brother is there something such as I do nothing Fai or how do we balance the two such that there's an even balance between faith and works cuz we also don't want to go to the extremes where we say have faith alone but also you might go to the Other Extreme and say it is my works that will save me how do we bring this together so that there's a balance between first of all as a Christian you need to have a life of moderation you cannot be on other extremes you cannot be uh you cannot display your Works to the extreme and you cannot display your faith to the extreme M actually you realize that uh your actions really display your faith M let me give you a good example you are seeing your friends driving and you desire to drive all so mhm and uh you have not even taken that step even to go to a driving school you don't even have a driving license but you really praying for for for for for a car one day to to have your own car I'm thinking that uh faith will come out when you pray then you trust and believe that God has answered your prayer then the next step you enroll to a driving school you get your driving license then you wait for that car you don't receive the car now and you look for the license then you start looking for the license so here we seeing that there's nothing like a do nothing Faith because now you'll become slothful the way you have described in the in the previous chapter here we are seeing that your actions really display your level of faith and remember live a life of moderation yeah thank you amen amen we're told in the book that faith and The Works Will Keep Us evenly balanced and make us successful in the work of perfecting Christian character so God tells us that he gives us Jesus who is the bread of life but if we want to obtain the bread of life then there must be some efforts on our part just as we told in the Bible in the beginning one of the Tes given upon men was that we had to walk for out of the ground and the sweat of our face we shall eat bread which means that even this salvation that we want to obtain there has to be some work on our part and in the book these are actually described as two ores and I'd like to read a statement on that says that if we are faithful in doing our part in cooperating with him God will work through through us to do the good pleasure of his will but God cannot work through us if we make no effort if we gain eternal life we must work and work honestly Faith and works are two ORS which must equally which we must use equally if we would press our way up the stream against the current of unbelief and I'm I'm I'm just thinking about this practically cuz one time I went with my wife canoeing and we were canoing on the boat and we had two hours and if I ended up rowing on one side very strongly with one ore and it was stronger than her then the boat would start turning in circles or going towards my direction and if she did the same then it would also start turning towards a Direction so we actually had to agree that these ores need to be done in sync and if for example I'm either stronger or moving faster than her then I need to slow down else we would probably spin or never get to anywhere where we going so if we have faith also in the same Essence we might be only saying we have faith but our boat will only be going in One Direction and we'll be out of balance and also if we have works we might go to the Other Extreme so as my brother op said we need to be moderate I noticed something interesting in the Bible there are certain areas where God wants us to be extreme and when you look at the Book of Revelation 3 verse 15 to8 we're told that we should be hot or cold not larm not larm yeah so those are the two extremes right we need to be hot or cold yeah so he'd rather that we were there rather than look home in the middle so that's the place where we actually look at it and say this is not one of those instances where we are saying that you need to only have you either have faith or you have works it's not the same as being hot cold here it's saying we need to have these two things to actually be balanced in the same and I love it in Prophecy when we actually look at it in Revelation 14 verse 12 where it says in verse 12 here is the patience of their Saints here are they that keep the Commandments of God the testimony of Jesus of Jesus yeah the testimony of Jesus the faith of Jesus notice that this faith that is spoken of is Faith on that side and the Commandments of God are actually the works so you actually have faith and works together combined so it's important for us to have this balance so as we close this I'd like to read one final statement effort and labor are required on the part of the receiver of God's grace for it is the fruit that makes manifest what is the character of the tree mhm what kind of fruit are you bearing bearing yes and if I make it even deeper what kind of tree are you a baren fruit or a a baren tree or a tree that is bearing fruit so let's consider that even as we think about the balance in faith and works amen so I'd like to close that chapter there and invite you all to join us for the next chapter which will be titled saved only in Christ saved only in Christ so as we close uh brother please give us a closing word of prayer thank you uh let's pray Our Father what in heaven we thank you for giving us these messages timely messages father you have seen father that faith without works is dead father we pray father that you may revive our lives so that we may through our actions father our faith be displayed and father you have also caution us father to to take a stand whether we want to be cold or whether we want to be hot not to be low because father in the Bible you have said uh it's hard to to please you father if we are not uh having this faith and father you also told us father that uh a faith just as little as that of a master seed is great enough father to work wondrous and huge Miracles father in our lives we pray father that this faith that our forefathers had may carry us through this life as we wait and prepare for your soon return in Jesus name we pray and believe amen amen

TIMESTAMPED TRANSCRIPT:
[1.5s] welcome again to our session which will
[4.3s] be reviewing the book through Revival as
[7.3s] always we have our team here with me on
[10.2s] my right we have brother opata and on my
[12.8s] left we have brother Steven muger and
[14.8s] I'll be a moderator for today my name is
[16.8s] Niko opio and uh as we go through the
[20.0s] book true Revival as you may have
[22.0s] noticed if you've been following the
[23.5s] series we are right now in chapter 5 in
[26.5s] chapter 1 we understood what that God is
[29.0s] actually calling us to to be revived
[30.9s] which is the greatest and most urgent
[32.8s] need of the church secondly we talked
[35.0s] about conversion fake or real then
[37.7s] thirdly we talked about how to be a born
[40.4s] again Christian and in chapter 4 we
[43.6s] spoke about the rules that God has to
[46.8s] and in this chapter for today we'll be
[48.8s] talking about the balance in faith and
[52.2s] works so before we begin discussing this
[55.0s] I'd like to invite my brother Steve to
[57.8s] say a short word of prayer for us as we
[59.6s] begin
[61.7s] okay welcome let us
[63.8s] pray father once again we come before
[66.6s] your
[67.4s] presence to discuss your word Holy
[71.1s] Spirit come down Minister unto us as you
[74.2s] redu us as God
[76.5s] increases may all we say that comes from
[79.8s] our lips bring glory and honor to your
[82.6s] name it is in Jesus name we pray amen
[85.6s] amen
[87.5s] amen so we'll be talking about the
[90.5s] balance in faith and works the first
[94.4s] thing I'd like us to do even as we start
[97.2s] this off is to read a verse from the
[99.2s] book of Hebrews 11: 6 Hebrews 11:
[106.2s] 6 the Bible says that but without faith
[111.2s] it is impossible to please him this is
[113.9s] in reference to God for he that comes to
[116.9s] God must believe that he is and that he
[120.0s] is a rewarder of them that diligently
[123.2s] seek
[124.6s] him there are many in the Christian
[127.2s] world who claim that all that is
[130.0s] necessary to Salvation is to have faith
[134.3s] works are nothing faith is the only
[137.6s] essential thing but God's word tells us
[140.8s] that faith without works is dead
[144.1s] according to James chapter 2 so it means
[147.0s] that if we expect to be saved without
[150.9s] works then we are grossly mistaken
[154.1s] because Works need to accompany Faith
[157.2s] I'd like to say that God does not bless
[159.7s] us in Disobedience for example if I go
[163.1s] and kill my friend today then I say God
[166.6s] will still save me because I claim to be
[169.1s] saved then say it's okay just have faith
[172.7s] only have faith and everything is okay
[176.0s] the answer should come strictly from the
[177.9s] Bible where it says faith without works
[181.2s] is dead so you have nothing to do with
[186.3s] what the world will think of you this is
[188.7s] from this book we're reading true
[190.3s] Revival let your words your spirit your
[194.0s] actions be a living testimony to Jesus
[197.0s] and the Lord will take care that the
[199.7s] testimony for his glory fished in a well
[202.5s] ordered life and a Godly conversation
[205.8s] shall deepen and intensifying power
[209.3s] which actually means that we should live
[211.2s] our lives in such a way that when we
[213.3s] have faith in God our works are showing
[216.0s] that God is in our hearts and sometimes
[218.9s] the actions we take may be misconstrued
[221.7s] for example when Jesus went to the
[223.6s] temple and he saw people desecrating it
[226.0s] and he actually had to drive out the
[228.2s] people who are doing the wrong things in
[229.8s] the temple for somebody who came in
[232.5s] there for the first time they might have
[234.6s] said what is this violent man doing here
[238.2s] but God was acting in accord with God's
[240.6s] will because Christ went I mean Jesus
[243.0s] was acting in accordance with God's will
[245.0s] because Christ say said I came to do my
[247.8s] father's will so that's why it says that
[250.5s] we have nothing to do with what the word
[253.0s] will think of us as long as we are
[255.3s] obeying God now this just doesn't mean
[258.2s] that we can just go and do anything and
[260.8s] claim God to be the one guiding Us in it
[264.0s] because the Bible also says that we
[265.5s] shall not take the name of the Lord in
[267.6s] vain so we need to be careful ful and
[270.3s] certain that it is God who is leading us
[274.1s] so what truly is the part that I
[276.9s] have and what is it that I'm supposed to
[280.2s] do when I'm to have a balance between
[283.5s] faith and works here's what we told in
[286.5s] the book true Revival page 43 the true
[289.8s] worker will have divine power to Aid him
[293.9s] but the idler will not be sustained by
[296.9s] the spirit of God the bible teach say
[300.0s] that everything regarding our Salvation
[303.1s] depends upon our own course of action if
[306.5s] we perish the responsibility will rest
[310.1s] wholly upon ourselves now I think about
[313.8s] this deeply and it actually comes clear
[316.8s] to me that we have something to do in
[320.9s] our Salvation just having faith in
[323.6s] itself is even a work that we need to
[326.0s] exercise because sometimes you might
[327.9s] choose not to exercise Faith it's self
[330.4s] so this is something that we need to do
[332.5s] to ensure that we are not thinking that
[336.4s] there's no responsibility that we have
[339.8s] so the fact that we are saved will mean
[342.7s] that we have accepted the merits of
[345.8s] Christ Saving Grace and I'd like to pass
[349.7s] this now to my fellow
[352.2s] panelists is there something such as a
[355.6s] do nothing faith is it possible for us
[358.6s] to just say the moment I claim to be
[361.0s] born again after being put in that
[362.8s] baptismal pool I am saved because I've
[366.0s] had some people say I've already done
[368.7s] all that it's is needed what next is
[371.9s] there something such as a do nothing fa
[374.4s] maybe I'll start with you brother Steve
[375.9s] then I'll go to my brother
[378.0s] P um thank you very much uh brother niik
[382.6s] again you bring out very pertinent
[385.8s] questions um I'm inan faith what what
[390.2s] and and brother niiko you have truly
[392.8s] defined what faith is we've spoken in
[395.0s] the previous weeks we spoke about um
[398.2s] faith without works we spoke about what
[401.7s] we are required as Christians in terms
[404.9s] of Faith how faithful are we to be and
[408.8s] you know if we are faithful and and if
[412.6s] if we are truly faithful and we ask God
[415.2s] um to Pardon us of our sins indeed he
[418.0s] will and of of course that is a p
[421.5s] realization that we are sinful and also
[424.3s] what sin is because we sometimes we
[427.0s] repent but we really don't know what sin
[428.6s] is we don't know how much we've sinned
[432.4s] and I remember also brother mentioned
[434.9s] that the spirit also helps us to
[436.8s] identify the depth of our sins and after
[441.0s] that I do nothing
[443.3s] faith I I there's there's nothing like a
[446.7s] do nothing Fai I think that's the best I
[449.0s] could I could uh bring it out because if
[451.8s] you Faithful we have you know we cannot
[454.5s] ever overemphasize or the Bible actually
[457.0s] not we cannot overemphasize enough um
[461.6s] the principle of faith without works
[465.7s] because you cannot claim to have faith
[469.0s] and you just sit back you know and you
[472.4s] you you don't express uh um your your
[476.8s] your faithfulness or you don't express
[478.8s] your salvation
[480.1s] through works because once you know we
[482.4s] remember we say that once you've
[484.4s] repented once you've been revived once
[487.1s] you've been reformed and what comes next
[489.4s] is what growing in Christ how do you
[491.7s] grow in Christ through study um through
[495.1s] prayer through Mission both in reach and
[498.5s] Outreach because you cannot just hold on
[500.5s] to this faith we are called to be
[503.7s] disciples and as a disciple remember we
[506.8s] cannot be lazy M because also brings our
[510.4s] part what is our part we cannot be
[511.8s] slothful yes and on our Strife to
[515.6s] Perfection of course or or our strive to
[518.5s] to to Merit heaven we have to wrestle it
[522.7s] is a wrestle we have to labor we have to
[525.8s] strive and we have to agonize in our
[528.2s] faith because we otherwise we will not
[529.8s] see the Straight Gate okay I think that
[533.1s] is what I wanted to summarize or bring
[536.4s] out in terms of of uh you know of um I
[540.6s] do nothing Faith so I'll take it back to
[543.0s] you n thank you thank you brother Steve
[545.8s] how about you
[547.1s] brother is there something such as I do
[550.9s] nothing Fai or how do we balance the two
[555.0s] such that there's an even balance
[557.4s] between faith and works cuz we also
[559.6s] don't want to go to the extremes where
[561.1s] we say have faith alone but also you
[564.0s] might go to the Other Extreme and say it
[565.9s] is my works that will save me how do we
[568.6s] bring this together so that there's a
[570.2s] balance between first of all as a
[572.6s] Christian you need to have a life of
[574.9s] moderation you cannot be on other
[578.0s] extremes you cannot be uh you cannot
[581.8s] display your Works to the extreme and
[584.2s] you cannot display your faith to the
[585.9s] extreme M actually you realize that uh
[589.2s] your actions really display your faith M
[593.4s] let me give you a good example you are
[596.0s] seeing your friends driving and you
[598.4s] desire to drive all so mhm and
[602.1s] uh you have not even taken that step
[604.7s] even to go to a driving school you don't
[607.2s] even have a driving license but you
[608.9s] really praying for for for for for a car
[613.5s] one day to to have your own car I'm
[616.2s] thinking that uh faith will come out
[619.1s] when you
[620.5s] pray then you
[622.5s] trust and believe that God has answered
[624.9s] your prayer then the next step you
[627.3s] enroll to a driving school
[630.0s] you get your driving license then you
[633.6s] wait for that car you don't receive the
[636.0s] car now and you look for the license
[638.4s] then you start looking for the license
[640.3s] so here we seeing that there's nothing
[642.2s] like a do nothing Faith because now
[644.3s] you'll become slothful the way you have
[646.4s] described in the in the previous chapter
[648.8s] here we are seeing that your actions
[652.0s] really display your level of faith and
[655.0s] remember live a life of
[657.2s] moderation yeah thank you amen
[660.2s] amen we're told in the book that faith
[663.3s] and The Works Will Keep Us evenly
[666.3s] balanced and make us successful in the
[669.6s] work of perfecting Christian
[672.7s] character so God tells us that he gives
[676.9s] us Jesus who is the bread of life but if
[680.1s] we want to obtain the bread of life then
[683.6s] there must be some efforts on our part
[685.8s] just as we told in the Bible in the
[688.3s] beginning one of the Tes given upon men
[691.0s] was that we had to walk for out of the
[694.7s] ground and the sweat of our face we
[697.4s] shall eat bread which means that even
[700.3s] this salvation that we want to obtain
[702.7s] there has to be some work on our part
[706.2s] and in the book these are actually
[708.2s] described as two ores and I'd like to
[711.4s] read a statement on that says that if we
[714.0s] are faithful in doing our part in
[716.4s] cooperating with him God will work
[719.0s] through through us to do the good
[721.2s] pleasure of his will but God cannot work
[724.6s] through us if we make no effort if we
[727.9s] gain eternal life we must work and work
[731.8s] honestly Faith and works are two ORS
[735.8s] which must equally which we must use
[738.8s] equally if we would press our way up the
[741.3s] stream against the current of
[744.5s] unbelief and I'm I'm I'm just thinking
[747.7s] about this practically cuz one time I
[749.7s] went with my wife canoeing and we were
[752.6s] canoing on the boat and we had two hours
[755.6s] and if I ended up rowing on one side
[759.2s] very strongly with one ore and it was
[761.4s] stronger than her then the boat would
[763.4s] start turning in circles or going
[765.7s] towards my direction and if she did the
[768.0s] same then it would also start turning
[769.9s] towards a Direction so we actually had
[772.1s] to agree that these ores need to be done
[774.9s] in sync and if for example I'm either
[777.8s] stronger or moving faster than her then
[780.0s] I need to slow down else we would
[783.2s] probably spin or never get to anywhere
[785.6s] where we going so if we have faith also
[788.6s] in the same Essence we might be only
[790.8s] saying we have faith but our boat will
[793.1s] only be going in One Direction and we'll
[795.4s] be out of balance and also if we have
[797.6s] works we might go to the Other Extreme
[800.2s] so as my brother op said we need to be
[803.3s] moderate I noticed something interesting
[805.6s] in the Bible there are certain areas
[807.8s] where God wants us to be
[810.0s] extreme and when you look at the Book of
[812.4s] Revelation 3 verse 15 to8 we're told
[816.7s] that we should be hot or cold not larm
[820.3s] not larm yeah so those are the two
[822.3s] extremes right we need to be hot or cold
[826.2s] yeah so he'd rather that we were there
[829.2s] rather than look home in the middle so
[831.4s] that's the place where we actually look
[833.0s] at it and say this is not one of those
[836.3s] instances where we are saying that you
[838.2s] need to only have you either have faith
[840.8s] or you have works it's not the same as
[843.6s] being hot cold here it's saying we need
[845.9s] to have these two things to actually be
[848.8s] balanced in the same and I love it in
[851.2s] Prophecy when we actually look at it in
[853.5s] Revelation 14 verse 12 where it says in
[857.0s] verse 12 here is the patience of their
[859.7s] Saints here are they that keep the
[862.3s] Commandments of God the testimony of
[864.8s] Jesus of Jesus yeah the testimony of
[867.0s] Jesus the faith of Jesus notice that
[870.6s] this faith that is spoken of is Faith on
[874.2s] that side and the Commandments of God
[877.4s] are actually the works so you actually
[879.8s] have faith and works together combined
[883.3s] so it's important for us to have this
[886.0s] balance so as we close this I'd like to
[890.3s] read one final statement effort and
[892.8s] labor are required on the part of the
[894.9s] receiver of God's grace for it is the
[897.1s] fruit that makes manifest what is the
[900.2s] character of the tree mhm what kind of
[903.7s] fruit are you bearing bearing yes and if
[906.8s] I make it even deeper what kind of tree
[910.3s] are you a baren fruit or a a baren tree
[915.5s] or a tree that is bearing
[917.8s] fruit so let's consider that even as we
[921.1s] think about the balance in faith and
[924.4s] works amen so I'd like to close that
[926.9s] chapter there and invite you all to join
[929.3s] us for the next chapter which will be
[931.8s] titled saved only in Christ saved only
[936.7s] in Christ so as we close uh brother
[940.0s] please give us a closing word of prayer
[943.0s] thank you uh let's pray Our Father what
[945.8s] in heaven we thank you for giving us
[949.2s] these messages timely messages father
[952.3s] you have seen father that faith without
[955.2s] works is dead father we pray father that
[958.2s] you may revive our lives so that we may
[961.2s] through our actions father our faith be
[963.2s] displayed and father you have also
[965.7s] caution us father to to take a
[969.2s] stand whether we want to be cold or
[971.7s] whether we want to be hot not to be low
[974.8s] because father in the Bible you have
[976.9s] said uh it's hard to to please you
[981.0s] father if we are not uh having this
[985.1s] faith and father you also told us father
[987.8s] that uh a faith just as little as that
[990.4s] of a master seed is great enough father
[993.2s] to work wondrous and huge Miracles
[996.8s] father in our lives we pray father that
[999.4s] this faith that our forefathers had may
[1002.4s] carry us through this life as we wait
[1004.9s] and prepare for your soon return in
[1006.8s] Jesus name we pray and believe amen amen
