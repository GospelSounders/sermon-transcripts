Uh, Pastor Mendawa and Pastor Ly uh 633 seeing the wondrous love of Jesus. Amen. We have been discussing around the theme light and strength to the soul. This is the work of the publishing ministry of the 7th Day Adventist Church and we have been emphasizing this important point. We find in the book ministry page 125 where Ellen White says the spirit of prophecy books contends the instruction that God has been giving. They contain the precious comforting light that God has graciously given his servant to be given to the world from their pages. This light is to shine into the hearts of men and women leading them to the savior. There is in them truth which to the receiver is a server of life unto life. They are the silent witnesses for God. In these words, we find the core and appeal to distribute the literature that we have as a church because they are important and they carry out the light necessary as Ellen White puts it in another place in the book Steps to Christ page 89 that the necessary truths for our salvation is made as clear as noonday. today and none will be mistaken unless one follows their own personal judgment. So my brothers and sisters, as we sit in this congregation, we must remember that we are a people on a mission. We are a people with a purpose and we are a people with a function. And this function must not end with a Sabbath worship in the pew, but it must go out with the light of God to every believer out in the space. Our scripture reading is Jeremiah chapter 6 and verse 16. I want to re-echo this from the New King James Version. The Bible says, "Thus says the Lord, thus says the Lord, stand in the ways and see and ask for the old parts where the good way is and walk in it." then you will find rest for your souls. I wish Jeremiah could only end there, but the Bible continues to say, "But they said, we will not walk in it." Jeremiah comes from a religious background. In fact, he comes from the tribe of Levy. Except at the time that he was ministering as a prophet, he was not among the presiding priests. But his other siblings and cousins were ministering in the sanctuary of the Lord. But the word of the Lord came to Jeremiah. And Jeremiah was told, "Jeremiah, it is time to arise and do my work." And Jeremiah as and like every one of us sometimes when the gospel call comes we feel like holding on to our comfort zones but Jeremiah begins to have an argument with the Lord and rationalize his call and then God turns to him and say Jeremiah remember before you were born before you coiled in your mother's womb before you came out of your mother's womb I sanctified you I ordained you as a prophet unto nation. Jeremiah, I am still the God who is the God of your beginning and I'm still the God of your ending. I am still the God who is calling you to arise even though you may not be presiding in the sanctuary. I am still calling you to a sanctified mission. And this sanctified mission is to appeal to my people that they may return to me because I am their God. I raise them. I called their father Abraham and now I have led them into a promised land lest they go back into captivity. I want you Jeremiah to go and appeal to them. And so verse six, chapter 6 comes in handy because there in Jeremiah is told to go out and make this public declaration where scripture has reminded us to say tell the children of Israel and go and stand in the ways. In this passage we find that to stand in the ways is in a moment to go and pause and reflect and mediate and reason and consider where the course of our spirituality is going. You see when you talk about a path you are talking about a direction a way in which one has to take. And if we were to ask ourselves as Christians and the 7th day Adventist, which course are we taking, what direction are we headed and which path have we treaded in the past of our lives? And especially for most of us that are baptized. I don't know whether it was just me but when I got baptized pastor Amayo I felt like the Holy Spirit was upon me and I felt like if and only had Christ come that day I could have been in the kingdom of glory but as time ticked on could it be that complicency crepts in and we begin to be so comfortable in the warm pews of the church that the the the zeal that we have the the zeal we have the drive we to proclaim the gospel almost begins to fade because we begin to think from the time I got baptized uh by the way it is how many how many years um got baptized in 1999 what 26 years from the time I got baptized I I I was thinking it was just like uh yesterday. It's already 26 years and and you see when you look at 26 years of baptism if it was in the corporate world I could have risen in the ranks uh of of professional hierarchies. Uh but you see the problem is the more you think and reason about the longevity of time you've spent in the church the more you feel so comfortable that you are so closer to holiness and you feel no need to renew your spirit every day. And so Jeremiah is told go and stand and tell the children of Israel to stand in the path and look for the old ways. Make a moral reflection about your spiritual life. My brothers and sisters in this church, I want us to remember. There is an important need for every one of us to pause a and ask ourselves, where am I going spiritually? As I reflect upon my personal lives, where am I headed? Am I going in the direction that God wants? or every time I'm wrestling against the power of the Holy Spirit. When the power and the current of the Holy Spirit is leading me in a particular direction, I feel like going my own way. And as in scripture remind us that there is a way that seems right to a man. Ah, however, its end is fatal. self to say that if we are to be called Christians, we must stick to the spiritual land that God has given to us. And no wonder why in the second part Jeremiah says, "Ask for the old parts." Now, now before you go to the odd parts which are the established rays of righteousness and obedience to God, there is an aspect that is appealing to asking. Could it be that sometimes it is important to pause a little and reflect and also seek guidance? And where do we find guidance? We find guidance from God's church, from the people, the men and women who have been entrusted with this work, the pastors and the elders and the leaders of the church. But we must also ask the God who has called us. And how can we find direction and the word of and direction from the word of go but but from the word of God that is the one that God has given us that we may ask of it because out of it God has given us a spiritual compass a spiritual direction that we when we expose ourselves to this word we can find what what what scripture says peace and rest for our souls. So my brothers and sisters, we must remember that our obedience to God is an important part of our righteous upbringing as well as our righteous expression of who we are. Our identity as Christians is seen in our obedience to Christ. Then no wonder why Christ says, "If you are my disciples, you will do that which I I command you and you will do my commandments only if you are my disciples." I don't know whether we've been discipled or we are struggling and grappling to be disciples. And maybe perhaps we don't even know what disciplehip entails. Then the Bible further continues to highlight that when we have found a particular direction and we have asked for the old ways of obedience and we have started leading in this there is an important aspect of walking in them. Now, walking in the light of God entails that each one of us, at least to the best of our ability, the truth that we have received from God's word, from the instructions given, from the spoken word, the written word, and the incarnate word, we begin to be faithful and live harmoniously with the revealed word of God. And the moment that we begin to live faithfully and accept the guidance from God's word, then we actively begin to engage in what walking in the parts of righteousness implies. By the way, most many of the times I have discovered and I have seen and observed that the the the voice of condemnation becomes stronger than the voice of commendation. What does this mean? It means they are many times that we feel so drained by our own inconsistencies that we don't realize where God is taking us from. Remember, Christianity is a journey. The way to perfection and to be in the image of God is a journey. It is a process. And the process is not once off and it is all perfect. There will be times you will make a step forward and make two steps backwards. But I want to write to remind you soldier of the cross rise up. Don't stay backwards. But every time be reminded by the word of God that for this reason Christ came to seek and to serve that which was lost. Christ did not come for the righteous, but he came to seek those that were in need of his grace. The unfortunate part is in the latter part of this passage where people bluntly denied and said we will not walk in the truth. Nor should we walk in the path of obedience. Nor should we walk and find the old ways. But this, my brothers and sisters, is a fourth feature to the preceding statement that you will find rest for your souls. Doesn't Christ remind us in the book of Matthew chapter 11 and verse 29? Chapter 11 29. Take my yoke upon you and learn from me for I am humble and gentle in heart and you will find rest for your soul. For my yoke is easy and my burden is light. Isn't this what God is reminding us that when we take up the yoke of Christ and when we take up the ways of Christ, he enables us by the power of his holy spirit to live as he desires. In fact, my brothers and sisters, let us remember this. The sinful experiences of life come at our own discretion and our own vition to do them. And we struggle to do things that are evil. But here is the contrast in living a holy life. As you struggle to let go of your sins, it is no longer you who lives a perfect life in you, but the Holy Spirit comes and begins to live out the life of Christ in you. There is aid that comes to your rescue as you desire and commit yourself. And I'm not saying it is a simple walk in the park. Takes a lot of commitment. It takes a lot of falling but yet rising up. And no wonder why scripture says a righteous man may fall how many times? How many times church? Seven times. But he does what? Again? He rises. It is not easy. But there is aid that comes. And the aid that comes is the power that prepares us to stand before the throne of God. Hallelujah. And my brothers and sisters, I am here to remind us that there is a blessing that God gives to those that follow his word. And I want to pick on seven important blessings that come from the book of Revelation. And here we will see how they are punctuated. In Revelation 1:3, there is a blessing for those who read the the the prophetic word as it is for the time of the end. In Revelation 14, it is a blessing in verse 13 for those that die in Christ. In Revelation 16 verse 15 is a blessing to those that watch and keep their garments. in Revelation 19:9 is a blessing to those who are called to the marriage supper of the lamb. In Revelation 20:6 is a blessing to those that are that are partakers in the first resurrection. In Revelation chapter, which is the sixth uh blessing, Revelation 22:7 is a blessing to those that keep the words of the prophets. And finally in Revelation chapter 22:14, there is a blessing to those who do uh the commandments of the will of God. Now I want you to do a parallel here. You will observe that the first blessing in Revelation is an appeal to reading, is an appeal to hearing. And it comes with a blessing to read the word of God, the written word of God. and also to listen to the spoken word of God because it is this word that Hebrews tells us that it is the it is powerful. It is still life and active. It changes and transforms people when it is heard or it is read. It still is the word of God and it accomplishes its mind. When we look at the last two, the sixth and the seventh, these are important because the sixth is an echo to the first. The blessing is on those who keep what have what they have read. In Revelation uh 22:7, this blessing comes because people have kept what is in the word. So let's refresh and do it now uh together in Revelation 1:3. It's hearing and doing what? Reading. In chapter 22, which is the sixth blessing, it is an appeal for us to practice what we have read and what we have done. What we have heard. And here is what happens between the reading, the hearing and the action is the process of transformation. You can only begin to do when what you have read and what you have heard is a part of you and it forms the fabric of your being. Listen to me my brothers and sisters. to be a Christian. There is a great deal more to this subject than we can take in a glance or that all might see the importance of carefully studying the scriptures. Many seem to have the idea that this world and heavenly mansions constitute the universe of God. Not so. The redeemed throng will range from world to world and much of their time will be employed in setting out the mysteries of redemption. Ah pastor my brother come come. No no no no. Come, come, come, come, come, come, come here. Come here. It's good to see you and God bless you. We heard about the tragedy that happened last night, but we praise God. What do we say for our pastor? And the saving grace of the Lord upon him. Amen. the protection from the harm that could have affected him and the family. Ah, may God bless you. Thank you. Thank you so much. You see, seeing him has even made me digress. Uh, that wasn't part of the sermon, but it was necessary. You see my brothers and sisters, it will be uncomfortable for us to begin learning about God if we have not uh to learn about God in the kingdom to come. If we have not learned to appreciate him now, especially for those of us who have been given the privilege to sit in his church to know and to learn of him, it is very different from the thief on the cross. Remember the thief on the cross had no time to look through the writings of the prophets. He could have known. He could have read Isaiah. He could have read Jeremiah. But he did not have the opportunity to reflect and carefully think who Jesus was. But we have the opportunity. We have the opportunity that God has given to us. And throughout eternal ages, Ellen White highlights that we will be learning about the mystery of redemption. And those that are learned men among us would tell us that uh mystery is something that is blurry. You cannot clearly see. Could it be also that even in eternity because it will be an endless study, we will not fully comprehend what it entails for God to speak his word, for God to make his word incarnate and for God to give us the written word. And this written word as it is spoken, it is still the written word that is able to transform us. Can we even understand? In upward Luke page 75, Ellen White says, "The importance of studying the word of God cannot be overestimated. Its promises are large and full of riches of richness. In no case should we fail of securing the heavenly treasure. Christ is our only security. We cannot trust to human reasoning. The world is full of men and women who cherish deceptive theories and it is dangerous to listen to them. And these are the people that scripture calls educated. F O L S. What does that read? At least it's not me who said it. It's you. and I will borrow it from you. Educated fools. And a fool says in his heart, there is no who? There's no God. And Ellen White says in this world, we will meet fools that have worn graduation gowns and caps. But we must realize that our only security and safety at whatever point of life is the word of God because it has the same effect and power as when God spoke it. So my brothers and sisters, I wish to remind what we affirm the 7th day Adventist church. We believe that the ministry and writings of Ellen White were a manifestation of the gift of prophecy. We believe that Ellen White was inspired by the Holy Spirit that her writings, the product of that inspiration, are applicable and authoritative, especially to the Seventh Day Adventist Church today. We believe that the purposes of the Ellen White writings include guidance in understanding the searching of scripture and the application of these teachings which with prophetic urgency to the spiritual and moral life. Lastly, we believe that the acceptance of the prophetic gift of Ellen White is important to the nature and unity of the 7th Day Adventist Church. Listen to me my brothers and sisters. We are an advantaged church. If of the truths necessary that has been given to us where brought before the fall of every and by the way it's one thing to have these writings on our devices and if I was to ask how many don't have the writings of Ellen White who are seventh day Adventists in this place none will raise their hand maybe a few but if I was to ask how many of us have the writings ings perhaps the church about 80% I can guarantee you would raise they have the problem is not having access to the problem is encountering the writings of Ellen White and I I want to suggest something that is very practical and start with a very clear and simple book like steps to Christ every day just read a paragraph a what a paragraph in the morning read maybe choose a topic that you feel out of the many topics that Ellen White has written in the book steps to Christ read just one paragraph and you will begin to enjoy because you know that thing is addictive eh very addictive you will begin to glean the sweetness of reading. And when you finish the first paragraph, it will lead you to the next paragraph because you would want to finish the entire chapter to see the end. But the entire chapter is actually preparing you for the next chapter. And the next chapter is preparing you for the next chapter. The next chapter will prepare you for the next book. The next book will prepare you now. And and as you expose yourself to this, your character begins to in fact what begins to change is your language. you you begin speaking. You you you know there was there was a time when we were uh pastor Maba you remember that time we used to speak uh the only authorized language in the church was the King James version language thou and thy simply because we read the King James version. And equally when we begin to expose ourselves to these gems found in the writings of Ellen White, we begin to realize that there is something about it that captures our attention and refocuses our attention to the attention of who Christ is. Now my brothers and sisters, we are to go to the old ways and stand in it and reflect as Adventists. But who are we reflecting these to? There is a world that is dying in sin. You and I may have an opportunity to be present in this place, but there is a sinner that is struggling with guilt in their lives. They have found no solution for their inconsistencies in life. And the only option they are thinking is to take up their lives. There is a sinner my brothers and sisters who might need the light in their home and it can only be given to them. And I remember this brother giving a testimony. He was a drunk chain smoker and you can tell it about him. He comes from uh um a a an Indian background and one day he was given a book by Ellen White, forgotten what the what what book it is and he went into his room and threw it under the bed. The power of the written word. This is a guy who is frustrated about life. This is a guy who doesn't even think there is hope about life today. And so when he went in one day because of his hopelessness, he went and kneelled besides the bed. And what does he see is this book that he was given. And he puts it he pulls it out and he begins to flip its pages. At least he begins to connect letter to letter, word to word, paragraph to paragraph. And and and as he continued reading, he tells a narrative that he was in tears because he had never found such powerful germs ever taught to him. Uh you want to know this pastor? Oh, this brother now, he is serving as a pastor and he has now moved from South Africa. He is now in the US as a pastor in the 7th day Adventist church. All from the written word. There is a power that God has hidden in the secrecy of those pages that when he illuminates the mind of its reader, its hearer, God transforms life and he can turn the drunkard into a sober people in our generation. We must begin to replace reals with a real life among young people. Did did that one come closer to the young people? We must replace reals with what? Real life. And so before our young people, a book messages to young people, youth instructor and the book education must be given into the hands of every young person for them to read and be prepared to come and take over this country and to lead it with morality and congruence of what their convictions are. Marriages are breaking and tearing apart and this place might not be any different but to the marriages and families that are failing we must place into their home the book called Adventist home and child guidance you see especially in contemporary times you you know you we we are raising children then when we were growing up when uh your mother is seated Ed on one end and you are seated on the other end. Just the look it will tell you discipline yourself or else you will see why Caesar did not leave to see Christ. And you know th those times yeah children as children we used to sit in front and when you sit in front and you're making noise we had big deconesses big deconesses they will lift you nicely and you see I I remember attending a church that had doors like these ones here but you are seated here they will not make sure that you come out from these two they will lift you nicely by your cheeks if you are lucky that day if you are unlucky by your ears and carry you through the center of the church so that everyone should see and then take you there. Uh in the evening you are just waiting for the Sabbath to end. You have booked a good one and it will either be a shoe, a broom or whatever instrument of discipline that can be found close by. But today how we raise up our children is anyhow anywhere. No leave him. He is still a baby. I don't know whether you pastor pastor Mishek come come me I like illustrating a 3 four year old there is a pastor who has visited and then he comes no pastor remove your head remove your head remove your head no no no please do don't do that he will cry he will do But you know if I am the visitor I will massage your child nicely. Nicely. Yeah. When I massage the child nicely. You will see the child getting off my laps and and respecting themselves. You see there is parenting chaos around us and we don't know where the problem is coming from but the problem is we as parents are listening from voices that have failed to parent and those are the voices that we are listening to in our church. We have been given the book child guidance for us to nurture our children from conception to the time that they leave our doors. When you talk about biblical biblical commentary, the conflict series patriarchs and prophets, prophets and kings, desire of ages, acts and epistles, uh, acts of the apostles and the great controversy becomes very handy to give you a commentary on the entire Bible from Genesis to Revelation. When you talk about the world that is grappling with health issues and health conditions, wellness and and incommunicable diseases, there is need before our people to be placed the book ministry of healing. Councils on on health and counsels on foods and diet. These are the gems that the people of this world need and we are blessed with these that we may bless the world that is dying. And these offer practical counsel. Must I remind the church that we are living in the end of times when you talk about the end of times the book last last day events and great controversy and we are doing the great controversy distribution last year and this year as uh project 2.0 zero as as as as a reminder of the urgency of the moment that indeed we are living in the last days. I like what Ellen White says about the last days. She says the present is a time of interest for learned men, men of every class. They are focused on on on their attention on things that are happening round about us. And all these things are potatoes. They forecast of something great that is about to happen. Listen to me my brothers and sisters. If our hope is in humanity, we will lose our sight. Our hope is in Christ who will usher in a kingdom that will never fail. You may talk about leadership, church organization and leadership, personal development. All these are the gems contained in the ministry of Ellen White. In Luke chapter 40, chapter 12:48 the latter part of it Christ appeals and says for everyone to whom much is given from him what will be required? Much will be required. To whom much has been committed of him they will ask more. As we sit in this congregation, much has been given to us. We are blessed with precious gems that we must bless others. We are not blessed with these words, my brothers and sisters, in order to I don't know maybe here pastor and pastor may you don't have brethren who come with the spirit of prophecy volumes on Sabbath for Bible study. They come with them and on one end they are bending like this and they they come and they sit nicely and all that they know is how to argue to the contrary. I don't know whether you have such people. Yeah. They only study to raise an argument. These words have not been given to us to engage in theological debates but rather they are given for personal spiritual as well as evangelistic mission to carry out the gospel to the rest of God's people. And that is why God has called us as seventh day Adventist at this time. So I'm here to challenge somebody, my brothers and sisters, that God is calling all of us not to a life that is complicent, but to a life that is fundamental for our times. We are to remember what time it is at 7day Adventist. And the time to speak God's word is now. If you cannot make and speak the word of God, it is time to share God's word written to somebody. It is time to create WhatsApp groups where you share God's word together. It is time to form reading groups that we can read the books together and share that important book and maybe that book will touch somebody's life. This morning I want to challenge somebody in this place. Sound the battle cry. In this church there is need to remember that we are in the battle and we are in the forefront of the battlefield. Therefore sound the battle cry and see that the fall is nigh. But here is the appeal that God gives us. Raise the standard high. Raise the standard high that the name of the Lord may be glorified in your behavior. Raise the standard high that God may be seen in you. Be heard, be lifted, and be exalted. raise the standard high because that is where God has called us to. My brothers and sisters in your families, you got to raise the standard for the Lord to be seen that he is at work in your family in raising your children. Raise the standard high because you have been blessed with the gems important for our generation and God is seeking for you and him to partner. May somebody partner with God in the plan of salvation this afternoon. Amen.

[171.2s] love of Jesus.
[174.5s] Amen. We have been discussing around the
[178.8s] theme light and strength to the soul.
[182.6s] This is the work of the publishing
[185.3s] ministry of the 7th Day Adventist Church
[189.2s] and we have been emphasizing this
[192.0s] important point. We find in the book
[195.8s] ministry page
[198.4s] 125 where Ellen White says the spirit of
[203.2s] prophecy books contends the instruction
[206.7s] that God has been giving. They contain
[210.5s] the precious comforting light that God
[214.5s] has graciously given his servant to be
[217.4s] given to the world from their pages.
[220.4s] This light is to shine into the hearts
[223.0s] of men and women leading them to the
[226.4s] savior. There is in them truth which to
[231.0s] the receiver is a server of life unto
[235.0s] life. They are the silent
[238.4s] witnesses for God. In these words, we
[243.8s] find the core and appeal to distribute
[247.5s] the literature that we have as a church
[250.8s] because they are important and they
[253.4s] carry out the light necessary as Ellen
[257.1s] White puts it in another place in the
[260.3s] book Steps to Christ page 89 that the
[264.9s] necessary truths for our salvation is
[267.6s] made as clear as noonday. today and none
[270.9s] will be mistaken unless one follows
[274.0s] their own personal judgment. So my
[277.1s] brothers and sisters, as we sit in this
[279.6s] congregation, we must remember that we
[282.1s] are a people on a mission. We are a
[284.3s] people with a purpose and we are a
[286.2s] people with a function. And this
[288.3s] function must not end with a Sabbath
[290.9s] worship in the pew, but it must go out
[293.8s] with the light of God to every believer
[297.2s] out in the space.
[299.7s] Our scripture reading is Jeremiah
[303.0s] chapter 6 and verse 16. I want to
[307.3s] re-echo this from the New King James
[311.4s] Version. The Bible says, "Thus says the
[314.9s] Lord, thus says the Lord, stand in the
[319.0s] ways and see and ask for the old parts
[323.5s] where the good way is and walk in it."
[328.5s] then you will find rest for your souls.
[332.6s] I wish Jeremiah could only end there,
[336.3s] but the Bible continues to say,
[339.7s] "But they said, we will not walk in
[344.6s] it." Jeremiah comes from a religious
[348.6s] background. In fact, he comes from the
[351.0s] tribe of Levy. Except at the time that
[353.9s] he was ministering as a prophet, he was
[357.8s] not among the presiding priests. But his
[361.9s] other siblings and
[364.2s] cousins were ministering in the
[366.8s] sanctuary of the Lord. But the word of
[369.2s] the Lord came to Jeremiah. And Jeremiah
[373.0s] was told, "Jeremiah, it is time to arise
[376.6s] and do my work." And Jeremiah as and
[380.9s] like every one of us sometimes when the
[384.1s] gospel call comes we feel like holding
[387.5s] on to our comfort zones but Jeremiah
[390.9s] begins to have an argument with the Lord
[393.4s] and rationalize his call and then God
[396.6s] turns to him and say Jeremiah remember
[399.7s] before you were born before you coiled
[402.4s] in your mother's womb before you came
[404.6s] out of your mother's womb I sanctified
[407.3s] you I ordained you as a prophet unto
[409.9s] nation. Jeremiah, I am still the God who
[414.2s] is the God of your beginning and I'm
[416.1s] still the God of your ending. I am still
[418.0s] the God who is calling you to arise even
[421.1s] though you may not be presiding in the
[423.5s] sanctuary. I am still calling you to a
[426.3s] sanctified mission. And this sanctified
[428.9s] mission is to appeal to my people that
[431.8s] they may return to me because I am their
[435.1s] God. I raise them. I called their father
[437.9s] Abraham and now I have led them into a
[441.0s] promised land lest they go back into
[444.3s] captivity. I want you Jeremiah to go and
[447.9s] appeal to them. And so verse six,
[450.4s] chapter 6 comes in handy because there
[453.8s] in Jeremiah is told to go out and make
[458.9s] this public declaration where scripture
[462.8s] has reminded us to say tell the children
[465.5s] of Israel and go and stand in the
[469.2s] ways. In this passage we find that to
[473.2s] stand in the ways is in a moment to go
[476.5s] and pause and reflect and mediate and
[479.9s] reason and consider where the course of
[483.3s] our spirituality is going. You see when
[486.6s] you talk about a path you are talking
[489.1s] about a direction a way in which one has
[492.8s] to take. And if we were to ask ourselves
[496.2s] as Christians and the 7th day Adventist,
[499.4s] which course are we taking, what
[501.7s] direction are we headed and which path
[504.2s] have we treaded in the past of our
[507.0s] lives? And especially for most of us
[509.4s] that are
[510.6s] baptized. I don't know whether it was
[512.8s] just me but when I got baptized pastor
[514.7s] Amayo I felt like the Holy Spirit was
[516.9s] upon me and I felt like if and only had
[520.7s] Christ come that day I could have been
[523.8s] in the kingdom of
[525.5s] glory but as time ticked
[528.7s] on could it be that complicency crepts
[531.9s] in and we begin to be so comfortable in
[535.0s] the warm pews of the church that the the
[537.4s] the zeal that we have the the zeal we
[540.0s] have the drive we to proclaim the gospel
[543.2s] almost begins to fade because we begin
[545.7s] to think from the time I got baptized uh
[548.6s] by the way it is how many how many years
[551.2s] um got baptized in
[558.0s] 1999 what 26 years from the time I got
[569.2s] baptized I I I was thinking it was just
[571.9s] like uh yesterday. It's already 26
[576.5s] years and and you see when you look at
[579.9s] 26 years of baptism if it was in the
[583.1s] corporate world I could have risen in
[586.0s] the ranks uh of of professional
[589.1s] hierarchies. Uh but you see the problem
[591.8s] is the more you think and reason about
[594.6s] the longevity of time you've spent in
[596.6s] the church the more you feel so
[598.5s] comfortable that you are so closer to
[600.8s] holiness and you feel no need to renew
[605.0s] your spirit every day. And so Jeremiah
[608.6s] is told go and stand and tell the
[611.0s] children of Israel to stand in the path
[613.6s] and look for the old ways.
[616.9s] Make a moral reflection about your
[619.4s] spiritual life. My brothers and sisters
[621.9s] in this church, I want us to remember.
[625.0s] There is an important need for every one
[628.6s] of us to pause a and ask ourselves,
[632.1s] where am I going
[634.7s] spiritually? As I reflect upon my
[637.6s] personal
[638.8s] lives, where am I headed? Am I going in
[642.2s] the direction that God wants? or every
[644.8s] time I'm wrestling against the power of
[647.4s] the Holy Spirit. When the power and the
[650.1s] current of the Holy Spirit is leading me
[652.1s] in a particular direction, I feel like
[654.2s] going my own
[656.7s] way. And as in scripture remind us that
[660.2s] there is a way that seems right to a
[665.3s] man. Ah, however, its end is fatal. self
[671.4s] to say that if we are to be called
[675.0s] Christians, we must stick to the
[677.4s] spiritual land that God has given to us.
[680.7s] And no wonder why in the second part
[683.0s] Jeremiah says, "Ask for the old parts."
[688.1s] Now, now before you go to the odd parts
[691.0s] which are the established rays of
[693.8s] righteousness and obedience to God,
[696.3s] there is an aspect that is appealing to
[701.6s] asking. Could it be that sometimes it is
[704.5s] important to pause a little and reflect
[707.2s] and also seek
[710.7s] guidance? And where do we find guidance?
[713.8s] We find guidance from God's church, from
[716.0s] the people, the men and women who have
[718.2s] been entrusted with this work, the
[720.5s] pastors and the elders and the leaders
[722.5s] of the church. But we must also ask the
[726.2s] God who has called us. And how can we
[729.0s] find direction and the word of and
[732.2s] direction from the word of go but but
[734.1s] from the word of God that is the one
[736.0s] that God has given us that we may ask of
[739.8s] it because out of it God has given us a
[743.0s] spiritual compass a spiritual direction
[745.4s] that we when we expose ourselves to this
[748.5s] word we can find what what what
[752.4s] scripture says
[754.2s] peace and rest for our souls.
[757.5s] So my brothers and sisters, we must
[759.9s] remember that our obedience to God is an
[764.6s] important part of our righteous
[767.7s] upbringing as well as our righteous
[770.8s] expression of who we are. Our identity
[773.6s] as Christians is seen in our obedience
[777.3s] to Christ. Then no wonder why Christ
[778.9s] says, "If you are my disciples, you will
[781.4s] do that which I I command you and you
[784.9s] will do my commandments only if you are
[788.5s] my
[789.9s] disciples." I don't know whether we've
[791.9s] been discipled or we are struggling and
[794.4s] grappling to be disciples. And maybe
[797.0s] perhaps we don't even know what
[798.9s] disciplehip entails.
[801.7s] Then the Bible further continues to
[803.9s] highlight that when we have found a
[806.8s] particular direction and we have asked
[809.3s] for the old ways of obedience and we
[811.8s] have started leading in this there is an
[814.7s] important aspect of walking in
[818.5s] them. Now, walking in the light of God
[823.0s] entails that each one of us, at least to
[826.7s] the best of our ability, the truth that
[829.8s] we have received from God's word, from
[833.5s] the instructions given, from the spoken
[836.8s] word, the written word, and the
[839.2s] incarnate word, we begin to be faithful
[843.1s] and live harmoniously with the revealed
[846.3s] word of God. And the moment that we
[848.9s] begin to live faithfully
[852.0s] and accept the guidance from God's word,
[855.5s] then we actively begin to engage in what
[859.5s] walking in the parts of righteousness
[863.6s] implies. By the way, most many of the
[866.3s] times I have discovered and I have seen
[868.8s] and
[869.8s] observed that the the the voice of
[872.9s] condemnation becomes stronger than the
[875.5s] voice of commendation. What does this
[878.1s] mean? It means they are many times that
[881.7s] we feel so drained by our own
[885.3s] inconsistencies that we don't realize
[887.8s] where God is taking us from. Remember,
[891.1s] Christianity is a journey. The way to
[893.9s] perfection and to be in the image of God
[897.0s] is a journey. It is a process. And the
[899.6s] process is not once off and it is all
[903.6s] perfect. There will be times you will
[905.7s] make a step forward and make two steps
[909.0s] backwards. But I want to write to remind
[911.2s] you soldier of the cross rise
[914.0s] up. Don't stay backwards. But every time
[918.7s] be reminded by the word of God that for
[921.0s] this reason Christ came to seek and to
[923.8s] serve that which was lost. Christ did
[926.6s] not come for the righteous, but he came
[928.6s] to seek those that were in need of his
[933.7s] grace. The unfortunate part is in the
[937.4s] latter part of this
[939.3s] passage where people bluntly denied and
[942.6s] said we will not walk in the truth. Nor
[947.4s] should we walk in the path of obedience.
[949.9s] Nor should we walk and find the old
[953.8s] ways. But this, my brothers and sisters,
[957.6s] is a fourth feature to the preceding
[961.2s] statement that you will find rest for
[964.0s] your
[964.8s] souls. Doesn't Christ remind us in the
[968.7s] book of Matthew chapter 11 and verse 29?
[975.0s] Chapter 11 29. Take my yoke upon you and
[979.8s] learn from me for I am humble and gentle
[983.4s] in heart and you will find rest for your
[986.5s] soul. For my yoke is easy and my burden
[990.0s] is light. Isn't this what God is
[992.8s] reminding us that when we take up the
[995.3s] yoke of Christ and when we take up the
[998.2s] ways of Christ, he enables us by the
[1001.6s] power of his holy spirit to live as he
[1004.7s] desires. In fact, my brothers and
[1007.1s] sisters, let us remember this.
[1012.4s] The sinful experiences of life come at
[1017.0s] our own discretion and our own vition to
[1020.7s] do them. And we struggle to do things
[1024.7s] that are evil. But here is the contrast
[1029.0s] in living a holy life. As you struggle
[1033.1s] to let go of your sins, it is no longer
[1036.7s] you who lives a perfect life in you, but
[1040.8s] the Holy Spirit comes and begins to live
[1043.8s] out the life of Christ in you. There is
[1047.1s] aid that comes to your rescue as you
[1050.2s] desire and commit yourself. And I'm not
[1052.7s] saying it is a simple walk in the
[1055.4s] park. Takes a lot of commitment. It
[1058.7s] takes a lot of falling but yet rising
[1060.9s] up. And no wonder why scripture says a
[1063.0s] righteous man may fall how many times?
[1065.6s] How many times church? Seven times. But
[1068.6s] he does what? Again? He rises. It is not
[1072.6s] easy. But there is aid that comes. And
[1075.9s] the aid that comes is the power that
[1078.8s] prepares us to stand before the throne
[1081.0s] of God. Hallelujah.
[1082.9s] And my brothers and sisters, I am here
[1085.2s] to remind us that there is a blessing
[1089.5s] that God gives to those that follow his
[1093.3s] word. And I want to pick on seven
[1096.2s] important blessings that come from the
[1098.4s] book of
[1099.3s] Revelation. And here we will see how
[1101.6s] they are punctuated.
[1103.5s] In Revelation
[1105.4s] 1:3, there is a blessing for those who
[1108.3s] read the the the prophetic word as it is
[1112.7s] for the time of the end. In Revelation
[1115.4s] 14, it is a blessing in verse 13 for
[1119.2s] those that die in
[1121.0s] Christ. In Revelation 16 verse 15 is a
[1126.6s] blessing to those that watch and keep
[1129.6s] their garments. in Revelation
[1132.7s] 19:9 is a blessing to those who are
[1135.8s] called to the marriage supper of the
[1138.0s] lamb. In Revelation 20:6 is a blessing
[1142.6s] to those that are that are partakers in
[1146.0s] the first
[1147.6s] resurrection. In Revelation chapter,
[1150.2s] which is the sixth uh blessing,
[1152.5s] Revelation
[1154.0s] 22:7 is a blessing to those that
[1157.7s] keep the words of the prophets.
[1161.2s] And finally in Revelation chapter 22:14,
[1165.6s] there is a blessing to those who do uh
[1169.3s] the commandments of the will of God. Now
[1172.0s] I want you to do a parallel here. You
[1174.8s] will observe that the first blessing in
[1177.4s] Revelation is an appeal to reading, is
[1180.7s] an appeal to hearing. And it comes with
[1183.4s] a blessing to read the word of God, the
[1187.2s] written word of God. and also to listen
[1190.1s] to the spoken word of God because it is
[1195.0s] this word that Hebrews tells us that it
[1198.2s] is the it is powerful. It is still life
[1201.0s] and active. It changes and transforms
[1203.6s] people when it is heard or it is read.
[1206.8s] It still is the word of God and it
[1209.2s] accomplishes its mind.
[1213.3s] When we look at the last two, the sixth
[1216.8s] and the
[1218.0s] seventh, these are important because the
[1221.8s] sixth is an echo to the
[1224.8s] first. The blessing is on those who keep
[1229.9s] what have what they have read. In
[1233.2s] Revelation uh 22:7, this blessing comes
[1238.2s] because people have kept what is in the
[1241.6s] word. So let's refresh and do it now uh
[1246.7s] together in Revelation
[1249.6s] 1:3. It's hearing and doing what?
[1254.2s] Reading. In chapter
[1256.4s] 22, which is the sixth blessing, it is
[1260.6s] an appeal for us to practice what we
[1264.1s] have read and what we have done. What we
[1266.9s] have heard. And here is what happens
[1269.5s] between the reading, the hearing and the
[1273.8s] action is the process of
[1278.3s] transformation. You can only begin to do
[1282.0s] when what you have read and what you
[1284.5s] have heard is a part of you and it forms
[1287.8s] the fabric of your being. Listen to me
[1291.1s] my brothers and sisters.
[1294.0s] to be a Christian.
[1325.3s] There is a great deal more to this
[1328.2s] subject than we can take in a glance or
[1331.5s] that all might see the importance of
[1333.6s] carefully studying the
[1335.5s] scriptures. Many seem to have the idea
[1339.2s] that this world and heavenly mansions
[1341.6s] constitute the universe of God. Not so.
[1345.0s] The redeemed throng will range from
[1348.4s] world to world and much of their time
[1351.2s] will be employed in setting out the
[1353.8s] mysteries of
[1357.5s] redemption. Ah pastor my brother come
[1361.4s] come. No no no no. Come, come, come,
[1363.4s] come, come,
[1370.0s] come, come here. Come
[1374.3s] here. It's good to see you and God bless
[1377.8s] you. We heard about the tragedy that
[1380.4s] happened last night, but we praise God.
[1383.3s] What do we say for our pastor? And the
[1385.5s] saving grace of the Lord upon him. Amen.
[1388.6s] the protection from the harm that could
[1391.0s] have affected him and the family. Ah,
[1394.6s] may God bless you. Thank you. Thank you
[1396.9s] so much. You see, seeing him has even
[1400.6s] made me digress. Uh, that wasn't part of
[1404.7s] the sermon, but it was necessary.
[1410.3s] You see my brothers and sisters, it will
[1412.5s] be
[1413.6s] uncomfortable for us to begin learning
[1417.4s] about God if we have not uh to learn
[1420.3s] about God in the kingdom to come. If we
[1423.0s] have not learned to appreciate him now,
[1425.3s] especially for those of us who have been
[1427.8s] given the privilege to sit in his church
[1432.2s] to know and to learn of him, it is very
[1435.2s] different from the thief on the cross.
[1438.3s] Remember the thief on the cross had no
[1440.2s] time to look through the writings of the
[1442.5s] prophets. He could have known. He could
[1444.7s] have read Isaiah. He could have read
[1446.8s] Jeremiah. But he did not have the
[1448.9s] opportunity to reflect and carefully
[1451.3s] think who Jesus was. But we have the
[1456.0s] opportunity. We have the opportunity
[1458.3s] that God has given to us. And throughout
[1461.0s] eternal ages, Ellen White highlights
[1463.0s] that we will be learning about the
[1465.6s] mystery of
[1468.2s] redemption. And those that are learned
[1470.8s] men among us would tell us that uh
[1473.6s] mystery is something that is blurry. You
[1476.3s] cannot clearly
[1478.2s] see. Could it be also that even in
[1482.8s] eternity because it will be an endless
[1485.9s] study, we will not fully comprehend what
[1488.9s] it entails for God to speak his word,
[1491.7s] for God to make his word incarnate and
[1494.2s] for God to give us the written word. And
[1496.6s] this written word as it is spoken, it is
[1499.1s] still the written word that is able to
[1502.1s] transform us. Can we even
[1507.6s] understand? In upward Luke page 75,
[1510.5s] Ellen White says, "The importance of
[1512.1s] studying the word of God cannot be
[1515.4s] overestimated. Its promises are large
[1518.9s] and full of riches of richness. In no
[1523.4s] case should we fail of securing the
[1526.5s] heavenly treasure. Christ is our only
[1530.0s] security. We cannot trust to human
[1533.2s] reasoning. The world is full of men and
[1536.1s] women who cherish deceptive theories and
[1539.0s] it is dangerous to listen to them. And
[1542.9s] these are the people that scripture
[1544.4s] calls
[1547.8s] educated. F O
[1550.4s] L
[1552.1s] S. What does that read? At least it's
[1555.8s] not me who said it. It's you. and I will
[1558.7s] borrow it from you. Educated fools. And
[1562.0s] a fool says in his heart, there is no
[1564.2s] who? There's no
[1568.4s] God. And Ellen White says in this world,
[1572.2s] we will meet fools that have worn
[1576.1s] graduation gowns and caps.
[1579.8s] But we must realize that our only
[1583.0s] security and safety at whatever point of
[1585.9s] life is the word of God because it has
[1590.4s] the same effect and power as when God
[1593.5s] spoke it. So my brothers and sisters, I
[1597.0s] wish to remind what we affirm the 7th
[1599.8s] day Adventist church. We believe that
[1603.5s] the ministry and writings of Ellen White
[1605.7s] were a manifestation of the gift of
[1608.0s] prophecy.
[1609.5s] We believe that Ellen White was inspired
[1612.2s] by the Holy Spirit that her writings,
[1615.0s] the product of that inspiration, are
[1617.7s] applicable and authoritative, especially
[1620.3s] to the Seventh Day Adventist Church
[1621.8s] today. We believe that the purposes of
[1625.3s] the Ellen White writings include
[1628.1s] guidance in understanding the searching
[1631.0s] of scripture and the application of
[1633.2s] these teachings which with prophetic
[1636.4s] urgency to the spiritual and moral
[1639.5s] life. Lastly, we believe that the
[1643.0s] acceptance of the prophetic gift of
[1644.9s] Ellen White is important to the nature
[1648.4s] and unity of the 7th Day Adventist
[1651.0s] Church.
[1652.4s] Listen to me my brothers and sisters. We
[1655.4s] are an advantaged church.
[1659.5s] If of the truths necessary that has been
[1662.9s] given to us where brought before the
[1665.4s] fall of every and by the
[1667.5s] way it's one thing to have these
[1671.4s] writings on our
[1674.0s] devices and if I was to ask how many
[1677.1s] don't have the writings of Ellen White
[1679.8s] who are seventh day Adventists in this
[1681.6s] place none will raise their hand maybe a
[1684.3s] few but if I was to ask how many of us
[1688.0s] have the writings ings perhaps the
[1690.2s] church about 80% I can guarantee you
[1693.3s] would raise they
[1699.0s] have the problem is not having access
[1703.5s] to the problem is
[1707.8s] encountering the writings of Ellen
[1710.7s] White and I I want to suggest something
[1713.1s] that is very
[1714.9s] practical and start with a very clear
[1718.0s] and simple book like steps to
[1721.1s] Christ every day just read a paragraph a
[1726.0s] what a paragraph in the
[1728.9s] morning read maybe choose a topic that
[1732.9s] you feel out of the many topics that
[1735.4s] Ellen White has written in the book
[1736.9s] steps to Christ read just one paragraph
[1739.6s] and you will begin to enjoy because you
[1742.5s] know that thing is addictive eh very
[1745.6s] addictive you will begin to glean the
[1749.0s] sweetness of reading. And when you
[1751.1s] finish the first paragraph, it will lead
[1753.1s] you to the next paragraph because you
[1754.8s] would want to finish the entire chapter
[1756.8s] to see the end. But the entire chapter
[1759.0s] is actually preparing you for the next
[1760.7s] chapter. And the next chapter is
[1762.7s] preparing you for the next chapter. The
[1764.6s] next chapter will prepare you for the
[1766.1s] next book. The next book will prepare
[1768.2s] you now. And and as you expose yourself
[1770.9s] to this, your character begins to in
[1773.9s] fact what begins to change is your
[1775.8s] language.
[1778.4s] you you begin speaking. You you you know
[1780.7s] there was there was a time when we were
[1784.0s] uh pastor Maba you remember that time we
[1786.0s] used to speak uh the only authorized
[1788.7s] language in the church was the King
[1790.6s] James version language thou and
[1793.6s] thy simply because we read the King
[1796.2s] James
[1797.3s] version. And equally when we begin to
[1800.6s] expose ourselves to these gems found in
[1803.0s] the writings of Ellen
[1804.6s] White, we begin to realize that there is
[1809.4s] something about it that captures our
[1813.0s] attention and refocuses our attention to
[1816.2s] the attention of who Christ
[1818.7s] is. Now my brothers and sisters, we are
[1821.4s] to go to the old ways and stand in it
[1825.0s] and reflect as Adventists.
[1827.8s] But who are we reflecting these
[1830.9s] to? There is a world that is dying in
[1835.0s] sin. You and I may have an opportunity
[1838.7s] to be present in this place, but there
[1841.6s] is a sinner that is struggling with
[1844.3s] guilt in their lives. They have found no
[1848.6s] solution for their inconsistencies in
[1851.1s] life. And the only option they are
[1853.0s] thinking is to take up their lives.
[1856.2s] There is a sinner my brothers and
[1857.8s] sisters who might need the light in
[1859.9s] their
[1861.2s] home and it can only be given to them.
[1865.0s] And I remember this brother giving a
[1868.4s] testimony. He was a
[1871.2s] drunk chain smoker and you can tell it
[1875.4s] about him. He comes from uh
[1879.1s] um a a an Indian
[1882.8s] background and one day he was given a
[1886.1s] book by Ellen White, forgotten what the
[1889.2s] what what book it is and he went into
[1892.6s] his room and threw it under the
[1895.0s] bed. The power of the written word. This
[1899.5s] is a guy who is frustrated about life.
[1902.9s] This is a guy who doesn't even think
[1905.7s] there is hope about life
[1909.2s] today. And so when he went in one day
[1914.1s] because of his hopelessness, he went and
[1916.5s] kneelled besides the bed. And what does
[1919.7s] he see is this book that he was given.
[1922.7s] And he puts it he pulls it out and he
[1925.2s] begins to flip its pages. At least he
[1927.8s] begins to connect letter to letter, word
[1930.3s] to word, paragraph to paragraph. And and
[1933.1s] and as he continued reading, he tells a
[1936.7s] narrative that he was in tears because
[1939.4s] he had never found such powerful germs
[1942.6s] ever taught to
[1944.0s] him. Uh you want to know this pastor?
[1947.0s] Oh, this brother now, he is serving as a
[1950.3s] pastor and he has now moved from South
[1952.9s] Africa. He is now in the US as a pastor
[1955.5s] in the 7th day Adventist church. All
[1958.3s] from the written word. There is a power
[1961.6s] that God has hidden in the secrecy of
[1964.7s] those pages that when he illuminates the
[1967.5s] mind of its reader, its hearer, God
[1971.3s] transforms life and he can turn the
[1974.2s] drunkard into a sober people in our
[1977.5s] generation. We must begin to replace
[1980.7s] reals with a real life among young
[1984.5s] people. Did did that one come closer to
[1987.6s] the young people? We must replace reals
[1990.2s] with what? Real life. And so before our
[1993.3s] young people, a book messages to young
[1996.2s] people, youth instructor and the book
[1998.6s] education must be given into the hands
[2001.5s] of every young person for them to read
[2004.2s] and be prepared to come and take over
[2007.3s] this
[2008.6s] country and to lead it with morality and
[2011.8s] congruence of what their convictions
[2014.4s] are.
[2015.9s] Marriages are breaking and tearing apart
[2018.2s] and this place might not be any
[2020.9s] different but to the marriages and
[2023.1s] families that are failing we must place
[2025.2s] into their home the book called
[2027.2s] Adventist home and child
[2031.1s] guidance you see especially in
[2033.4s] contemporary times you you know you we
[2036.3s] we are raising
[2038.4s] children
[2040.4s] then when we were growing up when uh
[2044.0s] your mother is seated Ed on one
[2046.3s] end and you are seated on the other
[2049.3s] end. Just the
[2051.7s] look it will tell
[2054.0s] you discipline
[2057.0s] yourself or
[2058.8s] else you will see why Caesar did not
[2062.2s] leave to see
[2065.6s] Christ.
[2067.2s] And you know th those times yeah
[2070.0s] children as children we used to sit in
[2072.3s] front and when you sit in front and
[2074.7s] you're making noise we had big
[2076.6s] deconesses big
[2078.8s] deconesses they will lift you nicely and
[2082.2s] you see I I remember attending a church
[2084.3s] that had doors like these ones here but
[2087.1s] you are seated here they will not make
[2089.0s] sure that you come out from these two
[2091.4s] they will lift you nicely by your cheeks
[2094.8s] if you are lucky that day if you are
[2097.8s] unlucky by your
[2099.5s] ears and carry you through the center of
[2102.5s] the church so that everyone should see
[2105.9s] and then take you there.
[2109.1s] Uh in the evening you are just waiting
[2112.0s] for the Sabbath to
[2113.7s] end. You have booked a good one and it
[2117.5s] will either be a shoe, a broom or
[2120.7s] whatever instrument of discipline that
[2123.1s] can be found close by.
[2126.2s] But today how we raise up our children
[2128.2s] is anyhow
[2129.9s] anywhere. No leave him. He is still a
[2132.9s] baby.
[2137.0s] I don't know whether you pastor pastor
[2140.1s] Mishek come come me I like
[2146.0s] illustrating a 3 four year old there is
[2149.9s] a pastor who has visited and then he
[2154.5s] comes no pastor remove your head remove
[2158.9s] your head remove your head no no no
[2160.8s] please do don't do that he will cry he
[2163.2s] will do
[2168.7s] But you know if I am the visitor I will
[2172.9s] massage your child
[2175.3s] nicely.
[2177.2s] Nicely. Yeah. When I massage the child
[2180.8s] nicely. You will see the child getting
[2183.4s] off my laps and and respecting
[2186.1s] themselves.
[2189.0s] You see there is parenting chaos around
[2191.6s] us and we don't know where the problem
[2194.1s] is coming from but the problem is we as
[2197.0s] parents are listening from voices that
[2199.4s] have failed to parent and those are the
[2201.8s] voices that we are listening to in our
[2203.8s] church. We have been given the book
[2205.5s] child guidance for us to nurture our
[2208.5s] children from conception to the time
[2211.2s] that they leave our
[2215.1s] doors. When you talk about biblical
[2217.4s] biblical commentary, the conflict series
[2220.4s] patriarchs and prophets, prophets and
[2222.0s] kings, desire of ages, acts and
[2224.1s] epistles, uh, acts of the apostles and
[2226.2s] the great controversy becomes very handy
[2229.5s] to give you a commentary on the entire
[2232.9s] Bible from Genesis to Revelation.
[2235.9s] When you talk about the world that is
[2237.6s] grappling with health issues and health
[2239.8s] conditions, wellness and and
[2242.9s] incommunicable diseases, there is need
[2245.8s] before our people to be placed the book
[2248.7s] ministry of healing. Councils on on
[2251.4s] health and counsels on foods and diet.
[2254.2s] These are the gems that the people of
[2257.0s] this world need and we are blessed with
[2260.2s] these that we may bless the world that
[2262.8s] is dying. And these offer practical
[2267.7s] counsel. Must I remind the church that
[2270.8s] we are living in the end of
[2273.2s] times when you talk about the end of
[2275.6s] times the book last last day events and
[2278.7s] great controversy and we are doing the
[2281.0s] great controversy distribution last year
[2283.2s] and this year as uh project 2.0 zero as
[2287.4s] as as as a reminder of the urgency of
[2290.6s] the moment that indeed we are living in
[2293.2s] the last
[2294.5s] days. I like what Ellen White says about
[2297.4s] the last
[2298.6s] days. She says the present is a
[2302.7s] time of interest for learned men, men of
[2307.0s] every class. They are focused on on on
[2311.2s] their attention on things that are
[2312.9s] happening round about us. And all these
[2315.6s] things are potatoes. They forecast of
[2318.3s] something great that is about to happen.
[2320.7s] Listen to me my brothers and sisters. If
[2322.6s] our hope is in humanity, we will lose
[2325.4s] our sight. Our hope is in Christ who
[2328.5s] will usher in a kingdom that will never
[2332.3s] fail. You may talk about leadership,
[2335.0s] church organization and leadership,
[2337.0s] personal development. All these are the
[2339.6s] gems contained in the ministry of Ellen
[2342.8s] White.
[2345.1s] In Luke chapter 40, chapter
[2348.5s] 12:48 the latter part of it Christ
[2351.3s] appeals and says for everyone to whom
[2354.2s] much is given from him what will be
[2358.7s] required? Much will be required. To whom
[2362.6s] much has been
[2364.2s] committed of him they will ask more. As
[2369.4s] we sit in this
[2372.0s] congregation, much has been given to us.
[2375.6s] We are blessed with precious gems that
[2378.6s] we must bless others. We are not blessed
[2381.8s] with these words, my brothers and
[2383.4s] sisters, in order to I don't know maybe
[2386.1s] here pastor and pastor may you don't
[2388.5s] have brethren who come with the spirit
[2391.1s] of prophecy volumes on Sabbath for Bible
[2393.4s] study.
[2394.8s] They come with them and on one end they
[2396.9s] are bending like this and they they come
[2399.7s] and they sit nicely and all that they
[2402.4s] know is how to argue to the contrary. I
[2406.2s] don't know whether you have such people.
[2408.8s] Yeah. They only study to raise an
[2412.6s] argument.
[2414.3s] These words have not been given to us to
[2417.4s] engage in theological
[2419.6s] debates but rather they are given for
[2422.8s] personal spiritual as well
[2426.6s] as evangelistic mission to carry out the
[2431.0s] gospel to the rest of God's people. And
[2433.4s] that is why God has called us as seventh
[2436.2s] day Adventist at this time. So I'm here
[2438.7s] to challenge somebody, my brothers and
[2441.1s] sisters, that God is calling all of us
[2445.5s] not to a life that is complicent, but to
[2448.6s] a life that is fundamental for our
[2451.8s] times. We are to remember what time it
[2454.4s] is at 7day Adventist. And the time to
[2457.0s] speak God's word is now. If you cannot
[2459.9s] make and speak the word of God, it is
[2462.1s] time to share God's word written to
[2464.6s] somebody. It is time to create WhatsApp
[2467.4s] groups where you share God's word
[2470.6s] together. It is time to form reading
[2473.8s] groups that we can read the books
[2476.6s] together and share that important book
[2479.1s] and maybe that book will touch
[2481.0s] somebody's life. This morning I want to
[2484.9s] challenge somebody in this place. Sound
[2487.9s] the battle cry. In this church there is
[2491.4s] need to remember that we are in the
[2493.4s] battle and we are in the forefront of
[2495.6s] the battlefield. Therefore sound the
[2497.8s] battle cry and see that the fall is
[2501.0s] nigh. But here is the appeal that God
[2503.7s] gives us. Raise the standard high. Raise
[2506.6s] the standard high that the name of the
[2508.4s] Lord may be glorified in your behavior.
[2511.0s] Raise the standard high that God may be
[2513.7s] seen in you. Be heard, be lifted, and be
[2516.9s] exalted. raise the standard high because
[2519.4s] that is where God has called us to. My
[2521.7s] brothers and sisters in your families,
[2523.6s] you got to raise the standard for the
[2525.6s] Lord to be seen that he is at work in
[2528.1s] your family in raising your children.
[2530.2s] Raise the standard high because you have
[2532.8s] been blessed with the gems important for
[2535.4s] our generation and God is seeking for
[2537.8s] you and him to partner. May somebody
[2540.2s] partner with God in the plan of
[2542.4s] salvation this afternoon. Amen.
