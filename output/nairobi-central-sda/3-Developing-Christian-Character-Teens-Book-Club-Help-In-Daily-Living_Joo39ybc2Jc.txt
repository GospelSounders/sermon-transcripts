FULL TRANSCRIPT:
greetings to you all thank you for joining us last week even as we covered the chapter living with others today we'll be covering chapter 3 which talks about uh developing Christian character this is from the book help in daily living and together with me are the panelists who will be sharing the word from the chapter um developing Christian character and I'd like to start the introduction from my extreme right then coming all the way to my immediate right hello everyone my name is Benda Maya hi my name is Amy andalu hi my name is sair kundi I'm a member of teens class and I'm happy to be here thank you and my name is niiko pi and I'm the moderator for today and before we begin I'd like to invite subira to give us a word of prayer okay let us pray dear heavenly father God thank you so much for this wonderful opportunity to seek truth as we dive into this book written by your servant Ellen G white let us gather gems that will help in our daily living looking at the Christian character I pray that we may embody you in every sense such that we will be among the number who are called to be with together with you in heaven we trust and believe in your name in Jesus name we pray and believe amen amen amen yeah so as we begin it's important for us to acknowledge that Christian character is not something that is developed in a day it actually takes time so as we acknowledge this this then it's important for us to actually learn how is it that we can develop our Christian character such that we are constantly growing as Christians because even if we know how to live with others and even if we understand how to live ourselves what is it that we are expected to do to help us in our heavenward journey so I'd like to invite subira to actually give us a summary of this chapter and then we can also continue discussing some of the main themes that are covered yes thank you so much for that introduction I'm extremely happy to be here and as we're looking at this chapter developing Christian character as teacher niiko rightfully noted this is a process it takes a while for you to develop the Christian character but as you develop it with the help of the Holy Spirit you can become more and more like Jesus so elg white notes that this Christian character is not just consisting of gentleness patience meekness kindliness all these things but instead there's also need for courage perseverance Force right and so the path for the Christian is very very narrow it's a self-denying path that requires sanctification it's very it's very difficult but still God wants people of stamina those who are willing to have the mental fortitude the spiritual fortitude to endure the suffering despite circumstance to be together with him so my first question will be posed to Brenda you know we've been told about all these the fruits of the spirit right the good characteristics but why do you think courage is as important as gentleness in our Christian faith that's that's a really important that's a really good question actually um I I honestly believe all of them all the fruits of the spirit are very important you know none is greater than the other but uh when it comes to developing a Christian character courage is very I think almost the most important if like I don't know how to best bringing it out but I'll I'll I'll just read a verse first I'll read Deuteronomy 31 verse 6 and it says be strong and of good courage do not fear nor be afraid of them for the Lord your God he is the one who goes with you he will not leave you or forsake you um I feel like this verse really brings out why courage is important When developing a Christian character because when you want to be when you want to start walking the Walk of Christ you need a lot of strength because it's not an easy path we're told it's a narrow road and most Christians they get tired quickly and they they lose heart and they're like why am I the one going through all this suffering and that's why we're told to Have Courage because when you want to start your walk with Christ you know it's not going to be easy you might be told oh it'll be fine like you you'll do fine but you won't do fine let's let's be very honest and you need that courage to actually step out of your comfort zone the comfort zone that you've made in the world to go out and be who Christ wants you to be and that needs a lot of Courage that's why God tells us to be of good courage cuz we need it truly yeah absolutely and so just like Benda is saying God wants people who are not spiritless have an enthusiasm a Zeal for Christ that's very very important but this Christian character be extends beyond our actions it's a mental culture it's a perspective a mentality and that entails those who are qualified to do this excellent work accomplish little sometimes because they attempt little and so we as Christians are aware of a higher standard and that standard is gone a God who has created this universe and if we depend on that higher standard that we are it ensures that we're not satisfied with reaching this low standard mean that in everything that we do we must be excellent for God I think this also extends to the exploration of knowledge we all need to live in the Bible but visit other books as well and as we're reading this book as well we are picking notes and applying it back to biblical truths and our own lives so in exploring Norge we must we must have this appetite to learn more and more about God yes this world has sort of programmed our minds religion programs minds I think education programs minds but instead God has given us a mind to think critically and we should explore ourselves on a personal note let me read this book let me learn more and so an encouragement to our audience explore this for yourself don't depend on our words solely but on the true word of Christ amen and so I have this question for Teacher Nico how do you think developing this mental culture and striving for higher things God's expectations helps us in our daily living yes when when I think about how to strive for better mental culture I actually think about what Christ expects of us in growth a tree does not stop growing after it produces the first fruit it continues bearing fruit continually all throughout the years like I remember my parents have an avocado tree in the home and it bears fruit every year and I always see it continuing to grow daily to the point that there's one time it B maybe 50 avocados then it went and B 100 avocados and it continued in that sense to grow grow and grow and grow to the point one time the avocados were so many they actually broke off the branch as a result of the growth now it doesn't mean we should stop growing as Christians on the branch bricks but I'm just trying to show here that even as we are Christians it's important for us to have continual growth we should never reach a place and say I have learned enough in fact I'd like to read a statement here that was saying never think that you have learned enough and that you may now relax your efforts and I think about it sometimes even many old people sometimes say I'm going into retirement does going into retirement mean that you're actually just going to be sitting somewhere looking around and thinking that okay what is it that I'm actually doing next I think of it more that your mind should be constantly growing even if your body may not be as strong as you are but it means your mind and your mental culture needs you need to be resilient and just one last statement I'd like to read says that remember in whatever position you may serve you're revealing motive developing character whatever your work do it with exactness with diligence and the last statement which I'll close with challenged me overcome the inclination to seek an easy task I read this and I paused and I'd like to pass that challenge back to you as well yeah do you overcome that inclination absolutely and I think in steps to Christ which you should definitely go and watch our panel discussion on we learned that activity is the very condition of life and as Christians we must exercise our even spiritual strength lest we lose the strength that we already had and so we do not go into retirement as Christians yeah our spiritual fortitude must be developed consistent amen but moving on to this idea of opposition we see that actually ellm G white mentions that men of power have been opposed thed baffled and they call their energies into action and this develops the idea of self-reliance how many times do we find that opposition is really really stifling in our Christian Journey Anytime we meet a bad circumstance we fall right but the righteous man is one who has gotten back seven times right yes yes this should be our perspective such that we're not victims of circumstance but masters of it amen and so my question is to Amy in what ways can we view opposition not as a means to stop our faith but as an opportunity for growth in strengthening our faith in God okay [Music] um what is growth in terms of being a Christian and this is essentially being Christlike and as Christians we strive to become more like Christ and when we read the Bible we see that Christ did not have an easy time on Earth and um so that sort of mentally prepares you that if you want to live like Christ you will have a difficult time you will have opposition you will have people going against you and I think it's important to realize that these sort of um difficulties that we experience as Christians help us grow our faith and trusting in God to bring us through whatever we go through experiences vary and obviously you're not going to have the same experiences as somebody else but the end goal is to understand and realize that we are growing our faith and we're becoming more like Christ yeah amen absolutely what Amy said is very true instead obstacles obstacles should become positive blessings in the mind of the Christian but you know I'm struggling for this but it is for the sake of Christ and sometimes we blame it on our circumstances but to choose to blame is to choose to remain the same and we should not have this as our perspective but it comes back to our work reveals a motive just as teacher niik did a said a quote um from Ellen G white I think we must reevaluate our motives in serving God sometimes we choose to help others to Pat ourselves on the back and say you know what that was me but you see that Christ doesn't measure his work by the hours he doesn't say I worked 16 hours in blessing and Healing The Sick no he doesn't account it but instead we could dedicate boundless time to helping people to devoting ourselves to Christ and all these things is not for ourselves but for the Eternal Father amen amen so this Same Spirit and the same principles that we use to bring to labor should be the same spirit that we bring to our whole entire life it is not just in the daily work but in the spiritual work as well MH our world has this currency of work smart and not work hard M but the issue with this is that we often look for the easy way out right we seek the easy task but seeking the easy task doesn't necessarily mean reaping the best results working hard is calling every single power your mind your heart your soul to your specific work for the sake of Christ I'd like to ask my panelists here any parting shorts things that you have learned significantly from the chapter that I didn't quite touch on that you would like to let our audience know as well starting from Brenda um something I think tribulation when you talked about tribulations that we face as Christians when we're developing our Christian character and um I'll just read a a verse real quick from uh Romans 12 verse 12 and it says rejoicing in Hope patience in tribulations continuing steadfastly in prayer and this brought out how if us as Christians can't develop our our character through tribulations that we face opposition we wouldn't be close to God we wouldn't look for him cuz when you are in a constant need of of help from him when you're confused and you're you're facing people who are going against you you get tired mentally spiritually and that's when you go to look for Christ when when Jesus was about to be crucified he went into prayer to talk to his heavenly father because he needed it and it's the same with us as Christians as we try to develop a Christian character like him we need to go and search for God get peace from him so through tribulations we are able to be closer to him and being closer to him helps us develop our character amen absolutely we'll hear from Amy well I think everything I would have talked about was covered really really nicely yeah okay okay um teacher Nico yes I believe that the most important thing which I saw is we need to be ready when duty calls us to do something for God and secondly second Corinthians 5:14 says it's the love of Christ that constrains us when we have the love of Christ in our hearts developing the Christian character will not be a burden but a blessing we'll do it because we love God not because we have to do it and then you'll stop measuring your work by hours you'll be working because you understand the effect of your work and you'll be working because you know what it means to bring souls to God absolutely and one final thing just like teacher niiko said actually there's a picture representing a bulock standing between a plow and an altar with the inscription ready for either ready to toil in The Farrow or to be offered on the altar of sacrifice this is the position of the true child of God willing to go where duty calls to deny self to sacrifice for the redeemer's cause are you ready for either Amy please pray for us let's believe and pray dear heavenly father we come before this day we thank you for allowing us to come and to discuss Chapter 3 of this book I pray that whatever we have gone through may help not just us but all those watching and that it may have this effect and help us change and grow and to be more like Christ I pray that you may keep on keeping us and that you may protect us even as we continue with our own lives um I pray this prayer believing and trusting in Jesus name amen amen thank you for joining us today uh we'll be covering pressing towards the mark in chapter 4 next week we hope to see you there and please read the nuggets and thoughts that we sharing from the book help in daily living by Ellen G see you next week bye for today 

==================================================

TIMESTAMPED TRANSCRIPT:
[2.2s] greetings to you all thank you for
[4.3s] joining us last week even as we covered
[6.4s] the chapter living with others today
[9.2s] we'll be covering chapter 3 which talks
[11.9s] about uh developing Christian character
[15.3s] this is from the book help in daily
[17.6s] living and together with me are the
[20.0s] panelists who will be sharing the word
[22.8s] from the chapter um developing Christian
[26.4s] character and I'd like to start the
[27.9s] introduction from my extreme right then
[30.8s] coming all the way to my immediate right
[33.3s] hello everyone my name is Benda Maya hi
[36.1s] my name is Amy andalu hi my name is sair
[39.4s] kundi I'm a member of teens class and
[41.1s] I'm happy to be here thank you and my
[43.3s] name is niiko pi and I'm the moderator
[45.3s] for today and before we begin I'd like
[47.7s] to invite subira to give us a word of
[49.5s] prayer okay let us pray dear heavenly
[52.6s] father God thank you so much for this
[54.3s] wonderful opportunity to seek truth as
[57.0s] we dive into this book written by your
[58.7s] servant Ellen G white let us gather gems
[61.5s] that will help in our daily living
[63.5s] looking at the Christian character I
[65.1s] pray that we may embody you in every
[67.0s] sense such that we will be among the
[69.8s] number who are called to be with
[71.8s] together with you in heaven we trust and
[74.1s] believe in your name in Jesus name we
[75.4s] pray and believe amen amen
[77.8s] amen yeah so as we begin it's important
[80.6s] for us to acknowledge that Christian
[82.5s] character is not something that is
[84.8s] developed in a day it actually takes
[87.8s] time so as we acknowledge this this then
[90.3s] it's important for us to actually learn
[92.6s] how is it that we can develop our
[94.9s] Christian character such that we are
[98.0s] constantly growing as Christians because
[100.9s] even if we know how to live with others
[102.6s] and even if we understand how to live
[104.4s] ourselves what is it that we are
[106.9s] expected to do to help us in our
[108.8s] heavenward journey so I'd like to invite
[110.8s] subira to actually give us a summary of
[113.3s] this chapter and then we can also
[115.2s] continue discussing some of the main
[117.2s] themes that are covered yes thank you so
[120.0s] much for that introduction I'm extremely
[122.4s] happy to be here and as we're looking at
[124.8s] this chapter developing Christian
[126.5s] character as teacher niiko rightfully
[129.2s] noted this is a process it takes a while
[132.4s] for you to develop the Christian
[133.6s] character but as you develop it with the
[136.4s] help of the Holy Spirit you can become
[138.5s] more and more like Jesus so elg white
[142.2s] notes that this Christian character is
[144.7s] not just consisting of gentleness
[148.1s] patience meekness
[150.4s] kindliness all these things but instead
[153.8s] there's also need for courage
[157.0s] perseverance Force right and so the path
[161.0s] for the Christian is very very narrow
[164.4s] it's a self-denying path that requires
[168.2s] sanctification it's very it's very
[170.9s] difficult but still God wants people of
[174.4s] stamina those who are willing to have
[177.4s] the mental fortitude the spiritual
[179.3s] fortitude to endure the suffering
[182.0s] despite circumstance to be together with
[184.7s] him so my first question will be posed
[187.2s] to
[188.5s] Brenda you know we've been told about
[190.7s] all these the fruits of the spirit right
[193.7s] the good characteristics but why do you
[196.6s] think courage is as important as
[199.4s] gentleness in our Christian faith that's
[203.0s] that's a really important that's a
[204.6s] really good question actually um I I
[207.9s] honestly believe all of them all the
[210.1s] fruits of the spirit are very important
[211.7s] you know none is greater than the other
[214.7s] but uh when it comes to developing a
[217.2s] Christian character courage is very I
[221.6s] think almost the most important if like
[224.9s] I don't know how to best bringing it out
[227.4s] but I'll I'll I'll just read a verse
[229.3s] first I'll read Deuteronomy 31 verse 6
[232.8s] and it says be strong and of good
[235.1s] courage do not fear nor be afraid of
[237.4s] them for the Lord your God he is the one
[239.5s] who goes with you he will not leave you
[241.8s] or forsake you um I feel like this verse
[245.1s] really brings out why courage is
[246.5s] important When developing a Christian
[247.9s] character because when you want to be
[251.1s] when you want to start walking the Walk
[253.2s] of Christ you need a lot of strength
[255.4s] because it's not an easy path we're told
[257.0s] it's a narrow road and most Christians
[260.7s] they get tired quickly and they they
[263.2s] lose heart and they're like why am I the
[265.3s] one going through all this suffering and
[267.4s] that's why we're told to Have Courage
[268.9s] because when you want to start your walk
[270.7s] with Christ you know it's not going to
[272.0s] be easy you might be told oh it'll be
[274.5s] fine like you you'll do fine but you
[277.0s] won't do fine let's let's be very honest
[279.2s] and you need that courage to actually
[281.2s] step out of your comfort zone the
[283.1s] comfort zone that you've made in the
[284.3s] world to go out and be who Christ wants
[288.4s] you to be and that needs a lot of
[289.8s] Courage that's why God tells us to be of
[293.2s] good courage cuz we need it truly yeah
[296.9s] absolutely and so just like Benda is
[299.4s] saying
[300.4s] God wants people who are not spiritless
[302.7s] have an enthusiasm a Zeal for Christ
[305.9s] that's very very important but this
[308.3s] Christian character be extends beyond
[310.6s] our actions it's a mental culture it's a
[313.8s] perspective a mentality and that
[316.7s] entails those who are qualified to do
[319.6s] this excellent work accomplish little
[322.2s] sometimes because they attempt little
[325.2s] and so we as Christians are aware of a
[327.1s] higher standard and that standard is
[329.4s] gone
[330.5s] a God who has created this universe and
[332.8s] if we depend on that higher standard
[335.4s] that we are it ensures that we're not
[337.8s] satisfied with reaching this low
[339.6s] standard mean that in everything that we
[342.1s] do we must be excellent for God I think
[346.6s] this also extends to the exploration of
[348.7s] knowledge we all need to live in the
[351.4s] Bible but visit other books as well and
[354.2s] as we're reading this book as well we
[356.1s] are picking notes and applying it back
[358.3s] to biblical truths and our own lives so
[362.2s] in exploring Norge we must we must have
[364.3s] this appetite to learn more and more
[367.4s] about God yes this world has sort of
[370.4s] programmed our minds religion programs
[373.2s] minds I think education programs minds
[376.6s] but instead God has given us a mind to
[379.9s] think critically and we should explore
[382.8s] ourselves on a personal note let me read
[385.2s] this book let me learn more and so an
[387.3s] encouragement to our audience explore
[389.3s] this for yourself don't depend on our
[391.4s] words solely but on the true word of
[394.2s] Christ amen and so I have this question
[396.5s] for Teacher Nico how do you think
[398.8s] developing this mental culture and
[401.5s] striving for higher things God's
[404.9s] expectations helps us in our daily
[408.6s] living yes when when I think about how
[412.2s] to strive for better mental culture I
[415.3s] actually think about what Christ expects
[418.1s] of us in growth a tree does not stop
[421.6s] growing after it produces the first
[424.4s] fruit it continues bearing fruit
[427.1s] continually all throughout the years
[429.7s] like I remember my parents have an
[431.2s] avocado tree in the home and it bears
[435.1s] fruit every year and I always see it
[438.0s] continuing to grow daily to the point
[441.2s] that there's one time it B maybe 50
[443.1s] avocados then it went and B 100 avocados
[446.5s] and it continued in that sense to grow
[449.5s] grow and grow and grow to the point one
[451.4s] time the avocados were so many they
[453.4s] actually broke off the branch as a
[456.0s] result of the growth now it doesn't mean
[458.0s] we should stop growing as Christians on
[459.7s] the branch bricks but I'm just trying to
[462.6s] show here that even as we are Christians
[466.2s] it's important for us to have continual
[468.9s] growth we should never reach a place and
[471.3s] say I have learned enough in fact I'd
[474.6s] like to read a statement here that was
[476.6s] saying never think that you have learned
[478.9s] enough and that you may now relax your
[481.8s] efforts and I think about it sometimes
[484.9s] even many old people sometimes say I'm
[487.2s] going into retirement does going into
[489.4s] retirement mean that you're actually
[490.9s] just going to be sitting somewhere
[492.6s] looking around and thinking that okay
[494.6s] what is it that I'm actually doing next
[496.9s] I think of it more that your mind should
[499.4s] be constantly growing even if your body
[502.4s] may not be as strong as you are but it
[504.8s] means your mind and your mental culture
[507.0s] needs you need to be resilient and
[510.0s] just one last statement I'd like to read
[513.4s] says that remember in whatever position
[515.6s] you may serve you're revealing motive
[518.9s] developing character whatever your work
[522.2s] do it with exactness with diligence and
[525.5s] the last statement which I'll close with
[527.6s] challenged me overcome the inclination
[531.3s] to seek an easy task I read this and I
[535.5s] paused and I'd like to pass that
[537.9s] challenge back to you as well yeah do
[540.2s] you overcome that
[541.7s] inclination absolutely and I think in
[544.9s] steps to Christ which you should
[546.8s] definitely go and watch our panel
[548.4s] discussion on we learned that activity
[551.3s] is the very condition of life and as
[553.7s] Christians we must exercise our even
[556.1s] spiritual strength lest we lose the
[559.1s] strength that we already had and so we
[562.2s] do not go into retirement as Christians
[565.2s] yeah our spiritual fortitude must be
[568.3s] developed consistent
[570.0s] amen but moving on to this idea of
[573.1s] opposition we see that actually ellm G
[575.8s] white mentions that men of power have
[578.5s] been opposed thed baffled and they call
[583.7s] their energies into action and this
[586.0s] develops the idea of
[587.7s] self-reliance how many times do we find
[590.0s] that opposition is really really
[592.6s] stifling in our Christian Journey
[595.0s] Anytime we meet a bad circumstance we
[597.8s] fall right but the righteous man is one
[600.9s] who has gotten back seven times right
[603.4s] yes yes this should be our perspective
[606.4s] such that we're not victims of
[608.8s] circumstance but masters of it amen and
[612.3s] so my question is to Amy in what ways
[615.6s] can we view opposition not as a means to
[618.8s] stop our faith but as an opportunity for
[621.9s] growth in strengthening our faith in God
[625.2s] okay
[626.0s] [Music]
[627.3s] um what is growth
[629.8s] in terms of being a Christian and this
[633.4s] is essentially being
[635.3s] Christlike and as Christians we strive
[639.0s] to become more like Christ and when we
[643.4s] read the Bible we see that Christ did
[645.2s] not have an easy time on Earth and um so
[649.1s] that sort of mentally prepares you that
[652.1s] if you want to live like Christ you will
[654.5s] have a difficult time you will have
[656.7s] opposition you will have people going
[658.2s] against you and I think it's important
[661.5s] to realize that these sort of
[665.5s] um difficulties that we experience as
[668.0s] Christians help us grow our faith and
[670.8s] trusting in God to bring us through
[673.2s] whatever we go through experiences
[677.1s] vary and obviously you're not going to
[679.9s] have the same experiences as somebody
[681.4s] else but the end goal is to understand
[684.6s] and realize that we are growing our
[687.2s] faith and we're becoming more like
[688.9s] Christ
[689.8s] yeah amen absolutely what Amy said is
[693.0s] very true instead obstacles obstacles
[695.8s] should become positive blessings in the
[698.5s] mind of the Christian but you know I'm
[700.5s] struggling for this but it is for the
[702.9s] sake of Christ and sometimes we blame it
[705.9s] on our circumstances but to choose to
[708.9s] blame is to choose to remain the same
[712.3s] and we should not have this as our
[714.1s] perspective but it comes back to our
[717.4s] work reveals a motive
[721.3s] just as teacher niik did a said a quote
[723.8s] um from Ellen G white I think we must
[726.4s] reevaluate our motives in serving God
[729.8s] sometimes we choose to help others to
[732.4s] Pat ourselves on the back and say you
[733.9s] know what that was me but you see that
[736.4s] Christ doesn't measure his work by the
[738.8s] hours he doesn't say I worked 16 hours
[741.7s] in blessing and Healing The Sick no he
[744.8s] doesn't account it but instead we could
[748.5s] dedicate boundless time to helping
[751.1s] people to devoting ourselves to Christ
[753.8s] and all these things is not for
[755.8s] ourselves but for the Eternal Father
[758.5s] amen amen so this Same Spirit and the
[761.7s] same principles that we use to bring to
[763.6s] labor should be the same spirit that we
[765.9s] bring to our whole entire life it is not
[769.0s] just in the daily work but in the
[771.8s] spiritual work as well MH our world has
[774.7s] this currency of work smart and not work
[777.1s] hard M but the issue with this is that
[781.5s] we often look for the easy way out right
[784.3s] we seek the easy task but seeking the
[787.4s] easy task doesn't necessarily mean
[789.7s] reaping the best results working hard is
[793.3s] calling every single power your mind
[795.8s] your heart your soul to your specific
[798.1s] work for the sake of Christ I'd like to
[802.0s] ask my panelists here any parting shorts
[805.4s] things that you have learned
[806.5s] significantly from the chapter that I
[808.4s] didn't quite touch on that you would
[810.1s] like to let our audience know as well
[813.2s] starting from
[814.5s] Brenda um something I think tribulation
[819.3s] when you talked about tribulations that
[821.3s] we face as Christians when we're
[822.8s] developing our Christian character and
[825.4s] um I'll just read a a verse real quick
[828.1s] from uh Romans 12 verse 12 and it says
[834.1s] rejoicing in Hope patience in
[835.9s] tribulations continuing steadfastly in
[838.6s] prayer and this brought out how if us as
[842.0s] Christians can't develop our our
[845.0s] character through tribulations that we
[846.9s] face opposition we wouldn't be close to
[849.8s] God we wouldn't look for him cuz when
[852.2s] you are in a constant need of of help
[855.6s] from him when you're confused and you're
[857.7s] you're facing people who are going
[859.0s] against you you get tired mentally
[861.0s] spiritually and that's when you go to
[862.8s] look for Christ when when Jesus was
[865.1s] about to be crucified he went into
[867.0s] prayer to talk to his heavenly father
[868.6s] because he needed it and it's the same
[870.9s] with us as Christians as we try to
[873.5s] develop a Christian character like him
[876.0s] we need to go and search for God get
[879.7s] peace from him so through tribulations
[883.1s] we are able to be closer to him and
[885.3s] being closer to him helps us develop our
[887.3s] character amen absolutely we'll hear
[889.9s] from
[890.8s] Amy well I think everything I would have
[894.9s] talked about was covered really really
[897.6s] nicely yeah okay okay um teacher
[901.2s] Nico yes I believe that the most
[904.4s] important thing which I saw is we need
[907.0s] to be ready when duty calls us to do
[911.1s] something for God and secondly second
[914.6s] Corinthians 5:14 says it's the love of
[918.4s] Christ that constrains us when we have
[922.0s] the love of Christ in our hearts
[924.3s] developing the Christian character will
[926.8s] not be a burden but a blessing
[929.8s] we'll do it because we love God not
[932.9s] because we have to do it and then you'll
[935.5s] stop measuring your work by hours you'll
[938.2s] be working because you understand the
[940.5s] effect of your work and you'll be
[942.3s] working because you know what it means
[945.2s] to bring souls to God absolutely and one
[949.0s] final thing just like teacher niiko said
[951.5s] actually there's a picture representing
[953.7s] a bulock standing between a plow and an
[956.4s] altar with the inscription ready for
[960.0s] either ready to toil in The Farrow or to
[963.2s] be offered on the altar of sacrifice
[966.4s] this is the position of the true child
[968.7s] of God willing to go where duty calls to
[971.9s] deny self to sacrifice for the
[974.4s] redeemer's cause are you ready for
[979.0s] either Amy please pray for us let's
[982.2s] believe and pray dear heavenly father we
[985.0s] come before this day we thank you for
[986.8s] allowing us to come and to discuss
[989.6s] Chapter 3 of this book I pray that
[992.3s] whatever we have gone through may help
[995.1s] not just us but all those watching and
[998.0s] that it may have this effect and help us
[1001.6s] change and grow and to be more like
[1003.8s] Christ I pray that you may keep on
[1005.8s] keeping us and that you may protect us
[1007.6s] even as we continue with our own lives
[1010.0s] um I pray this prayer believing and
[1011.2s] trusting in Jesus name amen
[1013.8s] amen thank you for joining us today uh
