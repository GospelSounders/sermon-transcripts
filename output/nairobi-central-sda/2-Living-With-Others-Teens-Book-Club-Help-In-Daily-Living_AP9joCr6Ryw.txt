FULL TRANSCRIPT:
hello to you all thank you for joining us once more for the Teens book club review of the book help in daily living in chapter one we covered everyday living and this talked about how we should live our lives individually today we are going to talk about living with others how should we interact and relate with the people who are around us and to help me cover this will be my Lively lovely panelists that like to start from my extreme right and then we can go in that order and please introduce yourself and uh subira immediately after the introduction you can give us the opening pray okay hi I'm Silas hi everyone my name is Brenda Maya hi my name is sair kundi I'm a member of teens class and I'm happy to be here hi my name is Amanda Galu and my name is Niko opio I'll be the moderator for today okay let us pray dear heavenly father God thank you so much for this wonderful book that has allowed us to read and dig deep into your word we know that the ultimate source of Truth is the word the Bible but as well you have inspired other people to write things and messages that tied back to the truth I pray Lord as truth Seekers that we may encourage our audience here and our wonderful panelists to continue to seek truth and in this way we may learn more and more about you in Jesus name I pray and believe amen amen amen thank you living with others this is something that all of us need because God did not build us to be like hits or to live individually we are born into families that are composed of individuals and the first people that we ever have to interact with are our own family members then we also need to interact with people around us and if you're lucky you get married and you now have to even interact with your wife and that different Social Circles like church school work that we have to interact with people so how do we do this I'd like Silas to give us a brief summary of what the chapter talks about this is chapter 2 of help in daily living okay so this chapter is talking about uh living with others as we have said and uh L G white says that we should learn to exercise self control forbearance sympathy in our daily life yeah and we should try and relate to others in their situations they are in put ourselves in those in their shoes to be able to to at least relate to them and what we would do in that situation for us to be able to advise them effectively and uh she also talks about forbear parents and wrong yes and uh we can and she says we cannot afford to let our Spirits Chef over any real or supposed wrong done to ourselves self is the enemy we need to fear no form of Vice has more bful effect upon the character than has human passion not under the control of the Holy Spirit no other Victory can we gain will be so precious as the victory gained over self so we can see that as the passion we have for things is should be should be influenced by the Holy Spirit and uh we should learn to die to self daily yes and I'll read a a text here it says Thou Hast cast men to ride over our heads he went we went Through Fire and through water but through thou broughtest us into wealth into a wealthy place that is under the same topic and uh when someone does something wrong to you and you feel you feel wronged or yeah you feel unhappy about it you're supposed to to in the way you react you're supposed to think of what Jesus would do in such a situation not just uh what you're thinking about or acting on impulse which brings us to the little things and cuty yeah importance of little things which are the sacrifices of our daily lives the little things are what adds up to the achievement we have and learning to sacrifice in Greater ways yes so I'll ask subira question how important are little things to you how important are little things to me okay so as you said the first aspect is sacrifice I think it's a matter of sacrifice and a matter of temptation as well and so in regards to sacrifices just the idea that our Christian Life does not have to have great big sacrifices but even in the little things that we do that attests to our faith right and so we view Faith sort of this as a school of our livelihood and it means that we can also go through Temptations as well and so LG white says that it is through our failure to endure the tests that come to us in little things that the habits are molded that the character is misshaped as well but when the greater tests come they usually find us unready I think what I get from this is that the Giants of today should help us fight the Giants of Tomorrow the battles of today should help us fight the battles of tomorrow and so in this school of our livelihood enduring the little tests that God presents to us builds us and prunes us for a greater battle ahead and I think the word even talks about how God will not give us something that we can't manage or we can't handle but ultimately we still have to grow we still have to progress to the next level and so I would encourage viewers and even our fellow fellow panelists we are all part of this maturing Faith as we mature in our faith it means having to go through tribulation but this is for a moment of refinement I think I remember Brenda speaking about like a refining glass and so as we are refined and gone through trial and Temptation we become better students of Faith yes amen amen okay I think yeah it's a good way to take it and also the small things we learn to sacrifice today is what helps us to be able to sacrifice big things tomorrow yes which helps us gain experience Amy how hard is it for you to exercise sympathy and self-control in your daily life okay so before reading this book um I always had this mentality of whatever I feel like is right is always right but Ellen in this book talks about how we come from different backgrounds and different environments and we have all been raised differently and I think it's extremely important to try and view other people's opinions from where they're standing and um just like you've also said um we're uh yeah we cannot afford to let our Spirits shave over any real supposed wrong done to ourselves so um essentially don't don't let yourself be be swayed um because of your emotions or you know all that kinds of stuff and essentially what I get is that once you see yourself from other people's perspectives it becomes a lot easier for you to to to sort of have sympathy and empathy and um essentially not get too upset over the way they think yeah I mean me I kind of have a thank you so much Amy like a caveat to that maybe um I think as sdas or even just Christians right we hold things as truth and there's so many truths that we have in our lives and that's unchangeable like you're not going to mess with the beliefs about Christ right cuz that's true that's absolute and sometimes people view that as judgment like simply stating a truth can be viewed as oh are you judging me what are you trying to say but I think yes I think in intellectual discourse there's room for um dialogue and perspective but sometimes stating a truth is not always combative and sometimes in a world truth can be viewed as controversial but that's not necessarily a problem of self but a problem of other people being receptive to that truth yeah makes sense okay yeah and uh when we are first with influence that leads us as leads us away from the right path how can we stay steadfast and not be led astray Brenda uh my answer for this is is one thing self discipline and this is this is a tough one guys self- discipline is a very hard thing to develop especially as a Christian cuz the discipline you're trying to form as a Christian is that which reflects Christ right and um especially when you're being infu influenced to go astray from what you believe what uh morals you've been raised by or what you how you act towards people when you've been influenced by the people around you to act a certainly that just goes against how you are as a Christian self-discipline is the is the biggest thing that could save you honestly and um when I was reading through the book there was a there's a line here that says when you go through such issues yeah you need to study carefully the Divine human character and constantly inquire what would Jesus do if he were in my place right and that's the reason Jesus came and died became a human for 33 years cuz he needed to become a human who went through everything we went through so he could be the perfect example for us so every time we are in a situation where we're being led astray from the the right thing to do or act we need to ask what would have Jesus done cuz he did live enough and did go through everything we went through so we need to constantly ask ourselves what would Jesus do and also form the discipline to do what he did oh yeah like tie back to home like maybe you know as teams we're always like presented with so many trends like Tik Tok Instagram all these things and we want to be like these influencers because they Persona is you know aesthetic and high life and we want that right I don't know if you guys empathize with that well well but um I think as Christians it's also calls us to be more watchful of the times because if we're aware of the time that we're in we don't become easily swept away I think there's some people who you you not quite aware like okay this translates to a Biblical truth such that you just wonder right what do you guys think about like a flood that blows of the wind I think in this same chapter it actually says we should always let principle guide so we should always have the principles in our life right in such a manner that if you face to the decision you'll always fall back to the principle to avoid getting sweed anyway it's important for us as teens to actually use principles so it's actually a challenge for us to develop guiding principles in our lives to avoid getting swept away absolutely yeah that is a principle over impulse where you where you make your decisions based on what you know is right and what you sure about and then uh what you feel like comes after yes okay I think it's a kind of weird statement I'm so sorry but um we should become Disciples of discipline so that dis it doesn't discipline us does that make sense like we don't cuz the world can discipline us dis discipline us for sure and so our job is let us be more in line and more in check so that we're not disciplined along the way yeah I think that's a good way to think about it okay and uh my last question is uh to youo which is how hard is it for you to sacrifice your time your money your resources for others yeah that's a that's a deep and personal question uh but yeah I'd say sometimes it's hard and sometimes it's easy um I'd say it's harder for me to sacrifice to give something to a stranger than for me to give it to my family member so for example if it's my family member it will be much easier to sacrifice something for them but when a stranger comes to me and asks me for something I'll have more questions than probably give out my time my money my resources so I think for me mostly what happens is when I think about how Christ dealt with people I look at it that he actually wanted to build a relationship with them because sometimes you may give to a cause to the point that you don't even know why you're giving to that cause but you just give to the same so for me I personally like understanding what I'm doing first before actually going to go ahead and do it so I'd say for me it's relative but it depends on the circumstance I am happy to give when I understand the cause but if there's no Clarity on what I'm giving towards or sacrificing for then it's something that is very hard for me to do because I wouldn't be acting a good part as a Christian yeah yeah okay so this chapter is talking about us what we need to do to be able to live happily and in harmony with the people around us it could be our family it could be yeah people we care about and many others so I hope that after this you will go and read the book not just this chapter but the previous one and the ones to come back ones to come yes thank you thank you so thank you so much for joining us even throughout the discussion of this chapter titled living with others remember the book is help in daily living and that's what we've been covering if you don't have it we are covering the third chapter from last in the book Ministry of healing please tune in next week for the chapter titled developing Christian character and thank you so much for the panelists who have shared and the thoughts that you shared we pray that this message will be be a blessing to you I'd like to invite Amy to give us a closing prayer let's believe and pray our dear heavenly father we come before you this day we thank you for allowing us to be here to come and discuss your word um discuss this book help in daily living I pray that whatever we have discussed may have a great impact on our lives and the lives of others and um I pray that when time comes or when Jesus comes again we will be in heaven I pray this prayer believing and trusting in Jesus name amen amen

TIMESTAMPED TRANSCRIPT:
[0.1s] hello to you all thank you for joining
[2.5s] us once more for the Teens book club
[5.2s] review of the book help in daily living
[9.2s] in chapter one we covered everyday
[11.7s] living and this talked about how we
[13.4s] should live our lives individually today
[16.2s] we are going to talk about living with
[18.7s] others how should we interact and relate
[21.2s] with the people who are around us and to
[24.3s] help me cover this will be my Lively
[26.8s] lovely panelists that like to start from
[29.1s] my extreme right and then we can go in
[31.7s] that order and please introduce yourself
[34.0s] and uh subira immediately after the
[35.8s] introduction you can give us the opening
[38.4s] pray okay hi I'm Silas hi everyone my
[43.3s] name is Brenda Maya hi my name is sair
[46.6s] kundi I'm a member of teens class and
[48.3s] I'm happy to be here hi my name is
[50.6s] Amanda Galu and my name is Niko opio
[54.3s] I'll be the moderator for today okay let
[57.1s] us pray dear heavenly father God thank
[59.6s] you so much for this wonderful book that
[62.0s] has allowed us to read and dig deep into
[64.9s] your word we know that the ultimate
[67.4s] source of Truth is the word the Bible
[70.5s] but as well you have inspired other
[73.1s] people to write things and messages that
[75.6s] tied back to the truth I pray Lord as
[78.9s] truth Seekers that we may encourage our
[80.6s] audience here and our wonderful
[82.3s] panelists to continue to seek truth and
[84.8s] in this way we may learn more and more
[87.0s] about you in Jesus name I pray and
[88.8s] believe amen amen amen thank you living
[93.7s] with others this is something that all
[96.6s] of us need because God did not build us
[99.7s] to be like hits or to live individually
[102.5s] we are born into families that are
[104.4s] composed of individuals and the first
[106.8s] people that we ever have to interact
[108.6s] with are our own family members then we
[111.7s] also need to interact with people around
[114.3s] us and if you're lucky you get married
[116.7s] and you now have to even interact with
[118.8s] your wife and that different Social
[120.7s] Circles like church school work that we
[124.3s] have to interact with people so how do
[126.8s] we do this I'd like Silas to give us a
[130.2s] brief summary of what the chapter talks
[132.4s] about this is chapter 2 of help in daily
[135.6s] living okay so this chapter is talking
[138.6s] about uh living with others as we have
[142.4s] said and uh L G white says that we
[146.6s] should learn
[148.1s] to exercise self control
[151.2s] forbearance sympathy in our daily
[154.7s] life yeah and we should try and relate
[158.0s] to others in their situations they are
[161.0s] in put ourselves in those in their shoes
[163.4s] to be able to to at least relate to them
[167.2s] and what we would do in that situation
[170.0s] for us to be able to advise them
[171.9s] effectively and
[175.9s] uh she also talks about forbear parents
[180.2s] and wrong yes and uh we can and she says
[185.3s] we cannot afford to let our Spirits Chef
[188.2s] over any real or supposed wrong done to
[191.4s] ourselves self is the enemy we need to
[195.4s] fear no form of Vice has more bful
[200.0s] effect upon the character than has human
[203.2s] passion not under the control of the
[205.6s] Holy Spirit no other Victory can we gain
[209.8s] will be so precious as the victory
[211.6s] gained over self so we can see that
[215.6s] as the passion we have for things is
[219.8s] should be should be influenced by the
[223.1s] Holy Spirit and uh we should learn to
[227.3s] die to self
[229.3s] daily yes and I'll read a a text here it
[234.4s] says Thou Hast cast men to ride over our
[238.0s] heads he went we went
[241.2s] Through Fire and through water but
[243.7s] through thou broughtest us into wealth
[246.8s] into a wealthy place that is under the
[249.8s] same topic and
[253.2s] uh when someone does something wrong to
[255.9s] you
[256.8s] and you
[258.6s] feel you feel wronged or yeah you feel
[263.2s] unhappy about it you're supposed
[265.9s] to
[267.5s] to in the way you react you're supposed
[270.2s] to think of what Jesus would do in such
[272.8s] a situation not just uh what you're
[276.3s] thinking about or acting on impulse
[278.7s] which brings us to the little things and
[285.0s] cuty yeah importance of little things
[288.3s] which are the sacrifices of our daily
[292.3s] lives the little things are what adds up
[294.9s] to
[296.6s] the achievement we have and learning to
[300.7s] sacrifice in Greater ways yes so I'll
[307.5s] ask subira question how important are
[311.8s] little things to you how important are
[314.8s] little things to me okay so as you said
[318.2s] the first aspect is sacrifice I think
[321.0s] it's a matter of sacrifice and a matter
[322.5s] of temptation as well and so in regards
[325.0s] to sacrifices just the idea that our
[328.0s] Christian Life does not have to have
[330.0s] great big
[332.2s] sacrifices but even in the little things
[335.0s] that we do that attests to our faith
[338.2s] right and so we view Faith sort of this
[341.2s] as a school of our livelihood and it
[345.0s] means that we can also go through
[347.0s] Temptations as well and so LG white says
[350.0s] that it is through our failure to endure
[352.4s] the tests that come to us in little
[356.3s] things that the habits are molded that
[359.3s] the character is misshaped as well but
[362.2s] when the greater tests come they usually
[364.8s] find us unready I think what I get from
[367.4s] this is that the Giants of today should
[370.0s] help us fight the Giants of Tomorrow the
[372.8s] battles of today should help us fight
[374.4s] the battles of tomorrow and so in this
[376.9s] school of our livelihood enduring the
[380.0s] little tests that God presents to us
[382.7s] builds us and prunes us for a greater
[386.2s] battle ahead and I think the word even
[388.7s] talks about how God will not give us
[390.6s] something that we can't manage or we
[392.9s] can't handle but ultimately we still
[396.5s] have to grow we still have to progress
[398.7s] to the next level and so I would
[401.0s] encourage viewers and even our fellow
[403.0s] fellow panelists we are all part of this
[405.8s] maturing Faith as we mature in our faith
[410.0s] it means having to go through
[412.1s] tribulation but this is for a moment of
[414.8s] refinement I think I remember Brenda
[417.0s] speaking about like a refining glass
[420.0s] and so as we are refined and gone
[422.9s] through trial and Temptation we become
[425.8s] better students of Faith yes amen amen
[430.7s] okay I think yeah it's a good way to
[433.0s] take it and also the small things we
[436.8s] learn to sacrifice today is what helps
[439.0s] us to be able to sacrifice big things
[441.8s] tomorrow yes which helps us gain
[445.0s] experience Amy how hard is it for you to
[448.1s] exercise sympathy and self-control in
[450.4s] your daily life okay so before reading
[453.5s] this book um I always had this
[457.4s] mentality
[459.7s] of whatever I feel like is right is
[463.0s] always right but Ellen in this book
[465.8s] talks about how we come from different
[468.7s] backgrounds and different environments
[470.3s] and we have all been raised differently
[472.5s] and I think it's extremely important to
[474.6s] try and view other people's opinions
[478.4s] from where they're
[480.5s] standing and um just like you've also
[484.5s] said um we're uh
[488.9s] yeah we cannot afford to let our Spirits
[492.1s] shave over any real supposed wrong done
[495.6s] to
[496.6s] ourselves so
[500.2s] um essentially don't don't let yourself
[505.0s] be be
[507.2s] swayed um because of your emotions
[511.5s] or you know all that kinds of stuff and
[515.5s] essentially what I get is
[519.1s] that once you see yourself from other
[522.0s] people's perspectives it becomes a lot
[523.9s] easier for you to to to sort of have
[528.4s] sympathy and empathy and um essentially
[532.8s] not get too
[534.7s] upset over the way they think yeah I
[539.3s] mean me I kind of have a thank you so
[541.1s] much Amy like a caveat to that maybe
[544.4s] um I think as sdas or even just
[547.2s] Christians right we hold things as truth
[551.4s] and there's so many truths that we have
[552.8s] in our lives and that's unchangeable
[555.1s] like you're not going to mess with the
[557.2s] beliefs about Christ right cuz that's
[560.4s] true that's absolute and sometimes
[562.5s] people view that as judgment like simply
[564.8s] stating a truth can be viewed as oh are
[567.2s] you judging me what are you trying to
[568.7s] say but I think yes I think in
[571.0s] intellectual discourse there's room for
[574.5s] um dialogue and perspective but
[577.8s] sometimes stating a truth is not always
[580.8s] combative and sometimes in a world truth
[583.9s] can be viewed as controversial but
[586.2s] that's not necessarily a problem of self
[588.8s] but a problem of other people being
[590.8s] receptive to that truth
[593.8s] yeah makes sense okay yeah and uh when
[598.6s] we are first with influence that leads
[601.2s] us as leads us away from the right path
[604.9s] how can we stay steadfast and not be led
[607.9s] astray
[609.3s] Brenda uh my answer for this is is one
[612.3s] thing self discipline and this is this
[615.4s] is a tough one guys self- discipline is
[617.2s] a very hard thing to develop especially
[619.5s] as a Christian cuz the discipline you're
[622.2s] trying to form as a Christian is that
[624.4s] which reflects Christ right and um
[630.9s] especially when you're being infu
[632.8s] influenced to go astray from what you
[635.3s] believe what uh morals you've been
[638.3s] raised by or what you how you act
[641.1s] towards people when you've been
[642.2s] influenced by the people around you to
[643.5s] act a certainly that just goes against
[645.7s] how you are as a Christian
[647.6s] self-discipline is the is the biggest
[649.6s] thing that could save you honestly and
[652.3s] um when I was reading through the book
[654.3s] there was a there's a line here that
[656.2s] says when you go through such issues
[658.6s] yeah you need to study carefully the
[660.4s] Divine human character and constantly
[663.0s] inquire what would Jesus do if he were
[665.6s] in my place right and that's the reason
[668.8s] Jesus came and died became a human for
[670.6s] 33 years cuz he needed to become a human
[674.4s] who went through everything we went
[675.9s] through so he could be the perfect
[677.8s] example for us so every time we are in a
[680.2s] situation where we're being led astray
[681.8s] from the the right thing to do or act we
[686.2s] need to ask what would have Jesus done
[687.9s] cuz he did live enough and did go
[689.7s] through everything we went through so we
[691.4s] need to constantly ask ourselves what
[693.3s] would Jesus do and also form the
[695.4s] discipline to do what he did oh yeah
[699.0s] like tie back to home like maybe you
[701.6s] know as teams we're always like
[704.1s] presented with so many trends like Tik
[706.3s] Tok Instagram all these things and we
[709.4s] want to be like these influencers
[712.0s] because they Persona is you know
[714.5s] aesthetic and high life and we want that
[716.8s] right I don't know if you guys empathize
[718.8s] with that well well but um I think as
[722.0s] Christians it's also calls us to be more
[725.1s] watchful of the times because if we're
[727.5s] aware of the time that we're in we don't
[730.3s] become easily swept away I think there's
[732.8s] some people who you you not quite aware
[736.0s] like okay this translates to a Biblical
[738.0s] truth such that you
[740.6s] just wonder right what do you guys think
[744.0s] about like a flood that blows of the
[746.9s] wind I think in this same chapter it
[749.5s] actually says we should always let
[751.4s] principle guide so we should always have
[754.2s] the principles in our life right in such
[756.6s] a manner that if you face to the
[758.9s] decision you'll always fall back to the
[761.6s] principle to avoid getting sweed anyway
[765.2s] it's important for us as teens to
[766.9s] actually use principles so it's actually
[769.5s] a challenge for us to develop guiding
[771.5s] principles in our lives to avoid getting
[773.8s] swept away
[776.3s] absolutely yeah that is a principle over
[780.0s] impulse where you where you make your
[783.2s] decisions based on what you know is
[786.3s] right and what you sure about and then
[789.6s] uh what you feel like comes
[794.1s] after yes okay I think it's a kind of
[798.0s] weird statement I'm so sorry but um we
[801.1s] should become Disciples of
[804.2s] discipline so that dis it doesn't
[807.1s] discipline us does that make sense like
[809.2s] we don't cuz the world can discipline us
[812.5s] dis discipline us for sure and so our
[815.2s] job is let us be more in line and more
[818.1s] in check so that we're not disciplined
[820.5s] along the way yeah I think that's a good
[822.9s] way to think about it okay and uh my
[825.4s] last question is uh to youo which is how
[830.0s] hard is it for you to sacrifice your
[833.5s] time your money your resources for
[836.3s] others
[839.4s] yeah that's a that's a deep and personal
[841.9s] question uh but yeah I'd say sometimes
[845.4s] it's hard and sometimes it's easy um I'd
[850.1s] say it's harder for me to sacrifice to
[852.6s] give something to a stranger than for me
[855.4s] to give it to my family member so for
[857.9s] example if it's my family member it will
[859.8s] be much easier to sacrifice something
[861.7s] for them but when a stranger comes to me
[864.8s] and asks me for something I'll have more
[867.1s] questions than probably give out my time
[869.6s] my money my resources so I think for me
[872.6s] mostly what happens is when I think
[875.2s] about how Christ dealt with people I
[878.1s] look at it that he actually wanted to
[880.0s] build a relationship with them because
[883.1s] sometimes you may give to a cause to the
[885.4s] point that you don't even know why
[886.8s] you're giving to that cause but you just
[889.8s] give to the same so for me I personally
[892.7s] like understanding what I'm doing first
[895.3s] before actually going to go ahead and do
[898.0s] it so I'd say for me it's relative but
[901.0s] it depends on the circumstance I am
[903.4s] happy to give when I understand the
[905.2s] cause but if there's no Clarity on what
[908.3s] I'm giving towards or sacrificing for
[911.2s] then it's something that is very hard
[912.8s] for me to do because I wouldn't be
[914.8s] acting a good part as a Christian
[919.9s] yeah yeah okay so this chapter is
[923.1s] talking about
[924.8s] us what we need to do to be able to live
[929.1s] happily and in harmony with the people
[931.8s] around us it could be our family it
[934.3s] could be yeah people we care about and
[938.4s] many others
[940.6s] so I hope that after this you will go
[944.0s] and read the book not just this chapter
[947.8s] but the previous one and the ones to
[951.2s] come back ones to come
