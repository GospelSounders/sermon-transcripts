all of us at his feet to be able to listen to him   and to hear him as he speaks to us today it is 
indeed a special special blessing on this fourth   Sabbath of October this is creation Sabbath 
that has been ongoing for the last 15 years   and um the SDA Church globally designates the 
fourth Sabbath of every October as a creation   Sabbath every fourth Sabbath of October is 
designated as a creation Sabbath so what   is creation Sabbath what is creation Sabbath now 
creation Sabbath is a special event where we post   and reflect on the wonders of life and nature 
recognizing God's sovereignity as the Creator   we acknowledge God as our creator on this day and 
take some time to reflect on the implications that   this Biblical teaching has for us it's a special 
day where we remind ourselves that Humanity   role as stewards of God's creation and the 
importance of caring for the environment a   special time of Celebration a chance to Rejoice to 
praise and rest with God as we enjoy the creation   he made this has been informed by the growing need 
to recognize God 's power and Grace as Creator   and Redeemer of the universe it is a profound 
opportunity where we reaffirm our beliefs as God   fearing Christians recognizing his Divine hand in 
the beauty and complexity of the natural world and   so this morning we've come to do number one pae 
and reflect acknowledge remind ourselves affirm   celebrate rejoice and praise Isaac wordss open the 
Bible one time in the Book of Genesis chapter 1   and as he was reading this the spirit of God spoke 
to him he got inspired and he panned down the the   the words you find in the song number 88 of SDA 
himnos it says I sing the mighty power of God that   made the mountains rise that spread the flowing 
Seas abroad and built the lofty skies I seeing   the wisdom that rained the sun through all the 
day and the moon shines full at God's command and   all the stars all of them obey second s say 
sing the goodness of the Lord who filled the   Earth with food he formed the creatures with his 
word and then he pronounced them they are good   Lord how thy wonders are displayed wherever I 
turn my eye if I survey the ground I Trend or   gaze upon the sky there's not a plant or flow 
below he continues but makes thy glories known   and clouds arise and Tempest blow blow by order 
from the throne creatures that borrow borrow life   from thee are subject to thy care he says there's 
not a place where we can flee but God is present   there you know the song I love it let's pray 
Heavenly Father we thank you for the privileg   to come and listen to your voice this morning your 
word is powerful your word is transformative and   heavenly father right now we'd want to open up 
our ears to listen to you as you speak to us we   pray that the word of God will come through to 
us unhindered the Lord you speak to your people   that we can leave this place having heard from our 
father having your way Holy Spirit hide me behind   the cross of Jesus there be nothing of Simon but 
you and you alone in Jesus name amen now I have   an assignment this morning God's people whereby my 
job is to make sure that in a very few minutes we   take some time to pause and reflect and affirm 
special Sabbath of creation to pae and reflect   reflect and affirm and maybe the questions which 
we the question which we need to ask ourselves   this morning is this why do we need to pause 
reflect and affirm more faith on the Biblical   teaching of creation Point number one the creation 
account found in the first three chapters of the   Book of Genesis is crucial for the understanding 
of the rest of the biblical record and of reality   in every story the beginning is very essential in 
every movie the beginning is very essential it is   the beginning the introduction of a story that 
provides the foundation for everything that will   follow this introduction serves as the foundation 
for the rest of the Bible I have a friend of mine   who who enjoys hearing stories and and he likes 
it well done and having a proper Foundation or a   proper introduction as you continue a very good 
close friend of mine and we meet sometimes and I   have a lot of stories and updates we have to to 
talk about and possibly tell each other and in   between I'll be quickly getting the nuder to the 
point summary and finishing and it'll be like no   no no no no no what kind of a story how how do you 
explain how do you give a story Simon and I'm like   hey you're getting the main point I said no no no 
no when you're telling a story you have to begin   with a proper Foundation introduce introduce and 
sometimes I I do joke and take advantage of that   sometimes I'll just make sure I begin the story 
up and down but in the same with all of us and   I believe that in every story in every movie the 
introduction is a foundation that which help us to   be able to understand the rest and to follow the 
rest of the story it is the same thing with the   word of God it is the same thing with the Bible 
I want to ask a question to every one of us this   morning do you love Jesus anybody in the house who 
love Jesus let me see your hand if you love Jesus   Oh Hallelujah do you love God's word say Amen if 
you do uhhuh has this word change your life say   Amen if you do believe so yes and therefore all 
the counil of God which we believe and embrace and   which has changed our lives that counil has its 
introduction and the introduction is and the Lord   said let there be let there be let there be that 
is a title for my someone this morning let there   be without the Genesis chapter 1 and to 3 the rest 
is a house made of cards or cast built with sand   on a seashore and your salvation and mine is in 
J without Genesis chapter 1 without chapter 2   without chapter 3 when God said let there be and 
there was Hallelujah Saints it is important to   realize that that God is presented as the basis 
of existence itself everything everything solely   exists because of him and thus God's existence is 
the foundation for all of the biblical worldview   everything that has a beginning has a cause they 
say that the Universe at a beginning and therefore   the universe too had a course Francis beckworth 
bewith wrote about that with his friends in a   article or possibly a world called a case for the 
Christian worldview where he say that everything   they believe has a beginning and has a cause and 
therefore the universe has a beginning it has a   cost without the Book of Genesis without chapter 
1 and two and three without the creation account   and the creation story we don't have the means to 
know the ca the only thing we could conclude it is   that this cause is an immaterial one since matter 
can't create matter and must exist beyond space   and time because all of these also were created 
therefore possibly we come to a conclusion we   say ah is the material and therefore Genesis 
chapter 1 and two and three becomes that basis   becomes that answer becomes that Foundation 
that gives us the CA and we believe that it   is an intelligent being behind it a God himself 
who spoke the world into existence Hallelujah   number two number two it is that it is important 
to post reflect and affirm because the beliefs   that we hold regarding our Origins they affect 
our picture of God of ourselves and consequently   even our relationship with him as Christians and 
as humans it is important to understand where we   come from Genesis 1: 26 Genesis 1 26 the Bible 
informs us that God made man made man into his   own image according to his likeness and he say 
let them have dominion over the fish of the sea   over the birds of the air and over the cattle 
let us make man in our own image and likeness   and the man was made into the likeness of God and 
the image of God it is through Genesis account   of creation that we understand that our purpose 
in life is to increasingly resemble the superior   model following a superior morality and trusting 
in a superior plan Hallelujah God's people it is   a belief that we hold regarding our Origins that 
also determines the quality of life we live and   the joy we derive from living somebody said in 
pen this there fulfillment in life happiness   and mental health is heavily heavily dependent 
on this belief we are not product of chances   we are not at the mercies of the elements we are 
not at the mercies of what you call the beggarly   elements of this life we we are we don't believe 
in fatalism that whatever will be will be I wake   up in the morning whatever will come my way it 
was supposed to come my way the way the evening   goes I possibly have no control over and it is in 
the hands of Fai there are people who believe in   what we call Faith whatever comes your way is 
supposed to come your way whatever you believe   whatever possibly happens to you what supposed to 
happen to you anyway we are not at the hands of   faith we are not at the hands of elements of this 
life we are at the hands of God our Father who   loves us so much Hallelujah God's people and this 
is the reason as to why we can sing the goodness   of the Lord this is why we can sing of him who 
created Heavens on the earth who spoke the world   into existence who is the reason for my being here 
today Hallelujah God's people I sing of that power   our fulfillment in life our happiness and mental 
health is heavily dependent on your source of reference belonging has always been a fundamental 
desire in each of us knowing that we play a part   into the big picture that we are significant 
that we are Loved These are ke ingredient I   to fulfillment that I know that I'm loved that 
I know that I'm significant having a space and   purpose is very necessary for your happiness and 
mental health knowing we were created and knowing   the way we were created it helps us to know 
ourselves better I was created and God formed   me this way that you are plant was planned we 
were part of God's plan and we still are we   have a place as well as a role within that place 
we have a home because God created it making sure   it was good and perfect before he put us there 
we have food and oxygen because God planted   grains trees and bushes fruit bearing plants to 
sustain our health we have a job because God gave   us a dominion over the Earth and all living things 
on it you are want you are wanted you are pled you   are cared for you are provided for and you are 
designed with a purpose through Jesus Christ you   have life it is the Millennials that believe in 
the genes possibly boring from Hollywood you know   where this this phrase this funny phrase they tell 
each other when they get get angry go go get life   go go get yourself a life you know go get a life 
possibly when they're angry or something like that   but you know something God's children we do have 
life and we have gotten that life through Jesus   Christ and that life started at the very origin 
of the earth we didn't just happen it could be   possible that possibly you may say Pastor was 
not plann my parents got me out of woodlock I   came to this world without people planning for 
me without folks thinking about me but let me   tell you something this morning the word of God 
reminds you and me that you are planned by God   you were provided for from the beginning of time 
you are designed with a purpose and through Jesus   Christ you have life there's nothing like unwanted 
for the heavenly father Hallelujah everybody was   planned for by the heavenly father all of us are 
wanted it was done at the beginning of it at the   origin of life in our daily lives today we can 
live a life of gratitude toward our savior and   Creator even though in Genesis chapter 3 we 
find that sin came into this world through   what we call the free choice or God is so good but 
even though in chapter 3 we see we see sin coming   into a world we also remind The Book of Job 19:25 
where despite of sin coming into this world and   Maring the Perfection and destroying that which 
was perfect that which God created to be holy and   beautiful and perfect then he comes and know that 
he says that I know that my redeemer lives job   speaks and says this and the last he will stand 
upon the Earth My Redeemer Lives it's in Genesis   that we get to remember that even though sin came 
into the world and even so it even even though it   mer in per the Perfection and the beauty and the 
Harmony and all that God had made he has a plan   to be able to restore it back my redeemer lives my 
redeemer lives and in the end he will stand upon   the Earth that he also created for us you know we 
have to allow God's children our world view to be   shaped by God's holy word we're living in times 
whereby the world is filled with a wide spectrum   of beliefs and positions regarding our Origins 
we need a world view that it's not shaped by   the world that is not shaped by human philosophies 
that is not shaped by humanism that is not shaped   by all this ISM fatalism and everything else 
we need a world view that is shaped by the word   of God hallelujah and not others regarding our 
origin and therefore we must be intentional about   spending time like we're doing today reflecting 
on creation reflecting on creation account of   Genesis chapter 1 and chapter 2 and maybe in 
our lives in our devotions and meditations we   could also see the words of Genesis chapter 1 and 
chapter 2 in the Book of Psalms 104 Psalms 104   where the psalmist psalmist painted differently 
he was a musician he was an artist he he wrote   it he put it in a very different way it is Genesis 
chapter 1 but he wrote in a musical format a very   language Psalms 104 let me mention some few 
verses begin from vers one praise the Lord my   soul Psalms 104 Psalm 104 from: 1 to begin with 
that one praise the Lord oh my soul Lord my God   you are very great you are clothed with Splendor 
and Majesty the Lord wraps himself in light as   with a garment he stretches out the heavens like 
a tent and lays the beam of his upper chambers   on their Waters vers three he makes the clouds his 
chariot he rides on the wings of the wind he makes   winds his Messengers flames of fire his servant 
vers five he set the foundation the foundations   it can never be moved can you please say amen for 
that he set the Earth on its foundations it can   never be moved six you covered it with water dep 
with a garment the water stood above the Mountain   Seven but at your rebuke the waters fled at the 
sound of your thunder they took flight they flowed   over the mountains they went down The Valleys to 
the place you assigned for them vers 9 you set a   boundary they cannot cross never again will they 
cover the Earth the sist painting Genesis chapter   1 24 how many are your works oh Lord a question 
and exclamation in wisdom you made them all here   answers the Earth is full of your creatures 
there there is a sea vast and spacious teing   with creatures Beyond number leaving uh things 
both large and small All Creatures look to you   to give them food at the proper time when you 
give it to them they gather it up Hallelujah   31 31 31 it says may the glory of the Lord endure 
forever may the Lord rejoice in his Works he who   looks at the Earth and he trembles who touches 
the mountains and the smoke 33 I will sing to   the Lord all my life I will sing praises to my 
God as long as I live my meditation be pleasing   to him as I rejoice in the Lord I besee you to 
go home in the evening and take Psalms 104 and   try to go through it and think about those words 
and reflect upon them and Med upon them there is   power there is power there is power in this word 
it changes a perspective it affirms Us in the Book   of John chapter 1 genes say again an account 
be put in few words here summary in very few   words John chapter one in the beginning was the 
word and the Word was with God and the Word was   God he was with God in the beginning through him 
all things were made without him nothing was made   that has been made in him was life and that life 
was the light of all mankind the light shines in   the darkness Hallelujah and the Darkness has no 
power to overcome it I love this I love it yes   Genesis account painted in the words of John the 
servant of the Lord in the Book of John chapter   1 I am confident I am purposeful I am meaningful 
and so you are knowing that an intelligent being   is behind my existence and your existence the 
omnipotent omnipresent omnicient loving caring   Heavenly Father somebody say Amen when he informs 
us when forms my breath the breath that I take and   it becomes the reference to the days I live under 
the sun everything arounds me takes shape and   assumes texture and he gives a sweet ious taste 
the life is worth a living just because he lives   number three number three number three on this 
special Sabbath we also have a calling from our   heavenly father where he calls us to remember 
what we call creation stewardship creation stewardship I am very blessed and I praise God 
because I'm a Kenyan Hallelujah I love Jesus   I'm a Child of God but I'm a Kenyan too Hallelujah 
and in Kenya it is a beautiful country I've seen   other beautiful countries in the world but 
here we have a very beautiful country H and   and sometimes we do not appreciate what we have 
with us here people pay thousands of US dollars   to travel and please you're welcome I know we have 
online audiences from all over the world you can   come and visit as well uh they they pay thousands 
of amount of US dollars to come and visit and see   not only the land landscape landscapes of Kenya 
but also the animals the worldlife about several   years ago maybe over 10 years ago had a chance of 
getting into one of our national parks Lake naku   National Park and I was with another Elder and 
another pastor with us in the vehicle and as we   were driving inside the national park some of you 
have been there already I know you've been there   you know the place very well From a Distance on 
the other side of the of the lake I we saw three   giraffes that are standing and it was morning 
hours you know we were possibly among the first   ones and some few other tourists we could see some 
few other vehicles in the national park and so we   told the ELD please let's rush let's go towards 
that place it was possibly over a kilometer inside   the park it's beautiful it's beautiful and so we 
drove fast we rushed through we took some Corners   you know in those roads inside there the creation 
beautiful trees and Flor and FAA and touch it just   National Park we just drove and finally we 
just arrived when this tall amazing creature   I have never seen something so Grand was just 
feeding maybe breakfast I don't know one of   the tallest aesia trees in the National Park I 
believe it's aesia tree hopefully I don't get it   wrong zoologist and botanist and he was standing 
comfortably feeding on the top leaves of one of   the tallest giant accasia trees in the national 
park and so we came when he just shifted and moved   his hand his legs its legs and it h legs and the 
back legs sorry were right next to the road where   we were driving it so we came and parked right 
behind it and it happened that I was at the   window facing this long huge amazing leg a tower 
of a leg putting my Palms together can't hold it   together and it's standing so tall and I look 
at the patterns in the body I look at the the   color of the hle or the skin I look at the hair 
I look at everything I look at the prints and   and and and the sheer size of the hoof and I 
tried to look up and it is not Disturbed it   is busy feeding taking it just moves a bit with 
Grace awesomeness and in that moment I was taken   over I began to swallow and take it in slowly we 
all kept quiet in the car and before the other   tourists could come and feel the plac and around 
this big tall male giraffe I don't know whether   he's still alive I don't know whether it's the 
breed is still there we had our time I I was   carried away for a moment and I was about to begin 
a worship because what I so was so amazing that it   took my breath but then the Lord reminded me it 
is not the creature it is me the Creator behind   that which you see Hallelujah and I couldn't help 
but began to sing that song I sing the goodness   of God I sing the mighty power I began to harm 
it and before you know in the car we all began   to sing it and the other three two giraff 
came around closer and more people before   we knew five six Vehicles were around us all of 
them watching at this beauty we have blessings   and Gifts in our country and around us 
which maybe maybe we don't even take a   moment to realize and appreciate Genesis 1:28 
God says God blessed them and said to them be   fruitful an increase in number fill the Earth 
and subdue it rule over the fish in the sea and   the birds in the sky and over every every living 
creature that moves on the ground Genesis 1 and:   28 God blessed them and he gave them the power to 
be fruitful and increase and beyond that beyond   that to subdue the Earth and rule over the fish 
in the sea and the birds in the sky do you have   you ever Sat one day and realized that animals 
work for you the dogs will listen to you and   just love you and be there for you but the cats 
in the house just love it when you are there and   maybe when you move out you can't find them any 
longer have we ever set one day to think about it   it is not the animals controlling us it is not the 
animals using us for their labor and for the work   and everything it is actually us beyond that man 
was given power to speak to River and make Rivers   shift man was given power to work with creation 
and change do things here for for his own good   and for his own existence as the bearer of the 
image of God human beings should reflect then his   character in the treatment and care of all those 
resources and all those blessings that we have   been given freely by Our Father Hallelujah church 
and as God's church and as God's people we have an   obligation from the Lord we have a responsibility 
of what we call creation stewardship are you a   good Steward of God's creation as a Church 
of God forget about individually as a person   because I could talk about making sure that 
we handle the Refuge well we struggle that   a bit in our country and the roads are clean 
everything else but what about us as a church the resources created by God should be used wisely 
the resources given to us by God should be used   without selfishness there should be no tyranny or 
violence or abuse of power it should not be found   among those who love the Lord and who reflect 
God's character and this means that we have to use   all the natures resources that God has given to 
us for good use using them wisely and cautiously   with the intent of promoting the well-being of 
all Hallelujah church we have responsibility   to keep the world beautiful in order we have a 
responsibility to be good stewards of the natural   resources and blessings God has given to us today 
in conclusion I want to finish Us by doing a   reaffirmation this morning Romans 8: 19: 19 it 
says for the creation then awaits with earnest   expectation the verse which was read to us this 
morning kext Romans 8:19 for the creation Waits   with Earnest expectation for the manifestation of 
the sons of God the first five days of the week   God made God made the made the man the man's home 
or habitant and when he woke up from God's hands   he found that everything was beautiful holy formed 
complete habitat with functional ecosystems sin   came and the Cur of sin came and destroyed even 
our ecosystem because of it it was cast you know   the Bible says so then we reminded this morning 
that the creation in that verse the Greek words   means the nature both in animate and animate rocks 
and trees and flowers and cats and dogs they are   in honest expectation they are watching with the 
head erect or out stretched awaiting in suspense   the Greek connotation for that as straining 
forward with outstretched hand just as we might   imagine the crowds outside a race course straining 
over the ropes to catch a sight of the runners   an eager intent expectation the creation is in 
eager intent in eager expectation for the for the   manifestation Revelation which is simply saying 
the glory which shall be revealed and one is that   it talks about par paria the coming of Christ 
which is to be accompanied by an appearance   of the redeemed in glorified form I love the 
book of 1 Corinthians 15:35 1 Corinthians 15   5355 it says for this Incorruptible must put 
on incorruptible for this Mortal M must put on   immortality Hallelujah the manifestation of the 
children of God in glorified bodies the creation   is yearning and eagerly waiting when Jesus 
comes because he's coming again in glory   Hallelujah church and at that point we saying 
the creation is longing eagerly when we all shall   be restored when God shall recreate and there 
shall be another let it be let it be let it be   and it shall become in the name of Jesus Christ 
amen amen I'm done preaching I'm done preaching   now I want to invite Brenda here I want us to 
do a quick responsive ly for a few minutes to   affirm that which we believe there's going to 
be some reading projected there on the screen   and the church sh shall have a part where we 
respond and we also leading that so please   communication team let us have that one there it's 
a responsive litany about the creative word of God so there should be a leader leading 
reading and then the congregation shall   be able to have a certifying word that goes with that okay the created word of God in the beginning 
God created heaven and the Earth and the Earth   was without form and void and darkness was upon 
the face of the deep and the con should be able   to see say and it was if it were not so I would 
have told you let me hear you say and it was and   it were not so I would have told you if it were 
not so I would have told you ah we're going to do   about three verses because over time then we be 
good to go first one I'm going to read then you   respond to that and it was if you were not so 
I would have told you I begin in the beginning   God created the Heaven and the Earth and the 
Earth was without form and void and darkness   was upon the face of the deep and the spirit of 
God moved upon the face of the waters let's say   it and it was so if it were not so I would have 
told you and God said let there be light and there   was light and God saw the light that it was good 
and God divided the light from the darkness and   God called the light day and the Darkness he 
called night and the evening and the morning   were the first day and it was so it were not so 
I would have told you and God said there will   be a forment in the midst of the waters and let it 
divide the waters from the waters and God made the   firmament and divided the waters which were under 
the firmament from the waters which were above   the forment and it was so and God called forment 
Heaven and the evening and the morning were the   second day and it was so if it were not so so I 
would have told you amen amen God bless us this   morning and I hope that we get to post reflect and 
affirm what this means to us in Jesus name amen

account found in the first three chapters of the  
[383.0s] Book of Genesis is crucial for the understanding 
of the rest of the biblical record and of reality  
[392.7s] in every story the beginning is very essential in 
every movie the beginning is very essential it is  
[403.4s] the beginning the introduction of a story that 
provides the foundation for everything that will  
[411.0s] follow this introduction serves as the foundation 
for the rest of the Bible I have a friend of mine  
[419.0s] who who enjoys hearing stories and and he likes 
it well done and having a proper Foundation or a  
[428.8s] proper introduction as you continue a very good 
close friend of mine and we meet sometimes and I  
[435.6s] have a lot of stories and updates we have to to 
talk about and possibly tell each other and in  
[441.7s] between I'll be quickly getting the nuder to the 
point summary and finishing and it'll be like no  
[446.6s] no no no no no what kind of a story how how do you 
explain how do you give a story Simon and I'm like  
[453.3s] hey you're getting the main point I said no no no 
no when you're telling a story you have to begin  
[458.7s] with a proper Foundation introduce introduce and 
sometimes I I do joke and take advantage of that  
[466.2s] sometimes I'll just make sure I begin the story 
up and down but in the same with all of us and  
[473.2s] I believe that in every story in every movie the 
introduction is a foundation that which help us to  
[485.1s] be able to understand the rest and to follow the 
rest of the story it is the same thing with the  
[492.4s] word of God it is the same thing with the Bible 
I want to ask a question to every one of us this  
[498.3s] morning do you love Jesus anybody in the house who 
love Jesus let me see your hand if you love Jesus  
[503.5s] Oh Hallelujah do you love God's word say Amen if 
you do uhhuh has this word change your life say  
[511.4s] Amen if you do believe so yes and therefore all 
the counil of God which we believe and embrace and  
[521.8s] which has changed our lives that counil has its 
introduction and the introduction is and the Lord  
[531.7s] said let there be let there be let there be that 
is a title for my someone this morning let there  
[540.7s] be without the Genesis chapter 1 and to 3 the rest 
is a house made of cards or cast built with sand  
[549.8s] on a seashore and your salvation and mine is in 
J without Genesis chapter 1 without chapter 2  
[561.1s] without chapter 3 when God said let there be and 
there was Hallelujah Saints it is important to  
[571.0s] realize that that God is presented as the basis 
of existence itself everything everything solely  
[583.6s] exists because of him and thus God's existence is 
the foundation for all of the biblical worldview  
[592.3s] everything that has a beginning has a cause they 
say that the Universe at a beginning and therefore  
[599.6s] the universe too had a course Francis beckworth 
bewith wrote about that with his friends in a  
[606.9s] article or possibly a world called a case for the 
Christian worldview where he say that everything  
[611.9s] they believe has a beginning and has a cause and 
therefore the universe has a beginning it has a  
[617.7s] cost without the Book of Genesis without chapter 
1 and two and three without the creation account  
[627.7s] and the creation story we don't have the means to 
know the ca the only thing we could conclude it is  
[637.1s] that this cause is an immaterial one since matter 
can't create matter and must exist beyond space  
[645.0s] and time because all of these also were created 
therefore possibly we come to a conclusion we  
[651.7s] say ah is the material and therefore Genesis 
chapter 1 and two and three becomes that basis  
[665.1s] becomes that answer becomes that Foundation 
that gives us the CA and we believe that it  
[672.8s] is an intelligent being behind it a God himself 
who spoke the world into existence Hallelujah  
[683.3s] number two number two it is that it is important 
to post reflect and affirm because the beliefs  
[693.1s] that we hold regarding our Origins they affect 
our picture of God of ourselves and consequently  
[703.4s] even our relationship with him as Christians and 
as humans it is important to understand where we  
[715.1s] come from Genesis 1: 26 Genesis 1 26 the Bible 
informs us that God made man made man into his  
[725.4s] own image according to his likeness and he say 
let them have dominion over the fish of the sea  
[731.6s] over the birds of the air and over the cattle 
let us make man in our own image and likeness  
[739.0s] and the man was made into the likeness of God and 
the image of God it is through Genesis account  
[749.5s] of creation that we understand that our purpose 
in life is to increasingly resemble the superior  
[759.4s] model following a superior morality and trusting 
in a superior plan Hallelujah God's people it is  
[767.6s] a belief that we hold regarding our Origins that 
also determines the quality of life we live and  
[777.6s] the joy we derive from living somebody said in 
pen this there fulfillment in life happiness  
[788.1s] and mental health is heavily heavily dependent 
on this belief we are not product of chances  
[800.4s] we are not at the mercies of the elements we are 
not at the mercies of what you call the beggarly  
[807.0s] elements of this life we we are we don't believe 
in fatalism that whatever will be will be I wake  
[814.8s] up in the morning whatever will come my way it 
was supposed to come my way the way the evening  
[819.6s] goes I possibly have no control over and it is in 
the hands of Fai there are people who believe in  
[826.7s] what we call Faith whatever comes your way is 
supposed to come your way whatever you believe  
[832.8s] whatever possibly happens to you what supposed to 
happen to you anyway we are not at the hands of  
[839.3s] faith we are not at the hands of elements of this 
life we are at the hands of God our Father who  
[848.2s] loves us so much Hallelujah God's people and this 
is the reason as to why we can sing the goodness  
[854.4s] of the Lord this is why we can sing of him who 
created Heavens on the earth who spoke the world  
[861.1s] into existence who is the reason for my being here 
today Hallelujah God's people I sing of that power  
[870.3s] our fulfillment in life our happiness and mental 
health is heavily dependent on your source of
[881.2s] reference belonging has always been a fundamental 
desire in each of us knowing that we play a part  
[892.6s] into the big picture that we are significant 
that we are Loved These are ke ingredient I  
[899.3s] to fulfillment that I know that I'm loved that 
I know that I'm significant having a space and  
[906.4s] purpose is very necessary for your happiness and 
mental health knowing we were created and knowing  
[917.7s] the way we were created it helps us to know 
ourselves better I was created and God formed  
[925.8s] me this way that you are plant was planned we 
were part of God's plan and we still are we  
[935.7s] have a place as well as a role within that place 
we have a home because God created it making sure  
[945.0s] it was good and perfect before he put us there 
we have food and oxygen because God planted  
[951.7s] grains trees and bushes fruit bearing plants to 
sustain our health we have a job because God gave  
[959.1s] us a dominion over the Earth and all living things 
on it you are want you are wanted you are pled you  
[969.9s] are cared for you are provided for and you are 
designed with a purpose through Jesus Christ you  
[979.0s] have life it is the Millennials that believe in 
the genes possibly boring from Hollywood you know  
[986.0s] where this this phrase this funny phrase they tell 
each other when they get get angry go go get life  
[990.3s] go go get yourself a life you know go get a life 
possibly when they're angry or something like that  
[998.4s] but you know something God's children we do have 
life and we have gotten that life through Jesus  
[1006.6s] Christ and that life started at the very origin 
of the earth we didn't just happen it could be  
[1015.3s] possible that possibly you may say Pastor was 
not plann my parents got me out of woodlock I  
[1023.6s] came to this world without people planning for 
me without folks thinking about me but let me  
[1029.2s] tell you something this morning the word of God 
reminds you and me that you are planned by God  
[1037.0s] you were provided for from the beginning of time 
you are designed with a purpose and through Jesus  
[1045.1s] Christ you have life there's nothing like unwanted 
for the heavenly father Hallelujah everybody was  
[1053.0s] planned for by the heavenly father all of us are 
wanted it was done at the beginning of it at the  
[1060.4s] origin of life in our daily lives today we can 
live a life of gratitude toward our savior and  
[1067.8s] Creator even though in Genesis chapter 3 we 
find that sin came into this world through  
[1074.4s] what we call the free choice or God is so good but 
even though in chapter 3 we see we see sin coming  
[1081.4s] into a world we also remind The Book of Job 19:25 
where despite of sin coming into this world and  
[1091.5s] Maring the Perfection and destroying that which 
was perfect that which God created to be holy and  
[1098.4s] beautiful and perfect then he comes and know that 
he says that I know that my redeemer lives job  
[1106.8s] speaks and says this and the last he will stand 
upon the Earth My Redeemer Lives it's in Genesis  
[1116.3s] that we get to remember that even though sin came 
into the world and even so it even even though it  
[1122.0s] mer in per the Perfection and the beauty and the 
Harmony and all that God had made he has a plan  
[1130.1s] to be able to restore it back my redeemer lives my 
redeemer lives and in the end he will stand upon  
[1138.3s] the Earth that he also created for us you know we 
have to allow God's children our world view to be  
[1145.9s] shaped by God's holy word we're living in times 
whereby the world is filled with a wide spectrum  
[1154.6s] of beliefs and positions regarding our Origins 
we need a world view that it's not shaped by  
[1164.1s] the world that is not shaped by human philosophies 
that is not shaped by humanism that is not shaped  
[1172.6s] by all this ISM fatalism and everything else 
we need a world view that is shaped by the word  
[1180.9s] of God hallelujah and not others regarding our 
origin and therefore we must be intentional about  
[1190.9s] spending time like we're doing today reflecting 
on creation reflecting on creation account of  
[1199.2s] Genesis chapter 1 and chapter 2 and maybe in 
our lives in our devotions and meditations we  
[1206.4s] could also see the words of Genesis chapter 1 and 
chapter 2 in the Book of Psalms 104 Psalms 104  
[1217.0s] where the psalmist psalmist painted differently 
he was a musician he was an artist he he wrote  
[1223.2s] it he put it in a very different way it is Genesis 
chapter 1 but he wrote in a musical format a very  
[1229.0s] language Psalms 104 let me mention some few 
verses begin from vers one praise the Lord my

sound of your thunder they took flight they flowed  
[1296.8s] over the mountains they went down The Valleys to 
the place you assigned for them vers 9 you set a  
[1303.2s] boundary they cannot cross never again will they 
cover the Earth the sist painting Genesis chapter

God as long as I live my meditation be pleasing  
[1368.2s] to him as I rejoice in the Lord I besee you to 
go home in the evening and take Psalms 104 and  
[1374.4s] try to go through it and think about those words 
and reflect upon them and Med upon them there is  
[1380.3s] power there is power there is power in this word 
it changes a perspective it affirms Us in the Book  
[1387.2s] of John chapter 1 genes say again an account 
be put in few words here summary in very few  
[1393.4s] words John chapter one in the beginning was the 
word and the Word was with God and the Word was

online audiences from all over the world you can

but also the animals the worldlife about several  
[1535.9s] years ago maybe over 10 years ago had a chance of 
getting into one of our national parks Lake naku  
[1543.2s] National Park and I was with another Elder and 
another pastor with us in the vehicle and as we  
[1549.1s] were driving inside the national park some of you 
have been there already I know you've been there  
[1552.8s] you know the place very well From a Distance on 
the other side of the of the lake I we saw three  
[1559.2s] giraffes that are standing and it was morning 
hours you know we were possibly among the first  
[1565.6s] ones and some few other tourists we could see some 
few other vehicles in the national park and so we  
[1570.3s] told the ELD please let's rush let's go towards 
that place it was possibly over a kilometer inside  
[1576.8s] the park it's beautiful it's beautiful and so we 
drove fast we rushed through we took some Corners  
[1582.1s] you know in those roads inside there the creation 
beautiful trees and Flor and FAA and touch it just  
[1588.6s] National Park we just drove and finally we 
just arrived when this tall amazing creature  
[1597.9s] I have never seen something so Grand was just 
feeding maybe breakfast I don't know one of  
[1606.3s] the tallest aesia trees in the National Park I 
believe it's aesia tree hopefully I don't get it  
[1612.0s] wrong zoologist and botanist and he was standing 
comfortably feeding on the top leaves of one of  
[1623.6s] the tallest giant accasia trees in the national 
park and so we came when he just shifted and moved  
[1632.5s] his hand his legs its legs and it h legs and the 
back legs sorry were right next to the road where  
[1641.8s] we were driving it so we came and parked right 
behind it and it happened that I was at the  
[1648.3s] window facing this long huge amazing leg a tower 
of a leg putting my Palms together can't hold it  
[1660.8s] together and it's standing so tall and I look 
at the patterns in the body I look at the the  
[1666.9s] color of the hle or the skin I look at the hair 
I look at everything I look at the prints and  
[1672.6s] and and and the sheer size of the hoof and I 
tried to look up and it is not Disturbed it  
[1680.1s] is busy feeding taking it just moves a bit with 
Grace awesomeness and in that moment I was taken  
[1689.0s] over I began to swallow and take it in slowly we 
all kept quiet in the car and before the other  
[1697.0s] tourists could come and feel the plac and around 
this big tall male giraffe I don't know whether  
[1702.2s] he's still alive I don't know whether it's the 
breed is still there we had our time I I was  
[1709.3s] carried away for a moment and I was about to begin 
a worship because what I so was so amazing that it  
[1718.4s] took my breath but then the Lord reminded me it 
is not the creature it is me the Creator behind  
[1731.0s] that which you see Hallelujah and I couldn't help 
but began to sing that song I sing the goodness  
[1738.4s] of God I sing the mighty power I began to harm 
it and before you know in the car we all began  
[1744.0s] to sing it and the other three two giraff 
came around closer and more people before  
[1748.8s] we knew five six Vehicles were around us all of 
them watching at this beauty we have blessings  
[1755.8s] and Gifts in our country and around us 
which maybe maybe we don't even take a  
[1760.6s] moment to realize and appreciate Genesis 1:28 
God says God blessed them and said to them be  
[1767.6s] fruitful an increase in number fill the Earth 
and subdue it rule over the fish in the sea and  
[1772.8s] the birds in the sky and over every every living 
creature that moves on the ground Genesis 1 and:  
[1781.9s] 28 God blessed them and he gave them the power to 
be fruitful and increase and beyond that beyond  
[1788.4s] that to subdue the Earth and rule over the fish 
in the sea and the birds in the sky do you have  
[1798.8s] you ever Sat one day and realized that animals 
work for you the dogs will listen to you and  
[1805.5s] just love you and be there for you but the cats 
in the house just love it when you are there and  
[1811.0s] maybe when you move out you can't find them any 
longer have we ever set one day to think about it  
[1816.6s] it is not the animals controlling us it is not the 
animals using us for their labor and for the work  
[1822.6s] and everything it is actually us beyond that man 
was given power to speak to River and make Rivers  
[1828.8s] shift man was given power to work with creation 
and change do things here for for his own good  
[1835.1s] and for his own existence as the bearer of the 
image of God human beings should reflect then his  
[1842.2s] character in the treatment and care of all those 
resources and all those blessings that we have  
[1850.1s] been given freely by Our Father Hallelujah church 
and as God's church and as God's people we have an  
[1859.0s] obligation from the Lord we have a responsibility 
of what we call creation stewardship are you a  
[1867.2s] good Steward of God's creation as a Church 
of God forget about individually as a person  
[1873.0s] because I could talk about making sure that 
we handle the Refuge well we struggle that  
[1876.9s] a bit in our country and the roads are clean 
everything else but what about us as a church
[1888.0s] the resources created by God should be used wisely 
the resources given to us by God should be used  
[1897.0s] without selfishness there should be no tyranny or 
violence or abuse of power it should not be found  
[1904.2s] among those who love the Lord and who reflect 
God's character and this means that we have to use  
[1910.9s] all the natures resources that God has given to 
us for good use using them wisely and cautiously  
[1920.1s] with the intent of promoting the well-being of 
all Hallelujah church we have responsibility  
[1926.3s] to keep the world beautiful in order we have a 
responsibility to be good stewards of the natural  
[1935.0s] resources and blessings God has given to us today 
in conclusion I want to finish Us by doing a  
[1940.7s] reaffirmation this morning Romans 8: 19: 19 it 
says for the creation then awaits with earnest  
[1948.0s] expectation the verse which was read to us this 
morning kext Romans 8:19 for the creation Waits  
[1953.6s] with Earnest expectation for the manifestation of 
the sons of God the first five days of the week  
[1961.2s] God made God made the made the man the man's home 
or habitant and when he woke up from God's hands  
[1968.1s] he found that everything was beautiful holy formed 
complete habitat with functional ecosystems sin  
[1975.6s] came and the Cur of sin came and destroyed even 
our ecosystem because of it it was cast you know  
[1981.0s] the Bible says so then we reminded this morning 
that the creation in that verse the Greek words  
[1990.2s] means the nature both in animate and animate rocks 
and trees and flowers and cats and dogs they are  
[1996.6s] in honest expectation they are watching with the 
head erect or out stretched awaiting in suspense  
[2004.8s] the Greek connotation for that as straining 
forward with outstretched hand just as we might  
[2012.3s] imagine the crowds outside a race course straining 
over the ropes to catch a sight of the runners  
[2018.2s] an eager intent expectation the creation is in 
eager intent in eager expectation for the for the  
[2029.0s] manifestation Revelation which is simply saying 
the glory which shall be revealed and one is that  
[2038.2s] it talks about par paria the coming of Christ 
which is to be accompanied by an appearance  
[2046.1s] of the redeemed in glorified form I love the 
book of 1 Corinthians 15:35 1 Corinthians 15  
[2052.4s] 5355 it says for this Incorruptible must put 
on incorruptible for this Mortal M must put on  
[2060.2s] immortality Hallelujah the manifestation of the 
children of God in glorified bodies the creation  
[2068.1s] is yearning and eagerly waiting when Jesus 
comes because he's coming again in glory  
[2075.4s] Hallelujah church and at that point we saying 
the creation is longing eagerly when we all shall  
[2083.2s] be restored when God shall recreate and there 
shall be another let it be let it be let it be  
[2093.2s] and it shall become in the name of Jesus Christ 
amen amen I'm done preaching I'm done preaching  
[2101.7s] now I want to invite Brenda here I want us to 
do a quick responsive ly for a few minutes to  
[2109.4s] affirm that which we believe there's going to 
be some reading projected there on the screen  
[2114.3s] and the church sh shall have a part where we 
respond and we also leading that so please  
[2120.4s] communication team let us have that one there it's 
a responsive litany about the creative word of
[2127.8s] God so there should be a leader leading 
reading and then the congregation shall  
[2137.0s] be able to have a certifying word that goes with
[2140.6s] that okay the created word of God in the beginning 
God created heaven and the Earth and the Earth  
[2151.3s] was without form and void and darkness was upon 
the face of the deep and the con should be able  
[2157.5s] to see say and it was if it were not so I would

I would have told you I begin in the beginning  
[2179.0s] God created the Heaven and the Earth and the 
Earth was without form and void and darkness  
[2184.7s] was upon the face of the deep and the spirit of 
God moved upon the face of the waters let's say  
[2190.7s] it and it was so if it were not so I would have 
told you and God said let there be light and there  
[2199.8s] was light and God saw the light that it was good 
and God divided the light from the darkness and
