FULL TRANSCRIPT:
welcome and join us as we go through the inverse lessons of the first quarters 2025 with the Collegiate class my name is Mikel flex and I'll be taking you through the missionary story titled staring storing God's word this this quarters then this quarter the Northern Asia Pacific Division is placing an emphasis on trading children training children to be missionaries through a 13th Sabbath project that en envisages the opening of a Missionary Training Center at hin Cook samuk Academy in South Korea but South Korean mother says the training of children to be missionary begins at home she started with her son when he was just beginning to walk to talk this is a story of how Olivia plants the guard of God in her children's heart when David was 18 months old his mother began to read four small books to him each book had a Bible p Mage with simple pictures the first book had Psalms 1 the second Matthew 53:12 the third John 14 1-4 and the fourth 1 Corinthians 13 mom read the books when David got up in the morning she read them when he went to bed at night she also read during the day in only a month Little David who was just learning to talk had memorized all four books today David is seven and he has memorized between 350 to 400 Bible verses how was it possible David's mother whose name is Olivia Kim was inspired by her own mother-in-law who taught four adopted children to read and write by memorizing Bible verses Olivia was deeply touched when she saw firsthand how the Bible transformed their little hearts when she became a mother she wanted to do the same for her son so she began to read the four small books which her mother-in-law made as she read David's eyes followed the pictures and his ears followed her voice he didn't say anything he couldn't read but after a month he had memorized the books when mom showed a picture he recognized and he recognized it and repeated the words on the page mom was amazed because this was the same time that he was beginning to talk and make meaningful words and sentences then mom made books with Psalm 12 1 Le Leviticus 6 4-9 The Three Angels messages in Revelations 14 The Ten Commandments in Exodus 20 and the blessings and curses of Deuteronomy 28 she read to David for 20 to 30 minutes in the morning and for 20 to 30 minutes at night he also read during the day he memorized those books as well David and Mom rely on Bible verses in everyday life David goes to a kindergarten where the teacher sometimes shows cartoons during break time popular Korean cartoons feature ghosts like cute that look cute and harmless but the story lines can be serious after watching one of those cartoons David got scared one night and ran to Mom's bedroom mommy I'm scared he said why are you scared mom asked I remember a cartoon that I watched today he said don't be scared because God is with you mom said this house is under God's protection angels are watching us over over us let's recite Psalm 121 together mom and site mom and son recited Psalm 121 which begins with the words I will lift up my eyes to the hills from whence comes my help my help comes from the Lord who made Heaven and Earth another time David was being mischievous he was four and overly excited after evening worship he didn't want to wash his face brush his teeth or pick up toys mom was busy with housework washing dishes doing laundry and caring for a six-month old baby daughter it was an hour past his usual 700 p.m. bedtime mom grew frustrated as David kept playing and running around the house finally she lost her patient and explained why are you acting like this do as I say do your chores the boy froze Mom hardly ever talked like that he looked up at Mom and Mom looked down at him mom felt sorry that she raised her voice as the two Stood Still First Corinthians 13 sprung to Mom's mind and she began to recite it silently though I speak with with the with the tongues of men and of angels but have not love have become sounding brass or clanging symbols then she looked at David and saw in his eyes that he was he was also reciting 1 Corinthians 13 in his mind she smiled David smiled the two hugged each other I am sorry that I raised my voice mom said David smiled and clung to her more tightly then he changed into his pajamas brushed his teeth and went to bed David today David loves memorizing the Bible his sister Abigail is three and is memorizing the four the first four books that he memorized mother has memorized everything that they memorize she has found that the memorization process happens automatically for her when she's teaching her children I honestly hope that the verses were memor are memorizing today will be boldly proclaimed from my children's lips one day as they become missionaries for the kingdom of God she said pray for Olivia and every parent seeking to plant the word of God in children's Hearts pray that these homes produce a bountiful crop of missionaries pray also for the Missionary Training Center that will open with the help of this quarters touch Sabbath offering at hancook seor Academy in South Korea thank you for planning a generous offering on June 29th good morning good afternoon and good evening ladies and gentlemen boys and girls from wherever you may watching uh this video from I hope that you are blessed for us here we are very much blessed this quarter we are looking at the state of the Mind Ren renewing the mind to be specific your mind needs to be renewed day in day out for this week in our quest to renew the mind we want to look at managing stress I invite my brother to lead us in a word of prayer all right let's pray oh God we come before your throne this hour to worship and praise you for K heav and Earth we also want to thank you for ening us to undertake this activity of diving into the lesson and as you're going to uh look at it be with us and show us with the Holy Spirit in just name I pray and believe Amen in front of you is a group of people who are amazing they have a heart towards God and they want to learn more the practice was Isaiah wrote come now let's reason together together we want now to study and discuss the word of God together but before I continue I'll just give them an opportunity to introduce themselves and just to sh share something on what they have learned thus far when it comes to dealing with the state of the Mind hello my name is Rose um I'm happy to be part of this panel thank you very much hello guys my name is Timothy Kuka I really looking forward to this lesson on stress hi my name is HRI Mai it has been an amazing uh Journey th thus far looking at how we can we can take practical St steps in in working on our anger and now we are looking at at stress I can't wait to see what's in store for us amen thank you your moderator this day is Elijah Peter before before you go on I think my brother Kuka said something uh he wants to learn more about stress to help our viewers what is stress okay uh stress okay for there once a quote I heard from Elon Musk H he was talking to a group of people and so he was telling them that stress does not happen because you have achieved every task in short he was saying that stress does not come from a point of discipline if you are able to do everything that you do that would not need to stress but stress would come from a point where you have things to do but you fail to do them so they sort of log log and become much more and much more so now you get stressed so I think a definition I would give for stress is just a simple one failing to do the right thing CU I think that is what causes stress generally failure to do the right thing I don't want us to be much on that but I just came across a quote that says it is not the stress that kills us but the reaction to it by hand s that's why I want to diverge more how do I manage this stress how do I react to this stress so that it doesn't end up being harmful to me for before we go in forward because it's a Bible study it's a discussion from the Bible we want to see what the Bible has to say if I I'll just welcome my brother to read from us from The Book of Matthew 11:25 to30 thank you Elijah Matthew 11 uh verse let me read from 25 to 30 it says at at that time Jesus said father Lord of Heaven and Earth I thank you because you have shown to the unlearned what you have hidden from the wise and Lear yes Father this was how you you wanted it to happen my father has given me all things no one knows the son except the father and no one knows the father except the son and those to whom the son chooses to reveal him come to me all of you who are tired from carrying heavy Lords and I will give you rest take my yoke and put it on you and learn from me because I am gentle and humble in spirit and you will find rest for the Yoke I will give you is easy and the Lord I will put on you is light amen amen amen first of all we looked at stress I'll approach this from the last part come unto me all ye that labor and are heavy laden in this world in this state of the economy in everything going on around us everything is stressful do you agree with me yeah that's very true why do you say it is true I mean this world is uh full of um things that burden us I think stress also another perspective is uh occurs when we feel overb burdened with um stuff happening in our lives and uh a good example as you said is you know uh economy others others other things that may lead to stress is relationships with people around you also the things that lead to stress is fearing of what the future holds for you so and and you know this is a world that is not our home and and God Jesus also tell tells us that we'll go through trials and tribulations but let me not talk too much but uh all I can say is uh yeah this this world is full of a lot of things that make stress us in a day-to-day basis yeah indeed as you say this world is definitely not our home so we might discussing here being vanity but I hope it might bless you wherever you may be the the lesson writer brings out the aspect of positive stress versus negative stress I'm seeing my brother KH ready to jump question in in in in in in a heartbeat but let's let's let's give our sister a chance positive stress versus negative stress um so positive stress uh the writer says is called you stressers and he the examples are like child birth moving get getting a new job or changing schools and there is also negative stress which is the bad the negative things that happen in our lives and I the difference between the two is that I think negative stress has a lot of negative impact towards our body physically spiritually and mentally and this whole quarter we are learning about um you know calming an angry mind U man renewing the mind and you know as the mind is a very central part in our body uh actually is a very central part in our spiritual life because if we are human beings without a mind then that means we are not able to function or we are not able to do things the way and and the mind actually enables us to understand God's word and everything so if we if the mind is affected negatively then that means we will be low spiritually we will be low physically and even mentally and that means that you will not able be able to serve God which is our main purpose on Earth number two we weren't able to function in a world full of trials and tribulation every single day you have to go through something and God calls us to have a clear mind so that we can go through such and we won't be able to do this with a negative mind um I think positive stressors are stress they are stressors but they they don't they don't you know I don't think they really really affect the the mind negatively they they bring about some Joy sometimes and expectations so I think mostly to the negative negative stressors I think those are the ones which bring a lot of um malfunction in the body and the mind and the spirit indeed I I I think as as as we transition to the next part stress is stress you might not we might try to look at positive stress negative stress uh pros and cons but stress is stress just to involve our panel members because you see that the intelligent individuals the question now comes have you ever been stressed I start fromo yes I've been stressed I my good example is uh school you know um sometimes things might not go your way in terms of um working on assignments or maybe be your performance that might stress you uh so for me one of the big stresses for me is academics like it happens most oftenly in academics and yeah yeah Timothy I think I share the sentiments of my brother I think the biggest stress for me is is school because H the course I'm pursuing it's not the the friendliest of courses outside there so it requires a lot of dedication and sometimes the effort you put in doesn't really show up in the results you get you get like 90% of effort then exam comes you just get 51 barely the pass Mark but anyway I think for me the biggest thing again has said is also academic stresses me out well I think um what stresses me out a lot I think I would say academics but I want go I'm not I'm not going to it because I realize that my spiritual life affects a lot um if I am weak spiritually then I am going to have stress in all aspects of my life so I would say that stress uh physical I mean spiritual stress feeling that you are not enough feeling that you can't talk to God maybe because of guilt or maybe because you have not read your Bible in a long time and now you you really want to be in contact with God and you feel like this is a lot and this is so I have disappointed God and you feel like and the devil tries to like actually make us feel So Unworthy to go before God I think a lot of stress in my life is caused by spiritual stress indeed I I I personally I'm I'm stressed and I think I'll share the same stress that uh my brother have shared academic stress we pursue the same course as my brother Timothy it it is it is it is it is quite a lot but I think when when when the Bible says God timing is the best I think our sister now shares that uh that verse in a holistic view because who knew that you could be here at such a time when we're discussing managing stress and now we want to look at managing stress from the biblical perspective we want to be able to manage the stress that she's facing spiritually everyone out there might be facing and for our viewers wherever you may be viewing and you can just ask your neighbor to your left how have they ever been stressed and as I I'll ask I'll throw you another question how do they handle the stress let's also look at how to handle the stress if if you can go back to the Book of Matthew 28 Matthew 11:28 come unto me all ye that labor and are heavy laden and I will give you rest what does that mean Matthew 11 verse 28 it's a powerful verse come to me who all who labor and I heavy laden and I will give you rest um I think there is a verse in the Bible that actually tells us to lean on God's promises because God does not go back on his promises and this outrightly is a promise come to me only who labor and heavy light and and I will give you rest that simply means that God is calling us that even in our worst of moments and even in our worst of stresses we should come to him and he will actually relieve the stress from us because even as we go forward it says take my yoke upon you and learn from me for I am gentle and lowly in heart and you will find rest for your souls for my yoke is easy and my burden is light when we look at many instances in the Bible we actually realize that God even when we are going through troubles or even when we have forsaken God ourselves God calls us back to himself he pleads with us to come back to himself and so I think this this verse 28 is is is a promise and also a plea to us as Christians that whenever you feel like you are so much stressed and you you know sometimes you can't tell just any other person you you are you are at you are at will to tell God and he will actually listen to you because this is a promise he has made to us amen amen amen I see my brother KH coming in but before I invite him to to just jump in we bring out the aspect of finding Rest In Christ it it it it when I just say finding Rest In Christ it seems uh very simple but if you can just imagine the depth of what that statement means finding Rest In Christ not finding rest in the economy not finding rest in your own bank accounts because the economy is but just finding Rest In Christ you see the Bible records in Ecclesiastes there's a time andon for everything there's a time when you'll have to labor and there a time you'll have to reap but then God calls unto you and says come unto me all ye that labor it doesn't mean that after you finish laboring is when you go to Christ to take your burden it doesn't mean that I I've stopped laboring let me just go to Christ only that Li God give a condition you have to be laboring to come to Christ you don't have to you can't just be sitting doing nothing and expect to find Rest In Christ to take your heavy lead into Christ yes there are conditions and there are situations because right now we looking at the state of the Mind renewing the mind you might be SE and your mind is is is is a constant Battle Ground your mind is throwing you battles left right and center and you need to find a way to handle it you need to find a way to to bring to Christ I think it's the book of Psalms uh 3:5 to Psalms 4:8 that says I will both lay me down in peace and sleep for thou Lord only makest me dwell in safety so when you're finding Rest In Christ there's a sense of safety but then most people have have mastered Matthew 11:28 but yet forget the other verse verse 29 verse 29 that says take my yoke upon you and learn of me for I am meek and lowly in heart and ye shall find rest unto your souls before we get to the last part the first part take my yoke upon you if if we just focus on the first part that says come unto me all the that Li and heavy lad and I will give you rest I'm I'm I'm I'm trying to use my imagination it's it's like I'm cutting a sack of potatoes and this thing is heavy and I'm just taking it to God and just laying it all on the on on on Christ and and letting him car it all the way but then if Christ does us we we ourselves will never learn human beings will like hey by the way I have someone who help me carry that load I don't have to carry it up but then we we we need to appreciate what verse 29 brings take my yoke upon you yoking up with Christ okay so I think it's interesting that the the writer decided to use the word yoke because the lesson gives us a very interesting perspective on the word yoke I'll just read it says the word yoke is translated from the Greek word zugos which refers to a wooden yoke that joins two animals together so that they can combine their strength to pull a load that would be too much for one animal so think about two animals there's this huge load that for one animal will be almost impossible to pull but now this two animals can work together by use of this yoke so this yoke is placed on these two animals and now their combined effort is able to pull this Lord so I think in the same way the call for the call that is given to us to take upon ourselves the Yoke of Christ is there's this load that we also put in our lives the stresses we have be it academics be it family be it relationships whatever stress that you have is this Lo that is sort of weighing you down but there's this Christ who in this scenario we can say is like this other animal that if this yoke is taken this load can be pulled so I think the the part the aspect of yoking up with Christ means is we are to yield our effort there's a quote that says that human effort plus divine intervention will yeld success so I think the yoking aspect is human effort so I think first of all you need to do your part indeed there's a for those in adventurers we say do your honest part indeed so do your honest part then divine intervention you take upon yourself the Yoke of Christ and understand that by the way with My Own Strength this load will be too heavy for me so I need someone to help me I need to yoke up with someone so that I can pull this load and the only person who can help you pull this load is Jesus Christ amen I think our friend has become a mathematician today and has formed a mathematical equation that says human effort plus divine intervention is equals to success success so I think whatever you may be take that mathematical equation and use it whatever you may be your human effort plus divine intervention is equals to success just to add on what he says Matthew Henry's know well commentary says to call those who are weary and heavy Len to take a yoke upon them looks like adding Affliction to The Afflicted let me pause there and just break it down in simple terms the Bible in Matthew 28 tells come all you that labor and are heavy lad and I will give you rest but then letter tells us to take up the Yoke Matthew Henry clearly records that is the same as adding Affliction to The Afflicted you add it's it's it's like jumping from the fun from the P to the firing place but now this negates everything that comes before it but the pertinency of it lies in the word you are under a yoke which makes you weary shake that off and try mine which will make you easy MH reading this quote I'm also getting different interpretations of it but just a question to you when it says shake that off and try mine which will make it easy how is Christ yoke easy um well Christ I as start by pulling out an example in uh I think we know the story of um Jesus coming the sea I think it was Mark chapter 4 um Mark chapter 4 whereby the disciples were really they didn't know what to do you know and Jesus was just sleeping calm and he woke up and asked them why why are they so anxious what is wrong what is going on and he just SC the storm you know Jesus yoke is is easy because you realize or he has told us that he has overcome the world even when he died for us at the cross he defeated Satan for good amen and once you realize that and you place yourself in Jesus yoke it is seamlessly easy but the thing is people really don't trust in him and that comes through mediation of his word as we've seen as it is it is it is U reflected in uh Psalms 119 verse 165 in uh let me just read the the verse those who love your law have perfect security and there's nothing that can make them fall so for those who mediate in God's word know that they don't have nothing to worry about nothing to say about because they know that God is in control and they have security so that's my view and Jesus yoke just gives you that security and knowing that he has overcome the world knows that you can you can you cannot have any stress or anything that can hinder you from seeking uh his face and which reminds me of a quote I I don't remember the pastor who came to uh give us uh break the bread of life for us but he said that when when when Satan reminds you of your past always remind Satan his future so if Satan tries to uh pull you down with stress just remind him boss your future isn't looking good leave me alone I am I'm the Son of God so yes thank you as I as I told we have an intelligent panelist this this this day and not not only are they intelligent but they also f if sat comes to you and tell you about your your past remind them of their future but now we want to look how practical is it for our viewers you're telling them if Satan comes to you and is stressing you out remind them remind him of his future how practical is it well in the lesson we see that uh it highlights how Satan in the in today's world is trying to move us away from God and and try to well us in a way that we are stressed and the best way is doing that is by us focusing on the world's demands and it can be academics can be employment and we focus so much at at work and trying to impress um our bosses and trying to have accad that we even forget about God who even placed Us in that position in the first place so it is also important to the I always say that the hierarchy is always uh start with prayer and amen in uh first John chapter 5 verse um verse4 it says we have courage in God's presence because we are sure that he hears us if we ask him for anything that is according to his will and in this case once we pray and ask for God to intervene for us and give us his yoke he is willing to help us God God loves us so much his love is unimaginable so first of all it's through prayer second of all I like how the lesson highlights the to-do list in terms of setting your priorities right and we have to put God first in everything that we do I always say that in your to-do list if you don't have God in it it w't prosper and one of the important things you can do is for instance this year just saying that okay every morning every evening every lunchtime I'm just going to pray and you just uh start small you know um for myself I I for last year I just told myself every every month I have to at least come out come out with one uh Bible verse that I'll memorize and I mean 12 months okay um I'm I'm I'm still trying to remember some six of them but I mean I I'm to be honest I feel more relieved of when when challenges come to my doorstep and I just reflect and mediate on Jesus word it's it's really an amazing uh stress reliever amen and another important thing is trusting in God in God's Providence uh I remind me of the verse but it says God for I know the plans I have for you says the Lord plans for you to prosper and not to destroy you and many people are stressed because they have so many uncertainties in life and in Matthew in together with that in Matthew chap 6:33 instead be concerned above above everything else with the kingdom of God and with what he requires of you and he will provide you with all these other things amen so seek first the kingdom of God and I'm telling you once you put your trust in God in everything that you do there is nothing that is going to uh pull you down or stress you and and you'll be able to achieve your goals uh even in trials and tribulations it's it's it's also important to also highlight because God talks to us through the scriptures indeed and he says that um um he says that uh just a minute okay we'll come back to that please remind remind me I'll come back to that but in the Bible God says that trials and tribulations just make us stronger and pers and more perseverant so we trust in God so let me just put it in order we pray uh set your priorities right but also included God in it meditate and trust in him that's you're good to go you're good to live in survive in this harsh world yes thank you thank you my brother for just giving us the practicability on how we can best manage stress I'm I'm I I wish we could prolong with this discussion because it's just sweeter and sweeter as we continue but sadly we we we have to come to an end every good thing has an end and as as we come to an end I'll just request each and every person from our panel to just give a parting shot as we finish uh okay so maybe a parting shot from me on how to manage stress uh my mom tells me that whenever you feel stressed just take a step back and I feel like that's so practical because the world of today is so fastpaced we are busy with very many things and sometimes you're not even thinking about them so especially when I'm stressed about school tell just take a step back take some time to think about it take some time to pray as we've said the the ultimate goal of the the ultimate thing that can help us manage and overcome stress is by praying and meditating upon the word of God in short for our viewers for me would be that the world is bound to be stressed because of the problem of sin we were put into this situation that we have to labor to get whatever we want so as a result because that will always come with a stress but a practical of us to for us to manage that is by praying and by meditating upon the word of God Amen for my party in short God understands that in this world we we need rest and that's why he Sanctified the Sabbath and gave us an opportunity to reflect upon him and also rest and um it is also quite important that we observe the Sabbath said because it makes us reflect upon God's trust and God's plan Upon Our Lives and it is it is quite unfortunate that in today's world we don't we don't we we tend to flick that away and not realize that with flicking that we are just imploding burden after burden without having a place where we can relieve them so my my urge to you to you viewers is that always put your trust in God God reflect in him and you will realize how powerful he is in what in in how he will handle your situation in in a miraculous ways that's my pting shot thank you amen um my pting shot would be made emphasis on meditation on God's word um last time we were looking at cognitive disorders and what I realized is that as human beings we we really mostly think about many things in our in our minds and we forget to meditate on God's word meditation on God's word means just reminding yourself of what you have learned in the Bible and reminding yourself on God's promises and such things and I feel like if you feel your mind with such things you will overcome stress also I would love to say that prayer is a lot is is a very powerful tool in a Christian's life and if you feel like you are guilty you are so stressed that you cannot tell anyone just call on God and I feel like looking at God as your friend your best friend who you can call any time you know the way you call your friends anytime if you have a problem or if you don't even have anything to say you call your friends I think that is how we are supposed to look at God as a very good friend of ours A a best friend who would understand all your troubles and not only understand but also help you in your troubles I think that is what I would say as a Parting Shot thank you very much to our viewers wherever you may be thank you for joining us for this amazing discussion my Parting Shot for you will be it is not the stress that kills you it is how you react to it therefore be careful on how you react to the stress that you imposed upon may God bless you and thank you very much for joining us I'll just request my sister to pray for us as we finish we're going to pray Heavenly Master thank you so much for this day that you have enabl us to do uh overcoming stress and we have learned a lot concerning stress and that we will lean on you anytime that we have stress in our lives that you meditate on your words and always look up to you in everything that you do please be with us even as we go and do these things in our lives in Jesus name I do pray and believe amen

[168.4s] at night he also read during the day he
[171.4s] memorized those books as well David and
[174.6s] Mom rely on Bible verses in everyday
[177.2s] life David goes to a kindergarten where
[180.0s] the teacher sometimes shows cartoons
[181.6s] during break time popular Korean
[183.8s] cartoons feature ghosts like cute that
[186.9s] look cute and harmless but the story
[189.4s] lines can be serious after watching one
[191.8s] of those cartoons David got scared one
[194.1s] night and ran to Mom's bedroom mommy I'm
[197.1s] scared he said why are you scared mom
[200.0s] asked I remember a cartoon that I
[202.1s] watched today he said don't be scared
[204.8s] because God is with you mom said this

[210.5s] are watching us over over us let's
[213.6s] recite Psalm 121 together mom and site
[216.9s] mom and son recited Psalm 121 which
[219.8s] begins with the words I will lift up my
[222.2s] eyes to the hills from whence comes my
[225.0s] help my help comes from the Lord who
[227.8s] made Heaven and Earth another time David
[231.3s] was being mischievous he was four and
[233.9s] overly excited after evening worship he
[236.6s] didn't want to wash his face brush his
[238.6s] teeth or pick up toys mom was busy with
[241.8s] housework washing dishes doing laundry
[244.2s] and caring for a six-month old baby
[246.6s] daughter it was an hour past his usual
[249.3s] 700 p.m. bedtime mom grew frustrated as
[252.6s] David kept playing and running around
[254.3s] the house finally she lost her patient
[257.2s] and explained why are you acting like
[259.4s] this do as I say do your chores the boy
[263.1s] froze Mom hardly ever talked like that
[266.3s] he looked up at Mom and Mom looked down
[268.6s] at him mom felt sorry that she raised
[271.6s] her voice as the two Stood Still First
[275.0s] Corinthians 13 sprung to Mom's mind and
[277.7s] she began to recite it silently though I
[280.8s] speak with with the with the tongues of
[282.7s] men and of angels but have not love have
[286.1s] become sounding brass or clanging
[288.4s] symbols then she looked at David and saw
[290.9s] in his eyes that he was he was also
[293.4s] reciting 1 Corinthians 13 in his mind
[296.4s] she smiled David smiled the two hugged
[299.9s] each other I am sorry that I raised my
[302.2s] voice mom said David smiled and clung to
[305.2s] her more tightly then he changed into
[308.6s] his pajamas brushed his teeth and went
[311.4s] to bed David today David loves
[314.7s] memorizing the Bible his sister Abigail
[317.7s] is three and is memorizing the four the
[320.0s] first four books that he memorized
[322.2s] mother has memorized everything that
[324.1s] they memorize she has found that the
[326.1s] memorization process happens
[328.2s] automatically for her when she's
[330.0s] teaching her children I honestly hope
[332.9s] that the verses were memor are

[426.6s] show us with the Holy Spirit in just
[428.6s] name I pray and believe
[432.0s] Amen in front of
[434.6s] you is a group of people who
[438.0s] are
[440.1s] amazing they have a heart towards God
[443.5s] and they want to learn
[445.0s] more the practice was Isaiah wrote come
[448.1s] now let's reason together together we
[451.0s] want now to study and discuss the word
[453.9s] of God together but before I continue
[457.3s] I'll just give them an opportunity to
[459.3s] introduce themselves and just to sh
[462.0s] share something on what they have
[463.4s] learned thus far when it comes to
[465.6s] dealing with the state of the
[468.1s] Mind hello my name is Rose um I'm happy
[472.7s] to be part of this panel thank you very
[475.1s] much hello guys my name is Timothy Kuka
[478.8s] I really looking forward to this lesson
[480.7s] on
[482.0s] stress hi my name is HRI Mai it has been
[485.5s] an amazing uh Journey th thus far
[488.5s] looking at how we can we can take
[491.2s] practical St steps in in working on our
[494.0s] anger and now we are looking at at
[496.2s] stress I can't wait to see what's in
[498.8s] store for us amen thank you your
[501.9s] moderator this day is Elijah
[505.0s] Peter before before you go on I think my
[507.3s] brother Kuka said something uh he wants
[509.7s] to learn more about stress to help our
[511.9s] viewers what is
[513.8s] stress okay
[516.5s] uh stress okay for there once a quote I
[521.1s] heard from Elon Musk H he was talking to
[524.7s] a group of people and so he was telling
[526.7s] them that stress does not happen because
[530.1s] you have achieved every task in short he
[532.3s] was saying that stress does not come
[533.9s] from a point of discipline if you are
[535.9s] able to do everything that you do that
[538.3s] would not need to stress but stress
[540.4s] would come from a point where you have
[542.4s] things to do but you fail to do them so
[544.6s] they sort of log log and become much
[546.6s] more and much more so now you get
[547.8s] stressed so I think a definition I would
[550.0s] give for stress is just a simple one
[552.4s] failing to do the right thing CU I think
[554.3s] that is what causes stress generally
[557.1s] failure to do the right
[559.3s] thing I don't want us to be much on that
[562.4s] but I just came across a quote that says
[565.4s] it is not the stress that kills us but
[567.9s] the reaction to it
[570.1s] by hand
[571.7s] s that's why I want to diverge more how
[575.4s] do I manage this stress how do I react
[578.4s] to this stress so that it doesn't end up
[581.0s] being harmful to me for before we go in
[584.8s] forward because it's a Bible study it's
[586.4s] a discussion from the Bible we want to
[589.0s] see what the Bible has to say if I I'll
[592.0s] just welcome my brother to read from us
[593.4s] from The Book of Matthew 11:25 to30
[596.0s] thank you Elijah Matthew 11
[600.1s] uh verse let me read from 25 to 30 it
[604.4s] says at at that time Jesus said father
[608.1s] Lord of Heaven and Earth I thank you
[610.9s] because you have shown to the unlearned
[614.1s] what you have hidden from the wise and
[616.6s] Lear yes Father this was how you you
[620.0s] wanted it to happen my father has given
[622.7s] me all things no one knows the son
[625.9s] except the father and no one knows the
[627.8s] father except the son and those to whom
[630.4s] the son chooses to reveal him come to me
[633.6s] all of you who are tired from carrying
[636.0s] heavy Lords and I will give you rest
[638.6s] take my yoke and put it on you and learn
[641.2s] from me because I am gentle and humble
[644.5s] in spirit and you will find rest for the
[647.2s] Yoke I will give you is easy and the
[649.2s] Lord I will put on you is light amen
[652.0s] amen
[653.3s] amen first of all we looked at stress
[657.8s] I'll approach this from the last part
[661.3s] come unto me all ye that labor and are
[665.0s] heavy
[667.2s] laden in this world in this state of the
[670.4s] economy in everything going on around us
[674.0s] everything is
[675.8s] stressful do you agree with me yeah
[678.2s] that's very true why do you say it is
[681.2s] true I mean this world is uh full of um
[686.3s] things that burden us I think stress
[689.5s] also another perspective is uh occurs
[692.8s] when we feel overb burdened with um
[695.0s] stuff happening in our lives and uh a
[698.8s] good example as you said is you know uh
[701.5s] economy others others other things that
[704.6s] may lead to stress is relationships with
[706.8s] people around you also the things that
[709.3s] lead to stress is fearing of what the
[712.0s] future holds for you so and and you know
[715.2s] this is a world that is not our home and
[718.2s] and God Jesus also tell tells us that
[719.7s] we'll go through trials and
[721.5s] tribulations but let me not talk too
[723.6s] much but uh all I can say is uh yeah
[727.0s] this this world is full of a lot of
[728.8s] things that make stress us in a
[730.3s] day-to-day basis yeah
[733.0s] indeed as you say this world is
[735.0s] definitely not our home so we might
[737.8s] discussing here being vanity but I hope
[739.6s] it might bless you wherever you may be
[741.8s] the the lesson writer brings out the
[743.2s] aspect of positive stress versus
[745.3s] negative
[746.4s] stress I'm seeing my brother KH ready to
[748.8s] jump question in in in in in in a
[752.1s] heartbeat but let's let's let's give our
[753.7s] sister a chance positive stress versus
[755.6s] negative stress um
[758.6s] so positive stress uh the writer says is
[762.0s] called you stressers and he the examples
[766.0s] are like child birth moving get getting
[769.2s] a new job or changing schools and there
[772.6s] is also negative stress which is the bad
[776.2s] the negative things that happen in our
[778.0s] lives and I the difference between the
[781.3s] two is that I think negative stress has
[785.2s] a lot of negative impact towards our
[788.0s] body physically spiritually and mentally
[791.1s] and this whole quarter we are learning
[793.3s] about um you know calming an angry mind
[798.0s] U man renewing the mind and you know as
[800.9s] the mind is a very central part in our
[803.0s] body uh actually is a very central part
[805.8s] in our spiritual life because
[809.2s] if we are human beings without a mind
[812.4s] then that means we are not able to
[814.3s] function or we are not able to do things
[817.5s] the way and and the mind actually
[819.8s] enables us to understand God's word and
[823.4s] everything so if we if the mind is
[826.7s] affected negatively then that means we
[829.4s] will be low spiritually we will be low
[832.2s] physically and even mentally and that
[834.0s] means that you will not able be able to
[836.7s] serve God which is our main purpose on
[838.6s] Earth number two we weren't able to
[840.8s] function in a world full of trials and
[844.1s] tribulation every single day you have to
[845.9s] go through something and God calls us to
[850.4s] have a clear mind so that we can go
[852.9s] through such and we won't be able to do
[855.4s] this with a negative mind um I think
[858.3s] positive stressors are stress they are
[862.2s] stressors but they they don't they don't
[864.9s] you know I don't think they really
[867.2s] really affect the the mind
[869.7s] negatively they they bring about some
[872.6s] Joy sometimes and expectations so I
[876.2s] think mostly to the negative negative
[879.0s] stressors I think those are the ones
[880.8s] which bring a lot of um malfunction in
[884.6s] the body and the mind and the spirit
[887.8s] indeed I I I think as as as we
[890.5s] transition to the next part stress is
[893.1s] stress you might not we might try to
[895.8s] look at positive stress negative
[897.9s] stress uh pros and cons but stress is
[901.2s] stress just to involve our panel members
[904.6s] because you see that the intelligent
[906.5s] individuals the question now comes have
[909.0s] you ever been
[911.1s] stressed I start
[913.6s] fromo yes I've been stressed I my good
[918.4s] example is uh school you
[921.2s] know um sometimes things might not go
[924.4s] your way in terms of um working on
[927.6s] assignments or maybe be your performance
[930.3s] that might stress
[931.7s] you uh so for me one of the big stresses
[936.0s] for me is academics like it happens most
[940.1s] oftenly in academics and yeah yeah
[945.1s] Timothy I think I share the sentiments
[947.4s] of my brother I think the biggest stress
[949.7s] for me is is school because H the course
[953.6s] I'm pursuing it's not the the
[955.5s] friendliest of courses outside there so
[958.3s] it requires a lot of dedication and
[960.9s] sometimes the effort you put in doesn't
[963.1s] really show up in the results you get
[964.8s] you get like 90% of effort then exam
[968.3s] comes you just get 51 barely the pass
[970.4s] Mark but anyway I think for me the
[973.8s] biggest thing again has said is also
[976.6s] academic stresses me
[979.3s] out well I think um what stresses me out
[982.8s] a lot I think I would say academics but
[985.4s] I want go I'm not I'm not going to it
[988.0s] because I realize that my spiritual life
[990.8s] affects a
[993.2s] lot um if I am weak spiritually then I
[997.5s] am going to have stress in all aspects
[999.8s] of my life so I would say that stress uh
[1004.6s] physical I mean spiritual stress feeling
[1007.6s] that you are not enough feeling that you
[1010.3s] can't talk to God maybe because of guilt
[1012.6s] or maybe because you have not read your
[1015.8s] Bible in a long time and now you you
[1018.0s] really want to be in contact with God
[1019.6s] and you feel like this is a lot and this
[1022.2s] is so I have disappointed God and you
[1025.0s] feel like and the devil tries to like
[1027.6s] actually make us feel So Unworthy to go
[1030.9s] before God I think a lot of stress in my
[1033.5s] life is caused by spiritual stress
[1037.2s] indeed I I I personally I'm I'm stressed
[1040.1s] and I think I'll share the same stress
[1041.8s] that uh my brother have shared academic
[1044.8s] stress we pursue the same course as my
[1047.6s] brother Timothy it it is it is it is it
[1051.6s] is quite a lot but I
[1054.4s] think when when when the Bible says God
[1056.9s] timing is the best I think our sister
[1059.0s] now shares that
[1060.9s] uh that verse in a holistic view because
[1064.2s] who knew that you could be here at such
[1065.7s] a time when we're discussing managing
[1067.6s] stress and now we want to look at
[1069.4s] managing stress from the biblical
[1071.8s] perspective we want to be able to manage
[1074.3s] the stress that she's facing
[1076.8s] spiritually everyone out there might be
[1078.8s] facing and for our viewers wherever you
[1080.8s] may be viewing and you can just ask your
[1082.7s] neighbor to your left how have they ever
[1085.5s] been stressed and as I I'll ask I'll
[1088.4s] throw you another question how do they
[1090.7s] handle the stress let's also look at how
[1093.2s] to handle the stress if if you can go
[1095.4s] back to the Book of Matthew 28 Matthew
[1098.8s] 11:28 come unto me all ye that labor and
[1103.1s] are heavy laden and I will give you rest
[1107.2s] what does that mean
[1109.6s] Matthew 11 verse 28 it's a powerful
[1113.3s] verse come to me who all who labor and I
[1117.0s] heavy laden and I will give you rest um
[1120.6s] I think there is a verse in the Bible
[1122.6s] that
[1123.8s] actually tells us to lean on God's
[1126.0s] promises because God does not go back on
[1128.6s] his promises and this outrightly is a
[1131.2s] promise come to me only who labor and
[1133.9s] heavy light and and I will give you rest
[1135.9s] that simply means that God is calling us
[1138.2s] that even in our worst of moments and
[1140.3s] even in our worst of stresses we should
[1142.6s] come to him and he will actually relieve
[1146.0s] the stress from us because even as we go
[1147.9s] forward it says take my yoke upon you
[1150.0s] and learn from me for I am gentle and
[1151.8s] lowly in heart and you will find rest
[1154.5s] for your souls for my yoke is easy and
[1157.2s] my burden is light when we look at many
[1159.4s] instances in the Bible we actually
[1161.4s] realize that God even when we are going
[1165.2s] through troubles or even when we have
[1167.2s] forsaken God ourselves God calls us back
[1170.0s] to himself he pleads with us to come
[1173.7s] back to himself and so I think this this
[1177.3s] verse 28 is is is a promise and also a
[1181.7s] plea to us as Christians that whenever
[1184.4s] you feel like you are so much stressed
[1187.2s] and you you know sometimes you can't
[1189.2s] tell just any other person you you are
[1192.1s] you are at you are at will to tell God
[1194.6s] and he will actually listen to you
[1196.5s] because this is a promise he has made to
[1198.2s] us amen amen amen I see my brother KH
[1201.8s] coming in but before I invite him to to
[1204.0s] just jump
[1205.4s] in we bring out the aspect of finding
[1208.3s] Rest In
[1210.0s] Christ it it it it when I just say
[1212.8s] finding Rest In Christ it seems uh very
[1215.3s] simple but if you can just imagine the
[1218.1s] depth of what that statement means
[1221.2s] finding Rest In Christ not finding rest
[1225.0s] in the economy not finding rest in your
[1226.6s] own bank accounts because the economy is
[1229.3s] but just finding Rest In Christ you see
[1232.0s] the Bible records in Ecclesiastes
[1233.9s] there's a time andon for everything
[1236.2s] there's a time when you'll have to labor
[1237.8s] and there a time you'll have to reap but
[1241.3s] then God calls unto you and says come
[1244.5s] unto me all ye that labor it doesn't
[1248.0s] mean that after you finish laboring is
[1249.4s] when you go to Christ to take your
[1251.4s] burden it doesn't mean
[1253.0s] that I I've stopped laboring let me just
[1255.5s] go to Christ only that Li God give a
[1259.0s] condition you have to be laboring to
[1260.8s] come to Christ you don't have to you
[1263.6s] can't just be sitting doing nothing and
[1266.3s] expect to find Rest In Christ to take
[1268.4s] your heavy lead into
[1270.4s] Christ yes there are conditions and
[1272.6s] there are situations because right now
[1274.2s] we looking at the state of the Mind
[1276.0s] renewing the mind you might be SE and
[1278.6s] your mind is is is is a constant Battle
[1281.0s] Ground your mind is throwing you battles
[1283.5s] left right and center and you need to
[1285.3s] find a way to handle it you need to find
[1287.6s] a way to to bring to Christ I think it's
[1290.4s] the book of Psalms uh 3:5 to Psalms 4:8
[1295.3s] that says I will both lay me down in
[1298.3s] peace and sleep for thou Lord only
[1302.6s] makest me dwell in
[1304.8s] safety so when you're finding Rest In
[1307.6s] Christ there's a sense of
[1310.4s] safety but
[1312.3s] then most people have have mastered
[1315.2s] Matthew 11:28
[1318.8s] but yet forget the other verse verse 29
[1321.9s] verse 29 that says take my yoke upon you
[1325.4s] and learn of me for I am meek and lowly
[1329.4s] in heart and ye shall find rest unto
[1331.9s] your
[1332.6s] souls before we get to the last part the
[1335.4s] first part take my yoke upon
[1341.2s] you if if we just focus on the first
[1343.6s] part that says come unto me all the that
[1345.6s] Li and heavy lad and I will give you
[1347.7s] rest I'm I'm I'm I'm trying to use my
[1349.8s] imagination it's it's like I'm cutting a
[1351.9s] sack of potatoes and this thing is heavy
[1353.7s] and I'm just taking it to God and just
[1355.6s] laying it all on the on on on Christ and
[1357.6s] and letting him car it all the way but
[1360.9s] then if Christ does us we we ourselves
[1364.0s] will never
[1365.0s] learn human beings will like hey by the
[1367.3s] way I have someone who help me carry
[1369.0s] that load I don't have to carry it up
[1372.0s] but then we we we need to appreciate
[1373.9s] what verse 29 brings take my yoke upon
[1377.4s] you yoking up with Christ okay so I
[1380.5s] think it's interesting that the the
[1382.1s] writer decided to use the word yoke
[1384.9s] because the lesson gives us a very
[1386.5s] interesting perspective on the word yoke
[1388.2s] I'll just read it says the word yoke is
[1390.6s] translated from the Greek word zugos
[1393.0s] which refers to a wooden yoke that joins
[1395.4s] two animals together so that they can
[1397.4s] combine their strength to pull a load
[1399.8s] that would be too much for one animal so
[1402.0s] think about two animals there's this
[1403.8s] huge load that for one animal will be
[1406.1s] almost impossible to pull but now this
[1408.6s] two animals can work together by use of
[1410.2s] this yoke so this yoke is placed on
[1411.6s] these two animals and now their combined
[1413.6s] effort is able to pull this Lord so I
[1416.1s] think in the same way the call for the
[1418.7s] call that is given to us to take upon
[1420.9s] ourselves the Yoke of Christ is there's
[1423.7s] this load that we also put in our lives
[1425.7s] the stresses we have be it academics be
[1428.3s] it family be it relationships whatever
[1431.0s] stress that you have is this Lo that is
[1433.2s] sort of weighing you down but there's
[1435.6s] this Christ who in this scenario we can
[1438.0s] say is like this other animal that if
[1440.5s] this yoke is taken this load can be
[1442.4s] pulled so I think the the part the
[1446.2s] aspect of yoking up with Christ means is
[1449.2s] we are to yield our effort there's a
[1451.7s] quote that says that human effort plus
[1454.9s] divine intervention will yeld success so
[1458.0s] I think the yoking aspect is human
[1461.0s] effort so I think first of all you need
[1462.7s] to do your part indeed there's a for
[1465.0s] those in adventurers we say do your
[1466.7s] honest part indeed so do your honest
[1469.0s] part then divine intervention you take
[1470.8s] upon yourself the Yoke of Christ and
[1472.4s] understand that by the way with My Own
[1474.2s] Strength this load will be too heavy for
[1476.0s] me so I need someone to help me I need
[1477.8s] to yoke up with someone so that I can
[1479.4s] pull this load and the only person who
[1481.2s] can help you pull this load is Jesus
[1482.7s] Christ amen I think our friend has
[1485.8s] become a mathematician today and has
[1487.4s] formed a mathematical equation that says
[1490.3s] human effort plus divine intervention is
[1493.3s] equals to success success so I think
[1496.2s] whatever you may be take that
[1497.6s] mathematical equation and use it
[1499.4s] whatever you may be your human effort
[1502.2s] plus divine intervention is equals to
[1505.6s] success just to add on what he says
[1508.2s] Matthew Henry's know well commentary
[1510.6s] says to call those who are weary and
[1512.9s] heavy Len to take a yoke upon them looks
[1516.7s] like adding Affliction to The
[1519.4s] Afflicted let me pause there and just
[1521.9s] break it down in simple terms the Bible
[1524.4s] in Matthew 28 tells come all you that
[1527.3s] labor and are heavy lad
[1528.8s] and I will give you rest but then letter
[1531.0s] tells us to take up the Yoke Matthew
[1534.8s] Henry clearly records that is the same
[1537.3s] as adding Affliction to The Afflicted
[1539.8s] you add it's it's it's like jumping from
[1542.2s] the fun from the P to the firing
[1546.9s] place but now this negates everything
[1550.4s] that comes before it but the pertinency
[1553.0s] of it lies in the word you are under a
[1557.9s] yoke
[1559.0s] which makes you weary shake that off and
[1562.6s] try mine which will make you easy
[1567.6s] MH reading this quote I'm also getting
[1569.8s] different interpretations of it but just
[1572.2s] a question to you when it says shake
[1575.4s] that off and try mine which will make it
[1577.8s] easy how is Christ yoke
[1583.2s] easy um well
[1586.4s] Christ I as start by pulling out an
[1590.3s] example in uh I think we know the story
[1593.8s] of um Jesus coming the sea I think it
[1596.3s] was Mark chapter
[1598.0s] 4 um Mark chapter 4 whereby the
[1602.0s] disciples were
[1604.6s] really they didn't know what to do you
[1606.9s] know and Jesus was just sleeping calm
[1610.3s] and he woke up and asked them why why
[1613.0s] are they so anxious what is wrong what
[1615.4s] is going on and he just SC the storm
[1619.1s] you know Jesus yoke is is easy
[1623.2s] because you realize or he has told us
[1626.4s] that he has overcome the world even when
[1630.2s] he died for us at the cross he defeated
[1634.4s] Satan for good amen and once you realize
[1638.0s] that and you place yourself in Jesus
[1641.1s] yoke it is seamlessly easy but the thing
[1645.4s] is people really don't trust in him and
[1648.4s] that comes through mediation of his word
[1651.0s] as we've seen as it is it is it is U
[1655.0s] reflected in uh Psalms
[1657.4s] 119 verse
[1659.4s] 165 in uh let me just read the the verse
[1663.8s] those who love your law have perfect
[1666.4s] security and there's nothing that can
[1668.9s] make them fall so for those who mediate
[1673.5s] in God's word know that they don't have
[1676.5s] nothing to worry about nothing to say
[1678.4s] about because they know that God is in
[1680.3s] control and they have security so that's
[1683.5s] my view and Jesus yoke just gives you
[1685.4s] that security and knowing that he has
[1687.3s] overcome the world knows that you can
[1690.5s] you can you cannot have any stress or
[1695.4s] anything that can hinder you from
[1697.2s] seeking uh his face and which reminds me
[1700.5s] of a
[1701.7s] quote I I don't remember the pastor who
[1704.6s] came to uh give us uh break the bread of
[1707.9s] life for us but he said that when when
[1713.9s] when Satan reminds you of your past
[1716.3s] always remind Satan his future so if
[1720.2s] Satan tries to uh pull you down with
[1723.0s] stress just remind him boss your future
[1726.3s] isn't looking good leave me alone I am
[1728.6s] I'm the Son of God so yes thank you as I
[1732.5s] as I told we have an intelligent
[1734.0s] panelist this this this day and not not
[1736.5s] only are they intelligent but they also
[1737.8s] f
[1738.9s] if sat comes to you and tell you about
[1740.6s] your your past remind them of their
[1742.9s] future but now we want to look how
[1744.9s] practical is it for our viewers you're
[1747.2s] telling them if Satan comes to you and
[1749.2s] is stressing you out remind them remind
[1751.1s] him of his future how practical is
[1754.2s] it well in the lesson we see that
[1758.8s] uh it highlights how Satan in the in
[1762.7s] today's world is trying to move us away
[1765.6s] from God and and try to well us in a way
[1769.0s] that we are stressed and the best way is
[1771.2s] doing that is by us focusing on the
[1773.0s] world's
[1774.1s] demands and it can be academics can be
[1778.2s] employment and we focus so much at at
[1781.8s] work and trying to impress um our bosses
[1786.3s] and trying to have accad that we even
[1788.2s] forget about God who even placed Us in
[1790.8s] that position in the first place
[1794.2s] so it is also important to
[1798.2s] the I always say that the hierarchy is
[1801.7s] always uh start with prayer and amen in
[1805.5s] uh first John chapter 5 verse um verse4
[1810.5s] it says we have courage in God's
[1813.5s] presence because we are sure that he
[1815.8s] hears us if we ask him for anything that
[1818.8s] is according to his will and in this
[1821.4s] case once we pray and ask for God to
[1825.2s] intervene for us and give us his yoke he
[1827.4s] is willing to help us God God loves us
[1829.9s] so much his love is unimaginable so
[1832.8s] first of all it's through prayer second
[1834.7s] of all I like how the lesson highlights
[1837.8s] the to-do list in terms of setting your
[1841.1s] priorities right
[1844.4s] and we have to put God first in
[1846.9s] everything that we do I always say that
[1849.4s] in your to-do list if you don't have God
[1851.5s] in it it w't prosper and one of the
[1854.7s] important things you can do is for
[1857.1s] instance
[1858.8s] this year just saying that okay every
[1861.2s] morning every evening every lunchtime
[1863.7s] I'm just going to pray and you just uh
[1866.9s] start small you know um for myself I I
[1872.6s] for last year I just told myself
[1876.0s] every every month I have to at least
[1879.2s] come out come out with one uh Bible
[1882.2s] verse that I'll memorize and I mean 12
[1885.6s] months okay um I'm I'm I'm still trying
[1888.8s] to remember some six of them but I mean
[1892.4s] I I'm to be honest I feel more relieved
[1898.0s] of when when challenges come to my
[1900.3s] doorstep and I just reflect and mediate
[1903.2s] on Jesus word it's it's really an
[1906.2s] amazing uh stress reliever amen and
[1910.4s] another important thing is trusting in
[1914.4s] God in God's
[1916.5s] Providence uh
[1919.1s] I remind me of the verse but it
[1922.1s] says God for I know the plans I have for
[1924.8s] you says the Lord plans for you to
[1927.2s] prosper and not to destroy
[1929.3s] you and many people are stressed because
[1932.6s] they have so many uncertainties in life
[1935.2s] and in Matthew in together with that in
[1937.2s] Matthew chap
[1939.7s] 6:33 instead be concerned above above
[1943.0s] everything else with the kingdom of God
[1945.2s] and with what he requires of you and he
[1947.1s] will provide you with all these other
[1949.0s] things amen so seek first the kingdom of
[1953.2s] God and I'm telling you once you put
[1957.0s] your trust in God in everything that you
[1959.0s] do there is nothing that is going to uh
[1962.6s] pull you down or stress you and and
[1964.6s] you'll be able to achieve your goals uh
[1967.1s] even in trials and tribulations it's
[1970.3s] it's it's also important to also
[1972.3s] highlight because God talks to us
[1974.3s] through the scriptures indeed and he
[1976.7s] says that um
[1980.6s] um he says that uh just a
[1985.8s] minute okay we'll come back to that
[1988.4s] please remind remind me I'll come back
[1990.8s] to that but in the Bible God says that
[1993.4s] trials and tribulations just make us
[1996.1s] stronger and pers and more perseverant
[1999.3s] so we trust in God so let me just put it
[2002.2s] in order we
[2004.8s] pray uh set your priorities right but
[2008.0s] also included God in it meditate and
[2011.0s] trust in him that's you're good to go
[2014.1s] you're good to live in survive in this
[2016.2s] harsh world yes thank you thank you my
[2019.8s] brother for just giving us the
[2021.4s] practicability on how we can best manage
[2024.7s] stress I'm I'm I I wish we could prolong
[2027.8s] with this discussion because it's just
[2029.6s] sweeter and sweeter as we continue but
[2032.0s] sadly we we we have to come to an end
[2035.4s] every good thing has an end and as as we
[2038.1s] come to an end I'll just request each
[2041.5s] and every person from our panel to just
[2043.1s] give a parting shot as we
[2045.6s] finish uh okay so maybe a parting shot
[2048.5s] from me on how to manage stress uh my
[2051.7s] mom tells me that whenever you feel
[2053.8s] stressed just take a step back and I
[2056.7s] feel like that's so practical because
[2058.5s] the world of today is so fastpaced we
[2060.7s] are busy with very many things and
[2063.1s] sometimes you're not even thinking about
[2064.7s] them so especially when I'm stressed
[2066.8s] about school tell just take a step back
[2069.8s] take some time to think about it take
[2071.6s] some time to pray as we've said the the
[2074.0s] ultimate goal of the the ultimate thing
[2076.6s] that can help us manage and overcome
[2078.5s] stress is by praying and meditating upon
[2080.9s] the word of God in short for our viewers
[2083.7s] for me would be that the world is bound
[2086.6s] to be stressed because of the problem of
[2088.4s] sin we were put into this situation that
[2091.5s] we have to labor to get whatever we want
[2093.8s] so as a result because that will always
[2095.6s] come with a stress but a practical of us
[2098.0s] to for us to manage that is by praying
[2101.0s] and by meditating upon the word of God
[2104.9s] Amen for my party in
[2108.1s] short God understands that in this world
[2111.3s] we we need
[2113.0s] rest and that's why he Sanctified the
[2116.4s] Sabbath and gave us an opportunity to
[2119.2s] reflect upon him and also rest and um it
[2124.9s] is also quite important that we observe
[2127.8s] the Sabbath said because it makes us
[2129.8s] reflect upon God's trust and God's plan
[2132.8s] Upon Our Lives and it
[2136.4s] is it is quite unfortunate that in
[2138.8s] today's world we don't we don't we we
[2141.3s] tend to flick that away and not realize
[2145.0s] that with flicking that we are just
[2147.2s] imploding burden after burden without
[2149.2s] having a place where we can relieve them
[2151.8s] so my my urge to you to you viewers is
[2155.2s] that always put your trust in God God
[2158.3s] reflect in him and you will realize how
[2161.6s] powerful he is in what in in how he will
[2165.6s] handle your situation in in a miraculous
[2168.2s] ways that's my pting shot thank you amen
[2171.8s] um my pting shot would be made emphasis
[2174.4s] on meditation on God's word um last time
[2178.0s] we were looking at cognitive disorders
[2180.3s] and what I realized is that as human
[2182.4s] beings we we
[2184.6s] really mostly think about many things in
[2188.1s] our in our minds and we forget to
[2191.4s] meditate on God's word meditation on
[2193.6s] God's word means just reminding yourself
[2197.2s] of what you have learned in the Bible
[2199.0s] and reminding yourself on God's promises
[2201.2s] and such things and I feel like if you
[2203.3s] feel your mind with such things you will
[2205.8s] overcome stress also I would love to say
[2208.4s] that prayer is a lot is is a very
[2210.7s] powerful tool in a Christian's life and
[2213.2s] if you feel like you are guilty you are
[2216.3s] so stressed that you cannot tell anyone
[2218.6s] just call on God and I feel like looking
[2222.2s] at God as your friend your best friend
[2224.6s] who you can call any time you know the
[2226.5s] way you call your friends anytime if you
[2228.0s] have a problem or if you don't even have
[2229.7s] anything to say you call your friends I
[2232.0s] think that is how we are supposed to
[2233.2s] look at God as a very good friend of
[2235.5s] ours A a best friend who would
[2237.8s] understand all your troubles and not
[2239.8s] only understand but also help you in
[2241.6s] your troubles I think that is what I
[2243.8s] would say as a Parting Shot thank you
[2246.3s] very much to our viewers wherever you
[2249.1s] may be thank you for joining us for this
[2252.2s] amazing discussion my Parting Shot for
[2254.6s] you will be it is not the stress that
[2257.0s] kills you it is how you react to it
[2260.9s] therefore be careful on how you react to
[2263.9s] the stress that you imposed upon may God
[2267.2s] bless you and thank you very much for
[2269.2s] joining us I'll just request my sister
[2270.6s] to pray for us as we finish we're going
[2273.3s] to pray Heavenly Master thank you so
[2275.6s] much for this day that you have enabl us
[2277.9s] to do uh overcoming stress and we have
[2281.4s] learned a lot concerning stress and that
[2283.8s] we will lean on you anytime that we have
[2285.7s] stress in our lives that you meditate on
[2288.0s] your words and always look up to you in
[2290.4s] everything that you do please be with us
[2293.0s] even as we go and do these things in our
[2296.6s] lives in Jesus name I do pray and
[2298.2s] believe amen
