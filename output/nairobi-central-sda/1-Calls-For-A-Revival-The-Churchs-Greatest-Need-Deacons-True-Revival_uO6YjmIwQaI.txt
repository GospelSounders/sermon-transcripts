FULL TRANSCRIPT:
hello and welcome to our review of the book true Revival this will be led by some of the deacons at Nairobi Central SDA church and true Revival is a book that we intend to read together with you because we've noticed that there really important things that need to happen in our lives if you want to Exel in our Christian journey and one of them is to have true Revival from this book it starts off with this quot a that a Revival of true godliness Among Us is the greatest and most urgent of all our needs and this necessitates the need to actually study what it means to be truly revived among the things that will be covering we'll be talking about what it means to be truly revived how you get converted is it fake or real conversion then what does it really mean to be a born again Christian and we'll also learn that God actually has rules too because sometimes we say it's only just a matter of having faith in God but it's also important to have the works that accompany them but what is the balance how do we follow God's rules but still believe that they are not the only way we can be saved but we actually get saved by faith in Christ then it's also important for us to notice that there are counterfeit revivals that exist Among Us the ones that come in shortly and then they die out then we'll also learn that after you have been revived that's not the end of the Christian journey in fact it's a battle and it's a fight so we need to actually continue in this fight to maintain the revived experience then we can also work we'll also learn how to safeguard this experience in Christ even as we read through this book and we'll also see some examples of some appeals that have been done in the past that have helped some people take a stand for Christ so it will be an exciting journey and every week we'll be doing a chapter for us to learn Point by Point what it means to have a truly revived experience and we pray that not only will you listen to us but you can also get a copy of this book true Revival and on the screen you'll see a link that can guide you to read the book or find the book online for those who cannot get access to a physical copy so together with me in this panel as will going through this book I'd like to introduce my panelist on the right can you introduce himself on the left rather on the left yeah thank you very much brother n thank you for the elaborate introduction my name is Steven muga one of the deacons I be sharing and um covering the book true Revival thank you and welcome thank you very much and on my right please introduce yourself good morning good evening uh depending on where you are my name is opata hayanga also a Deon at Nairobi Central and uh I'm glad to have this opportunity to review this book to Revival and we pray that uh we may learn more thank you thank you and my name is niik opio I'll be moderating this session and I pray that you'll be blessed even as we study so before we Dive Right into chapter one which is titled calls for Revival I'd like opata to give us a word of prayer and dive right into it thank you so much n thank you for the brief introduction uh let's have a word of prayer Our dear heavenly father we come before your throne of Mercy our hearts are full of Thanksgiving we invite your holy presence to come at Tabernacle with us as we do this book review we pray father that you may put words in our mouth father and give us the guidance that you want us to have so that we may share your word in truth honesty father and in belief all this your us trust and believing in Jesus name we pray amen okay let's start for with the chapter one the book true Revival and chapter one talks about uh the church greatest greatest need and when we talk about the church I just want to remind you that uh the church is you and me and and just to summarize this chapter you realize that uh the book speaks against uh group thinking you know whenever we are together there's something called group thinking where you you it's like you're picking your energy from your other brother and then uh in that process you realize that uh sometimes you may become neglectful because you think that Steve will do it or Nick will do it but here we are being called upon to take this revival as a personal Quest because the opening the opening statement says that uh a Revival of true godliness Among Us is the greatest and most agent of all our needs to seek this should be our first work and then uh when you go further it says there's a question that we have been asked here are we hoping to see the whole church revived and then the answer is that time will never come so that group mentality that group thinking mentality we need to drop it's upon you to have a personal relationship with Christ so that when you revived when my brother sees that you're revived even him will be encouraged and hope to to to to have the same experience as you are having and then one of the reason you have been given why this group mentality thinking uh will never happen is you know when you're congregating together remember we are people with diverse coming from diverse backgrounds and here we are being told that there are persons in the church who are not converted and who will not unite in honest prevailing prayer this is just a situation that you have been given why this group mentality is somehow very hard to work with because you realize that when you congregate together we come with very different needs and aspirations so you realize that uh we might not be in the same page as much as we are sitting together might not be on the same page so you are called upon you to step back think about it and uh have this personal connection with with Jesus uh so that uh through you even the church may be be revived and uh there's another section that talks about opening the door to their adversity and when you talk about opening the door to the adversary you realize that through the Bible we have been told that the devil is not prevy to what to your thoughts what you think inside your mind the devil cannot know what what instead he does is he's a very keen Observer he observes your words he observes your actions and then he customized his Temptations to what he has seen so through this he'll be able to to catch you so we being told that uh when when you're revived this is the point where now we are told that uh if we will labor toess sinful thoughts and feelings giving them no expression in words or actions Satan will be defeated because he can't really know what you're thinking or what you're doing because you have expressed those Temptation that are thrown your way so for if for he could not prepare his suspicious temptation to meet this case so there's nothing that he can fashion to to toss to you so that you can he can to dangle to you so that he can woo you so I think it's uh when you talk about that personal Revival realize that uh when you walk closely with God and then you anchor your your your your your guidance and your foundation to God you realize that uh you'll be able to suppress these Temptations and the devil will not have an angle or an opportunity to to to enjoin with you and um while links look on and Jing jingly exclaim exclaim I think here we are being introduced that U when you are a a Christian and uh through your personal expression your words and actions you realize that uh there's so much that is is expected from you especially the people who are from the from the other side the people who are still attached to the world who have not given them the themselves to to Christ these people when they see you fall there are some sort statements they start making like the one that let me just read here you say behold how these Christians hate one another if this is religion we do not want it and they look upon themselves and they irreligious characters with great satisfaction thus they are confirmed in their imp impenitence and Satan exalt at his uh success so this is just a challenge to us that if you have given your life to Christ live as one who has the experience of Christ in you so I just want to ask my brother nick uh what can you say about uh this chapter this talks about the greatest need of the church yes the greatest need of the church as you say is true Revival and I felt that there were some things that were highlighted that are key given that we are in the time of investigative judgment also known as the day of atonement it's important for us to actually realize that this is the work where God is actually calling our names and reviewing our cases before him and and as we stand before the great judgment seat of Christ we need to have had this revival experience because if our name is called up and we don't seem to be ready even to meet Jesus we're not even working to get people into his kingdom I think that it will be a very uh bad situation for us because if a case is brought up against you and the evidence is on the contrary it means that you may receive a sentence that you do not like so given we in the period of investigative judgment also known as the day of atonement it's important for us to have a Revival in our experience and it's not just for a certain period of time but a continual one because we do not know when our names will be called up and more importantly we do not know when we'll die so it's best for us to be revived to ensure that we may get into this Promised Land Of Heaven thank you uh brother Steve do you have any yeah thank you any contribution thank you very much uh brother opata and brother niik I think you've brought it out um very clearly um and and very explicitly and and I like when you say that uh you know the church is you and me however um the call for reformation the the call for Revival is independent you need to um ask the spirit to give you Revival as an individual before we go to the church as collective um congregation and and um this chapter tells us that spirit of God cannot come to the church unless the church prepares the way and how does the church prepare the way simply by Hest prayers by Hest request from God for True conversion because if if if we are not truly converted and in an Hest way then there's no way that this promise of of the power of God or the holy spirit will fall unto us also reminded that uh there's nothing that Satan fears um than than an individual who's truly revived an individual who filled with the power of the Holy Spirit and if Satan had his way if it were up for up up for um up for him then we would not have another Revival but this revival is Promised it's a sure promise from God that the latter R will indeed come and if we've been promised this true Revival our only need and ask from God is that we seek Him in honest in truth and in spirit and indeed he will outpour um the Holy Spirit or the power of the spirit to the to the church um I think that's what I would add um to this chapter one thank you uh just to summarize the Bible says that uh the book says he'll use Simple agencies and we know Bible says that he'll use the foolish things of the world to even ashame the the elit so we here we saying that uh at no point will the word of God ever stop because maybe you you're being regretful you remember even Jesus told telling the the Pharisees that uh out of these stones able to raise children for Abraham so the Bible is very clear that uh if you're negul the word of God will never stop he will use anything and everything to make sure that his word will always move forward and that brings the conclusion for chapter chapter one thank you thank you P so as we've been going through this there are several themes that we've talked about the need of the church the greatest need which is true Revival and how we should not open the door to the adversity and we've been talking about true Revival I'd like to highlight two things the first is Revival only comes in answer to prayer and once the prayer is answered then we are filled with the Holy Spirit then we can be truly revived then the second thing is that Revival is always accompanied with a Reformation to read it from a statement here to explain what it is we're told that Revival and Reformation are two different things Revival signifies a renewal of spiritual life a quickening of the powers of the mind and heart a resurrection from spiritual death Reformation signifies a reorganization a change in ideas and theories habits and practices Reformation will not bring forth the good fruit of righteousness un let unless it is connected with the Revival of the spirit and that's why we only can be revived in answer to prayer amen so with that we'd like to close this chapter we'd like to invite you to join us for next week's chapter which is going to talk about conversions will are they fake or real and we'll be able to identify counterfeits and you'll also be able to identify the genuine ones brother Steve please close for us with a word of prayer thank you let us pray Our Father what in heaven we thank you we thank you very much for your blessings when we began uh this book and uh when we began to tackle this chapter we committed ourselves before you Lord you've been gracious enough you've granted us your Holy Spirit the same holy spirit that is being talked about in this book Lord it is our prayer that you shall grant us your power and you shall commit us you shall bless us with the latter rain we confess our forgiveness and we seek true Revival and true Reformation transform us even as we um continue uh highlighting and reviewing this book and even for our audiences Lord it is our prayer that this transformation shall um Encompass all of us we thank you and we lift you up prepare us for the next week for it is in Jesus name we pray amen amen amen

TIMESTAMPED TRANSCRIPT:
[0.6s] hello and welcome to our review of the
[3.6s] book true Revival this will be led by
[7.1s] some of the deacons at Nairobi Central
[9.4s] SDA church and true Revival is a book
[13.4s] that we intend to read together with you
[16.5s] because we've noticed that there really
[18.5s] important things that need to happen in
[20.2s] our lives if you want to Exel in our
[22.9s] Christian journey and one of them is to
[25.6s] have true Revival from this book it
[28.8s] starts off with this quot a that a
[31.2s] Revival of true godliness Among Us is
[34.5s] the greatest and most urgent of all our
[37.2s] needs and this necessitates the need to
[40.9s] actually study what it means to be truly
[43.8s] revived among the things that will be
[46.1s] covering we'll be talking about what it
[48.5s] means to be truly revived how you get
[51.5s] converted is it fake or real conversion
[54.5s] then what does it really mean to be a
[56.3s] born again Christian and we'll also
[59.2s] learn that God actually has rules too
[61.8s] because sometimes we say it's only just
[63.6s] a matter of having faith in God but it's
[66.4s] also important to have the works that
[68.4s] accompany them but what is the balance
[70.6s] how do we follow God's rules but still
[73.0s] believe that they are not the only way
[75.7s] we can be saved but we actually get
[78.1s] saved by faith in Christ then it's also
[81.5s] important for us to notice that there
[83.0s] are counterfeit revivals that exist
[85.0s] Among Us the ones that come in shortly
[87.8s] and then they die out then we'll also
[90.6s] learn that after you have been revived
[93.3s] that's not the end of the Christian
[95.6s] journey in fact it's a battle and it's a
[98.4s] fight so we need to actually continue in
[101.3s] this fight to maintain the revived
[104.6s] experience then we can also work we'll
[107.4s] also learn how to safeguard this
[109.2s] experience in Christ even as we read
[111.8s] through this book and we'll also see
[113.9s] some examples of some appeals that have
[115.7s] been done in the past that have helped
[118.0s] some people take a stand for Christ so
[121.1s] it will be an exciting journey and every
[123.2s] week we'll be doing a chapter for us to
[125.9s] learn Point by Point what it means to
[128.2s] have a truly revived experience and we
[131.1s] pray that not only will you listen to us
[134.1s] but you can also get a copy of this book

[144.0s] those who cannot get access to a

[177.4s] evening uh depending on where you are my
[180.2s] name is opata hayanga also a Deon at
[183.1s] Nairobi Central and uh I'm glad to have
[186.4s] this opportunity to review this book to
[188.5s] Revival and we pray that uh we may learn
[192.8s] more thank you thank you and my name is
[196.5s] niik opio I'll be moderating this
[198.7s] session and I pray that you'll be
[200.9s] blessed even as we study so before we
[203.8s] Dive Right into chapter one which is
[206.1s] titled calls for Revival I'd like opata
[209.3s] to give us a word of prayer and dive
[212.5s] right into it thank you so much n thank
[215.8s] you for the brief introduction uh let's
[220.1s] have a word of
[221.3s] prayer Our dear heavenly father we come
[224.0s] before your throne of Mercy our hearts
[225.7s] are full of Thanksgiving we invite your
[228.4s] holy presence to come at Tabernacle with
[230.5s] us as we do this book review we pray
[233.1s] father that you may put words in our
[235.0s] mouth father and give us the guidance
[237.5s] that you want us to have so that we may
[239.4s] share your word in truth honesty father
[243.4s] and in belief all this your us trust and
[246.0s] believing in Jesus name we pray
[248.4s] amen okay let's start for with the
[252.1s] chapter
[253.3s] one the book true Revival and chapter
[256.5s] one talks about
[260.3s] uh the church greatest greatest need and
[263.8s] when we talk about the church I just
[265.4s] want to remind you that uh the church is
[268.1s] you and me and and just to summarize
[271.7s] this chapter you realize that uh the
[274.8s] book speaks against uh group thinking
[278.6s] you know whenever we are together
[281.5s] there's something called group thinking
[283.1s] where you you it's like you're picking
[285.5s] your energy from your other brother and
[288.0s] then uh in that process you realize that
[291.4s] uh sometimes you may become neglectful
[294.5s] because you think that Steve will do it
[297.4s] or Nick will do it but here we are being
[300.1s] called upon to take this revival as a
[304.2s] personal Quest because the opening the
[307.5s] opening statement says that uh a Revival
[310.8s] of true godliness Among Us is the
[313.3s] greatest and most agent of all our needs
[316.8s] to seek this should be our first
[319.4s] work and then uh when you go further it
[323.4s] says there's a question that we have
[325.2s] been asked here are we hoping to see the
[327.7s] whole church revived
[330.2s] and then the answer is that time will
[333.6s] never come so that group mentality that
[336.6s] group thinking mentality we need to drop
[339.0s] it's upon you to have a personal
[342.4s] relationship with Christ so that when
[345.2s] you
[346.0s] revived when my brother sees that you're
[348.2s] revived even him will be encouraged and
[351.1s] hope to to to to have the same
[353.9s] experience as you are having and then
[356.8s] one of the reason you have been given
[358.4s] why this group mentality thinking uh
[361.4s] will never happen is you know when
[363.7s] you're congregating together remember we
[365.6s] are people with diverse coming from
[368.0s] diverse backgrounds and here we are
[369.8s] being told that there are persons in the
[371.9s] church who are not
[373.5s] converted and who will not unite in
[376.2s] honest prevailing prayer this is just a
[379.6s] situation that you have been given why
[381.2s] this group mentality is somehow very
[383.8s] hard to work with because you realize
[386.0s] that when you congregate
[388.0s] together we come with very different
[390.9s] needs and
[393.0s] aspirations so you realize that uh we
[395.6s] might not be in the same page as much as
[397.2s] we are sitting together might not be on
[398.8s] the same page so you are called upon you
[401.9s] to step back think about it and uh have
[406.4s] this personal connection with with Jesus
[409.6s] uh so that uh through you even the
[412.0s] church may be be revived and uh there's
[416.4s] another section that talks about opening
[418.2s] the door to their adversity
[420.6s] and when you talk about opening the door
[422.5s] to the adversary you realize that
[424.8s] through the Bible we have been told
[427.0s] that the devil is not prevy to what to
[431.0s] your thoughts what you think inside your
[434.7s] mind the devil cannot know what what
[438.2s] instead he does is he's a very keen
[440.8s] Observer he observes your words he
[443.8s] observes your actions and then he
[447.2s] customized his Temptations to what he
[450.3s] has seen so through this he'll be able
[453.2s] to to catch you so we being told that uh
[456.4s] when when you're revived this is the
[459.2s] point where now we are told that uh if
[461.4s] we will labor toess sinful thoughts and
[464.7s] feelings giving them no expression in
[467.2s] words or actions Satan will be defeated
[470.1s] because he can't really know what you're
[471.6s] thinking or what you're doing because
[473.6s] you have expressed those Temptation that
[476.0s] are thrown your way so for if for he
[479.8s] could not prepare his suspicious
[481.4s] temptation to meet this case so there's
[483.4s] nothing that he can fashion to to toss
[487.6s] to you so that you can he can to dangle
[489.9s] to you so that he can woo you so I think
[493.5s] it's uh when you talk about that
[495.1s] personal Revival realize that uh when
[498.7s] you walk closely with
[500.8s] God and then you anchor your your your
[505.6s] your your guidance and your foundation
[508.0s] to God you realize that uh
[510.1s] you'll be able to suppress these
[511.4s] Temptations and the devil will not have
[513.3s] an angle or an opportunity to to to
[516.3s] enjoin with you and um while links look
[519.6s] on and Jing jingly exclaim exclaim I
[523.1s] think here we are being introduced that
[525.7s] U when you are a a
[529.7s] Christian and uh through your personal
[534.1s] expression your words and actions you
[537.1s] realize that uh there's so much that is
[539.4s] is expected from you especially the
[540.9s] people who are from the from the other
[543.4s] side the people who are still attached
[545.2s] to the world who have not given them the
[547.8s] themselves to to
[549.7s] Christ these people when they see you
[554.7s] fall there are some sort statements they
[557.0s] start making like the one that let me
[559.1s] just read here you say behold how these
[560.9s] Christians hate one another if this is
[564.0s] religion we do not want it and they look
[566.8s] upon themselves and they irreligious
[569.7s] characters with great
[571.7s] satisfaction thus they are confirmed in
[574.8s] their imp impenitence and Satan exalt at
[578.9s] his uh success so this is just a
[581.8s] challenge to us that if you have given
[584.2s] your life to Christ live as one who has
[589.7s] the experience of Christ in you so I
[592.8s] just want to ask my brother nick uh what
[596.9s] can you say about uh this chapter this
[600.4s] talks about the greatest need of the
[604.6s] church yes the greatest need of the
[606.8s] church as you say is true Revival and I
[609.8s] felt that there were some things that
[612.1s] were highlighted that are key given that
[615.0s] we are in the time of investigative
[617.6s] judgment also known as the day of
[619.7s] atonement it's important for us to
[621.9s] actually realize that this is the work
[624.2s] where God is actually calling our names
[626.3s] and reviewing our cases before him and
[629.3s] and as we stand before the great
[630.8s] judgment seat of Christ we need to have
[633.8s] had this revival experience because if
[637.5s] our name is called up and we don't seem
[641.0s] to be ready even to meet Jesus we're not
[643.4s] even working to get people into his
[646.0s] kingdom I think that it will be a very
[649.6s] uh bad situation for us because if a
[652.4s] case is brought up against you and the
[654.6s] evidence is on the contrary it means
[657.0s] that you may receive a sentence that you
[658.8s] do not like
[659.9s] so given we in the period of
[662.0s] investigative judgment also known as the
[664.5s] day of atonement it's important for us
[667.4s] to have a Revival in our experience and
[670.0s] it's not just for a certain period of
[672.3s] time but a continual one because we do
[675.0s] not know when our names will be called
[677.0s] up and more importantly we do not know
[679.4s] when we'll die so it's best for us to be
[681.8s] revived to ensure that we may get into
[684.6s] this Promised Land Of
[687.1s] Heaven thank you uh brother Steve do you
[690.2s] have any yeah thank you any contribution
[693.0s] thank you very much uh brother opata and
[695.0s] brother niik I think you've brought it
[697.7s] out um very clearly um and and very
[702.4s] explicitly and and I like when you say
[705.6s] that uh you know the church is you and
[707.7s] me however um the call for reformation
[712.6s] the the call for Revival is independent
[716.3s] you need to um ask the spirit to give
[719.6s] you Revival as an individual before we
[722.8s] go to the church as collective um
[725.8s] congregation and and um this chapter
[729.2s] tells us that spirit of God cannot come
[731.2s] to the church unless the church prepares
[733.5s] the way and how does the church prepare
[735.8s] the way simply by Hest prayers by Hest
[740.6s] request from God for True conversion
[743.8s] because if if if we are not truly
[746.5s] converted and in an Hest way then
[748.9s] there's no way that this promise of of
[751.7s] the power of God or the holy spirit will
[753.8s] fall unto us also reminded that uh
[758.5s] there's nothing that Satan fears um than
[761.6s] than an individual who's truly revived
[764.1s] an individual who filled with the power
[766.6s] of the Holy Spirit and if Satan had his
[770.1s] way if it were up for up up for um up
[773.2s] for him then we would not have another
[777.6s] Revival but this revival is Promised
[780.4s] it's a sure promise from God that the
[782.2s] latter R will indeed come and if we've
[784.5s] been promised this true Revival our only
[787.5s] need and ask from God is that we seek
[790.3s] Him in honest in truth and in spirit and
[793.6s] indeed he will outpour um the Holy
[796.5s] Spirit or the power of the spirit to the
[798.7s] to the church um I think that's what I
[801.5s] would add um to this chapter one thank
[806.0s] you uh
[809.9s] just to summarize the Bible says that
[813.4s] uh the book says he'll use Simple
[816.5s] agencies and we know Bible says that
[819.0s] he'll use the foolish things of the
[820.8s] world to even ashame the the elit so we
[824.8s] here we saying that
[826.3s] uh at no point will the word of God ever
[830.5s] stop because maybe you you're being
[832.8s] regretful you remember even Jesus told
[835.4s] telling the the Pharisees that uh out of
[838.5s] these stones able to raise children for
[840.8s] Abraham so the Bible is very clear that
[844.8s] uh if you're negul the word of God will
[848.4s] never stop he will use anything and
[850.8s] everything to make sure that his word
[852.8s] will always move forward and that brings
[854.9s] the conclusion for chapter chapter one
[858.2s] thank you thank you P so as we've been
[861.4s] going through this there are several
[863.8s] themes that we've talked about the need
[866.0s] of the church the greatest need which is
[868.1s] true Revival
[869.6s] and how we should not open the door to
[872.4s] the adversity and we've been talking
[874.4s] about true Revival I'd like to highlight
[877.4s] two things the first is Revival only
[881.8s] comes in answer to prayer and once the
[885.7s] prayer is answered then we are filled
[887.8s] with the Holy Spirit then we can be
[890.5s] truly
[891.7s] revived then the second thing is that
[895.2s] Revival is always accompanied with a
[898.1s] Reformation
[900.0s] to read it from a statement here to
[902.1s] explain what it is we're told that
[905.1s] Revival and Reformation are two
[907.6s] different things Revival signifies a
[910.8s] renewal of spiritual life a quickening
[913.8s] of the powers of the mind and heart a
[916.2s] resurrection from spiritual death
[919.3s] Reformation signifies a reorganization a
[923.1s] change in ideas and theories habits and
[927.3s] practices
[929.3s] Reformation will not bring forth the
[931.3s] good fruit of righteousness un let
[934.0s] unless it is connected with the Revival
[936.4s] of the spirit and that's why we only can
[939.3s] be revived in answer to prayer amen so
[943.5s] with that we'd like to close this
[945.2s] chapter we'd like to invite you to join
[947.6s] us for next week's chapter which is
[949.9s] going to talk about conversions will are
[952.8s] they fake or real and we'll be able to
[955.6s] identify counterfeits and you'll also be
[958.3s] able to identify the genuine ones

[963.1s] word of prayer thank you let us pray Our
