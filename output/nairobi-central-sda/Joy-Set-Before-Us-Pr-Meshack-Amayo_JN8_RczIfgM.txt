Let us pray. Heavenly Father, it is the time for your son to be glorified. Feeble I am. I stand before your children.

God is doing everything for each of us to be in heaven. It is his desire that all of us as we sit here or as we listen to this sermon today, the Lord is willing to do anything possible so that each one of us will be seated with him in heaven when Christ comes back the second time. And that is why he's following you every day doing all that he can all in his power that each one of us is saved and each one of us will be in heaven. By the way, some of us we think of the second coming of Jesus Christ as just a story. We don't think it is real. Christ is coming back and he must come back and he must save those who are willing to be saved. And I invite you, each one of you, please accept this salvation. Allow me before I start the sermon to do my last tribute to the fallen soldier, Elder Elias. Elder Elias did wonderful things. A man of God. Last Sabbath I came to this church and I just said let me just enter in to confirm that his lesson class he is not there and I confirmed that he was not there and the journey to heaven we will meet a lot of obstacles we will meet challenges but God is doing all in his power that we may be able to be with him in heaven. Some of us we feel that we are just enjoying coming to judge but we don't see something that heaven is prepared for us that we have to achieve. Let us come to the book of Isaiah 53. Sorry, Isaiah 52 verse 13- 15. Isaiah 52 verse starting from verse 13 through 15. And the story here is about a servant of God or a suffering servant. And this story starts from here three verses, three last verses of chapter 52 and the next 12 verses of chapter 53 of Isaiah. It's a story of a suffering servant. And it reads, we first do the three three stanzas of this poem. And this poem says, "Behold, my servant shall deal prudent prudently. He shall be exalted and ex extolled and be very high." Verse 14 is saying he just as many were astonished at at you, so his visage was mad more than any man and his form more than any sons of men. So shall he sprinkle many nations, kings shall shut their mouth at him. For what had not been told them they shall see and what they had not heard they shall consider. We first look at those three verses and verse 13 is saying behold my servant. He shall deal prudently or he shall deal wisely and therefore he shall be exalted and exalt extolled and very high. This verse means that the servant that the prophet is talking about is a servant who will be lifted up. Someone who is lifted up and then magnified. He will be lifted up and then he will be magnified. Therefore, he will be very great. Those descriptions that have been used there, they are they are only used in four places in the book of Isaiah only. Not in any other book of the Bible, but only four places in the book of Isaiah. And they refer to God who is exalted. So this verse is saying behold my servant he shall be wise in his tact of saving the people of God. The servant of God will be wise. By the way this servant of God the identity needs to be known. There might be other identities also. how Israelites understood this word the servant who was the servant but you can't miss to note that this servant is Jesus Christ and therefore it says that Christ in his might and power he will deal with sin so wisely and he will have a good success in dealing with sin he will succeed to deal with sin and therefore after succeeding to deal with sin he will be exalted he will be magnified and he will be very great. But verse 14 brings us again low that this servant who is magnified and very bra people will be astonished because he will be disfigured and his image will be mad and his form more than the sons of man. How comes that that person who is exalted will be disfigured? That is why verse 15 is really saying that it will be a surprise. Let me tell you something small about the book of Isaiah that Isaiah was writing in around 740 740 BC through 680 BC. And as he writes, you find chapter 1-39 is talking about much about the the the the defeat of Israelites by Assyria. And they were defeated, by the way. They were taken captiv captives in 7:22 BC. But again God again from chapter 40 is promising deliverance to the children of Israel. And even he says that when when Babylon will come, God will deliver them. And his mode of deliverance here is where now you find God talking about a servant who will deliver Israel. in your Bible. I know you always love chapter 40. You always encourage people using chapter 40 or encourage yourself when it starts by saying comfort. Yes, comfort my people says your God. God is saying let my people be comforted. Speak comfort to Jerusalem and cry out to her that her welfare sorry her warfare is ended. I'm reading 40:2 her warfare is ended. Her iniquity is pardoned. Tell Israel that her warfare is ended. The iniquity is pardoned. A very great hope that is given to the children of Israel. And that is why he is saying in this book that even youths will run and will grow weary. But those who trust in the Lord will renew their strength day by day. And therefore you find that a the promise of conquering and a servant who will come to conquer is given in the book of Isaiah. If you only look at chapter 42 verse one is saying behold my servant whom I uphold my elect one in whom my soul delights. So we are finding a servant who God delights in him. When you go to verse four of chapter 42, it says he will not fail nor be discouraged. Jesus Christ who is coming to save us, that text is saying that he will not fail, neither will he be discouraged. He will pass through persecutions, but he will not fail. He will never be discouraged. That is the promise that is coming from this servant. Now just because of them we could have done many of them. But it is telling us that the method that God has designed for the salvation of man will not fail. Christ came to save and he will not fail. He must save with success. And therefore when now this uh poem proceeds to 53 verse1 it says that is Isaiah 53:1 the poem proceeds and says who has believed our report and to whom has the arm of the Lord been revealed for he shall shall grow up before him as a tender plant and as a root out of dry ground. He has no form or comeliness. And when we see him, there is no beauty that we should desire him. This these three verses of chapter 3 verse 1-3 you find a long moment of this servant. You found that in the beginning he was dis discussed as someone who is lifted up, someone who is magnified and someone who will be very great. Israelites expected someone who will deliver them from the powers of the enemies and they expected a messiah who will be very great. But now what we are finding is that this man is coming as a plant that is a tender plant that is growing up in a desert. Try to figure out a desert where no vegetation or some very uh some shrubs that can be able to persevere the drought are there. Then a small flowery plant is coming out very beautiful. Do you expect that small flowery plant, that be beautiful plant to grow up and be something? You don't expect any success in that kind of a small thing. And therefore, because you don't expect success, Israelites looked at Jesus Christ and never expected somebody coming in that nature can be able to save them. And therefore Isaiah is writing here in verse one and says by the way we are talking about Jesus Christ and his power. Who has believed that power of Jesus Christ? By the way you are here you always talk about Jesus Christ. Have you believed that power of Jesus Christ? When we look at him he seems to be despised and rejected by women. Do you believe that that man can be able to do great things? And therefore they looked at him and they despised him and they rejected him. Here there is nothing. And therefore they said in verse three, no verse two still, he has no form or comeliness and when we see him there is no beauty that we may be able to desire him. So this that place tells me that when they saw Jesus you know this beauty that is being described that Christ had no beauty might not be the physical appearance but the way we expected to get someone who is our God who is doing for us miracles that we need we go to him we don't expect great miracles that We we expected and therefore he's coming in a lowly manner in a humble way that is not appe appealing to our eyes and therefore you know when a person is beautiful this person will be able to attract naturally his manner of salvation is not attractive to us naturally he tells us to live and avoid many things we don't want to avoid and that one is not appealing to us and then who has believed our report the kind of Jesus we wanted is not what we are seeing in him and therefore verse four is saying he is despised and rejected by men a man of sorrows and acquainted with grief and we we hid as it our faces from him. He was despised and we did not esteem him. This is a confirmation that we despised Christ and we don't esteem him. By the way, in your character, in your daily life, you despise Christ and you don't esteem him because you don't expect somebody who is not bringing things you need. And therefore verse 5 is saying surely he has borne our griefs and carried out our sorrows yet we uh that is verse four still yet we esteemed him stricken smitten by God and afflicted. Verse 5 says but he was wounded for our transgressions. He was bruised for our iniquities and the chastisement for our peace was upon him and by his stripes we are healed. This poem talking about a suffering servant is saying by Christ being striped we are healed. Ladies and gentlemen, by Christ being stricken, we are healed. By his stripes, we are healed. I want us to go and understand about crucifixion. We need to read some statements that will be projected to us about the pain of crucifixion to understand how Christ became lonely and really suffered and crucifixion was a painful way. I request peer uh communication that you can be able to project that Christ went through the most humiliating death that we can ever imagine. It was meant to shame to ashame the person. Let us see the experience of crucifixion. The primary goal of crucifixion was to maximize the victim's suffering through psychological humiliation and physical pain. The torturous nature was intended to leave a lasting impression on the witness acting as a deterrent. If you are a criminal, you would do it again after seeing how the person suffered. And Romans did not invent crucifixion, but they perfected it to produce a slow death with maximum pain and suffering. Yes, you can continue. The victim's back was first torn open by scorging. You remember Christ was whipped, whipped. And then you have wounds at the back. And then the clothing blood was ripped open again where clothes were torn off the victim. When he was thrown on the ground to to nail his hands to the cross beam, the wounds were again torn open and contaminated with that. Then as he hung on the cross with each breath the painful wounds on the back scrapped against the rough wood of the upright beam. You know when you are breathing you you your hands are up there and they are nailed there. You want to catch some breath. It means you have to bring yourself a bit up and then you scratch the wounds against the the wood. When the nail was driven through the wrist, it severed the large media nerve. This stimulated nerve produced excruciating balls of fury pain in both arms and resulted in a claw-like grip in the victim's hand. Very painful. Then beyond that pain, the major effect of crucifixion was inhibiting normal breathing. The weight of the body pulling down on the arms. You are there and only nails here which were driven against the nerves are holding your weight and therefore breathing is not easy. Then pulling down on the arms, the weight of the body pulling down on the arms and shoulders tended to fix the respiratory muscle in an inhalation state and hindered exhalation. The lack of adequate respiration resulted in severe muscle cramps which hindered breathing even further to get good breath. one had to push against the feet. The feet is down. You have to push against the feet so that you can bring yourself up so that you can be able to breathe. To get a good breath, one had to push against the feet and flex the elbows. Pulling from the shoulders, putting the weight of the body on the feet produced searing pain. and flexing the elbows twisted the hands hanging on the nails and therefore lifting the body for a breath also painfully scrubbed the back against the rough wooden post. Each effort to get a proper breath was agonizing, exhausting and led to sooner death. Not commonly. Not uncommonly. Just try to imagine somebody's there with wounds everywhere and and and blood there then insects would come and they want to borrow into those wounds or the eyes and ears they come there and nose of the dying and helpless victim and the birds of prey would tear at these sites. Moreover, it was customary to leave the corpse on the cross to be devoured by predator predatory animals. Last one I think death from crucifixion could come from many sources. Acute shock for blood loss, being too exhausted to breathe any longer, dehydration, stress induced heart attack or congestive heart failure leading to a cardiac rupture. If the victim did not die quickly enough, the legs were broken and the victim was soon unable to breathe. Christ verse 5 is saying Isaiah 53:5 is saying he was wounded for our transgressions. He was bruised for our iniquities. The chastisement for our peace was upon him. and by his stripes we are healed. Christ got a lot of whips. Christ was persecuted. But he was persecuted that you a sinner may go to heaven. All the debts that you owe because of your sins, he paid the penalty by being striped. By his stripes we are healed. It was the most painful type of death and shameful type of death that I may be able to gain eternal life. And therefore in Hebrews 12, in Hebrews 12, the writer of Hebrews writes from verse one and he says, "Therefore we also since we are surrounded by a great cloud of witnesses. Let us lay aside every weight and sin which so easily ens snare us. and let us run with endurance the race that is set before us, looking unto Jesus, the author, the finisher of our faith, who for the joy that was set before him, endured the cross, despising the shame, and has sat down at the right hand of the throne of God. I like when the writer is making a conjunction at the beginning of this that therefore since we have a great cloud of witnesses meaning that he is connecting witnesses that have been talked of in chapter 11. Time is not enough for him to count many people but he has counted a few. Abraham, those faithful people, Noah, Sarah, and many, we can add Elijah, Elisha, we can add Joseph. Time is not enough to count the cloud of witnesses. And he says that therefore since we have we are surrounded by such a great cloud of witnesses. Who are these witnesses? Why are they witnessing? What are they witnessing? You know witnessing witnessing might be just spectators. He is saying let us run because they are witnesses looking at us. Who are the spect these witnesses? Are they spectators? No. These witnesses are witnesses of the faithfulness of God and witnesses of the effectiveness of the faith. You didn't understand that one. These are witnesses of the faithfulness of God. Those people counted in Hebrews 11, they have testified that God is faithful. Those witnesses have testified that our faith is effective. Believe in Jesus. Our faith is effective. And I also love it when the writer uses this it's it's called a pronoun first person plural when he says look at how he uses the word therefore we also we also meaning that he the writer is saying that I am part of this group who are being witnessed to I I am part of this group and you Christians we are part of the group who are to run. So he's saying we therefore since we have we are surrounded by a great cloud of witnesses let us lay aside every weight. There's a lot of weight we carry weight of sin. When you are running the marathon, lay aside every weight so that we may be able to run and succeed. And the sin which so easily ens snares us. And let us run. Let us run with endurance. Before I magnify running with endurance, let me proceed. looking unto Jesus, the author and the finisher of our faith, who for the joy that was set before him endured the cross. the writer. This this book of Hebrews, remember Hebrews was being written to people who are being persecuted and the whole book of Hebrews is to encourage people who are going through persecution to endure. And that is why when even when you start from chapter one is being they are being told that Christ he is God and by the way he is above Moses and by the way he's above Aaron and by the way his order is in the order of Melkisedc and therefore he succeeded. He is the author and the finisher of our faith. So therefore endure. And why did he endure? Is because of the joy that was set before him. Christ saw people who are thieves. Christ saw people who were murderers. Christ saw people who are adulterers. Christ saw people who are immoral in every way. and he saw him himself on the cross and realized that these sinners will be pardoned because of him going to the cross. So because of seeing that that these people will be saved, he endured the cross. He endured the cross because of you. He knew that a lady somewhere will be so deep in sin but one time will recognize that a savior died. So because of that he saw you. He saw you and therefore he endured. And why was he still enduring? Because he looked at the life after that after the cross. He saw the travail of his soul and he was satisfied. When he will come the second time, then those who believed in him, they will awake to the everlasting life. And therefore the graves of the saints will open up. And then we will be caught up in the air and for 7 days we will be ascending the sea of glass. Then on the in the morning we reach the pal gates but just before entering the the city Christ must give us the emblems of victory and the insignia of the royal city. The emblems of victory and the insignas of the royal city. Then we he will himself stop at us. He will have crown for each and every one of us. And with his own right hand he will place crowns on each one of us. Crowns on each one of us having his new name. And on each all the crowns written holiness to the Lord. holiness to the Lord. Then he will give us haps each one of us and we will touch those strings very skillfully and then we will echo with singing and therefore Christ will open to us the wider pal gates and when he open to us the wide pal gates and he bids us enter in the beloved of my father and then we march in the Israel of God who have kept the truth march into the city. And as we march into the city, he takes us to the father. And he tells the father, here I am with the people whom you gave unto me. And after taking us to the father, he will stand to welcome Adam. Then he is standing taller than each one of us, taller than all the angels. And Adam is less taller than less taller than him. Then he stretches his arms to receive Adam, the one who fell. And then Adam sees on his stretched arms the marks of nails on his hands. Then he realizes that he made Christ to go to the cross. He will not fall at the bosom of the savior. He will kneel and cast his crown at Jesus' feet. And then after Jesus will raise him up and takes him on the road and takes him to the to look at the trees. He will see the vines and realize he will realize that this is Eden much more beautiful than the first Eden. This is Eden restored. And after realizing that this is Eden restored, Christ takes him to the tree of life. Christ plucks the fruit of the tree of life. Then Christ places the tree of life in his hand that he may be able to eat. Then before eating he looks around and he sees the multitude of us. Some of us like like dwarfs because he's very tall but some of us like dwarfs. He sees how we fell into sin and the effects of sin on us. And Adam will strike a note on his harp. All of us, we will strike a note. And the voice of heaven will echo with great music singing, "Worthy is the lamb. Worthy is the lamb. Worthy is the lamb who was slain. He is worthy to take the scroll." Therefore, he saw that joy. He saw that joy ahead of time. And because of the joy that was set before him, he endured the cross because he saw the joy ahead of him. Let me tell you this joy he saw in that text in verse two is not saying that the joy was lying ahead of him. But the verse is saying the joy was set before him. To those who shall overcome, joy is not lying ahead of you. God has decided to set to plan joyous occasion for you in heaven. God has set joy for any person who will endure. With a lot of endurance, we will be able to enter heaven. Now, because of the joy that is set ahead of us, let us endure the race. What does that text mean? In this race of heaven, we will go through pains in life. In this walk to heaven, you will find a lot of stresses on the way. Some stresses are through the family. Some stresses are through workplaces. Some stresses are financial. Some stresses are because of sicknesses. We will not be able to overcome them. But God is saying because of the joy that is set ahead of us, let us run with endurance. Persevere till we reach home. Persevere and let us run this race. We are going to overcome. By the way, that servant will not fail. The servant who came to save us, he will not fail. My savior Jesus Christ will not fail. If your heart is for you to enjoy the joy in heaven, there is a joy that he has set before us. You might be going through challenges in life, but because of the joy that Christ has said before you, he understands that you have endured a lot. And he must give you something to make you wipe away all your tears and forget everything you went through. And that is why Christ persevered and he endured the cross till we are assured of our salvation. That is why the greatest promise he is giving unto us. He is telling his disciples are coming forward. He's telling his disciples that I will never drink of this cup with you again. I will never drink it again. Meaning that he's giving a promise. I am going to fast. I will not drink of this vine again till we do I do it a new with you in heaven. He is saying I will do it a new with you in heaven. Endure the race because there is joy that is set before us. Each one of us. How cheering. How cheering. This is song 440. that we may encourage one another. We will may encourage ourselves on the way and therefore we will set aside every weight. Let us rise with Psalm 440.

[131.2s] The sermon title today
[135.4s] is
[136.9s] [Music]
[138.8s] joy
[140.7s] set
[142.2s] before us.
[144.5s] Joy
[146.3s] set
[148.0s] before us.
[152.8s] Saints,
[155.1s] heaven is there for us to achieve.
[160.8s] God is doing everything for each of us
[165.1s] to be in heaven. It is his desire that
[169.4s] all of us as we sit here or as we listen
[173.2s] to this sermon today, the Lord is
[176.1s] willing to do anything possible so that
[179.4s] each one of us will be seated with him
[183.6s] in heaven when Christ comes back the
[186.5s] second time. And that is why he's
[189.8s] following you every day doing all that
[193.3s] he can all in his power that each one of
[197.3s] us is saved and each one of us will be
[201.0s] in heaven. By the way, some of us we
[203.4s] think of the second coming of Jesus
[205.8s] Christ as just a story. We don't think
[208.7s] it is real. Christ is coming back and he
[213.3s] must come back and he must save those
[217.0s] who are willing to be saved. And I
[219.8s] invite you, each one of you, please
[223.6s] accept this salvation.
[227.1s] Allow me before I start the sermon
[231.7s] to do my last tribute
[235.0s] to the fallen soldier, Elder Elias.
[242.2s] Elder Elias
[244.6s] did wonderful things. A man of God. Last
[248.1s] Sabbath I came to this church and I just
[251.3s] said let me just enter in to confirm
[253.8s] that his lesson class he is not there
[258.6s] and I confirmed that he was not there
[262.9s] and
[265.4s] the journey to heaven we will meet a lot
[268.2s] of obstacles
[270.3s] we will meet challenges but God is doing
[274.3s] all in his power
[276.9s] that we may be able to be with him in
[279.4s] heaven. Some of us we feel that we are
[282.4s] just enjoying coming to judge but we
[284.8s] don't see something that heaven is
[287.6s] prepared for us that we have to achieve.
[293.6s] Let us come to the book of Isaiah 53.
[298.8s] Sorry, Isaiah 52
[302.2s] verse 13- 15.
[307.2s] Isaiah 52
[311.3s] verse
[314.8s] starting from verse 13 through 15.
[319.4s] And the story here is about
[323.3s] a servant of God or a suffering servant.
[326.9s] And this story starts from here three
[330.2s] verses, three last verses of chapter 52
[333.3s] and the next 12 verses of chapter 53 of
[337.1s] Isaiah. It's a story of a suffering
[340.4s] servant. And
[345.4s] it reads, we first do the three three
[348.2s] stanzas of this poem. And this poem
[351.3s] says, "Behold, my servant shall deal
[355.0s] prudent prudently. He shall be exalted
[359.4s] and ex extolled
[362.3s] and be very high." Verse 14 is saying
[367.4s] he
[369.8s] just as many were astonished at at you,
[373.6s] so his visage was mad more than any man
[379.0s] and his form more than any sons of men.
[383.0s] So shall he sprinkle many nations, kings
[388.0s] shall shut their mouth at him. For what
[391.8s] had not been told them they shall see
[396.6s] and what they had not heard they shall
[401.8s] consider.
[403.8s] We first look at those three verses and
[406.8s] verse 13 is saying
[410.1s] behold my servant.
[413.8s] He shall deal prudently or he shall deal
[418.4s] wisely
[420.0s] and therefore he shall be exalted
[424.1s] and exalt extolled
[428.5s] and very high. This verse means that the
[433.0s] servant that the prophet is talking
[435.5s] about is a servant who will be lifted
[439.8s] up. Someone who is lifted up and then
[443.9s] magnified.
[445.9s] He will be lifted up and then he will be
[450.6s] magnified.
[452.2s] Therefore, he will be very great. Those
[456.0s] descriptions that have been used there,
[458.3s] they are they are only used in four
[460.6s] places in the book of Isaiah only. Not
[463.8s] in any other book of the Bible, but only
[466.8s] four places in the book of Isaiah. And
[470.3s] they refer to God who is exalted. So
[475.1s] this verse is saying behold my servant
[479.0s] he shall be wise
[482.4s] in his tact of saving the people of God.
[486.6s] The servant of God will be wise. By the
[490.2s] way this servant of God the identity
[494.0s] needs to be known.
[496.6s] There might be other identities also.
[499.7s] how Israelites understood this word the
[503.8s] servant who was the servant but
[508.3s] you can't miss to note that this servant
[510.7s] is Jesus Christ and therefore it says
[513.8s] that Christ in his might and power he
[518.8s] will deal with sin so wisely and he will
[523.4s] have a good success in dealing with sin
[527.2s] he will succeed to deal with sin and
[530.8s] therefore after succeeding to deal with
[533.1s] sin he will be exalted he will be
[537.0s] magnified and he will be very great.
[542.6s] But verse 14 brings us again low
[546.7s] that this servant who is magnified and
[550.2s] very bra
[553.8s] people will be astonished
[556.5s] because he will be disfigured
[561.4s] and his image will be mad
[567.5s] and his form more than the sons of man.
[572.7s] How comes that that person who is
[574.8s] exalted will be disfigured?
[580.0s] That is why verse 15 is really saying
[582.2s] that it will be a surprise.
[584.9s] Let me
[587.0s] tell you something small about the book
[588.7s] of Isaiah
[590.4s] that Isaiah was writing in around 740
[593.9s] 740 BC through 680 BC. And as he writes,
[599.6s] you find chapter 1-39 is talking about
[602.9s] much about the the the the defeat of
[606.7s] Israelites
[608.8s] by Assyria.
[612.1s] And they were defeated, by the way. They
[613.9s] were taken captiv captives in 7:22 BC.
[618.1s] But again God again from chapter 40 is
[622.6s] promising deliverance to the children of
[625.9s] Israel. And even he says that when when
[629.8s] Babylon will come,
[632.3s] God will deliver them. And his mode of
[635.8s] deliverance here is where now you find
[638.4s] God talking about a servant who will
[641.9s] deliver Israel. in your Bible. I know
[644.8s] you always love chapter 40. You always
[648.8s] encourage people using chapter 40 or
[651.5s] encourage yourself when it starts by
[654.4s] saying comfort. Yes, comfort my people
[660.3s] says your God. God is saying let my
[663.1s] people be comforted.
[665.3s] Speak comfort to Jerusalem and cry out
[668.5s] to her that her welfare
[672.2s] sorry her warfare is ended. I'm reading
[676.7s] 40:2 her warfare is ended.
[683.2s] Her iniquity
[685.2s] is pardoned.
[687.1s] Tell Israel that her warfare is ended.
[693.4s] The iniquity
[695.1s] is pardoned.
[697.9s] A very great hope that is given to the
[701.8s] children of Israel. And that is why he
[704.8s] is saying in this book that even youths
[708.4s] will run and will grow weary.
[711.6s] But those who trust in the Lord will
[715.0s] renew their strength day by day. And
[718.5s] therefore you find that a the promise of
[723.0s] conquering
[724.9s] and a servant who will come to conquer
[728.6s] is given in the book of Isaiah.
[732.1s] If you only look at chapter 42 verse one
[735.5s] is saying behold my servant whom I
[739.0s] uphold
[741.3s] my elect one
[744.1s] in whom my soul delights.
[748.3s] So we are finding a servant who God
[751.4s] delights in him.
[753.9s] When you go to verse four of chapter 42,
[756.9s] it says he will not fail
[761.1s] nor be discouraged.
[764.1s] Jesus Christ who is coming to save us,
[767.3s] that text is saying that he will not
[769.3s] fail, neither will he be discouraged.
[773.8s] He will pass through persecutions, but
[776.6s] he will not fail. He will never be
[780.6s] discouraged. That is the promise that is
[784.7s] coming from this servant. Now just
[786.5s] because of them we could have done many
[788.2s] of them.
[790.0s] But it is telling us that the method
[793.8s] that God has designed for the salvation
[796.5s] of man will not fail.
[800.3s] Christ came to save and he will not
[804.0s] fail. He must save with success.
[808.4s] And therefore when now this
[812.2s] uh poem proceeds to 53 verse1 it says
[817.5s] that is Isaiah 53:1
[820.2s] the poem proceeds and says
[825.0s] who has believed our report
[829.4s] and to whom has the arm of the Lord been
[833.8s] revealed
[836.2s] for he shall shall grow up before him as
[840.0s] a tender plant and as a root out of dry
[844.2s] ground. He has no form or comeliness.
[849.8s] And when we see him, there is no beauty
[855.1s] that we should desire him.
[860.6s] This
[862.5s] these three verses of chapter 3 verse
[865.7s] 1-3
[867.4s] you find
[870.2s] a long moment of this servant.
[875.1s] You found that in the beginning he was
[878.0s] dis discussed as someone who is lifted
[882.4s] up, someone who is magnified
[886.5s] and someone who will be very great.
[890.7s] Israelites expected someone who will
[893.5s] deliver them from the powers of the
[896.2s] enemies
[897.8s] and they expected a messiah who will be
[901.6s] very great.
[903.5s] But now what we are finding is that this
[907.0s] man
[909.9s] is coming as a plant
[912.5s] that is a tender plant that is growing
[915.4s] up in a desert. Try to
[920.6s] figure out a desert
[923.8s] where
[927.0s] no vegetation or some very
[931.1s] uh some shrubs that can be able to
[934.2s] persevere the drought are there. Then a
[938.5s] small flowery plant is coming out very
[942.2s] beautiful.
[944.1s] Do you expect that small flowery plant,
[948.1s] that be beautiful plant to grow up and
[951.5s] be something?
[954.0s] You don't expect any success in that
[956.7s] kind of a small thing.
[959.1s] And therefore, because you don't expect
[961.9s] success,
[963.5s] Israelites looked at Jesus Christ and
[966.2s] never expected somebody coming in that
[968.9s] nature can be able to save them. And
[972.2s] therefore
[974.2s] Isaiah is writing here in verse one and
[976.6s] says by the way we are talking about
[979.0s] Jesus Christ and his power. Who has
[981.0s] believed that power of Jesus Christ? By
[983.9s] the way you are here you always talk
[985.5s] about Jesus Christ. Have you believed
[987.8s] that power of Jesus Christ? When we look
[990.7s] at him he seems to be despised and
[993.5s] rejected by women.
[996.2s] Do you believe that that man can be able
[999.3s] to do great things? And therefore they
[1003.8s] looked at him and they despised him and
[1005.8s] they rejected him. Here there is
[1007.4s] nothing.
[1009.2s] And therefore
[1012.5s] they said in verse three,
[1016.7s] no verse two still,
[1020.5s] he has no form or comeliness
[1025.6s] and when we see him there is no beauty
[1029.7s] that we may be able to desire him. So
[1034.5s] this that place tells me that when they
[1039.1s] saw Jesus
[1041.1s] you know this beauty that is being
[1043.8s] described that Christ had no beauty
[1047.6s] might not be the physical appearance
[1051.0s] but the way we expected to get someone
[1054.2s] who is our God who is doing for us
[1056.9s] miracles that we need we go to him we
[1059.8s] don't expect great miracles that We we
[1062.3s] expected and therefore he's coming in a
[1064.9s] lowly manner in a humble way that is not
[1068.5s] appe appealing to our eyes and therefore
[1074.1s] you know when a person is beautiful this
[1077.5s] person will be able to attract naturally
[1081.0s] his manner of salvation is not
[1083.4s] attractive to us naturally
[1086.7s] he tells us to live and avoid many
[1091.7s] things we don't want to avoid and that
[1094.1s] one is not appealing to us
[1098.2s] and then who has believed our report
[1102.6s] the kind of Jesus we wanted is not what
[1105.2s] we are seeing in him
[1107.8s] and therefore verse four is saying he is
[1111.0s] despised and rejected by men a man of
[1114.2s] sorrows and acquainted with grief and we
[1118.1s] we hid as it
[1120.9s] our faces from him. He was despised and
[1125.3s] we did not esteem him. This is a
[1128.6s] confirmation that we despised Christ and
[1132.0s] we don't esteem him. By the way, in your
[1135.1s] character, in your daily life, you
[1137.3s] despise Christ and you don't esteem him
[1141.0s] because you don't expect somebody who is
[1143.0s] not bringing things you need.
[1146.8s] And therefore
[1148.6s] verse 5 is saying surely
[1153.4s] he has borne our griefs
[1157.1s] and carried out our sorrows
[1160.4s] yet we uh that is verse four still yet
[1163.8s] we esteemed him stricken smitten by God
[1167.8s] and afflicted. Verse 5 says
[1171.4s] but he was wounded for our
[1174.3s] transgressions.
[1175.9s] He was bruised for our iniquities and
[1180.2s] the chastisement for our peace was upon
[1184.1s] him
[1185.7s] and by his stripes
[1189.5s] we are healed.
[1194.1s] This poem talking about a suffering
[1196.4s] servant is saying by Christ being
[1200.4s] striped
[1202.2s] we are healed.
[1205.8s] Ladies and gentlemen,
[1208.5s] by Christ being stricken,
[1216.1s] we are healed. By his stripes,
[1220.4s] we are healed.
[1223.0s] I want us to go and understand about
[1225.8s] crucifixion.
[1227.8s] We need to read some statements that
[1231.2s] will be projected to us about
[1235.8s] the pain
[1237.7s] of crucifixion
[1241.0s] to understand
[1243.8s] how Christ
[1246.0s] became lonely
[1248.6s] and really suffered
[1251.6s] and
[1254.3s] crucifixion was a painful way.
[1258.1s] I request peer uh
[1262.1s] communication that you can be able to
[1263.7s] project
[1269.4s] that Christ
[1271.7s] went through the most humiliating
[1275.4s] death
[1277.0s] that we can ever imagine. It was meant
[1280.4s] to shame to ashame the person. Let us
[1284.2s] see the experience of crucifixion.
[1288.8s] The primary goal of crucifixion
[1291.9s] was to maximize the victim's suffering
[1295.8s] through psychological humiliation and
[1298.9s] physical pain. The torturous nature was
[1303.0s] intended to leave a lasting impression
[1306.5s] on the witness acting as a deterrent. If
[1310.1s] you are a criminal, you would do it
[1312.2s] again after seeing how the person
[1313.8s] suffered.
[1315.7s] And Romans did not invent crucifixion,
[1319.2s] but they perfected it to produce a slow
[1323.0s] death with maximum pain and suffering.
[1328.6s] Yes, you can continue. The victim's back
[1331.9s] was first torn open by scorging. You
[1335.0s] remember Christ was whipped, whipped.
[1337.5s] And then you have wounds at the back.
[1340.0s] And then the clothing blood was ripped
[1342.6s] open again where clothes were torn off
[1345.5s] the victim. When he was thrown on the
[1348.1s] ground to to nail his hands to the cross
[1351.8s] beam, the wounds were again torn open
[1354.4s] and contaminated with that. Then as he
[1357.6s] hung on the cross with each breath the
[1362.3s] painful wounds on the back scrapped
[1366.6s] against the rough wood
[1369.9s] of the upright beam. You know when you
[1372.5s] are breathing you you your hands are up
[1375.2s] there and they are nailed there. You
[1377.5s] want to catch some breath. It means you
[1379.4s] have to bring yourself a bit up and then
[1382.3s] you scratch the wounds against the the
[1384.5s] wood.
[1386.4s] When the nail was driven through the
[1390.3s] wrist, it severed
[1393.8s] the large media nerve.
[1396.8s] This stimulated nerve
[1402.0s] produced
[1403.7s] excruciating balls of fury pain in both
[1407.8s] arms
[1409.4s] and resulted in a claw-like grip in the
[1413.1s] victim's hand. Very painful.
[1417.3s] Then
[1419.9s] beyond that pain, the major effect of
[1422.8s] crucifixion was inhibiting
[1426.6s] normal breathing.
[1429.6s] The weight of the body pulling down on
[1432.2s] the arms. You are there and only nails
[1435.4s] here which were driven against the
[1438.4s] nerves
[1440.1s] are holding your weight
[1442.9s] and therefore
[1446.0s] breathing is not easy.
[1449.8s] Then pulling down on the arms, the
[1452.6s] weight of the body pulling down on the
[1454.5s] arms and shoulders tended to fix the
[1457.9s] respiratory muscle in an inhalation
[1461.3s] state and hindered exhalation. The lack
[1466.0s] of adequate respiration resulted in
[1469.5s] severe muscle cramps
[1473.2s] which hindered breathing even further to
[1476.8s] get good breath.
[1479.1s] one had to push against the feet. The
[1481.9s] feet is down. You have to push against
[1483.9s] the feet so that you can bring yourself
[1486.4s] up so that you can be able to breathe.
[1492.2s] To get a good breath, one had to push
[1494.6s] against the feet and flex the elbows.
[1497.8s] Pulling from the shoulders, putting the
[1500.5s] weight of the body on the feet produced
[1505.3s] searing pain. and flexing the elbows
[1508.3s] twisted the hands hanging on the nails
[1512.3s] and therefore
[1514.7s] lifting the body for a breath also
[1516.7s] painfully scrubbed the back against the
[1518.6s] rough wooden post. Each effort to get a
[1522.2s] proper breath was agonizing,
[1526.3s] exhausting
[1528.1s] and led to sooner death.
[1532.6s] Not commonly. Not uncommonly. Just try
[1536.2s] to imagine somebody's there with wounds
[1538.3s] everywhere and and and blood there then
[1541.8s] insects would come and they want to
[1544.2s] borrow into those wounds
[1547.8s] or the eyes and ears they come there and
[1550.6s] nose
[1552.1s] of the dying
[1554.3s] and helpless victim
[1557.4s] and the birds of prey would tear at
[1562.1s] these sites.
[1563.9s] Moreover,
[1565.4s] it was customary to leave the corpse on
[1568.2s] the cross to be devoured by predator
[1571.9s] predatory animals.
[1574.2s] Last one I think death from crucifixion
[1577.7s] could come from many sources. Acute
[1580.3s] shock for blood loss, being too
[1582.9s] exhausted to breathe any longer,
[1585.4s] dehydration, stress induced heart attack
[1588.6s] or congestive heart failure leading to a
[1591.8s] cardiac rupture. If the victim did not
[1595.1s] die quickly enough, the legs were broken
[1598.6s] and the victim was soon unable to
[1602.6s] breathe.
[1605.8s] Christ verse 5 is saying Isaiah 53:5 is
[1611.0s] saying
[1615.4s] he was wounded for our transgressions.
[1621.1s] He was bruised for our iniquities.
[1626.6s] The chastisement for our peace was upon
[1629.7s] him. and by his stripes we are healed.
[1635.4s] Christ got a lot of whips.
[1639.5s] Christ was persecuted.
[1642.6s] But he was persecuted that you a sinner
[1645.5s] may go to heaven.
[1648.3s] All the debts that you owe because of
[1652.6s] your sins, he paid the penalty by being
[1656.8s] striped. By his stripes we are healed.
[1661.8s] It was the most painful type of death
[1665.4s] and shameful type of death that I may be
[1669.4s] able to gain eternal life. And therefore
[1673.5s] in Hebrews 12,
[1677.4s] in Hebrews 12,
[1680.2s] the writer of Hebrews
[1684.9s] writes from verse one and he says,
[1691.0s] "Therefore
[1693.9s] we also
[1697.0s] since we are surrounded
[1699.8s] by a great cloud of witnesses.
[1706.9s] Let us lay aside every weight and sin
[1712.0s] which so easily ens snare us.
[1716.5s] and let us run with endurance the race
[1720.1s] that is set before us, looking unto
[1723.7s] Jesus, the author, the finisher of our
[1727.0s] faith, who for the joy
[1731.0s] that was set before him,
[1734.2s] endured the cross,
[1737.8s] despising the shame,
[1742.0s] and has
[1744.0s] sat down
[1746.2s] at the right hand of the throne of God.
[1753.9s] I like when
[1756.2s] the writer is making a conjunction at
[1759.9s] the beginning of this that therefore
[1764.5s] since we have a great cloud of witnesses
[1768.2s] meaning that he is connecting witnesses
[1771.3s] that have been talked of in chapter 11.
[1775.4s] Time is not enough for him to count many
[1777.8s] people but he has counted a few.
[1780.2s] Abraham, those faithful people, Noah,
[1784.6s] Sarah, and many, we can add Elijah,
[1788.7s] Elisha, we can add Joseph.
[1792.3s] Time is not enough to count the cloud of
[1795.1s] witnesses. And he says that therefore
[1798.2s] since we have we are surrounded by such
[1801.0s] a great cloud of witnesses. Who are
[1803.5s] these witnesses? Why are they
[1805.1s] witnessing? What are they witnessing?
[1807.6s] You know witnessing witnessing might be
[1810.6s] just spectators. He is saying let us run
[1813.6s] because they are witnesses looking at
[1815.3s] us. Who are the spect these witnesses?
[1818.1s] Are they spectators?
[1820.0s] No. These witnesses are witnesses
[1823.3s] of the faithfulness of God and witnesses
[1827.4s] of the effectiveness of the faith.
[1832.1s] You didn't understand that one. These
[1834.6s] are witnesses
[1837.0s] of the faithfulness of God.
[1842.2s] Those people counted in Hebrews 11,
[1846.3s] they have testified that God is
[1850.1s] faithful.
[1851.8s] Those witnesses have testified that our
[1855.6s] faith is effective.
[1858.4s] Believe in Jesus. Our faith is
[1860.6s] effective. And I also love it when the
[1863.2s] writer
[1864.9s] uses this
[1867.5s] it's it's called
[1869.8s] a pronoun
[1872.6s] first person plural when he says look at
[1877.2s] how he uses the word therefore
[1880.4s] we also we also meaning that he the
[1884.4s] writer is saying that I am part of this
[1887.0s] group who are being witnessed to
[1890.6s] I I am part of this group and you
[1893.1s] Christians we are part of the group who
[1896.2s] are to run. So he's saying
[1899.8s] we therefore
[1901.8s] since we have we are surrounded by a
[1904.6s] great cloud of witnesses let us lay
[1907.4s] aside every weight.
[1909.8s] There's a lot of weight we carry weight
[1911.9s] of sin.
[1913.8s] When you are running the marathon, lay
[1916.0s] aside every weight
[1918.6s] so that we may be able to run and
[1920.3s] succeed.
[1922.0s] And the sin which so easily ens snares
[1925.2s] us. And let us run. Let us run with
[1931.8s] endurance.
[1936.1s] Before I magnify running with endurance,
[1941.8s] let me proceed.
[1945.8s] looking unto Jesus,
[1949.6s] the author and the finisher of our
[1951.9s] faith, who for the joy that was set
[1956.6s] before him
[1958.8s] endured the cross.
[1969.0s] the writer. This this book of Hebrews,
[1973.2s] remember
[1975.1s] Hebrews was being written to people who
[1977.5s] are being persecuted
[1979.8s] and the whole book of Hebrews is to
[1982.2s] encourage people who are going through
[1983.8s] persecution to endure.
[1987.1s] And that is why when even when you start
[1989.0s] from chapter one is being they are being
[1990.7s] told that Christ he is God and by the
[1994.8s] way he is above Moses and by the way
[1997.9s] he's above Aaron and by the way his
[2000.8s] order is in the order of Melkisedc
[2003.4s] and therefore he succeeded. He is the
[2006.8s] author and the finisher of our faith. So
[2010.2s] therefore endure.
[2012.3s] And why did he endure? Is because of the
[2015.8s] joy that was set before him. Christ saw
[2021.1s] people who are thieves.
[2024.3s] Christ saw people who were murderers.
[2027.2s] Christ saw people who are adulterers.
[2029.9s] Christ saw people who are immoral in
[2032.6s] every way. and he saw him himself on the
[2037.2s] cross
[2038.8s] and realized that these sinners will be
[2041.8s] pardoned because of him going to the
[2045.2s] cross.
[2046.9s] So because of seeing that that these
[2049.4s] people will be saved, he endured the
[2053.4s] cross. He endured the cross because of
[2056.6s] you. He knew that a lady somewhere will
[2060.6s] be so deep in sin but one time will
[2063.9s] recognize that a savior died. So because
[2067.1s] of that he saw you. He saw you and
[2071.1s] therefore he endured.
[2074.2s] And why was he still enduring? Because
[2078.0s] he looked at the life after that after
[2081.3s] the cross.
[2083.3s] He saw the travail of his soul and he
[2087.3s] was satisfied.
[2089.4s] When
[2092.2s] he will come
[2094.4s] the second time,
[2098.6s] then
[2100.7s] those who believed in him,
[2103.7s] they will awake to the everlasting life.
[2107.3s] And therefore the graves of the saints
[2110.5s] will open up. And then we will be caught
[2114.1s] up in the air and for 7 days we will be
[2117.4s] ascending the sea of glass. Then on the
[2120.3s] in the morning we reach the pal gates
[2123.8s] but just before entering the the city
[2127.3s] Christ must give us
[2130.6s] the emblems of victory and the insignia
[2134.6s] of the royal city.
[2137.3s] The emblems of victory and the insignas
[2140.0s] of the royal city. Then we he will
[2143.4s] himself
[2145.2s] stop at us. He will have crown for each
[2148.3s] and every one of us. And with his own
[2151.4s] right hand he will place crowns on each
[2155.8s] one of us. Crowns on each one of us
[2159.5s] having his new name. And on each all the
[2164.8s] crowns written
[2167.0s] holiness to the Lord. holiness to the
[2171.2s] Lord. Then he will give us haps each one
[2174.3s] of us and we will touch those strings
[2177.8s] very skillfully
[2179.7s] and then we will echo with singing and
[2182.5s] therefore Christ will open to us the
[2186.0s] wider pal gates and when he open to us
[2188.6s] the wide pal gates and he bids us
[2193.4s] enter in
[2195.7s] the beloved of my father and then we
[2198.6s] march in the Israel of God who have kept
[2203.4s] the truth march into the city. And as we
[2207.5s] march into the city, he takes us
[2214.6s] to the father. And he tells the father,
[2218.2s] here I am with the people whom you gave
[2221.4s] unto me. And after taking us to the
[2224.6s] father,
[2227.4s] he will stand to welcome Adam. Then he
[2232.2s] is standing taller than each one of us,
[2234.5s] taller than all the angels. And Adam is
[2237.4s] less taller than less taller than him.
[2240.2s] Then he stretches his arms to receive
[2244.9s] Adam,
[2246.7s] the one who fell. And then Adam sees on
[2250.8s] his stretched arms
[2253.0s] the marks of nails
[2257.4s] on his hands.
[2259.4s] Then he realizes that he made Christ to
[2262.5s] go to the cross. He will not fall at the
[2265.5s] bosom of the savior. He will kneel and
[2268.6s] cast his crown at Jesus' feet. And then
[2272.2s] after Jesus will raise him up and takes
[2275.4s] him on the road and takes him to the to
[2278.4s] look at the trees. He will see the vines
[2281.1s] and realize he will realize that this is
[2284.0s] Eden much more beautiful than the first
[2287.6s] Eden. This is Eden restored. And after
[2291.4s] realizing that this is Eden restored,
[2293.7s] Christ takes him to the tree of life.
[2296.1s] Christ plucks the fruit of the tree of
[2298.1s] life. Then Christ places the tree of
[2300.5s] life in his hand that he may be able to
[2302.8s] eat. Then before eating he looks around
[2306.5s] and he sees the multitude of us. Some of
[2309.8s] us like like dwarfs
[2312.7s] because he's very tall but some of us
[2314.8s] like dwarfs. He sees how we fell into
[2318.2s] sin and the effects of sin on us.
[2322.6s] And Adam
[2324.8s] will strike a note on his harp. All of
[2328.8s] us, we will strike a note. And the voice
[2332.0s] of heaven will echo with great music
[2335.0s] singing, "Worthy is the lamb. Worthy is
[2339.0s] the lamb. Worthy is the lamb who was
[2342.6s] slain. He is worthy to take the scroll."
[2348.4s] Therefore, he saw that joy.
[2352.4s] He saw that joy ahead of time. And
[2355.4s] because of the joy that was set before
[2357.8s] him, he endured the cross because he saw
[2362.8s] the joy ahead of him.
[2365.7s] Let me tell you
[2368.2s] this joy he saw in that text in verse
[2371.7s] two is not saying that the joy was lying
[2374.6s] ahead of him.
[2377.4s] But the verse is saying the joy was set
[2383.0s] before him.
[2388.6s] To those who shall overcome,
[2391.8s] joy is not lying ahead of you. God has
[2395.5s] decided to set to plan joyous occasion
[2399.4s] for you in heaven. God has set joy for
[2404.4s] any person who will endure.
[2407.8s] With a lot of endurance, we will be able
[2410.1s] to enter heaven. Now, because of the joy
[2413.8s] that is set ahead of us,
[2417.4s] let us endure the race.
[2422.1s] What does that text mean?
[2424.7s] In this race of heaven, we will go
[2428.2s] through pains in life.
[2432.3s] In this walk to heaven, you will find a
[2436.6s] lot of stresses on the way.
[2440.6s] Some stresses are through the family.
[2443.8s] Some stresses are through workplaces.
[2446.6s] Some stresses are financial. Some
[2449.0s] stresses are because of sicknesses. We
[2451.6s] will not be able to overcome them. But
[2454.9s] God is saying because of the joy that is
[2458.1s] set ahead of us,
[2460.5s] let us run with endurance.
[2464.2s] Persevere till we reach home. Persevere
[2467.8s] and let us run this race. We are going
[2471.5s] to overcome. By the way, that servant
[2474.3s] will not fail. The servant who came to
[2477.3s] save us, he will not fail. My savior
[2481.4s] Jesus Christ will not fail. If your
[2484.2s] heart is for you to enjoy the joy in
[2487.9s] heaven, there is a joy that he has set
[2490.2s] before us.
[2493.0s] You might be going through challenges in
[2494.9s] life,
[2501.1s] but because of the joy that Christ has
[2503.6s] said before you,
[2507.6s] he understands that you have endured a
[2509.7s] lot.
[2512.2s] And he must give you something
[2515.1s] to make you wipe away all your tears and
[2518.5s] forget everything you went through.
[2521.7s] And that is why Christ persevered
[2525.2s] and he endured the cross
[2528.8s] till we are assured of our salvation.
[2533.0s] That is why the greatest promise he is
[2535.8s] giving unto us. He is telling his
[2537.9s] disciples
[2540.5s] are coming forward. He's telling his
[2542.8s] disciples
[2546.2s] that
[2548.4s] I will never drink of this cup
[2553.0s] with you again.
[2555.1s] I will never drink it again.
[2559.0s] Meaning that he's giving a promise.
[2562.1s] I am going to fast.
[2565.0s] I will not drink of this vine again
[2569.0s] till we do I do it a new with you in
[2572.8s] heaven. He is saying I will do it a new
[2575.7s] with you in heaven.
[2578.6s] Endure the race
[2580.9s] because there is joy that is set before
[2584.6s] us. Each one of us. How cheering. How
[2588.4s] cheering. This is song 440.
[2595.0s] that we may encourage one another. We
[2597.1s] will may encourage ourselves on the way
[2600.6s] and therefore we will set aside every
[2603.6s] weight.
[2607.5s] Let us rise with Psalm 440.
