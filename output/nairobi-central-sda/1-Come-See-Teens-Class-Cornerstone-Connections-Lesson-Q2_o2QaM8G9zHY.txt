FULL TRANSCRIPT:
Good morning, good afternoon, good evening to you wherever you're joining us from. Welcome to the second quarter of this year of the cornerstone lesson. Our theme for this quarter is boundless freedom as you can see from behind us. And today we're doing lesson one, come and see. But before we begin, I'd like to introduce our panelists and then we can have a word of prayer from the father's left. Uh my name is Omir. My name is Ariana Kima. My name is Amy and my name is Jonan Mana. I'll be moderating this panel. I'd like to ask Ariana to offer a word of prayer. We begin. Okay, let's bow down for a word of prayer. Our kind and heavenly father, we thank you for this day. Thank you for the gift of life. Thank you for helping us to be here today. as we're about to start this panel discussion. Lord, I pray that you may help us to understand and speak through us Lord Father for I pray in Jesus name. Amen. Amen. Amen. Thank you. This year we're studying the life of Jesus and in quarter it started all the way from the birth of Jesus as he grew up in his early ministry. And the second quarter we're going further deeper into Christ's ministry here on earth. And today's lesson is a very intriguing one, very common to most of us. It's Samaritan woman. You know, come and see, hence the title. And um the Samaritans, I know it's a question to most of us. Where do these people come from? Okay, so let me just give a brief background. When the Israelites went to exile in Babylon, there's a group that remained behind. Now, that group are the ones who are known as the Samitans. Now what's happened to them is they got hopeless because the temple's destroyed. The ark of the covenant is gone. They felt like there's no hope in Israel anymore and God had left them. So they mingled with the tribes that were surrounding them and they started making idols to remind them of the God that they had. So when the Jews actually came back to their land, they found a very different practice from these Samaritans who are also Jews. So when the Jews were rebuilding the walls of Jerusalem and the temple during the time of Nehemiah, Samaritans wanted to help them out, but the Jews said, "Nope, we cannot mingle with you because you've defiled yourselves by worshiping idols." And that is where the enemity started between the two groups. So we'll just go straight into our lesson today. I think we'll start with the key text. I'd like to ask Omari to read the key text for us. You can open your Bibles. That's John 4 verse 28-30. John 4:28-30. Uh the key text says as he said John 4:28-30, then leaving her water jar, the woman went back to the town and said to the people, "Come see a man who told me everything I ever did. Could this be the Messiah?" They came out of town and made their way toward him. Mhm. Thank you for that. That that just gives a brief summary of what what's going to happen in our story today. Before we get into it, uh let us read the flashlight. See what Ellen White says concerning our story. Like to ask Ariana to read that. The flashlight. Okay. The flashlight. As soon as she had found the savior, the Samaritan woman brought others to him. She proved herself a more effective missionary than his own disciples. The disciples saw nothing in Samaria to indicate that it was an encouraging field. Their thoughts were fixed up upon a great work to be done in the future. They did not see the right around them was a harvest to be gathered. But through the woman whom they despised, the whole a whole city full were brought to hear the savior, the desire of ages, page 195. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you for reading that, Rihanna. which will actually just lead us into the next parts of our lesson. So the Jews who the disciples of Jesus were all Jews, right? The Jews were very discriminatory people. They had a feeling of self-importance around them. Okay? And when you when you have a certain upper hand to a group, you are always going to tend to bully them or keep yourself separate from them. I think there's a story Amy would like to give us about such an illustration about how people can be prejudiced towards others. Amy. Okay. So about 30 years ago in response to the assassination of Martin Luther King Jr. an American teacher developed a simple classroom exercise to illustrate the power of prejudice. So she told her children that children with blue eyes have are special and more intelligent. And so throughout that single day um the children with blue eyes would bully and look down upon the students with brown eyes. And the children with brown eyes would feel fearful, shy and essentially not feel their self worth. And this happened in one day. So the next day the teacher said um okay what I told you was wrong. Um it's actually people with brown eyes that are more intelligent. And so the same thing happened in reverse. So the browneyed kids looked down upon blue-eyed children. So this experience opened students eyes both blue and brown to the power of prejudice and the divisions we create between people. Just like the Jews and Samaritans in Jesus days, we tend to divide people based off of race, religion, color, ethnicity, and essentially put barriers between people. um we decide who's in, who's out, who's cool and who's not. And so Jesus saw past all these barriers and he chooses his followers from every race, background, culture essentially, and he asks us to look past those barriers as well. Thank you for that, Amy. Yeah. So Christ is not a discriminator of persons. And uh it's the same thing that God said in the book of 1 Samuel when Samuel was anointing David when he was looking for the next king of Israel. Samuel was also looking at the outward appearance. It's a thing with human beings. Okay? We discriminate people based on how they look. But um Christ does not discriminate people and he looks at the heart, right? Um so the disciples of Jesus they had this same prejudice and partly is because they felt they were not well equipped to reach out to certain people. So to the what do you think section let us answer some questions about that so that we can understand really what does it take to be a witness for Jesus. Ariana. So the what do you think section, which of the following things do you think are necessary to be a witness for Jesus? Check any that you think apply. A person who wants to witness for Jesus should have read the entire Bible, be baptized, have finished high school, love Jesus, be born again, be able to lead a Bible study, go to church regularly. So, I'll ask Amy what she thinks applies. Um, okay. So, I would go with love Jesus. Um, be able to lead a Bible study and go to church regularly. So, I will speak on going to church regularly. Um, going to church regularly essentially helps you foster a constant connection with God and be able to have the Holy Spirit within you. Cuz if you don't go to church, you're essentially not letting the Holy Spirit work in you and that way you cannot help other people as well. So go to church regularly, foster a relationship and then love Jesus as well. It's super important. Yeah. Yes. How about uh I think what really stands out is loving Jesus to me because we know that you know God is love and love is the root of everything in Christianity and okay this woman the Samaritan woman I don't know if she did love him at that point as she was being told but then she was curious and she wanted to find out more about the truth and it's not listed here but I think wanting to know more about the truth is also very important thank you teacher Jonahan um I think I'd rather let you go first tell us what you and then I can give my points yeah okay so loving Jesus being baptized I feel like um baptism is giving our lives to Jesus Christ and when we have accepted Jesus to take over in our lives then we can be able to be a witness for him. Yes. So I think being baptized is the one that I think applies. Okay. Uh thank you Ariana for that. Uh quick question. What do you guys understand by the word witnessing or what does it mean to be a witness? Um, okay. Can I go first? I think witnessing is being present at a scene and having seen everything that has happened. All right. At that particular scene. Yeah. So, you're practically telling something you saw or something you experienced. Yes. Okay. So if we use that um definition of witnessing and apply to witnessing for Christ, we can say that to be a witness of Christ, you need to have had an encounter with Jesus. Yeah. Okay. So all it takes is actually just having an encounter with Jesus, right? All those things you said really true, very important for witnessing. But the main thing that you need to witness for Christ is just having an experience with him. Have you met Jesus? Um, have you had a miracle in your life? That's all it takes to witness. Now, most preachers, they are usually taught or trained on how to give a witness statement in like two, three minutes to convince someone. At times, that's not enough because people take time to connect with each other. So, the best way to witness to someone is one have a connection with them. You know, we get a shared experience, have some some common ground. We'll see that into the story section. How Jesus did it. And then number two, just share about what Jesus has done in your life. The most powerful sermon someone can ever preach is something about your life, something that has happened to you. That is why in very many sermons, very many preachers usually use stories or illustrations. You know, there was someone who this happened to in a certain area so that it can go verify the story later on. There's something very powerful about someone experiencing or knowing that you have gone through something and I have the chance to go through the same. So this is just a call to us that you can witness for God. All you need is just to have a personal experience with him. That is all it takes. Yeah. All right. So um I'll ask Omari just read the did you know session just to have a better understanding of the Samaritans. The Samaritans were a group of people living to the north of the land of Judea in Jesus' time. Samaritans believed they were the descendants of the northern tribes of Israel who had remained in the land after most of their people had been taken into captivity to Babylon by Nebuchadnezzar. Jews believe the Samaritans were descendants of Gentiles who had had settled there after the Babylonian conquest. Whatever their origins, Samaritans worshiped the God of Israel, but had many customs and traditions different from the Jews. They were viewed by most Jews as being an inferior class of people. And the Jews of Jesus' time would have nothing to do with Samaritans just as they would have nothing to do with Gentiles. Thanks for that, Amari. Um, in the Israelite culture in the olden days, there was a lot of discrimination, right? Especially the Jews towards other people. They were the chosen generation. They were the people who um their their forefather wrestled with God and actually won. That's the only guy who's ever done that. You know, I'm just remembering this is just to a bit off the topic. came across a story one time I think just a few days ago about how the reaction of people to seeing angels right Manoah saw an angel he got really terrified and then later on he he was he was dumb but he quickly speak because he not believe what the angel said Gideon saw an angel he he offered an offering he I mean he gave an offering um so many guys when they saw angels they just were really terrified but then Jacob this guy meets an angel at night and he's like Bro, let's fight. Let's fight. So, this is the kind of tribe. That's the mentality they had that we can wrestle with God. We can wrestle with anyone else. So, they were very um their egos really inflated. So, they just look down upon everyone. Question to us, if Jesus were was living in our time, which groups do you think we have discriminated that Jesus will go and talk to? Eg was living in our day right now. There are those guys who in our in our Christians, let's say as Christians, as Adventists, there's some people who we might look down upon or we think salvation is out of reach for them or we cannot talk to those people because I mean why? Okay. When we going out for missions, do you know people tend to discriminate who they'll reach out to? When we give you books, Amy, and we tell you, walked in the streets of Nairobi and just distribute these books to people. You'll be very picky about the people you subconsciously actually, it's not consciously thinking about it. So, you might just go find well-dressed person. You think if I give this one, it might help him. Then you find someone who's shabily dressed, you're like this one may just tear up the book. So are there any groups in our society that we have really marginalized right now? I would say that people who are living in seen that can be thought of as like so like off-putting by society like people who are in the LGBTQ community or people who are deep into drugs. and want to avoid them. Yeah. But then knowing Jesus, talking to tax collectors who are like the off-putting group of the day, I think he would be interacting with them trying to help them. Yeah. Thanks for that. That's actually one of the groups that people really discriminate these days, Christians especially. You know, um we tend to judge people based on the sins that they have. But Jesus' example shows that we can go beyond boundaries that we have set up as human beings and just reach out to people. So uh we'll just get a brief summary of what the story is all about. I think I'll ask um just give us a summary of what really happened, what how the encounter of Jesus with Samaritan woman went. Uh so Jesus goes to draw water. At this time he wasn't with his disciples and he sees a Samaritan woman there. He asks her for some water to drink and the Samaritan woman gets confused wondering why would this you know a Jew and a man be asking me for water cuz you know at this time as you have said Jews and Samaritans didn't really interact and also women didn't interact much with men outside of you know their immediate family. Mhm. So now Jesus keeps on you know he has already asked her for water and now she eventually she Jesus asks her about her husband. M she says that she doesn't have a husband. But Jesus responds that you have five husbands and the man that you're living with now isn't your husband. He's not one of the five. And now this, you know, this would be startling because you've just been told about your life by someone you've never met before. But she takes it positively and goes around telling people there's this man that you know has told me all I've ever did, all I've ever done. And that's even the source of the title of this story. Mhm. And now she tells people, they come to talk to him and they see that really this man is is special. And I forgot to add as Jesus is asking her for water. He says if you knew who you are talking to, you'd ask him for water and he he'd give you the living water. She asks him where water that you can't you would get thirsty after drinking it. She asks him where she can get that water and he tells her that he is the Messiah. Yeah. So talk about the story. All right. Thank you for that. Um yes. So that is basically the story of what we reading today. And if you just happen to go to the next verses or that's John chapter 4, you'll get that the disciples came back and they found Jesus talking to a woman and they were skeptical like you sent us away so that you just you know talk talk to a woman. They really had judgmental looks on their faces, but they the mission that this woman accomplished, the people that she brought to Christ were way more than the disciples had brought at that time. Yeah. And um this further emphasizes what we're talking about what it takes to be a witness. Just having an encounter with Jesus, that's all it takes. And she brought a whole village to Christ. So we'll answer a few questions in the out of the story. out of the story section. Okay. So, uh what do you think Jesus meant by living water? What did Jesus what do you think Jesus meant by saying I am the living water or I will give you the of the living water? These girls are literally standing next to a well. And this this is one of one of the oldest wells. This wall was dug by Jacob when he was still roaming around. And this woman knew there's no one greater than Jacob because he's the founding father of the Israelite nation. Then comes up this young man who's just 30 and he says he's the living water. What do you think Christ meant by saying he's the living water? But I think living water has to do with something you would use more say eternally or it does not quench temporary thirst more spiritual thirst. Yeah. And yeah. Um in many thank you for that. In many analogies that Christ um uses, most of them are found from the book of John. Christ is known as the living water. He's right and woman. Christ is also known as the bread of life. You know, he's the way, the truth, and the life as well. He's the light. Um Christ was revealing himself to the people. Let me take you guys back a bit. When Jesus was talking to his disciples, he asked them a very simple question. Who do you guys think I am? What did they respond? When he asked them that they just seated. Then he asked them, um, I have been walking with you guys. Who do you think I am? Or what do the people say I am? They said some people think that you're Elijah. Mhm. Or a prophet. Yeah. And then now when he asked them, now who do you say I am? I think it was Peter. Peter. Yeah, that answered. That's you. You know, you're the Messiah. Mhm. Yeah. Thank you for that. And it actually, it's very intriguing because Christ walked with the disciples all those years, every single day, but they it took them a while to really realize this is the actual Messiah. But look at this woman. Probably less than an hour of interaction with Jesus, and she knew in her mind this is the Messiah who we're looking for. Um, let let me find that verse in John chapter 4, but we can just open up Bibles there. John chapter 4, verse 25. Let me just read that out. The woman said to him, I know the Messiah is coming who is called Christ. When he comes, he will tell us all things. Then verse 26, Jesus said to her, I who speak to you, am he. And then if you just skip to verse 28, the woman then left her water pot, went her way into the city, and said to the man, "Come and see a man who told me all things that I ever did. Could this be the Christ?" When you are actually searching for something, when you see it, you'll know what it is. The Jews mentality of the Messiah was, for lack of a better term, it was it was messed up cuz they expected a Messiah who would come from the clouds with all the angels and come and overthrow the Roman government. But the Samaritans on the other hand, they had studied the scriptures through the words of Moses and they were expecting a Messiah who would look in a certain way. They knew he'd be humble, he'd be different, and the words that he will speak of will be life and it'll just be transforming to your life. And once the woman experienced that, because she had actually been studying and waiting for the Messiah, she knew in her mind, this is the guy. Okay? So, it's it's it's a call to us. You cannot find Jesus unless you're looking for him, right? You cannot find God in your life until you actually actively look for him. And the Bible tells us, you will find me when you seek for me with all your heart. God promises if you look for him, you'll find me. But if you don't look for him, you won't find him. Right? So that that is what we can learn from that. Um G. So another question, this should be the last question. Um, why do you think the Samaritans came out to hear Jesus? Why do you think they came out to play um to hear Jesus after that woman went and spoke to them? Um, now remember now, let me just put it into context. The women used to fetch water at very specific times, early in the morning or late in the evening. Now, this time it was midday when Christ was uh near the well. Uh we're told that in uh John chapter 4, the very beginning of it, right? Uh yes, verse 6. It was about the sixth hour. 6th hour is about midday in Hebrew time. So this woman was fetching water at midday because she wanted to be alone. Why did she want to be alone? How many husbands has she had before? Five. And they were all not hers. Which means she was snatching husbands from people from other women. So she did not want to interact with the women. That is why she came alone. But now after experiencing Jesus, she went to the city and told these people who have been stealing husbands from come listen to a guy who told me all about my life. So why do you think the people actually believed her and came out? Ariana, why why do you think they they came out to listen to Jesus? [Music] because it would be unbelievable that that the Messiah would actually be there talking to her because she was there at midday and she was like an outcast of the people and for her to come and give this information to people who probably despise her because of what she does, they would be in their minds they would be like maybe that could actually be Jesus. So they want to go and actually find out if it actually is him. Yes. All right. Thanks for that very important point. She was an outcast and people expected the missile not interact with sinners. Yeah. Thanks for that. Or Mary or Amy, anything to add. Why Why do you think the Smittans came out to listen to Jesus? Yeah. Uh, I think also it would just be if you hear this crazy story of someone telling you what you've done, you'd want to go and see if it's really true. Curiosity as well. True. True. Uh-huh. Yeah. I'd say the same thing as Omar. Personally, if me someone came to me and told me, "Yo, uh, someone is the Messiah at the well." I'd be like, "Huh? Huh?" Yeah. And then literally go and see it for myself. You know, sometimes you want to see things for yourself to believe just confirm if she's lying or not. Yeah. Yeah. Very true. Um, also remember the the Samitans thought that the Messiah will be Jewish and he only come to the Jews. So for him coming to a village in Samaria will be a shock. But they did not expect that. As much as they knew the Messiah was coming, they wouldn't think that this is the guy who's coming to talk to us who are considered outcasts, not part of the Jewish community as well. All right, thank you for that. So, we can uh read the further insight. I'd like to ask Amy to read the first one and then Ariana read the second one as we close up. Okay, so further insight, every true disciple is born into the kingdom of God as a missionary. Ellen G. White Desire of Ages page 195. Who has the heart? With whom are our thoughts? Of whom do we love to converse? Who has our warmest affections and our best energies? If we are Christs, our thoughts are with him and our sweetest thoughts are of him. Ellen G. White, steps to Christ, page 58. Thank you for that. Um, thank you so much for joining us for this lesson. So as we close up, just final word. In our church, we tend to have so many restrictions about who can witness. We tend to think you have to be older. You need to have gone through a theology school or something. But all it takes is to tell someone, I have met Jesus. This is what he's done for me. Come see what he can do for you. That is all it takes. So just an encouragement to all of us. As young as you might be, just tell someone what Christ has done for you. That is all it takes to be a witness for him. Yes. Amen. Amen. Thank you so much for your time and your comments. Any one of the parting shots or anything as we finish up. All right. Okay. So, we'll have a word of prayer from Omari as we finish up. Let's pray. Lord, I want to thank you that we're able to meet here in this church on this day and to, you know, help to spread your word. Lord, Lord, please help us to be like Jesus in this sense to be able to forgo the social restrictions that may keep us from taking your word to the people that need it most. Lord, help us to be brave and to have faith that you will be with us as we spread it. In Jesus name we pray. Amen. Amen. Amen. Thanks so much. See you in the next lesson.

TIMESTAMPED TRANSCRIPT:
[0.2s] Good morning, good afternoon, good
[2.5s] evening to you wherever you're joining
[4.3s] us from. Welcome to the second quarter
[8.3s] of this year of the cornerstone lesson.
[12.2s] Our theme for this quarter is boundless
[15.5s] freedom as you can see from behind us.
[17.4s] And today we're doing lesson one, come
[20.2s] and see. But before we begin, I'd like
[22.2s] to introduce our panelists and then we
[24.1s] can have a word of prayer from the
[25.8s] father's left.
[27.8s] Uh my name is Omir.
[31.0s] My name is Ariana Kima. My name is Amy
[34.2s] and my name is Jonan Mana. I'll be
[37.4s] moderating this panel. I'd like to ask
[39.3s] Ariana to offer a word of prayer. We
[41.0s] begin. Okay, let's bow down for a word
[44.2s] of prayer. Our kind and heavenly father,
[46.4s] we thank you for this day. Thank you for
[47.9s] the gift of life. Thank you for helping
[50.4s] us to be here today. as we're about to
[52.5s] start this panel discussion. Lord, I
[54.4s] pray that you may help us to understand
[57.0s] and speak through us Lord Father for I
[59.1s] pray in Jesus name. Amen. Amen. Amen.
[62.1s] Thank
[63.3s] you. This year we're studying the life
[65.9s] of Jesus and in quarter it started all
[68.6s] the way from the birth of Jesus as he
[70.6s] grew up in his early ministry. And the
[72.6s] second quarter we're going further
[74.8s] deeper into Christ's ministry here on
[77.0s] earth. And today's lesson is a very
[80.2s] intriguing one, very common to most of
[82.2s] us. It's Samaritan woman. You know, come
[84.6s] and see, hence the title. And
[88.1s] um the Samaritans, I know it's a
[91.0s] question to most of us. Where do these
[92.9s] people come from? Okay, so let me just
[94.6s] give a brief background. When the
[96.6s] Israelites went to exile in Babylon,
[99.5s] there's a group that remained behind.
[102.0s] Now, that group are the ones who are
[103.6s] known as the Samitans. Now what's
[105.6s] happened to them is they got hopeless
[109.0s] because the temple's destroyed. The ark
[111.2s] of the covenant is gone. They felt like
[113.8s] there's no hope in Israel anymore and
[115.4s] God had left them. So they mingled with
[119.0s] the tribes that were surrounding them
[120.8s] and they started making idols to remind
[123.0s] them of the God that they had. So when
[125.2s] the Jews actually came back to their
[128.1s] land, they found a very different
[131.4s] practice from these Samaritans who are
[133.0s] also Jews. So when the Jews were
[135.8s] rebuilding the walls of Jerusalem and
[137.4s] the temple during the time of Nehemiah,
[139.8s] Samaritans wanted to help them out, but
[141.8s] the Jews said, "Nope, we cannot mingle
[144.7s] with you because you've defiled
[145.9s] yourselves by worshiping idols." And
[148.1s] that is where the enemity started
[150.0s] between the two groups. So we'll just go
[152.5s] straight into our lesson today. I think
[155.0s] we'll start with the key text. I'd like
[157.6s] to ask Omari to read the key text for
[159.8s] us. You can open your Bibles. That's
[162.1s] John 4 verse
[164.6s] 28-30. John 4:28-30.
[168.6s] Uh the key text
[170.6s] says as he said John 4:28-30, then
[174.2s] leaving her water jar, the woman went
[176.5s] back to the town and said to the people,
[179.2s] "Come see a man who told me everything I
[182.3s] ever did. Could this be the Messiah?"
[185.3s] They came out of town and made their way
[187.4s] toward him. Mhm. Thank you for that.
[190.2s] That that just gives a brief summary of
[192.1s] what what's going to happen in our story
[193.8s] today. Before we get into it, uh let us
[196.2s] read the flashlight. See what Ellen
[198.1s] White says concerning our story. Like to
[201.1s] ask Ariana to read that. The flashlight.
[204.0s] Okay. The flashlight. As soon as she had
[206.9s] found the savior, the Samaritan woman
[209.0s] brought others to him. She proved
[211.4s] herself a more effective missionary than
[214.1s] his own disciples. The disciples saw
[216.6s] nothing in Samaria to indicate that it
[218.7s] was an encouraging field. Their thoughts
[221.1s] were fixed up upon a great work to be
[224.2s] done in the future. They did not see the
[226.6s] right around them was a harvest to be
[229.1s] gathered. But through the woman whom
[231.3s] they despised, the whole a whole city
[234.2s] full were brought to hear the savior,
[236.8s] the desire of ages, page 195. Thank you.
[240.1s] Thank you. Thank you for reading that,
[241.2s] Rihanna. which will actually just lead
[243.4s] us into the next parts of our lesson. So
[246.7s] the Jews who the disciples of Jesus were
[250.8s] all Jews, right? The Jews were very
[253.8s] discriminatory people. They had a
[256.6s] feeling of self-importance around them.
[259.2s] Okay? And when you when you have a
[262.8s] certain upper hand to a group, you are
[266.5s] always going to tend to bully them or
[268.5s] keep yourself separate from them. I
[270.8s] think there's a story Amy would like to
[272.4s] give us about such an illustration about
[274.6s] how people can be prejudiced towards
[276.8s] others. Amy. Okay. So about 30 years ago
[280.2s] in response to the assassination of
[282.6s] Martin Luther King Jr. an American
[285.0s] teacher developed a simple classroom
[287.8s] exercise to illustrate the power of
[289.4s] prejudice. So she told her children that
[292.9s] children with blue eyes have are special
[296.9s] and more intelligent. And so throughout
[299.4s] that single day um the children with
[302.6s] blue eyes would bully and look down upon
[306.0s] the students with brown eyes. And the
[308.1s] children with brown eyes would
[309.9s] feel fearful, shy and
[313.6s] essentially not feel their self worth.
[316.8s] And this happened in one day. So the
[318.9s] next day the teacher said um okay what I
[321.4s] told you was wrong. Um it's actually
[323.6s] people with brown eyes that are more
[325.4s] intelligent. And so the same thing
[327.8s] happened in reverse. So the browneyed
[329.8s] kids looked down upon blue-eyed
[332.4s] children. So this experience opened
[335.5s] students eyes both blue and brown to the
[337.8s] power of prejudice and the divisions we
[340.1s] create between people. Just like the
[342.3s] Jews and Samaritans in Jesus days, we
[345.0s] tend to divide people based off of race,
[347.4s] religion, color, ethnicity, and
[349.8s] essentially put barriers between people.
[354.2s] um we decide who's in, who's out, who's
[358.1s] cool and who's not. And so Jesus saw
[360.7s] past all these barriers and he chooses
[363.4s] his followers from every race,
[366.3s] background, culture essentially, and he
[369.0s] asks us to look past those barriers as
[371.2s] well. Thank you for that, Amy. Yeah. So
[374.5s] Christ is not a discriminator of
[376.1s] persons. And uh it's the same thing that
[378.6s] God said in the book of 1 Samuel when
[382.2s] Samuel was anointing David when he was
[384.5s] looking for the next king of Israel.
[386.4s] Samuel was also looking at the outward
[388.0s] appearance. It's a thing with human
[389.3s] beings. Okay? We discriminate people
[391.3s] based on how they look. But um Christ
[395.0s] does not discriminate people and he
[396.8s] looks at the heart, right? Um so the
[401.8s] disciples of Jesus they had this same
[405.0s] prejudice and partly is because they
[408.4s] felt they were not well equipped to
[410.6s] reach out to certain
[412.2s] people. So to the what do you think
[415.2s] section let us answer some questions
[416.8s] about that so that we can understand
[418.2s] really what does it take to be a witness
[420.3s] for Jesus. Ariana. So the what do you
[423.4s] think
[424.2s] section, which of the following things
[426.6s] do you think are necessary to be a
[428.6s] witness for Jesus? Check any that you
[431.3s] think apply. A person who wants to
[433.9s] witness for Jesus should have read the
[436.6s] entire Bible, be baptized, have finished
[439.7s] high school, love Jesus, be born again,
[443.0s] be able to lead a Bible study, go to
[445.8s] church regularly. So, I'll ask Amy what
[449.1s] she thinks applies.
[452.0s] Um, okay. So, I would go with love
[455.8s] Jesus. Um, be able to lead a Bible study
[459.8s] and go to church regularly. So, I will
[462.3s] speak on going to church regularly.
[465.7s] Um, going to church regularly
[468.1s] essentially helps you foster a constant
[471.3s] connection with God and be able to have
[474.8s] the Holy Spirit within you. Cuz if you
[477.8s] don't go to church, you're
[479.4s] essentially not letting the Holy Spirit
[481.8s] work in you and that way you cannot help
[484.1s] other people as well. So go to church
[486.8s] regularly, foster a relationship and
[489.4s] then love Jesus as well. It's super
[491.3s] important. Yeah. Yes. How about
[496.3s] uh I think what really stands out is
[500.6s] loving Jesus to
[502.4s] me because we know that you know God is
[506.2s] love and love is the root of everything
[509.9s] in Christianity
[512.5s] and okay this woman the Samaritan
[519.0s] woman I don't know if she did love him
[522.7s] at that point as she was being told but
[526.3s] then she was curious and she wanted to
[528.4s] find out more about the truth and it's
[530.8s] not listed here but I think wanting to
[532.6s] know more about the truth is also very
[534.6s] important thank you teacher Jonahan
[539.1s] um I think I'd rather let you go first
[541.9s] tell us what you and then I can give my
[544.2s] points yeah okay
[545.6s] so loving Jesus being baptized I feel
[549.7s] like um baptism is giving our lives to
[554.3s] Jesus Christ and when we have accepted
[557.8s] Jesus to take over in our lives then we
[560.6s] can be able to be a witness for him.
[565.0s] Yes. So I think being baptized is the
[568.9s] one that I think applies. Okay. Uh thank
[571.6s] you Ariana for that. Uh quick question.
[574.8s] What do you guys understand by the word
[576.6s] witnessing or what does it mean to be a
[578.7s] witness?
[580.5s] Um, okay. Can I go first? I think
[583.8s] witnessing is being present at a scene
[589.4s] and having seen everything that has
[591.2s] happened. All right. At that particular
[593.2s] scene. Yeah. So, you're practically
[595.5s] telling something you saw or something
[597.4s] you experienced. Yes. Okay. So if we use
[601.1s] that um definition of witnessing and
[604.5s] apply to witnessing for Christ, we can
[607.0s] say that to be a witness of Christ, you
[610.3s] need to have had an encounter with
[611.8s] Jesus. Yeah. Okay. So all it takes is
[615.2s] actually just having an encounter with
[617.1s] Jesus, right? All those things you said
[619.9s] really true, very important for
[621.4s] witnessing. But the main thing that you
[624.6s] need to witness for Christ is just
[626.2s] having an experience with him.
[628.4s] Have you met Jesus? Um, have you had a
[630.8s] miracle in your life? That's all it
[632.4s] takes to witness. Now, most preachers,
[634.8s] they are usually taught or trained on
[637.0s] how to give a witness statement in like
[639.8s] two, three minutes to convince someone.
[641.8s] At times, that's not enough because
[643.8s] people take time to connect with each
[646.0s] other. So, the best way to witness to
[648.6s] someone is one have a connection with
[650.5s] them. You know, we get a shared
[652.2s] experience, have some some common
[654.2s] ground. We'll see that into the story
[655.8s] section. How Jesus did it. And then
[657.8s] number two, just share about what Jesus
[660.8s] has done in your life. The most powerful
[663.8s] sermon someone can ever preach is
[666.7s] something about your life, something
[668.4s] that has happened to you. That is why in
[670.8s] very many sermons, very many preachers
[674.0s] usually use stories or illustrations.
[676.6s] You know, there was someone who this
[678.5s] happened to in a certain area so that it
[680.9s] can go verify the story later on.
[683.0s] There's something very powerful about
[685.4s] someone experiencing or knowing that you
[688.2s] have gone through something and I have
[690.0s] the chance to go through the same. So
[691.7s] this is just a call to us that you can
[694.6s] witness for God. All you need is just to
[696.4s] have a personal experience with him.
[698.1s] That is all it takes. Yeah. All right.
[701.4s] So um I'll ask Omari just read the did
[705.2s] you know session just to have a better
[706.9s] understanding of the Samaritans.
[709.8s] The Samaritans were a group of people
[711.9s] living to the north of the land of Judea
[714.5s] in Jesus' time. Samaritans believed they
[717.6s] were the descendants of the northern
[719.4s] tribes of Israel who had remained in the
[722.0s] land after most of their people had been
[724.9s] taken into
[726.8s] captivity to Babylon by
[729.7s] Nebuchadnezzar. Jews believe the
[731.7s] Samaritans were descendants of Gentiles
[734.1s] who had had settled there after the
[736.6s] Babylonian conquest. Whatever their
[739.5s] origins, Samaritans worshiped the God of
[743.1s] Israel, but had many customs and
[745.4s] traditions different from the Jews. They
[748.2s] were viewed by most Jews as being an
[750.4s] inferior class of people. And the Jews
[753.2s] of Jesus' time would have nothing to do
[755.6s] with
[756.4s] Samaritans just as they would have
[758.9s] nothing to do with Gentiles. Thanks for
[761.8s] that, Amari. Um, in the Israelite
[765.4s] culture in the olden days, there was a
[767.0s] lot of discrimination, right? Especially
[770.1s] the Jews towards other people. They were
[772.9s] the chosen generation. They were the
[775.3s] people who um their their forefather
[777.3s] wrestled with God and actually won.
[779.6s] That's the only guy who's ever done
[780.9s] that. You know, I'm just remembering
[783.0s] this is just to a bit off the topic.
[785.8s] came across a story one time I think
[787.7s] just a few days ago about how the
[790.6s] reaction of people to seeing angels
[792.7s] right Manoah saw an angel he got really
[795.8s] terrified and then later on he he was he
[798.3s] was dumb but he quickly speak because he
[800.1s] not believe what the angel said Gideon
[802.3s] saw an angel he he offered an offering
[805.0s] he I mean he gave an offering um so many
[807.8s] guys when they saw angels they just were
[810.2s] really terrified but then
[811.8s] Jacob this guy meets an angel at night
[814.2s] and he's like Bro, let's fight. Let's
[817.1s] fight. So, this is the kind of tribe.
[819.6s] That's the mentality they had that we
[821.8s] can wrestle with God. We can wrestle
[823.2s] with anyone else. So, they were very um
[827.2s] their egos really inflated. So, they
[829.8s] just look down upon
[831.9s] everyone. Question to us, if Jesus were
[836.0s] was living in our time, which groups do
[838.9s] you think we have discriminated that
[840.7s] Jesus will go and talk to?
[843.8s] Eg was living in our day right now.
[846.2s] There are those guys who in our in our
[848.7s] Christians, let's say as Christians, as
[850.2s] Adventists, there's some people who we
[852.3s] might look down upon or we think
[854.6s] salvation is out of reach for them or we
[857.1s] cannot talk to those people because I
[860.0s] mean
[860.8s] why? Okay. When we going out for
[864.8s] missions, do you know people tend to
[867.8s] discriminate who they'll reach out to?
[870.9s] When we give you books, Amy, and we tell
[873.2s] you, walked in the streets of Nairobi
[875.3s] and just distribute these books to
[876.8s] people. You'll be very picky about the
[878.9s] people you subconsciously actually, it's
[881.8s] not consciously thinking about it. So,
[883.9s] you might just go find well-dressed
[886.3s] person. You think if I give this one, it
[889.1s] might help him. Then you find someone
[890.2s] who's shabily dressed, you're like this
[892.6s] one may just tear up the book. So are
[894.9s] there any groups in our society that we
[896.4s] have really marginalized right
[899.2s] now? I would say that people who are
[903.0s] living
[904.6s] in seen that can be thought of as like
[909.8s] so like off-putting by society like
[912.6s] people who are in the LGBTQ community or
[915.8s] people who are deep into drugs. and want
[918.4s] to avoid them. Yeah. But then knowing
[920.6s] Jesus, talking to tax collectors who are
[923.0s] like the off-putting group of the day, I
[926.3s] think he would be interacting with them
[928.6s] trying to help them. Yeah. Thanks for
[930.2s] that. That's actually one of the groups
[932.0s] that people really discriminate these
[933.4s] days, Christians especially. You know,
[936.2s] um we tend to judge people based on the
[938.6s] sins that they have. But Jesus' example
[941.8s] shows that we can go beyond boundaries
[944.6s] that we have set up as human beings and
[947.0s] just reach out to people. So uh we'll
[950.2s] just get a brief summary of what the
[952.0s] story is all about. I think I'll ask um
[955.4s] just give us a summary of what really
[957.8s] happened, what how the encounter of
[959.8s] Jesus with Samaritan woman went.
[963.4s] Uh so Jesus goes to draw water. At this
[967.2s] time he wasn't with his
[969.1s] disciples
[970.9s] and he sees a Samaritan woman there. He
[975.2s] asks her for some water to drink and the
[978.2s] Samaritan woman gets confused wondering
[981.3s] why would this you know a Jew and a man
[984.0s] be asking me for water cuz you know at
[986.5s] this time as you have said Jews and
[988.2s] Samaritans didn't really interact and
[990.7s] also women didn't interact much with men
[993.9s] outside of you know their immediate
[995.9s] family. Mhm.
[999.0s] So
[1001.2s] now Jesus keeps on you know he has
[1004.3s] already asked her for water and now
[1008.0s] she
[1011.1s] eventually she Jesus asks her about her
[1015.3s] husband. M she says that she doesn't
[1017.4s] have a husband. But Jesus responds that
[1020.5s] you have five
[1021.9s] husbands and the man that you're living
[1024.2s] with now isn't your husband. He's not
[1027.7s] one of the
[1028.9s] five. And now this, you know, this would
[1031.7s] be startling because you've just been
[1035.0s] told about your life by someone you've
[1037.0s] never met before.
[1039.0s] But she takes it positively and goes
[1042.2s] around telling people there's this man
[1045.0s] that you know has told me all I've ever
[1047.6s] did, all I've ever done. And that's even
[1050.5s] the source of the title of this story.
[1054.2s] Mhm. And now she tells people, they come
[1057.1s] to talk to him and they see that really
[1059.3s] this man is is special.
[1063.3s] And I forgot to add as Jesus is asking
[1066.5s] her for water. He says if you knew who
[1069.0s] you are talking to, you'd ask him for
[1072.0s] water and he he'd give you the living
[1074.8s] water. She asks him where water that you
[1078.5s] can't you would get thirsty after
[1080.4s] drinking it. She asks him where she can
[1083.4s] get that
[1084.6s] water
[1086.8s] and he tells her that he is the Messiah.
[1092.7s] Yeah. So talk about the story. All
[1094.7s] right. Thank you for that. Um yes. So
[1098.5s] that is basically the story of what we
[1101.2s] reading today. And if you just happen to
[1103.8s] go to the next verses or that's John
[1107.9s] chapter 4, you'll get that the disciples
[1110.7s] came back and they found Jesus talking
[1112.1s] to a woman and they were skeptical like
[1114.6s] you sent us away so that you just you
[1116.4s] know talk talk to a woman. They really
[1117.9s] had judgmental looks on their faces, but
[1121.7s] they the mission that this woman
[1124.2s] accomplished, the people that she
[1125.9s] brought to Christ were way more than the
[1127.5s] disciples had brought at that time.
[1130.4s] Yeah. And
[1132.4s] um this further emphasizes what we're
[1135.4s] talking about what it takes to be a
[1136.9s] witness. Just having an encounter with
[1138.8s] Jesus, that's all it takes. And she
[1140.7s] brought a whole village to Christ. So
[1143.2s] we'll answer a few questions in the out
[1145.8s] of the story.
[1148.2s] out of the story
[1150.1s] section. Okay. So, uh what do you think
[1154.5s] Jesus meant by living water? What did
[1158.8s] Jesus what do you think Jesus meant by
[1161.3s] saying I am the living water or I will
[1163.3s] give you the of the living
[1165.5s] water? These girls are literally
[1167.8s] standing next to a well. And this this
[1170.3s] is one of one of the oldest wells. This
[1173.0s] wall was dug by Jacob when he was still
[1176.2s] roaming around. And this woman knew
[1179.4s] there's no one greater than Jacob
[1181.0s] because he's the founding father of the
[1182.8s] Israelite nation. Then comes up this
[1185.5s] young man who's just 30 and he says he's
[1188.5s] the living water. What do you think
[1189.8s] Christ meant by saying he's the living
[1191.4s] water? But I think living water has to
[1194.3s] do
[1195.3s] with something you would
[1199.2s] use more say
[1201.7s] eternally
[1203.3s] or it does not quench temporary thirst
[1206.3s] more spiritual thirst. Yeah. And yeah.
[1211.6s] Um in many thank you for that. In many
[1214.1s] analogies that Christ um uses, most of
[1217.3s] them are found from the book of John.
[1219.0s] Christ is known as the living water.
[1221.6s] He's right and woman. Christ is also
[1223.8s] known as the bread of life. You know,
[1226.3s] he's the way, the truth, and the life as
[1228.2s] well. He's the light.
[1230.6s] Um Christ was revealing himself to the
[1234.8s] people. Let me take you guys back a bit.
[1238.5s] When Jesus was talking to his disciples,
[1240.5s] he asked them a very simple question.
[1243.0s] Who do you guys think I am? What did
[1245.4s] they
[1246.5s] respond? When he asked them that they
[1249.0s] just seated. Then he asked them,
[1251.7s] um, I have been walking with you guys.
[1255.5s] Who do you think I am? Or what do the
[1257.0s] people say I am? They said some people
[1260.5s] think that you're Elijah. Mhm. Or a
[1263.5s] prophet. Yeah. And then now when he
[1267.5s] asked them, now who do you say I am? I
[1271.0s] think it was Peter. Peter. Yeah, that
[1273.8s] answered.
[1275.4s] That's you. You know, you're the
[1278.3s] Messiah. Mhm. Yeah. Thank you for that.
[1281.8s] And it actually, it's very intriguing
[1283.5s] because Christ walked with the disciples
[1285.8s] all those years, every single day, but
[1288.3s] they it took them a while to really
[1290.1s] realize this is the actual Messiah. But
[1292.6s] look at this woman. Probably less than
[1295.2s] an hour of interaction with Jesus, and
[1297.5s] she knew in her mind this is the Messiah
[1300.3s] who we're looking for. Um, let let me
[1303.1s] find that verse in John chapter 4, but
[1305.4s] we can just open up Bibles there. John
[1308.8s] chapter
[1310.7s] 4, verse 25. Let me just read that
[1314.8s] out. The woman said to him, I know the
[1318.2s] Messiah is coming who is called Christ.
[1321.0s] When he comes, he will tell us all
[1323.0s] things. Then verse 26, Jesus said to
[1326.2s] her, I who speak to you, am he. And then
[1330.6s] if you just skip to verse
[1333.5s] 28, the woman then left her water pot,
[1336.6s] went her way into the city, and said to
[1339.0s] the man, "Come and see a man who told me
[1341.3s] all things that I ever did. Could this
[1343.4s] be the
[1345.7s] Christ?" When you are actually searching
[1348.3s] for something, when you see it, you'll
[1350.6s] know what it is.
[1353.1s] The Jews mentality of the Messiah
[1357.0s] was, for lack of a better term, it was
[1359.7s] it was messed up cuz they expected a
[1362.1s] Messiah who would come from the clouds
[1364.5s] with all the angels and come and
[1366.2s] overthrow the Roman government. But the
[1369.0s] Samaritans on the other hand, they had
[1370.8s] studied the scriptures through the words
[1372.5s] of Moses and they were expecting a
[1375.8s] Messiah who would look in a certain way.
[1378.0s] They knew he'd be humble, he'd be
[1379.9s] different, and the words that he will
[1381.7s] speak of will be life and it'll just be
[1384.3s] transforming to your life. And once the
[1386.7s] woman experienced that, because she had
[1388.5s] actually been studying and waiting for
[1390.7s] the Messiah, she knew in her mind, this
[1393.6s] is the guy. Okay? So, it's it's
[1397.6s] it's a call to
[1399.7s] us. You cannot find Jesus unless you're
[1402.3s] looking for
[1403.9s] him, right? You cannot find God in your
[1407.1s] life until you actually actively look
[1409.2s] for him. And the Bible tells us, you
[1412.0s] will find me when you seek for me with
[1414.8s] all your heart. God promises if you look
[1416.9s] for him, you'll find me. But if you
[1419.0s] don't look for him, you won't find him.
[1420.8s] Right? So that that is what we can learn
[1422.5s] from that.
[1424.4s] Um G. So another question, this should
[1429.0s] be the last question. Um, why do you
[1432.6s] think the Samaritans came out to hear
[1434.9s] Jesus? Why do you think they came out to
[1437.8s] play um to hear Jesus after that woman
[1440.4s] went and spoke to them? Um, now remember
[1443.8s] now, let me just put it into
[1445.6s] context. The women used to fetch water
[1448.7s] at very specific times, early in the
[1451.2s] morning or late in the evening. Now,
[1454.3s] this time it was midday when Christ was
[1458.0s] uh near the well. Uh we're told that in
[1461.2s] uh John chapter 4, the very beginning of
[1464.0s] it, right? Uh yes, verse 6. It was about
[1468.5s] the sixth hour. 6th hour is about midday
[1471.0s] in Hebrew time. So this woman was
[1473.6s] fetching water at midday because she
[1475.8s] wanted to be
[1477.2s] alone. Why did she want to be alone? How
[1480.2s] many husbands has she had before? Five.
[1483.4s] And they were all not hers. Which means
[1485.0s] she was snatching husbands from people
[1487.7s] from other women. So she did not want to
[1489.8s] interact with the women. That is why she
[1491.5s] came alone. But now after experiencing
[1495.3s] Jesus, she went to the city and told
[1497.4s] these people who have been stealing
[1498.5s] husbands from come listen to a guy who
[1501.0s] told me all about my life. So why do you
[1502.9s] think the people actually believed her
[1504.1s] and came out? Ariana, why why do you
[1507.1s] think they they came out to listen to
[1508.8s] Jesus?
[1510.0s] [Music]
[1511.3s] because it would be unbelievable that
[1515.0s] that the Messiah would actually be there
[1518.9s] talking to her because she was there at
[1521.1s] midday and she was like an outcast of
[1524.5s] the people and for her to come and give
[1526.6s] this information to people who probably
[1529.4s] despise her because of what she does,
[1532.3s] they would be in their minds they would
[1534.0s] be like maybe that could actually be
[1536.6s] Jesus. So they want to go and actually
[1539.7s] find out if it actually is him. Yes. All
[1543.4s] right. Thanks for that very important
[1545.0s] point. She was an outcast and people
[1547.2s] expected the missile not interact with
[1549.1s] sinners. Yeah. Thanks for that. Or Mary
[1551.4s] or Amy, anything to
[1553.6s] add. Why Why do you think the Smittans
[1555.9s] came out to listen to Jesus? Yeah.
[1559.3s] Uh, I think also it would just be if you
[1564.6s] hear this crazy story of someone telling
[1566.6s] you what you've done, you'd want to go
[1567.8s] and see if it's really true.
[1571.6s] Curiosity as well. True. True. Uh-huh.
[1576.6s] Yeah. I'd say the same thing as Omar.
[1579.4s] Personally, if me someone came to me and
[1581.4s] told me, "Yo,
[1583.8s] uh, someone is the Messiah at the well."
[1586.9s] I'd be like, "Huh? Huh?" Yeah. And then
[1588.9s] literally go and see it for myself. You
[1592.1s] know, sometimes you want to see things
[1593.8s] for yourself to believe just confirm if
[1595.8s] she's lying or not. Yeah. Yeah. Very
[1597.6s] true. Um, also remember the the Samitans
[1601.9s] thought that the Messiah will be Jewish
[1604.1s] and he only come to the Jews. So for him
[1607.4s] coming to a village in Samaria will be a
[1610.3s] shock. But they did not expect that. As
[1612.6s] much as they knew the Messiah was
[1613.8s] coming, they wouldn't think that this is
[1616.3s] the guy who's coming to talk to us who
[1618.6s] are considered outcasts, not part of the
[1620.7s] Jewish community as well. All right,
[1623.4s] thank you for that. So, we can uh read
[1625.4s] the further insight. I'd like to ask Amy
[1627.9s] to read the first one and then Ariana
[1629.9s] read the second one as we close up.
[1633.0s] Okay, so further insight, every true
[1636.1s] disciple is born into the kingdom of God
[1638.4s] as a missionary. Ellen G. White Desire
[1641.0s] of Ages page 195.
[1644.2s] Who has the heart? With whom are our
[1647.1s] thoughts? Of whom do we love to
[1649.5s] converse? Who has our warmest affections
[1652.7s] and our best energies? If we are
[1655.3s] Christs, our thoughts are with him and
[1658.0s] our sweetest thoughts are of him. Ellen
[1660.5s] G. White, steps to Christ, page 58.
[1664.0s] Thank you for that.
[1666.3s] Um, thank you so much for joining us for
[1668.5s] this lesson. So as we close up, just
[1671.9s] final
[1673.7s] word. In our church, we tend to have so
[1677.1s] many restrictions about who can witness.
[1680.0s] We tend to think you have to be older.
[1681.9s] You need to have gone through a theology
[1683.8s] school or something. But all it takes is
[1687.3s] to tell someone, I have met Jesus. This
[1690.7s] is what he's done for me. Come see what
[1693.7s] he can do for you. That is all it takes.
[1696.2s] So just an encouragement to all of us.
[1698.1s] As young as you might
[1699.9s] be, just tell someone what Christ has
[1702.6s] done for you. That is all it takes to be
[1703.8s] a witness for him. Yes. Amen. Amen.
[1707.8s] Thank you so much for your time and your
[1710.2s] comments. Any one of the parting shots
[1712.2s] or anything as we finish up. All right.
[1716.3s] Okay. So, we'll have a word of prayer
[1718.5s] from Omari as we finish
[1720.6s] up. Let's pray.
[1725.8s] Lord, I want to thank you that we're
[1728.7s] able to meet here in this church on this
[1732.0s] day and to, you know, help to spread
[1735.0s] your word.
[1736.4s] Lord, Lord, please help us to be like
[1739.3s] Jesus in this sense to be able
[1742.1s] to forgo the social restrictions that
[1745.7s] may keep us from taking your word to the
[1748.9s] people that need it most. Lord, help us
[1751.6s] to be
[1752.6s] brave and to have faith that you will be
[1755.7s] with us as we spread
[1758.9s] it. In Jesus name we pray. Amen. Amen.
[1762.7s] Amen. Thanks so much. See you in the
[1764.7s] next lesson.
