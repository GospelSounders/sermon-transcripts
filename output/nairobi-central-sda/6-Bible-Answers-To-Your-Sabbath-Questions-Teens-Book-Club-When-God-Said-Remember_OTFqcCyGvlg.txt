FULL TRANSCRIPT:
good morning good afternoon good evening happy Sabbath to wherever you are or wherever you're watching us from welcome kibana my name is bism lumumba and welcome to the Teens book club uh today we are reading the book When God Says remember but before we start let's say our prayer dear father in Heaven oh Lord God we come before you at this time we like to thank you so much for another opportunity to come and discuss your word now father please be with us keep us and protect us in Jesus name I pray am amen amen well ladies and gentlemen today we are going to be looking at chapter 6 Bible answers to your Sabbath questions Bible answers to your Sabbath questions so before we start I'll just give a little bit of a background and then move on so in this chapter Mark Finley who's the author of this wonderful book tries to give some answers to your Sabbath questions you know the prevailing Sabbath questions that you might be asking uh I know that there are some tough questions but he does give us some advice on how to approach these questions first of all he tells us a story of a wonderful couple that's looking for answers just like you may be as well and he tells us that some of the advice before we get into the question is that number one you need to approach the Bible with an open mind all right you need to be willing to learn from uh the Bible number two uh you need to ask God and His Holy Spirit to open your mind and to reveal the truth number three you need to compare each relevant passage of scripture on a a given topic here a little there a little and number four you need to make a decision and act on what God reveals to you to help me explore some of these Sabbath questions I have subira right here with me subira introduce yourself and prep for the first question hello my name is subira I'm so glad to be here and I probably add to one more thing is that Jesus really declares his truth in his word and so John 17:17 says sanctify them with Your Truth Thy word is the truth amen and so we need to search the Bible for answers let's just be mindful in the fact that everything that we say needs to have biblical Roots Good Wonderful all right question number one are you ready yeah all right here's the first question it says is it true that the Old Testament people were saved by keeping the law while the New Testament while in the New Testament salvation is by Grace what do you think okay the first thing to know is that there's no two ways to Redemption okay so salvation is by grace through faith there's not two ways in order for you to gain salvation so actually both um the Old Testament people did prioritize legalism but that was just the introduction of the law but in the New Testament we see the Fulfillment of the law nothing is changing if anything Grace is introduced in and faith is introduced such that you will exercise and do the things but there's a meaning behind the action um we talked about how love is the principle of action so as we are exercising and doing the works of the Lord what is behind that is the faith and that Faith allows us to still experience eternity by the grace of God Amen secondly um again faith without actions is dead MH this saying we've been saying it constantly in our churches but it's very important because we can believe but if we're not acting is that true belief i' like to think of Faith as extra credit when the teacher gives you an assignment you are called to fulfill 100 out of the points and so hopefully you can get a good score an a if you will but before you receive extra credit you have to receive the the minimum which is 100% then you can request for extra credit but a lot of us really go to the extra credit before we fulfill our actual duties God expects us to have something but little is much when it is in God's hands and therefore if we have something to present at least 100% the faith gives us the opportunity to redeem in a way extra points that gains our Salvation amen amen yeah uh and that's very true you know one of the insights that's actually uh revealed in the book book by Mark Finley is that in the Old Testament uh they were actually saved by a Christ but the Christ was to come right but in the New Testament we are saved by the Christ who actually died on the cross for our sins right so in both uh Testaments we are saved by Christ all right and you know you look at the book of First uh of First Timothy no sorry Titus 2:1 and it affirms you know that we are saved by grace just as the people in the Old Testament were saved by grace as well yes and also when we look back I hope you all watch chapter 2 set free to obey this idea of being saved by grace is actually a call to obedience so we are saved by grace not to disobey but saved by grace to obey obedience to the Lord grants us freedom and that freedom ensures that we can have a good relationship with Christ amen any questions for me yes so I'm going to pose this question to you M didn't Jesus come to do away with the Ten Commandments and establish a new commandment of loveh what about Matthew CH 22: 37-40 love God with all your heart your neighbors as yourself isn't love to God and our neighbors all Jesus requires these are the new Commandments yeah yeah you know I know that in the question they termed as the new Commandments but it will surprise you that even those new Commandments when Jesus was giving those new Commandments he was merely summarizing The Ten Commandments you know when he says love for God and love for man you know the first four Commandments have to do with love for God all right uh you shall Worship the Lord and serve him alone you shall not take the lord's name in vain keep the Sabbath holy do not make for yourself gra graen images right those Commandments have to do with God but the latter half have to do with man you shall not commit adultery love your neighbor as yourself right uh uh uh uh uh obey your parents these Commandments have to do with how we relate with to man so God did not essentially or rather Jesus did not essentially come to do away with the law in fact he says it himself he says that I have not come to do away with the law but to fulfill the law right and so uh God or Jesus Christ when he came who was God still uh did not do away with the law all right absolutely and I think this reminds me of Prophecy mhm and so when we think of Prophecy from the Old Testament there it's what prophecy is is pointing us to Jesus and so we find with such exactitude all the prophecies that are told in the Old Testament are fulfilled completely the exact same um and in the Bible if I can find it um yes so it says in Isaiah chter 46:9 I'll read from verse 9 to 10 remember the former things those of long ago I am God and there is no other I am God and there's none like me I make known the end from the beginning from ancient times what is still to come I say my purpose will stand and I will do all that I please and so essentially what this is is prophecies confirming the divine inspiration but also the power of God and still with Jesus being God he's fulfilling the law not negating it in any way and that is why both Testaments are necessary for us to have a holistic understanding of our salvation and who God is all right soir Before I Let You Go there's just one more question right here it's a bit of a hard text that's found in Romans 14:5 uh rather difficult that says that we ought not to judge or if one esteems one day over the other then we shouldn't really judge that person uh what would you say about that and uh what are your insights on that well I would say this is also a topic of understanding so the the text in Romans chapter 14 um this is from Paul and so Paul's letter to the Romans um he does St he that he that regards the day regards it unto the Lord and He that regarded he regarded not the day regards it not to the Lord he that eateth eateth to the Lord for he giveth God thanks and he that eateth not to the Lord he eateth not for he giveth God thanks and so this issue is actually revolving around fast days not Sabbath days and that's very important to note because as we somewhat twist the scripture one can look at this test and say oh no this is directly connected to the Sabbath if anything if we worship on Sunday we worship on Sabbath it's the same God God doesn't not not allow us to worship on other days but let us know the exclusivity of the Sabbath day God has appointed a time of rest allowing us to work in the six days but the seventh day must be commemorated am and God does so too so who are we to not amen amen well ladies and gentlemen we've come to the end I just want to encourage you to pick up a copy of this book When God Says remember and read that chapter 6 it has fantastic answers to numerous questions questions uh such as regarding uh let no one judge you about the Bible Sabbath a text in Colossians 2:16 I know you have questions on that questions on you know was Peter the first pope and you know what about when Jesus said on this rock I will build my church uh the Keys of the Kingdom that were handed to the apostles in the first days uh all these questions can be answered when you look into that chapter but for now let's pray as we say goodbye dear father in Heaven oh Lord God we come before you at this time we thank you so much oh Father for the day that you have given us and the ability to read father from your word now father bless those who have heard bless us to to keep us and save us for your kingdom when you come in Jesus name I pray amen amen

[10.2s] welcome to the Teens book club uh today

[17.0s] our prayer dear father in Heaven oh Lord

[29.7s] am amen amen well ladies and gentlemen
[32.2s] today we are going to be looking at
[33.4s] chapter 6 Bible answers to your Sabbath
[36.8s] questions Bible answers to your Sabbath
[38.8s] questions so before we start I'll just
[40.5s] give a little bit of a background and
[42.2s] then move on so in this chapter Mark
[44.8s] Finley who's the author of this
[46.0s] wonderful book tries to give some
[48.1s] answers to your Sabbath questions you
[50.2s] know the prevailing Sabbath questions
[51.7s] that you might be asking uh I know that
[53.8s] there are some tough questions but he
[55.3s] does give us some advice on how to
[56.7s] approach these questions first of all he
[58.9s] tells us a story of a wonderful couple
[60.8s] that's looking for answers just like you
[62.6s] may be as well and he tells us that some
[67.0s] of the advice before we get into the
[68.6s] question is that number one you need to
[71.0s] approach the Bible with an open mind all
[73.5s] right you need to be willing to learn
[76.6s] from uh the Bible number two uh you need
[80.4s] to ask God and His Holy Spirit to open
[83.6s] your mind and to reveal the truth number
[86.0s] three you need to compare each relevant
[88.4s] passage of scripture on a a given topic
[90.9s] here a little there a little and number
[93.3s] four you need to make a decision and act
[97.0s] on what God reveals to you to help me
[99.9s] explore some of these Sabbath questions
[101.7s] I have subira right here with me subira
[104.0s] introduce yourself and prep for the
[105.8s] first question hello my name is subira
[109.0s] I'm so glad to be here and I probably
[111.0s] add to one more thing is that Jesus
[113.9s] really declares his truth in his word
[116.6s] and so John 17:17 says sanctify them
[119.7s] with Your Truth Thy word is the truth
[122.5s] amen and so we need to search the Bible
[125.0s] for answers let's just be mindful in the
[128.2s] fact that everything that we say needs
[130.4s] to have biblical Roots Good Wonderful
[134.3s] all right question number one are you
[136.5s] ready yeah all right here's the first
[138.9s] question it says is it true that the Old
[141.5s] Testament people were saved by keeping
[143.2s] the law while the New Testament while in
[146.0s] the New Testament salvation is by Grace
[148.1s] what do you think okay
[150.5s] the first thing to know is that there's
[153.6s] no two ways to Redemption okay so
[156.8s] salvation is by grace through faith
[160.5s] there's not two ways in order for you to
[162.8s] gain salvation so actually both um the
[166.3s] Old Testament people did prioritize
[169.1s] legalism but that was just the
[170.8s] introduction of the law but in the New
[173.0s] Testament we see the Fulfillment of the
[175.2s] law nothing is changing if anything
[178.6s] Grace is introduced in and faith is
[180.5s] introduced such that you will exercise
[183.2s] and do the things but there's a meaning
[185.6s] behind the action um we talked about how
[188.4s] love is the principle of action so as we
[191.0s] are exercising and doing the works of
[193.2s] the Lord what is behind that is the
[195.8s] faith and that Faith allows us to still
[199.0s] experience eternity by the grace of God
[202.9s] Amen secondly um again faith without
[206.1s] actions is dead MH this saying we've
[208.6s] been saying it constantly in our
[210.1s] churches but it's very important because
[212.5s] we can believe but if we're not acting
[215.6s] is that true belief i' like to think of
[217.9s] Faith as extra credit when the teacher
[220.2s] gives you an assignment you
[222.8s] are called to fulfill 100 out of the
[225.7s] points and so hopefully you can get a
[228.0s] good score an a if you will but before
[232.0s] you receive extra credit you have to
[234.2s] receive the the minimum which is 100%
[237.6s] then you can request for extra credit
[240.4s] but a lot of us really go to the extra
[242.5s] credit before we fulfill our actual
[244.8s] duties God expects us to have something
[248.5s] but little is much when it is in God's
[250.4s] hands and therefore if we have something
[253.1s] to present at least 100% the faith gives
[256.9s] us the opportunity to redeem in a way
[260.6s] extra points that gains our Salvation
[263.7s] amen amen yeah uh and that's very true
[266.6s] you know one of the insights that's
[268.3s] actually uh revealed in the book book by
[270.1s] Mark Finley is that in the Old Testament
[273.4s] uh they were actually saved by a Christ
[275.5s] but the Christ was to come right but in
[278.1s] the New Testament we are saved by the
[280.2s] Christ who actually died on the cross
[282.3s] for our sins right so in both uh
[285.1s] Testaments we are saved by Christ all
[287.3s] right and you know you look at the book
[289.4s] of First uh of First Timothy no sorry
[292.4s] Titus 2:1 and it affirms you know that
[295.6s] we are saved by grace just as the people
[298.2s] in the Old Testament were saved by grace
[300.7s] as well yes and also when we look back I
[303.4s] hope you all watch chapter 2 set free to
[306.2s] obey this idea of being saved by grace
[309.8s] is actually a call to obedience so we
[312.4s] are saved by grace not to disobey but
[315.7s] saved by grace to obey obedience to the
[319.0s] Lord grants us freedom and that freedom
[322.1s] ensures that we can have a good
[323.7s] relationship with Christ amen any
[325.9s] questions for me yes so I'm going to
[328.1s] pose this question to you M didn't Jesus
[330.8s] come to do away with the Ten
[332.6s] Commandments and establish a new
[334.4s] commandment of loveh what about Matthew
[337.1s] CH 22:
[339.0s] 37-40 love God with all your heart your
[342.8s] neighbors as yourself isn't love to God
[345.7s] and our neighbors all Jesus requires
[349.1s] these are the new Commandments yeah yeah
[352.0s] you know I know that in the question
[353.6s] they termed as the new Commandments but
[355.4s] it will surprise you that even those new
[357.0s] Commandments when Jesus was giving those
[358.7s] new Commandments he was merely
[360.4s] summarizing The Ten Commandments you
[362.5s] know when he says love for God and love
[364.5s] for man you know the first four
[366.1s] Commandments have to do with love for
[367.4s] God all right uh you shall Worship the
[369.8s] Lord and serve him alone you shall not
[371.6s] take the lord's name in vain keep the
[373.4s] Sabbath holy do not make for yourself
[375.1s] gra graen images right those
[377.3s] Commandments have to do with God but the
[379.9s] latter half have to do with man you
[381.9s] shall not commit adultery love your
[383.7s] neighbor as yourself right uh uh uh uh
[387.5s] uh obey your parents these Commandments
[390.0s] have to do with how we relate with to
[391.6s] man so God did not essentially or rather
[394.1s] Jesus did not essentially come to do
[395.8s] away with the law in fact he says it
[397.7s] himself he says that I have not come to
[399.9s] do away with the law but to fulfill the
[402.2s] law right and so uh God or Jesus Christ
[406.2s] when he came who was God still uh did
[409.1s] not do away with the law all right
[413.4s] absolutely and I think this reminds me
[415.6s] of Prophecy mhm and so when we think of
[418.9s] Prophecy from the Old Testament there
[421.2s] it's what prophecy is is pointing us to
[423.6s] Jesus and so we find with such
[426.4s] exactitude all the prophecies that are
[428.7s] told in the Old Testament are fulfilled
[431.6s] completely the exact same um and in the
[434.9s] Bible if I can find it um yes so it says
[439.9s] in Isaiah chter
[442.0s] 46:9 I'll read from verse 9 to 10
[444.8s] remember the former things those of long
[447.0s] ago I am God and there is no other I am
[449.3s] God and there's none like me I make
[451.7s] known the end from the beginning from
[454.3s] ancient times what is still to come I
[456.8s] say my purpose will stand and I will do
[459.3s] all that I please and so essentially
[461.9s] what this is is prophecies confirming
[463.9s] the divine inspiration but also the
[466.8s] power of God and still with Jesus being
[470.6s] God he's fulfilling the law not negating
[473.4s] it in any way and that is why both
[475.8s] Testaments are necessary for us to have
[478.3s] a holistic understanding
[480.2s] of our salvation and who God is all
[483.0s] right soir Before I Let You Go there's
[485.4s] just one more question right here it's a
[487.6s] bit of a hard text that's found in
[489.1s] Romans
[490.6s] 14:5 uh rather difficult that says that
[493.6s] we ought not to judge or if one esteems
[496.6s] one day over the other then we shouldn't
[498.7s] really judge that person uh what would
[501.0s] you say about that and uh what are your
[503.6s] insights on that well I would say this
[506.4s] is also a topic of understanding so the
[510.0s] the text in Romans chapter
[512.1s] 14 um this is from Paul and so Paul's
[515.3s] letter to the Romans um he does St he
[518.0s] that he that regards the day regards it
[520.5s] unto the Lord and He that regarded he
[523.6s] regarded not the day regards it not to
[526.0s] the Lord he that eateth eateth to the
[528.9s] Lord for he giveth God thanks and he
[532.3s] that eateth not to the Lord he eateth
[534.7s] not for he giveth God thanks and so this
[537.9s] issue is actually revolving around fast
[540.4s] days not Sabbath days and that's very
[543.8s] important to note because as we somewhat
[547.8s] twist the scripture one can look at this
[550.4s] test and say oh no this is directly
[552.5s] connected to the Sabbath if anything if
[555.0s] we worship on Sunday we worship on
[556.6s] Sabbath it's the same God God doesn't
[559.2s] not not allow us to worship on other
[562.6s] days but let us know the exclusivity of
[566.1s] the Sabbath day God has appointed a time
[568.9s] of rest allowing us to work in the six
[571.3s] days but the seventh day must be
[574.1s] commemorated am and God does so too so
[577.0s] who are we to not amen amen well ladies
[579.5s] and gentlemen we've come to the end I
[580.8s] just want to encourage you to pick up a
[582.6s] copy of this book When God Says remember
[585.0s] and read that chapter 6 it has fantastic
[587.8s] answers to numerous questions questions
[590.4s] uh such as regarding uh let no one judge
[592.8s] you about the Bible Sabbath a text in
[594.8s] Colossians 2:16 I know you have
[596.7s] questions on that questions on you know
[599.5s] was Peter the first pope and you know
[602.5s] what about when Jesus said on this rock
[604.5s] I will build my church uh the Keys of
[606.9s] the Kingdom that were handed to the
[608.6s] apostles in the first days uh all these
[611.0s] questions can be answered when you look
[613.3s] into that chapter but for now let's pray
[616.4s] as we say goodbye dear father in Heaven
[618.9s] oh Lord God we come before you at this
[620.9s] time we thank you so much oh Father for
[622.8s] the day that you have given us and the
[624.2s] ability to read father from your word
[626.5s] now father bless those who have heard
[628.6s] bless us to to keep us and save us for
[630.9s] your kingdom when you come in Jesus name
[632.8s] I pray amen amen
