FULL TRANSCRIPT:
you missed [Laughter] me was not part of [Laughter] this we thank the Lord now let's bring our thoughts to the message for the day it's beautiful to have the privilege to share the word of God this morning together with us our subject this morning as you can see those are able to see the screen and those are not able to see the subject this morning is a lost treasure in plain side a lost treasure in plain sight just to remind us that we uh into our second month of our strategic Focus theme for the year 2025 2026 the theme is Brent and growing now this month if you're following through in our strategic Focus the theme for this month is nourished by his word nourished by his word the objective of this for this month is to draw church members and all believers back to the Bible and I will use this subject a lost treasure in plain sight to create curiosity and interest uh for believers to go back to the reading of the word of God basically what I'm going to do this morning is to take us through the Bible Journey how the Bible has been able to to impact the world and where we are today when tables seem to have turned on the Bible and seemingly many people are rejecting the Bible you see friends I want first to imagine discovering an ancient map that leads to a hidden treasure that is so special immesurable value one that holds the key to wisdom life and Eternity now again imagine people dismissing that map this one is old it is outdated it is irrelevant it is inconveniencing us and so they just threw it away and they have nothing to do with that particular map now this is actually the Paradox of the Bible in our contemporary Society you see the history has revealed that the Bible has played a major role in shaping the economies shaping Nations and shaping many things that today we enjoy the Bible has been at the center of every society but today this book that has been so much been of use in shaping many many systems and structures of our societies seemingly is been looked at something that is inconveniencing Our Lives despite it stess truth and transformative power that the Bible comes with people have replaced it with fleeting philosophies personal opinions and human reasoning now let me remind us quickly friends that in this particular text or of Psalm 19 from verse number 7 the bible says the law of the Lord is perfect converting the soul the testimony of the Lord is sure making wise the simple verse 8 the statutes of the Lord are are right rejoicing the heart the Commandment of the Lord is pure and enlightening the eyes verse number nine the fear of the Lord is clean enduring forever the judgments of the Lord are true and righteous altogether and verse number 10 more to be desired are they than gold more to be desired are they than gold yay than much fine gold sweeter also than honey and the honecomb the word of God is to be desired more than gold to be desired more than fine gold the word of God is sweeter than honey oh yes sweeter than the honeycomb the word of God is to be desired now I am having this passage in my mind even as I speak to us today on the subject of a lost treasure in the plain s let me quickly take us through this word of God this morning but before I do this let's have a word of prayer gracious Father in heaven Hallowed Be the Name the kingdom come thy will be done in this place and for this message as it is in heaven for thine is the kingdom the power and the glory father you say to be lifted up you shall draw all men unto yourself and so Lord this morning my request is that you may put your words into my mouth that you may order my thoughts and my lips to your will in Jesus name I pray amen Jour with me briefly as I try to show you what the Bible has been in the past history I said the Bible the today seemingly forgotten the Bible has impacted the history of the world in all spheres of History the Bible has been the most influential book in history shaping civilizations cultures laws education system art and even personal lives for thousands and thousands of years across the history it has been a transformed power into the society's life guided the leaders that have worked before us provided moral foundations of every society and inspired great movement that shook the entire world I quickly remind you of how the Bible was and has been so key in formation of legal systems of the entire world many modern legal principles are actually rooted in the biblical laws that I sposed in the Bible now for example the Ten Commandments in Exodus 20 verse 1-1 17 shaped the leg of foundations of Western Civilization those of us who are standing history we know and we appreciate that the early legal documents including the Magna those are legal people here you know what I'm talking about B was based in the year 20155 or we talk about the English common laws and the USA Constitution all these borrowed heavily from The Ten Commandments now if you doubt go back to history and check what I'm talking about and you see the people then relied on the Bible to structure laws that would govern the Society of their days now we read in the Ten Commandments and the Bible says in Exodus chapter number 20 verse number 13 you shall not murder now this became the foundation for the laws against homicide the Bible says in Exodus 20 verse number 15 you shall not steal now this became the basis for the property laws and criminal you know laws that we have today about Justice the Bible says in Exodus 20 verse number 16 you shall not bear false witness and this became the legal principle of ping lying under oath and all when you go through the Bible and you pick the Bible carefully you see actually the legal systems of the Nations do from the Bible I mean the Bible has been so critical so important in shaping the societies it has not been just used in shaping the legal systems but I want to let you know friends that the three branches of any government have drawn and bured heavily from the Bible they a strative of the government the executive arm of the government the judicial system of the government they mirror the roles of God as a judge God as a lawgiver and God as a king now for example if I give you a man called William bstone who writing shaped English and American law system he actually Cen the Bible as the foundation for the moral law that governs his country now the Bible was not just used to shape the LA legal system but the Bible was at the center of championing the abolition abolition of the slaver trade we remember how the slavery or the slave trade and undermined the human rights and the people who crusaded against the slave trade based their discussion and their discourses on the Bible the word of God the Bible played a key role in abolishing slavery through leaders who saw all people as cat in God's image and they kept on quoting the Book of Genesis chter 1 verse number 27 let us make man in our own image and in the image of God he created them male and female and they would AR and say everyone is equal in the eyes of the Lord they pushed the Bible narrative into the Parliament and brought up registrations that gave people freedom and rights and abolished slavery the Bible has been critical book in the history of the world this book has not just been able to shape the legal system this book has not only been used to shape or abolish the slave trade but this book especially found itself in the hands of prominent people who then leading their countries were able to shape their Nations to ones having you know privileges that God gave people I will just give an example of Abraham Lincoln many of us you know we appreciate this president or the 16th president of United States of America now this particular president is remembered to have walked with the Bible everywhere he was and he used to use the Bible powerfully in his discourses and because of him and because of the Bible that was in his hand in everywhere he went in his speeches this is what led to 1863 in America the issued of the issuance of the Emancipation Proclamation it was entirely based on the discourse of Abraham Lincoln from The Bible I am simply saying the Bible has been a treasure in this world but I am concerned today that we don't see the Bible occupying the very place that has occupied somehow things have changed the Bible has been removed from where it was and other things have taken Center place this month and this quarter and this year we are talking about rooted and growing and you cannot be rooted and grow if you're not rooted in the word of God this morning I'm just here to remind you friends the centrality of the Bible in the Christian church now the Bible was not just used to sh the legal systems or abolish the the slavery but actually the Bible is the source the essence the reason behind all the institutions of of learning we see today the Bible impacted education system and literacy I'll just give you a few examples you know the the the famous universities we know today in the world all almost all of them began as seminaries training the Bible the missionaries who came across Asia and Africa and India and everywhere they all came and they planted churches to train people to understand to read the Bible and because of that today we have so so many schools in the world the Bible was at the center of shaping the education systems of the world now just an example harand University that was established in 1636 was founded by Puritans to train ministers in biblical Doctrine Oxford and Cambridge University studed as a Theological Seminary for the Deep biblical study preson University that was formed in 1746 his Motel was under God's she flourishes all these great universities came as a result of the Bible but what is happening today universities have removed the Bible from the syllabus the schools today in the developed world do not want the Bible to be the classroom today is offensive for you to put the biblical agenda in the classroom the Bible has been removed from where God and placed it in the universe I am not too sure whether the Bible still occupies the same position in the church well I don't know who I'm talking to this morning but but I'm just concerned that where I stand I see the Bible has lost Exposition we today in the society have drawn the Bible from where it is set in shaping the societies and shaping the human right by the way all the entire idea of Human Rights and equality was all based in the Bible by the same body that the Bible was used to establish is the one that is being used today to fight the Bible things have turned things have changed the Bible that has been the greatest influential book in history shaping civilizations a book that has been used to establish education system and literacy institutions the book that has been the best of Judicial Systems of the world and governance of Nations a book that has transformed lives societies G leaders and provided moral foundations and inspiring great movement today has been rejected what a s situation today what a s state of things today a book that was everything for man today is nothing for man I am here this morning briefly to remind my church that we should not allow ourself as a body of Faith to fall into the Trap the world has fallen into I am here today to say the Bible is still the rule of Authority for Humanity there is no there is no society that can Thrive without thus says the Lord a people without the word of God a society with the Bible is a society that is broken and look at us today and see how because of the very fact that the Bible is no longer given the prominence that it used to have how the society has changed the morals have decayed people become massless people don't care people live in how they want and laws are being you know Judicial Systems and parliaments are being is coming up with laws and laws and laws to San human rights against the right that have been given by the Bible today the Bible doesn't matter all that matters is what I feel is what you feel don't tell me about the Bible now not not too long ago I was talking with a friend and she told me uh allow me to to do this she told me she could be listening watching and I Bor permission to say this that she reported into a new place of work and then she as a Christian in that meeting she said oh can you pray before we start the meeting she said is a good Adventist then our boss looked at us said excuse me Madame here we don't pray here we don't pray keep your prayers now you thinking that is was happening in some place in Middle East no no no no no no no no no no you think that is happening some place in you no no no no that happened right here in this country here we don't pray I I know what is your thought about what I'm talking about today but the Bible has not only been ignored by systems but also has been ignored by individuals you know the Bible prophesy in this particular time in 2 Timothy chter 4 verse number 3 and 4 now Paul spoke to Timothy and told him listen to me young preacher for the time will come when people will not put up with sound Doctrine instead to suit their own desires they will gather around them a great number of teachers to say what their eaching years want to hear today it is not about what the Bible says it's not about what God want us to hear it's about what we want to hear Pastor Don't Preach to us that message because we don't want to hear that message preach to us what we want to hear now there who are today in most churches in most Pulpit the Bible is no longer the authority of the preacher today the Propet has been turned to entertainment it is where people come to feel good before they start another week today a pastor a preacher who is stuck on the Bible is actually an outdated P you got to understand where people are and come where people are today the Bible is no longer the authority on the pulpit because people are fulfilling the prophecy that Paul gave the young preacher Timothy many people they own bies but rarely do they read it let me just sample here not to shame anyone not to shame anyone and be very honest before the Lord do you have somebody here from when we we we left here last Sabbath very honestly you did not get time to open your Bible anyone you you didn't open your Bible no offense no offense no offense you are just busy you are just busy and you thank God has come thank God saath has come oh let let me see how many of you from the day we left last Sabbath you actually took your Bible at home at your workplace open and study the Bible let me see okay if you're standing where I am then you could say God have mercy no what I'm talking about is so real we read even though we have Bibles in our houses we really take time structure and time to stud the Bible We Know It All by the way what is it that we don't know and you know on Ser Pastor will be there to read the Bible for us we are going to listen to the message and our pastors are they going to preach I'm okay I'm okay by the way I attended a prayer session so I had the preacher mentioning ver and that morning I listen to the Bible I have a podcast you know whenever driving going to work I listen to this message I'm okay I'm okay the Bible slowly has been taken away out of the Christians life the rise of social media entertainment and secular ideologies as replaced time that our forefathers spent in the scripture some Churches today focus on F good messages and let me let me let me say here I'm sorry we choose not to selectively give you f good messages we'll be very intentional to tell you what the lord requires of you in this age the Bible is today seen as on fashioned especially within the young people well the new age believes and looks at life from an individual perspective the Bible was meant to be the light on our path but today we are working on paths that are so dark because the Bible which ought to be our light is no longer on our paths the Bible has not only been rejected but actually has been attacked and persecuted across the history but especially in our contemporary Society now Jesus and world of course and said in John 15: number 18 if the world hates you keep in mind that it hat me first in many parts of the world Christians are persecuted for owning the Bible now I was listening to our preacher just the other day who was here and we in a moment with him and he told me you know Pastor he was in some place here in Middle East and was doing a week of prayer there and he told me you know what Pastor you are so lucky to have the church in this country that you can preach any time you want and call people as as many as they can there where I was preaching the nation has regulated you cannot baptize more than four people now by the way not too far from where we are I don't want to mention the name but you in that country no no and they say we have given you a big favor but listen you go do whatever you want to do preach where you want to preach but you cannot baptize how many people more than four people and in every Church there is a representative of the government B in every Church the mon everything that is happening in the churches and when an alter call is made and people come out they're watching to see they won stop people from coming but they want to see after they come how many people is the pastor going to register in the books of the church through baptism if you do more than four you're locked in but Bible is being persecuted today now I want to mention North Korea China and Iran if you go to these countries there is absolutely little freedom for the Bible anyone owning the Bible in this countries is the threat to the prosperity of the Nations Christian businesses and individuals are used used to you know long time ago the Bible was everywhere and and even today you know as I walk and travel uh and especially in the Christian countries you'll go to hotels and when you get to your room the first thing you see on the table is what but I've been asking myself by the way how many people who use those rules even touch that Bible the bibles are everywhere even in the Christian countries even in the Christian churches even in the Christian homes but people see the Bible say ah this is our book I know every and they will busy themselves on other things that they think they don't have this is the weapon the devil has used to weaken the church and we are saying in the year 2025 Central Church we want to grow through being rooted in Christ and for us be rooted the Christ we are calling the church back to the Bible and I want ask here this morning why as the book th was once so loved become so hated the book that was so important become so useless and rejected why is the Bible today being rejected I have a friend in Australia he was telling me you can't share faith I have relatives in you as who tell me in public places keep your faith don't tell us about your faith why has the Bible all of a sudden become so hated why do people fear the Bible what has the Bible done is it true that the B Bible has become outdated and is not relevant to this age is it true that the Bible is no longer impactful it's no longer transformative it's no longer changing lives what has the Bible done to the people of this world well when I was struggling to appreciate what is happening with our good book then somebody something came to my mind and I want to let you know that this morning Paul spoke about it in Hebrews CH 4 verse number 12 you may want to know this this morning why has the Bible become so HED all of a sudden why has the B become so rejected well Hebrews chapter 4 Paul gives a clue in verse number 12 Paul writes here and says for the word of God I wish it could be projected for the word of God is is somebody with me let's reading together for the word of God is quick and Powerful just stop there the word of God is what quick and Powerful no no no no no no no you see we are in an age where men and women have become so powerful and no power won't be challenged the Bible is a powerful Authority and the people in Authority do not want anything challenging their Authority the Bible says that the word of God say the word of God is what quick and Powerful the Bible says and sharper than any twoed sword now the Bible is actually is actually a weapon it is quicker it is sharper than any two sword now if this text was being written today we would be talking about two Angel sword because the two Ang was then one of the very serious sophisticated Weaponry now today we'll be talking about very serious you know weapons of mass destruction that are existing today no the Bible is a weapon of mass destruction anyone who interact with the Bible anyone who interacts with the Bible doesn't matter who you are the Bible will cast you and align you with God and because people do not want to change their ways they better keep the Bible away because the Bible is powerful Bible says for the word of God is quick and powerful and sharper than any two Ang sword piercing even to the dividing Ascender of Soul and Spirit you see friends in the end we living today these are the days Paul said perous times of come people shall never want to heed to any s Doctrine people's life will be so difficult their hearts their love will dry away we are living in an age where people become so much hearted in their heart and the only thing that can Pierce through that difficult heart is the sword of the spirit the word of God and because people do not want to change they better keep the Bible away why has the Bible become so hien today is because people do not want the biblical truth people want to embrace Lifestyles sinful Lifestyles they feel okay they feel good in their sins now first teachers the Bible said they shall come and they will preach that which entertains the mind that which entertains the soul that we should give the soul and elevation of This World by the Bible the word of God as a way of getting into the heart into the spirit and even into the marrow and break it down andern even the intent of the soul and align the heart of men the heart of God now the Bible says this one of God is powerful and is able to to to to to come into your life and do an operation of your heart and do a heart transplant and Remove Your Heart of Stone and bring to you and give you a heart of Flesh no people love the Heart of Stone more than the heart of Flesh are you somebody with me this morning now because of this the Bible must be rejected and slowly the Christian Church Without understanding how the game is being played we are all falling into the Trap of rejecting the Bible people today they are rejecting the Bible because they want to create their own version of Truth people are creating their own version of Truth Now Jesus said I am the truth the way and life now people don't want Jesus they want to create their own version of Truth doesn't matter what Jesus said it's about I want what I feel don't tell me about your religion don't tell me about your Jesus no don't tell me about your faith tell me what I want to hear people are creating their own version of the truth but the Bible reminds me there is no any other truth but the one in Jesus Christ many churches today AV preaching about Sin about repentance and Holiness messages focus on prosperity and self- Improvement this is what people are feeding on God's social media see almost every church today the messing there is just for Prosperity entertainment it's motivation and people feel okay because people are so stressed but even as you go you know you know you know today pull pit has become like a painkiller somebody is not with me you come you have been so stressed and oppressed your business is not working and preacher tells you it's because you forgot to plant a seed that's your problem plant what seed and today today even in the advented church I have seen members who come to church with their offering listen to me carefully with their offering as a Miss to tell God God see today I'm giving offering please remember me you give so that you can bless that is not the teaching the word of God you come to give because you have overflowing with Thanksgiving towards God who has been in your life you don't give so that God can give you but today the Christian church has been taught go and give so that God can bless you and if you are not blessed because you're not giving listen to me keep your money keep your money keep your money do not bring money to church that God can bless you God blesses you even when you do not know him keep your money keep your money but give only as a result of you overflowing the love of your God come and worship him we are tired of the messages on the pulpit that pushes people to give so that they can bless the Bible does not teach that God blessed us even before we knew him why as the Bible become all of a sudden so hden today is because the world is teaching today there is no absolute truth but the Bible says there is absolute truth Jesus is the truth Jesus is the truth Jesus is the truth anyone seeking for truth on any issue of religion and salvation it is is found in Jesus that is truth absolute now the word is telling us follow your heart that is the message in the world today but the Bible says no no do not follow your heart why because your heart the heart is a deceitful above how many things all things but what is happening today in the world we are being pushed to follow our hearts this is an advice of the evil one to destroy the Christian Church listen to me my church do not follow your heart follow Jesus Christ Jesus is found in his word said You shall know the truth and the truth so set you free and then it says I am a truth look out for Jesus the one today does not want the Bible because the B the one is telling us today all relationss lead to God all rels lead to God doesn't matter kyans you understand what I'm talking about now those of you in the internet not this country you don't understand what I'm talking about no let me break it for you you know the word is telling us never never about what church you go to a church is your heart and so they say all the legions are equal they all lead to God why are they pushing this narrative is because the Bible says no no not all religion that leads to God acts 4 verse number 12 the Bible says nor is there salvation in any other there is no salvation in any other for there's no other name under Heaven that has been given among men by which they must be saved by the name of Jesus there is not salvation elsewhere salvation is in Jesus you can't tell me all Leg lead to God no there's no any other that give salvation but Jesus you take Jesus you accept him or you rejecting him I can tell you for sure the Bible means what it says there is no salvation in any other but in Jesus the world is rejecting the Bible because the Bible will Point people to Jesus and I am here today to speak to my church and tell my church let go back to the Bible let's go back to the Bible my church let's go back to the Bible when we are living in an age where the Bible is growing exceedingly unimportant the eyes of people we need to go back to the Bible in a society where the social media FS the mind we need to remind our Young Generation the Bible FS the soul and you shall not go to heaven because of your mind you shall go to heaven because of your soul take time with the word of God and feed your soul in a world where we are living and today the entertainment has taking the world we need to go back to the Bible we have a witness out here today are you here today do you say in your heart yes let's go back to the Bible let me speak to you and say this friends a Bible less life A Bess life is a directionless directionless life A Bess life is a directionless life and that's why you see confusion today so much confusion today men marry men women Maring men people doing all kinds of evil things why because the Bible has been rejected when the word is rewriting truth bring back the Bible when social media shapes Minds more than the scripture bring back the Bible when families gather around screens instead of scripture bring back the Bible when B time stories have been replaced have replaced the Bible stories I am calling my church bring bring back the Bible when kids know celebrities more than Bible characters bring back the Bible for this is the only way to attain salvation this morning this morning this morning who would say with me give me the Bible give me the Bible I want to invite chers to come and give her that song give me the Bible but I want to pray with somebody who says Jesus I want to be intentional with my Bible I want the Bible to be my companion even where they don't want me to read the Bible I will read my Bible and I want to say like Paul I am not ashamed of the Gospel of Jesus Christ because it is salvation andto all men I Pastor Peter Naga I'm not a ashamed of the Gospel of Jesus this book is eternal life this book is salvation in this book a transformation in this book there is hope in this book there's healing in this book there's everything you desire for your life I give you today the Bible read the Bible

TIMESTAMPED TRANSCRIPT:
[1.6s] you missed
[2.5s] [Laughter]
[6.4s] me was not part of
[8.5s] [Laughter]
[13.4s] this we thank the Lord
[16.7s] now let's bring our thoughts to the
[20.1s] message for the
[22.6s] day it's beautiful to have the privilege
[26.7s] to share the word of God this morning
[30.1s] together with
[32.2s] us our subject this
[35.9s] morning as you can see those are able to
[39.1s] see the screen and those are not able to
[42.8s] see the subject this morning is a lost
[47.9s] treasure in plain
[50.3s] side a lost treasure in plain
[56.1s] sight just to remind us that we uh
[61.0s] into our second month of our strategic
[66.1s] Focus theme for the year 2025
[69.4s] 2026 the theme is Brent and growing now
[75.0s] this
[76.6s] month if you're following through in our
[79.8s] strategic Focus the theme for this month
[83.0s] is nourished by his
[85.5s] word nourished by his word the objective
[90.4s] of this for this month is to draw church
[94.0s] members and all believers back to the
[99.1s] Bible and I will use this subject a lost
[104.8s] treasure in plain sight to create
[108.0s] curiosity and interest uh for believers
[111.0s] to go back to the reading of the word of
[113.1s] God basically what I'm going to do this
[115.3s] morning is to take us through the Bible
[117.8s] Journey how the Bible has been able to
[119.9s] to impact the world and where we are
[122.5s] today when tables seem to have turned on
[125.0s] the Bible and seemingly many people are
[128.0s] rejecting the Bible you see
[131.8s] friends I want first to
[134.8s] imagine discovering an ancient map that
[138.9s] leads to a hidden treasure that is so
[142.6s] special immesurable
[145.0s] value one that holds the key to wisdom
[150.0s] life and
[152.5s] Eternity now again
[155.6s] imagine people
[157.9s] dismissing that
[160.3s] map this one is old it is outdated it is
[165.2s] irrelevant it is inconveniencing us and
[168.6s] so they just threw it away and they have
[171.3s] nothing to do with that particular map
[174.0s] now this is actually the Paradox of the
[177.4s] Bible in our contemporary
[181.0s] Society you
[183.3s] see the history has revealed that the
[186.7s] Bible has played a major role in shaping
[190.9s] the economies shaping Nations and
[193.6s] shaping many things that today we enjoy
[196.7s] the Bible has been at the center of
[199.9s] every
[201.2s] society but today this book that has
[205.4s] been so much been of use in shaping many
[210.0s] many systems and structures of our
[212.3s] societies
[213.8s] seemingly is been looked at something
[216.6s] that is
[217.6s] inconveniencing Our Lives despite it
[220.9s] stess truth and transformative power
[223.6s] that the Bible comes with people have
[225.9s] replaced it with fleeting
[228.4s] philosophies personal
[230.4s] opinions and human
[233.3s] reasoning now let me remind us quickly
[235.6s] friends
[237.3s] that in this particular text or
[241.0s] of Psalm
[245.4s] 19 from verse number
[247.9s] 7 the bible
[250.2s] says the law of the Lord is
[254.8s] perfect converting the
[258.6s] soul the testimony of the Lord is sure
[263.4s] making wise the simple verse 8 the
[267.6s] statutes of the Lord are are right
[271.6s] rejoicing the heart the Commandment of
[275.2s] the Lord is
[276.5s] pure and
[278.4s] enlightening the eyes verse number nine
[282.3s] the fear of the Lord is
[284.8s] clean enduring forever the judgments of
[289.3s] the Lord are true and righteous
[292.9s] altogether and verse number 10 more to
[296.3s] be desired are they than gold
[300.8s] more to be desired are they than gold
[305.5s] yay than much fine gold sweeter also
[310.9s] than honey and the honecomb the word of
[314.4s] God is to be desired more than gold to
[319.0s] be desired more than fine gold the word
[322.8s] of God is sweeter than honey oh yes
[325.9s] sweeter than the honeycomb the word of
[329.3s] God
[330.6s] is to be desired now I am having this
[333.6s] passage in my mind even as I speak to us
[335.9s] today on the subject of a lost treasure
[339.5s] in the plain s let me quickly take us
[343.5s] through this word of God this morning
[346.0s] but before I do this let's have a word
[347.6s] of prayer gracious Father in heaven
[350.6s] Hallowed Be the Name the kingdom come
[353.2s] thy will be done in this place and for
[355.0s] this message as it is in heaven for
[357.3s] thine is the kingdom the power and the
[359.4s] glory
[360.7s] father you say to be lifted up you shall
[363.0s] draw all men unto yourself and so Lord
[365.7s] this morning my request is that you may
[368.6s] put your words into my mouth that you
[371.0s] may order my thoughts and my lips to
[372.7s] your will in Jesus name I pray
[378.0s] amen Jour with me briefly as I try to
[382.4s] show you what the Bible has been in the
[385.2s] past
[386.2s] history I said the
[388.4s] Bible the today seemingly forgotten the
[392.6s] Bible has impacted the history of the
[395.1s] world in all spheres of History the
[398.6s] Bible has been the most influential book
[401.8s] in history shaping
[404.4s] civilizations cultures laws education
[408.1s] system art and even personal lives for
[411.3s] thousands and thousands of years across
[413.3s] the history it has been a
[416.2s] transformed power into the society's
[419.0s] life
[420.1s] guided the leaders that have worked
[422.3s] before us provided moral foundations of
[426.6s] every society and inspired great
[430.1s] movement that shook the entire world I
[434.5s] quickly remind you of how the Bible was
[437.2s] and has been so key in formation of
[440.4s] legal systems of the entire world many
[444.2s] modern legal principles are actually
[446.9s] rooted in the biblical laws that I
[450.0s] sposed in the Bible now for example the
[452.3s] Ten Commandments in Exodus 20 verse 1-1
[456.9s] 17 shaped the leg of foundations of
[460.5s] Western Civilization those of us who are
[463.2s] standing history we know and we
[464.9s] appreciate that the early legal
[468.0s] documents including the Magna those are
[471.9s] legal people here you know what I'm
[473.2s] talking about B was based in the year
[475.4s] 20155 or we talk about the English
[478.0s] common laws and
[480.0s] the USA Constitution all these borrowed
[484.0s] heavily from The Ten
[486.6s] Commandments now if you doubt go back to
[489.2s] history and check what I'm talking about
[491.8s] and you see the people then relied on
[494.6s] the Bible to structure laws that would
[497.8s] govern the Society of their days now we
[501.3s] read in the Ten Commandments and the
[503.5s] Bible says in Exodus chapter number 20
[505.8s] verse number 13 you shall not murder now
[509.9s] this became the foundation for the laws
[512.8s] against homicide the Bible says in
[515.6s] Exodus 20 verse number 15 you shall not
[518.8s] steal now this became the basis for the
[522.1s] property laws and criminal you know laws
[525.3s] that we have today about Justice the
[527.8s] Bible says in Exodus 20 verse number 16
[531.1s] you shall not bear false witness and
[534.2s] this became the legal principle of ping
[537.5s] lying under oath and all when you go
[540.6s] through the Bible and you pick the Bible
[542.6s] carefully you see actually the legal
[544.7s] systems of the Nations do from the Bible
[549.2s] I mean the Bible has been so critical so
[552.4s] important in shaping the societies it
[555.9s] has not been just used in shaping the
[558.1s] legal systems but I want to let you know
[560.9s] friends that the three branches of any
[563.9s] government have drawn and bured heavily
[566.8s] from the Bible they a strative of the
[569.6s] government the executive arm of the
[571.2s] government the judicial system of the
[573.0s] government they mirror the roles of God
[575.8s] as a judge God as a lawgiver and God as
[579.2s] a king now for example if I give you a
[582.7s] man called William bstone who writing
[585.5s] shaped English and American law system
[588.2s] he actually Cen the Bible as the
[590.8s] foundation for the moral law that
[593.4s] governs his country now the Bible was
[596.4s] not just used to shape the LA legal
[598.5s] system but the Bible was at the center
[601.8s] of championing the abolition abolition
[604.6s] of the slaver trade we remember how the
[607.9s] slavery or the slave trade and
[609.8s] undermined the human rights and the
[612.9s] people who crusaded against the slave
[615.6s] trade based their discussion and their
[618.4s] discourses on the Bible the word of God
[621.8s] the Bible played a key role in
[623.7s] abolishing slavery through leaders who
[626.6s] saw all people as cat in God's image and
[630.7s] they kept on quoting the Book of Genesis
[632.7s] chter 1 verse number 27 let us make man
[635.8s] in our own image and in the image of God
[638.8s] he created them male and female and they
[641.8s] would AR and say everyone is equal in
[644.7s] the eyes of the Lord they pushed the
[647.2s] Bible narrative into the Parliament and
[649.6s] brought up registrations that gave
[651.8s] people freedom and rights and abolished
[654.4s] slavery the Bible has been critical book
[657.7s] in the history of the world
[660.0s] this book has not just been able to
[662.6s] shape the legal system this book has not
[665.9s] only been used to shape or abolish the
[668.6s] slave trade but this book especially
[672.8s] found itself in the hands of prominent
[675.8s] people who then leading their countries
[678.6s] were able to shape their Nations to ones
[681.4s] having you know privileges that God gave
[684.6s] people I will just give an example of
[687.1s] Abraham Lincoln many of us you know we
[689.5s] appreciate this president or the 16th
[691.8s] president of United States of America
[693.8s] now this particular president is
[695.8s] remembered to have walked with the Bible
[698.5s] everywhere he was and he used to use the
[701.1s] Bible powerfully in his discourses and
[703.7s] because of him and because of the Bible
[706.0s] that was in his hand in everywhere he
[708.2s] went in his speeches this is what led to
[711.6s] 1863 in America the issued of the
[715.2s] issuance of the Emancipation
[717.2s] Proclamation it was entirely based on
[720.1s] the discourse of Abraham Lincoln from
[723.0s] The Bible I am simply saying the Bible
[726.4s] has been a treasure in this world but I
[730.3s] am concerned today that we don't see the
[733.4s] Bible occupying the very place that has
[736.2s] occupied somehow things have changed the
[739.4s] Bible has been removed from where it was
[742.7s] and other things have taken Center place
[745.4s] this month and this quarter and this
[748.0s] year we are talking about rooted and
[750.8s] growing and you cannot be rooted and
[753.3s] grow if you're not rooted in the word of
[755.6s] God this morning I'm just here to remind
[758.4s] you friends the centrality of the Bible
[761.4s] in the Christian church now the Bible
[764.7s] was not just used to sh the legal
[766.8s] systems or abolish the the slavery but
[770.3s] actually the Bible is the source the
[774.2s] essence the reason behind all the
[778.2s] institutions of of learning we see today
[781.4s] the Bible impacted education system and
[784.7s] literacy I'll just give you a few
[786.6s] examples you know the the the famous
[789.4s] universities we know today in the world
[792.0s] all almost all of them began as
[794.6s] seminaries training the Bible the
[797.2s] missionaries who came across Asia and
[800.0s] Africa and India and everywhere they all
[802.6s] came and they planted churches to train
[805.6s] people to understand to read the Bible
[807.4s] and because of that today we have so so
[809.3s] many schools in the world the Bible was
[811.6s] at the center of shaping the education
[814.0s] systems of the world now just an example
[817.1s] harand University that was established
[819.0s] in
[819.8s] 1636 was founded by Puritans to train
[823.2s] ministers in biblical Doctrine Oxford
[826.1s] and Cambridge University studed as a
[828.5s] Theological Seminary for the Deep
[830.6s] biblical study preson University that
[834.1s] was formed in
[835.5s] 1746 his Motel was under God's
[839.8s] she flourishes all these great
[842.8s] universities came as a result of the
[845.4s] Bible but what is happening today
[847.8s] universities have removed the Bible from
[850.2s] the syllabus the schools today in the
[853.3s] developed world do not want the Bible to
[856.1s] be the classroom today is offensive for
[859.0s] you to put the biblical agenda in the
[861.4s] classroom the Bible has been removed
[864.5s] from where God and placed it in the
[866.9s] universe I am not too sure whether the
[869.5s] Bible still occupies the same position
[872.4s] in the
[874.7s] church well I don't know who I'm talking
[878.1s] to this morning but but I'm just
[880.3s] concerned that where I stand I see the
[884.1s] Bible has lost
[887.0s] Exposition we today in the society have
[891.4s] drawn the Bible from where it is set in
[894.9s] shaping the societies and shaping the
[897.9s] human right by the way all the entire
[900.6s] idea of Human Rights and equality was
[903.8s] all based in the Bible by the same body
[907.2s] that the Bible was used to establish is
[909.5s] the one that is being used today to
[911.5s] fight the Bible things have turned
[915.4s] things have changed the Bible that has
[918.1s] been the greatest influential book in
[920.2s] history shaping civilizations a book
[923.0s] that has been used to establish
[924.6s] education system and literacy
[926.3s] institutions the book that has been the
[928.6s] best of Judicial Systems of the world
[930.7s] and governance of Nations a book that
[933.3s] has transformed lives societies G
[936.2s] leaders and provided moral foundations
[939.2s] and inspiring great movement today has
[942.4s] been
[944.1s] rejected what a s situation today what a
[949.1s] s state of things today a book that was
[953.8s] everything for man today is nothing for
[957.4s] man I am here this morning briefly to
[960.9s] remind my church that we should not
[963.9s] allow ourself as a body of Faith to fall
[968.0s] into the Trap the world has fallen into
[971.7s] I am here today to say the Bible is
[974.0s] still the rule of Authority for Humanity
[977.6s] there is no there is no society that can
[981.7s] Thrive without thus says the Lord a
[986.4s] people without the word of God a society
[989.3s] with the Bible is a society that is
[992.2s] broken and look at us today and see how
[996.4s] because of the very fact that the Bible
[999.5s] is no longer given the prominence that
[1001.5s] it used to have how the society has
[1004.8s] changed the morals have decayed people
[1008.7s] become massless people don't care people
[1012.3s] live in how they want and laws are being
[1015.9s] you know Judicial Systems and
[1018.1s] parliaments are being is coming up with
[1020.1s] laws and laws and laws to San human
[1023.2s] rights against the right that have been
[1025.4s] given by the Bible today the Bible
[1027.6s] doesn't matter all that matters is what
[1030.6s] I feel is what you feel don't tell me
[1034.2s] about the Bible now not not too long ago
[1036.9s] I was talking with a
[1038.7s] friend and she told
[1041.6s] me
[1043.4s] uh allow me
[1045.9s] to to do this
[1058.5s] she told
[1059.6s] me she could be listening
[1064.0s] watching and I Bor permission to say
[1067.0s] this that she reported into a new place
[1070.2s] of
[1071.0s] work and then she as a Christian in that
[1074.7s] meeting she said oh can you pray before
[1076.1s] we start the
[1077.6s] meeting she said is a good
[1080.0s] Adventist then our boss looked at us
[1082.4s] said excuse me Madame here we don't
[1088.0s] pray here we don't pray keep your
[1094.4s] prayers now you thinking that is was
[1096.7s] happening in some place in Middle East
[1098.2s] no no no no no no no no no no you think
[1100.0s] that is happening some place in you no
[1101.6s] no no no that happened right here in
[1103.4s] this
[1104.2s] country here we don't
[1107.5s] pray I I know what is your thought about
[1111.9s] what I'm talking about
[1113.6s] today but the Bible has not only been
[1116.6s] ignored by systems but also has been
[1119.3s] ignored by
[1120.9s] individuals you know the Bible prophesy
[1124.0s] in this particular time in 2 Timothy
[1126.3s] chter 4 verse number 3 and 4 now Paul
[1129.0s] spoke to Timothy and told him listen to
[1130.7s] me young preacher for the time will come
[1133.7s] when people will not put up with sound
[1137.2s] Doctrine instead
[1140.0s] to suit their
[1142.0s] own desires they will gather around them
[1147.1s] a great number of teachers to say what
[1150.8s] their eaching years want to hear today
[1156.5s] it is not about what the Bible says it's
[1159.4s] not about what God want us to hear it's
[1162.2s] about what we want to hear Pastor Don't
[1165.8s] Preach to us that message because we
[1168.0s] don't want to hear that message preach
[1170.9s] to us what we want to hear now there who
[1174.1s] are today in most churches in most
[1176.2s] Pulpit the Bible is no longer the
[1179.2s] authority of the preacher today the
[1181.6s] Propet has been turned to entertainment
[1184.4s] it is where people come to feel good
[1187.0s] before they start another week today a
[1189.4s] pastor a preacher who is stuck on the
[1191.9s] Bible is actually an outdated P you got
[1196.2s] to understand where people are and come
[1198.3s] where people are today the Bible is no
[1201.7s] longer the authority on the pulpit
[1204.5s] because people are fulfilling the
[1206.9s] prophecy that Paul gave the young
[1209.0s] preacher
[1209.8s] Timothy many
[1213.1s] people they own
[1216.6s] bies but
[1219.6s] rarely do they read
[1222.6s] it let me just sample
[1226.4s] here not to shame anyone

[1232.1s] anyone and be very honest before the
[1234.5s] Lord do you have somebody here from when

[1271.0s] workplace open and study the Bible let
[1273.2s] me
[1276.0s] see okay if you're standing where I am
[1278.4s] then you could say God have
[1281.4s] mercy no what I'm talking about is so
[1284.8s] real we read even though we have Bibles
[1288.1s] in our houses we really take time
[1292.1s] structure and time to stud the Bible We
[1294.4s] Know It All by the way what is it that
[1296.1s] we don't know and you know on Ser Pastor
[1298.0s] will be there to read the Bible for us
[1299.3s] we are going to listen to the message
[1300.6s] and our pastors are they going to preach
[1302.6s] I'm okay I'm okay by the way I attended
[1304.6s] a prayer session so I had the preacher
[1306.2s] mentioning ver and that morning I listen
[1308.1s] to the Bible I have a podcast you know
[1310.6s] whenever driving going to work I listen
[1312.3s] to this message I'm okay I'm okay the
[1315.2s] Bible slowly has been taken away out of
[1318.9s] the Christians
[1320.9s] life the rise of social media
[1323.7s] entertainment and secular ideologies as
[1326.6s] replaced time that our forefathers spent
[1330.4s] in the scripture some Churches today
[1333.4s] focus on F good messages and let me let
[1337.1s] me let me say here I'm
[1340.6s] sorry we choose
[1343.5s] not to selectively give you f good
[1347.0s] messages
[1349.5s] we'll be very
[1351.2s] intentional to tell you what the lord
[1354.0s] requires of you in this
[1356.4s] age the Bible is today seen as on
[1361.2s] fashioned especially within the young
[1364.2s] people well the new age believes
[1369.2s] and looks at life from an individual
[1374.0s] perspective the Bible was meant to be
[1377.4s] the light on our
[1379.6s] path but today we are working on paths
[1383.7s] that are so dark because the Bible which
[1386.6s] ought to be our light is no longer on
[1389.2s] our
[1391.4s] paths the Bible has not only been
[1393.8s] rejected but actually has been attacked
[1396.9s] and
[1397.8s] persecuted across the history but
[1400.6s] especially in our contemporary Society
[1403.4s] now Jesus and world of course and said
[1405.1s] in John 15: number 18 if the world hates
[1408.6s] you keep in mind that it hat me first in
[1414.0s] many parts of the world Christians are
[1416.5s] persecuted for owning the Bible now I
[1419.9s] was listening to our preacher just the
[1422.6s] other day who was here and we in a
[1424.1s] moment with him and he told me you know
[1426.7s] Pastor he was in some place here in
[1428.8s] Middle East and was doing a week of
[1430.2s] prayer there and he told me you know
[1432.0s] what Pastor you are so lucky to have the
[1433.7s] church in this country that you can
[1435.8s] preach any time you want and call people
[1438.5s] as as many as they can there where I was
[1440.8s] preaching the nation has
[1444.5s] regulated you cannot baptize more than
[1447.3s] four
[1451.1s] people now by the way not too far from
[1453.2s] where we are I don't want to mention the
[1455.6s] name but you in that country no no and
[1458.7s] they say we have given you a big
[1461.1s] favor but listen you go do whatever you
[1464.0s] want to do preach where you want to
[1465.1s] preach but you cannot baptize how many
[1468.0s] people more than four people and in
[1471.2s] every Church there is a representative
[1474.3s] of the government B in every Church the
[1477.6s] mon everything that is happening in the
[1479.2s] churches and when an alter call is made
[1482.0s] and people come out they're watching to
[1484.0s] see they won stop people from coming but
[1486.5s] they want to see after they come how
[1489.2s] many people is the pastor going to
[1491.9s] register in the books of the church
[1494.0s] through baptism if you do more than four
[1496.4s] you're locked in but Bible is being
[1499.4s] persecuted today now I want to mention
[1502.5s] North Korea China and Iran if you go to
[1505.6s] these countries there is
[1507.5s] absolutely little freedom for the Bible
[1511.3s] anyone owning the Bible in this
[1513.0s] countries is the threat to the
[1516.5s] prosperity of the Nations Christian
[1518.8s] businesses and individuals are used used
[1521.9s] to you know long time ago the Bible was
[1524.1s] everywhere and and even today you know
[1526.5s] as I walk and travel uh and especially
[1529.4s] in the Christian countries you'll go to
[1532.0s] hotels and when you get to your room the
[1534.9s] first thing you see on the table is
[1537.6s] what but I've been asking myself by the
[1540.8s] way how many people who use those
[1545.2s] rules even touch that
[1549.5s] Bible the bibles are
[1552.0s] everywhere even in the Christian
[1554.4s] countries even in the Christian churches
[1557.3s] even in the Christian homes but people
[1559.8s] see the Bible say ah this is our book I
[1561.9s] know
[1563.6s] every and they will busy themselves on
[1566.0s] other things that they think they don't
[1567.6s] have this is the weapon the devil has
[1570.8s] used to weaken the church and we are
[1573.7s] saying in the year 2025 Central Church
[1577.3s] we want to grow through being rooted in
[1581.3s] Christ and for us be rooted the Christ
[1584.0s] we are calling the church back to the
[1586.9s] Bible and I want ask here this
[1590.4s] morning why as the book th was once so
[1596.0s] loved become so hated the book that was
[1599.8s] so important become so useless and
[1606.6s] rejected why is the Bible today being
[1614.0s] rejected I have a friend in Australia he
[1616.5s] was telling me
[1620.1s] you can't share
[1623.8s] faith I have relatives in you as who
[1626.3s] tell
[1627.2s] me in public places keep your
[1632.7s] faith don't tell us about your
[1637.0s] faith why has the Bible all of a sudden
[1639.8s] become so hated why do people fear the
[1643.4s] Bible what has the Bible
[1645.8s] done is it true that the B Bible has
[1648.7s] become outdated and is not relevant to
[1651.4s] this age is it true that the Bible is no
[1655.4s] longer impactful it's no longer
[1657.4s] transformative it's no longer changing
[1659.7s] lives what has the Bible done to the
[1663.0s] people of this
[1665.8s] world well when I was struggling to
[1669.3s] appreciate what is happening with our
[1671.2s] good book then somebody something came
[1673.2s] to my mind and I want to let you know
[1674.9s] that this morning Paul spoke about it in
[1678.3s] Hebrews CH 4 verse number
[1680.9s] 12 you may want to know this this
[1683.0s] morning why has the Bible become so HED
[1685.3s] all of a
[1686.2s] sudden why has the B become so
[1689.5s] rejected well Hebrews chapter 4 Paul
[1692.6s] gives a clue in verse number 12 Paul
[1695.7s] writes here and says for the word of God
[1700.2s] I wish it could be projected for the
[1702.6s] word of God is is somebody with me let's
[1707.0s] reading together for the word of God is
[1710.7s] quick and Powerful just stop there the
[1714.8s] word of God is what quick and Powerful
[1718.9s] no no no no no no no you see we are in
[1721.8s] an age where men and women have become
[1725.6s] so powerful and no power won't be
[1729.6s] challenged the Bible is a powerful
[1732.5s] Authority and the people in Authority do
[1735.5s] not want anything challenging their
[1737.6s] Authority the Bible says that the word
[1739.6s] of God say the word of God is what quick
[1742.8s] and Powerful the Bible says and sharper
[1747.2s] than any
[1748.8s] twoed sword now the Bible is actually is
[1753.6s] actually a weapon it is quicker it is
[1756.9s] sharper than any two sword now if this
[1761.5s] text was being written today we would be
[1764.9s] talking about two Angel sword because
[1767.4s] the two Ang
[1768.6s] was then one of the very serious
[1771.3s] sophisticated Weaponry now today we'll
[1774.3s] be talking about very serious you know
[1777.4s] weapons of mass destruction that are
[1780.5s] existing today no the Bible is a weapon
[1783.9s] of mass destruction anyone who interact
[1787.6s] with the Bible anyone who interacts with
[1790.5s] the Bible doesn't matter who you are the
[1793.2s] Bible will cast you and align you with
[1795.8s] God and because people do not want to
[1799.1s] change their ways they better keep the
[1801.5s] Bible away because the Bible is
[1804.6s] powerful Bible says for the word of God
[1807.7s] is quick and powerful and sharper than
[1810.5s] any two Ang sword piercing even to the
[1813.6s] dividing Ascender of Soul and Spirit you
[1819.2s] see
[1820.5s] friends in the end we living
[1823.2s] today these are the days Paul said
[1826.9s] perous times of come people shall never
[1832.6s] want to heed to any s Doctrine people's
[1836.5s] life will be so difficult their hearts
[1838.9s] their love will dry away we are living
[1841.9s] in an age where people become so much
[1845.2s] hearted in their heart and the only
[1847.3s] thing that can Pierce through that
[1850.2s] difficult heart is the sword of the
[1852.4s] spirit the word of God and because
[1854.4s] people do not want to change they better
[1857.6s] keep the Bible
[1859.5s] away why has the Bible become so hien
[1862.1s] today is because people do not want the
[1867.8s] biblical
[1869.3s] truth people want to
[1872.1s] embrace Lifestyles sinful Lifestyles
[1875.3s] they feel okay they feel good in their
[1878.1s] sins now first teachers the Bible said
[1880.8s] they shall come and they will preach
[1883.2s] that which entertains the mind that
[1886.4s] which entertains the soul that we should
[1888.6s] give the soul and elevation of This
[1891.0s] World by the Bible the word of God as a
[1894.1s] way of getting into the heart into the
[1896.4s] spirit and even into the marrow and
[1898.7s] break it down andern even the intent of
[1901.5s] the soul and align the heart of men the
[1905.0s] heart of God now the Bible says this one
[1907.3s] of God is powerful and is able to to to
[1910.1s] to to come into your life and do an
[1912.8s] operation of your heart and do a heart
[1914.9s] transplant and Remove Your Heart of
[1917.3s] Stone and bring to you and give you a
[1919.6s] heart of Flesh no people love the Heart
[1923.3s] of Stone more than the heart of Flesh
[1926.4s] are you somebody with me this morning
[1928.0s] now because of this the Bible must be
[1932.3s] rejected and
[1934.0s] slowly the Christian
[1936.2s] Church Without understanding how the
[1938.7s] game is being played we are all falling
[1941.5s] into the Trap of rejecting the Bible
[1944.8s] people today they are rejecting the
[1947.1s] Bible because they want to create their
[1949.7s] own version of
[1952.7s] Truth people are creating their own
[1956.0s] version of Truth Now Jesus said I am the
[1959.2s] truth the way and life now people don't
[1963.1s] want Jesus they want to create their own
[1966.0s] version of Truth doesn't matter what
[1968.8s] Jesus said it's about I want what I feel
[1972.0s] don't tell me about your religion don't
[1974.6s] tell me about your Jesus no don't tell
[1976.7s] me about your faith tell me what I want
[1980.4s] to hear people are creating their own
[1983.6s] version of the truth but the Bible
[1985.4s] reminds me there is no any other truth
[1989.0s] but the one in Jesus
[1991.0s] Christ many churches today AV preaching
[1994.8s] about Sin about repentance and Holiness
[1998.3s] messages focus on prosperity and self-
[2001.6s] Improvement this is what people are
[2003.6s] feeding on God's social media see almost
[2006.7s] every church today the messing there is
[2009.4s] just for Prosperity
[2011.1s] entertainment it's motivation and people
[2013.8s] feel okay because people are so stressed
[2017.1s] but even as you go you know you know you
[2019.9s] know today pull pit has become like a
[2025.1s] painkiller somebody is not with
[2029.8s] me you
[2032.6s] come you have been so stressed and
[2036.7s] oppressed your business is not
[2040.3s] working and preacher tells you it's
[2043.4s] because you forgot to plant a seed
[2046.5s] that's your problem plant what
[2051.0s] seed and today today even in the
[2054.3s] advented church I have seen members who
[2057.4s] come to church with their offering
[2060.0s] listen to me carefully with their
[2062.1s] offering as a Miss to tell God God see
[2065.2s] today I'm giving offering please
[2067.8s] remember me you give so that you can
[2071.3s] bless that is not the teaching the word
[2073.3s] of God you come to give because you have
[2077.2s] overflowing with Thanksgiving towards
[2080.3s] God who has been in your life you don't
[2082.8s] give so that God can give you but today
[2086.4s] the Christian church has been taught go
[2088.5s] and give so that God can bless you and
[2090.9s] if you are not blessed because you're
[2092.4s] not giving listen to me keep your money
[2095.2s] keep your money keep your money do not
[2098.1s] bring money to church that God can bless
[2100.4s] you God blesses you even when you do not
[2103.0s] know him keep your money keep your money
[2107.1s] but give only as a result of you
[2109.5s] overflowing the love of your God come
[2112.4s] and worship him we are tired of the
[2114.9s] messages on the pulpit that pushes
[2116.9s] people to give so that they can bless
[2119.1s] the Bible does not teach that God
[2121.4s] blessed us even before we knew
[2124.4s] him why as the Bible become all of a
[2127.2s] sudden so hden today is
[2132.8s] because the
[2134.7s] world is teaching
[2136.9s] today there is no absolute
[2139.8s] truth but the Bible says there is
[2143.2s] absolute truth Jesus is the truth Jesus
[2148.7s] is the truth Jesus is the truth anyone
[2152.8s] seeking for truth on any issue of
[2155.7s] religion and salvation it is is found in
[2159.0s] Jesus that is truth absolute now the
[2162.2s] word is telling us follow your heart
[2165.1s] that is the message in the world today
[2167.1s] but the Bible says no no do not follow
[2171.0s] your heart why because your heart the
[2174.2s] heart is a deceitful above how many
[2177.0s] things all things but what is happening
[2180.3s] today in the world we are being pushed
[2182.4s] to follow our hearts this is an advice
[2186.0s] of the evil one to destroy the Christian
[2188.2s] Church listen to me my church do not
[2190.8s] follow your heart follow Jesus
[2195.3s] Christ Jesus is found in his word said
[2200.5s] You shall know the truth and the truth
[2203.6s] so set you free and then it says I am a
[2207.4s] truth look out for Jesus the one today
[2211.1s] does not want the Bible because the B
[2213.1s] the one is telling us today all
[2215.2s] relationss lead to God
[2218.1s] all rels lead to God doesn't
[2224.6s] matter kyans you understand what I'm
[2226.4s] talking about now those of you in the
[2228.2s] internet not this country you don't
[2230.2s] understand what I'm talking about no let
[2231.4s] me break it for you you know the word is
[2233.0s] telling us never never about what church
[2236.4s] you go to a church is your
[2240.8s] heart and so they say all the legions
[2244.7s] are equal they all lead to God why are
[2248.4s] they pushing this narrative is because
[2250.8s] the Bible says no no not all religion
[2254.5s] that leads to God acts 4 verse number 12
[2257.9s] the Bible says nor is there salvation in
[2261.6s] any
[2262.9s] other there is no salvation in any other
[2267.0s] for there's no other name under Heaven
[2271.7s] that has been given among men by which
[2274.2s] they must be saved by the name of Jesus
[2278.8s] there is not salvation elsewhere
[2280.6s] salvation is in Jesus you can't tell me
[2284.2s] all Leg lead to God no there's no any
[2287.8s] other that give salvation but Jesus you
[2291.3s] take Jesus you accept him or you
[2293.7s] rejecting him I can tell you for sure
[2296.2s] the Bible means what it says there is no
[2299.1s] salvation in any other but in
[2303.7s] Jesus the world is rejecting the Bible
[2308.0s] because the Bible will Point people to
[2311.6s] Jesus and I am here today to speak to my
