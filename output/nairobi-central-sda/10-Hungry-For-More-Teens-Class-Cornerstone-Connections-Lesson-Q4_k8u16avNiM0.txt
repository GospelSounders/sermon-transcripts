so much for the mission reading that you're going to be reading help us to learn from it is my humble prayer through Jesus Christ amen so our mission reading for today is coming from the United States of America in a state called Alaska and the topic of our reading is mysterious light this reading is about uh a camp where they took a boy to hospital on the other side of the island then on coming back they had failures but then God showed them light so I'll proceed to read it on a summer night six people made an emergency trip to the hospital in Dillingham Alaska to reach the hospital from from Camp Polaris the sick child and five grown-ups had to travel by boat for 15 minutes and then by car for 30 minutes once the child was safe L at the hospital the five grown-ups returned to the boat on the lake it was about 2:00 in the morning the sky was Pitch Black and the water was calm it was difficult to see anything the boat had special navigation equipment that allowed it to sail in the dark but on this night one important piece of the equipment didn't work the SAA which measures the depth of the water was broken this was a serious problem because the L was shallow in some places and if the boat hit a sand or a rock it might get stuck or was even sink but none of the grown-ups wanted to stay on the lake show all night everyone everyone wanted to return to the camp and sleep in warm sleeping bugs okay let's go said one grownup who was acting as the boat's Captain he gunned the motor and it Rod to life with a prayer for safety the five grown set off for the camp the boat sped smoothly over the the open Waters at first it was easy sailing no Islands or other obstacles blocked the way but it was dark the boat Riders kept praying as they headed in the direction of the camp finally two islands appeared on the navigation SK uh screen the islands were located right in front of the shoreline with a camp the captain steer the bo the boat between the islands and slowed down the engine the engine seized its angry row and settled into a steady chugging sound the captain was worried I can't see anything he said I don't want to hit the dock what am I supposed to do then everyone was worried all the camp lights were out because everyone at the camp was asleep no one on the boat could see the camp in the dark someone had an idea saying move the boat forward slowly keeping the motor on low speed the captain slowly did that suddenly a bright light appeared in the middle of the camp the brilliant white light cast dazzling Rays over the camp the grown-ups on the boat could see the boys cabins they could see the girls cabins equally they could see the bathrooms and most important they could see the dock and the shoreline the captain guided the boat past the dock and onto the the show everyone jumped off the boat it felt good to have Solid Ground under their feet the grown-ups looked to see where the light was coming from they wanted to thank the person who had switched it on but the lights went off when the morning sun had risen they tried to find the person who had turned on the light the captain felt the captain felt certain that it must have been the camp director thank you for turning that light on he said we we never would have made it without it but the camp director said it wasn't him what light he said I didn't even know what that you were coming the director said no one at the camp had turned on the light the boat Riders believe that there is only one answer an angel showed up with a bright light on The Dark Night the light showed them where to go and interesting fact is that camp Polaris is located outside Dillingham in Alaska and is the only 7th Day Adventist summer camp that caters especially to Alaska native children part of a 13th Sabbath Sabbath offering in 2015 helped to improve the camp with new cabins and real toilets thank you so much for your contributions let's pray Mighty father who lives above we thank you so

entitled H hungry for more that is lesson 10 um you know we've been speaking about H um um King Nehemiah in the past um two or so Saturdays and equally even so slightly before that and we continue about that and today's lesson is interesting entitled hungry for more whereby we are trying we are trying to learn after nemiah LED people into prayers after he led people into prayers and all that and and and and equally after that last week's lesson was speaking about Nehemiah being the Visionary leader and who was also a doer then today we are trying to find out what is this that they are hungry for more after getting to find a day that they were you know they were trying to get a day to worship God and to be grateful so we want to learn this day what is it that they were grateful for but even as we proceed on and before we start the lesson at large I would want to request my panelist to do invite them uh to mention their names and greet us and starting from my farthest left hi everyone my name is Le hi my name is Winston hello my name is Christel fella hello everyone my name is Ashley serma yeah so I would want to request um my good good friend Ashley to pray with us so that we can start let's bow our heads for a prayer dear heavenly father we thank you so much for this wonderful day as we about to read this lesson I please ask that you may Inspire us that you may let the holy spirit guide us to understand what you have written in your holy word this I pray in Jesus mighty holy name amen amen amen yeah thank you for leading us through so maybe to start with with this day the question I would want to ask you guys have you gotten to a point whereby you really yearning for more you know like um like after the temple had been reconstructed the Israelites were still yearning for more so have you gotten to a point whereby you still yearning for more you know you you get to a point and you are like I think I've been blessed but I still wish to get more however as as as before I invite um my dear panelist to take us through how was your um what do you think section I would want to take us through to Pro Philippians 1:6 that says being confident of this that he who began a good work in you will carry it on to completion at the day of Christ Jesus so that means the same Lord that has led us and has begun the good work in each and every one of us is still eager to continue in the same moving forward but as we pause just take a pause and think about it let me invite um my dear panelist to take us do what do you think section and then we proceed on thank you hello so for the what do you think section this section will cover about the meaningful ways in which we respond to God's Mercy In Worship there are various ways in which you can show gratitude and uh one of them is through joyful celebration uh thoughtful reflection faithful obedience frequently retelling the story of redemption and excellence in worship praise and music I'd like to ask uh fuel for which way does she think is the best way of showing gratitude and commit commitment to God for his grace well I think the best way to show gratitude and commitment to God for his Graces is uh first of all when you receive God's blessings I think the best thing to do is you can celebrate it you joyfully celebrate what the Lord has done for you then after that you can start thinking of maybe God has done so much for me why don't I have a future in the church so a thoughtful reflection you start thinking about your life and how you want to come back to the ways of the Lord then Faithfully faithful obedience so after the thoughtful reflection you can uh as you come back to church the faithful obedience you have to obey his word then frequently retelling of the story of redemption uh after all everything that God has done for you you have to go out and tell the testimonies to everyone so that they can also be welcomed in church through your testimony then excellence in worship praise and music so after all of this you are now a member of the church and you have to worship and praise God uh using music and various ways thank you um I'd also like to ask uh Peter leis uh what's does he think the best way to show gratitude and commitment to God for his grace is okay okay according to me the best way I can show gratitude to God's and commitment to God's grace is through Faithfully obeying his Commandments yes thank you um just to add on that also my my thought on this um I feel like all of these points are very very essential cuz when you look at all of them joyful celebration thoughtful reflection faithful obedience uh frequent telling uh the story of redemption excellence in worship praise and music I feel like all of them are very like the things that we should actually do but I feel like you know the most important one or the best way to show gratitude and commitment for God for his grace I feel like um the the most important one is faithful obedience cu you know when we speak of obedience it means that we understand the fact that um God has done so much for us and obeying in his commands means that we respect the fact that he has done so much for us and it's kind of like um something that we return back to him yeah thank you all for your views and I also agree that the best way to show gratitude is through faithful obedience as Jesus had said before that if we love him we will keep his Commandments in order to better our lives and for those around us thank you wow what an elaborate what an elaborate uh discussion on how to show gratitude indeed I think um if there's something that we lack in this generation today is aspect of gratitude we find that we as young people we mostly sometimes just love comparing and contrasting and you forget that you're supposed to be grateful you find that most of the young people in schools be teenagers be the guys in campus just someone who just started work you know sometimes we never have some to be grateful you know and I think this day we are being challenged that we as Believers much more so that we should not be that generation that was written in the Bible The Ungrateful Generation The Generation that will be be lovers of self lovers of everything and money other than lovers of God I pray today that we can be grateful indeed in everything we've always learned that be anxious for nothing but in everything we must learn to give thanks for this is a perfect will of God so that is a challenge I'm challenging us even as you proceed on the lesson and you know as I was going through the lesson I realized that there was a certain illust ation an interesting one that the author of The Lesson takes us through I would want to request my sister um to take a f take us through the illustration so that we can get to learn maybe in a minute or two even as we proceed on with the rest of the lesson so the illustration that is being brought before us is about um the way uh we can have a big match in a stadium then thousands and thousands of people people flock the area so that they can um see the match then uh apparently in this situation they had to sing the national anthem and during the national anthem the the author rather saw that people's acquaintance just changed when the national anthem was being sung and so uh the the there was a man who was sitting next to him next to her and so when when she looked at the man she she noticed that the man was a bit different from the rest he somehow uh his posture changed he it's like he respected the national anthem then he turned to the man and he asked him uh uh what do you what do you feel when uh people when people are disrespecting the national anthem so the man started by introducing himself he said that he worked in a marine he was a marine police and uh so he he said that at first he felt angry but now all he does is just hope and pray that everyone will someday get a chance to feel the pride and respect that he has for his own country so from this we have that sometimes we hear people describe a significant experience as having a moment in this week's lesson the people of God stop and have a moment together learning crying shouting for joy and feasting in celebration of God's amazing love and care for his children wow wow so it actually shows you if if you guys got my point it actually or her Point as well it actually shows you that if the national anthem is sung if the flag for example maybe if you are in Kenya or in America if the flag is being raised you find that guys stop for the honor of the same and in the same honor that we give to the national anthem of whichever country that you're coming from or you tending from or if possibly you are participating in a national event you realize that there has to be an emblem there has to be a way that they have to show that how they honor their certain country and so we've been challenged today that we must also have give the same respect to whichever aspect or sphere of life that comes to be and equally so even to the things of God we are to have relevance we are to have honor we are to have respect and above all we ourselves ought to be people who carry ourselves in the best way whenever we are in the house of God and you know I think that that was a great illustration and actually by respect also we affirm the aspect of gratitude because if you respect the national anthem that it actually also shows that you are grateful you know you you appreciate your country similar case even our engagements every other day so I think there's a part on the Tuesday part um there's one of the connecting to life that actually takes us to the Tuesday part and I would want that is a Monday part I would want one of us to take us through the key text that is my brother Peter I think you can take us through nemiah 88 and then you guide us through the Monday part even as we will be going into the story that is a brief of what the lesson is all about so please take us to Nehemiah 88 and the Monday part thank you okay neem 8 8:8 and it says they read from the book of The Law of God making it clear giving the meaning so that the people understood what was being read now the Monday part May read it so that we can get the question how many times have you opened God's word and struggled to understand the meaning of the point of the passage some some some feel as if the Bible is a magic book that if you only open the page that then something should happen but more often more often than not bibl Bible study and your Devotion to God comes as a result of simple contest conver conversion and communication to connect with God in a more regular way so that the word of God and your overall experience is familiar instead of awkward so the question is like how many times have you opened the open God's word and struggle to understand the meaning or the point of the passage Ashley uh okay for that question there are some times when I would open a Bible and uh pick a specific passage to read it would be easy for me to understand as it may be a famous story like uh the story about David a story about Samson but there are also other times when I'd open and The Passage would leave me with um um many questions on what this means how it's important uh how how I'm able to apply it to my life and I've often uh gotten the advice that the Bible is its own interpretor where uh if you read another part of the Bible it will find you'll find that you'll get the answers to the question uh you're asking yourself and you're reading another passage from a certain part of the holy word yeah okay for me multiple times have I open but like sometimes I don't understand the the context of the Bible or like that certain topic I I can't understand it so like what I usually do is I pray to God for the spirit of understanding so that when I read the the word I can understand it so Mr Kevin how do you do about it I think um if I came across um if I go too well there's also a point that you mentioned that but more often than not Bible study and your Devotion to God come as a result of simple consistent conversation and communication and I think I came across a quote in the course of last week that says that the rarest of all human qualities is consistency so what do I mean by that you may pray to God in the morning and then the next time you'll pray is in the evening and you make it happy that every day you'll do so what about if you decided I'm going to pray to God on a Monday only when I'm eating food and possibly your best plate maybe it's some nice healthy snack or it's just any other regular meal or you decide then after you pray on Monday the next time you'll pray is only when you're having a meal so that means possibly and you pray maybe you know I once interacted with a friend who mentioned my friend we pray in the morning for all the prayers of the whole day so that means you pray for food you pray for Journey masses and everything in the morning and that is it for the whole day so the question I'm finding here for myself is so if that's the only prayer you pray you only pray once in the morning how many times do you need God's blessings is it only in the morning or through the day and and I think the answer is you need God's blessings cons consistently like every other time so that means if you only pray in the morning then there's trouble so there are those guys who only pray when they eating and they pray once and they don't pray every day maybe Monday maybe Saturday maybe Sunday so I think for me if I was to look through this question then many times I may not have understood a Bible verse but with looking back to it with a consistent you know praying about it with engaging with people by the way I read this verse what do you think about it then that makes the difference that makes the difference yeah so I think um if if if you're done then we can there's also another question that I want to leave with you my dear viewer take a moment to think about what you can do to connect with God in a more regular way so that the word of God and your overall experience is familiar instead of awkward you know most of us um we find ourselves connecting to God only when everything is working out you know and and I think you have got this well consistency is key so I think for me to do to you my viewer I want to challenge you to ask yourself in your every other day lives or whatever you do on a daily basis maybe you are working maybe you're in school do you find time to spend with God do you read a verse or two and above all do you even share that which you read I think that really stands out and and consistency truly is key showing up every morning there's there's a song they taught us while we were young and and maybe while some of us are still learning they usually say r b how did that song go like um my sister how did that song go like read your Bible pray every day pray every day pray every day read your Bible pray every day if you want to grow if you want to grow if you want to grow read your Bible pray every day if you want to grow so my dear brother my dear sister pause and think about that let's go into the story I would want my brother just in a minute or two just tell us what is the story all about you know we've been speaking about gratitude we spoken about consistency we spoken about sometimes understanding other times not understanding maybe you can give us in a nutshell maybe in three or four minutes what do you understand what do the story and where does it come from okay theend the end the story comes from the book of nemiah chapter 8 verse 2 to 15 and it's about Ezra Ezra the teacher of the law he brought the the word of God the the law the book of law to the people of Israel and the audience were were many the Israelites both women and men and Ezra to stood and T about the book and the the Israelites listened and the Levites Al the Levites they read from the book clearly G meaning so that the people understood what was being read and then when the people the Israelites had the about the law they were like they they were sorrowful they had sorrow in their heart for they did not know what what was in the book of the laws and they they thought that they had broken the law but Nar the governor said to to them that they should not they should not mourn for that the day of the Lord they should they should go and enjoy the they should go and enjoy theel through eating and drinking sweet drinks yeah yes I think that's a summary which verse uh Which chapter of the Bible does it come from uh the book of NE chapter 8:2 2 to 15 um um you said chapter 8: 2 2 to 15 as you try to digest that and even as you come to the end I would want to request my brother to take us through the flashlight and a little bit about H um Spirit of Prophecy it comes from chapter 56 um 57 of prophet and Kings chapter 56 is entitled instructed in the law of God in chapter 57 Reformation so maybe he can also just briefly tell us what um the spirit of Prophecy is guiding us on today's thought um thank you so much CH Kevin um beginning with the flashlight of today's story um just from prophets and Kings just as Ching said um we get the the chapter is chapter chapter 56 and 57 from the prophets and Kings so beginning with the flashlight it says that every true turning to the Lord brings abiding joy into the life when a sinner yields to the influence of the Holy Spirit he sees his own guilt and defilement in contrast with the Holiness of the great serer of Hearts it is GL it is God's glory to encircle sinful repentant human beings in the arms of his love to bind up their wounds to cleanse them from sin and to clothe them with the garments of Salvation so basically in the prophets and Kings what is being brought out in the story section it's it's just um nehemiah's efforts yeah to restore true worship of God and we see that his efforts actually um they were crowned success or more less he succeeded in it and basically what elen G white is trying to tell us in the prophets and Kings chapter 56 and 57 um he's basically just reminding us he she she reminds people of how much God Waits to restore and rejoice with the sinner who comes to God in faith she states it is God's glory to encircle sinful repentant human beings in the arms of his love to bind up their wounds to cleanse them from sin and to clothe them with the garments of Salvation yeah so I think that is has also touched on the Tuesday part because it's basically what elen is trying to tell us in the prophets and kings and I think maybe just to add on chapter 57 which is entitled formation um the very first paragraph which I read that is PK 669 .1 says solemnly and publicly the people of Judah had pledged themselves to obey the law of God but when the influence of Ezra and Nehemiah was for a Time withdrawn there were many who departed from the Lord Nehemiah had returned to Persia during the absence from Jerusalem evils crept in that threatened to pervert the nation idolators not only gained a foothold in the city but contain contaminated by the presence of the very prisons of the temple and equally say that through many other sources people just diverted their way so what does that teach you that King nemiah and Ezra and you see we we actually been speaking about Ezra and act Nah when just for a minute they were withdrawn or they left or their presence was not felt people started slowly creeping out of the way that had been shown to them so what does that tell me and you what does that inform you young person listening to us that at times if you don't keep to the principles and the precepts that we have been taught if you don't follow our guidelines if you don't keep ourselves consistent every other day like reading the word of God like following a certain content and for a minute we decide to stay off then slowly all the things that we had been working on start creeping back and that is what that shows you because two weeks ago we discussed about nemiah the praying Prophet last week we discussed about nemiah um him being a Visionary and a doer and him standing with God's word so today my challenge is to you my viewer are there things that after you relax on you reading your Bible praying to God and seeking him that slowly they started creeping back then you think to reconsider and get back to your consistent every other day daily pattern so I would want to as as you know that was a very nice illustration I would want to take it back to my brother Peter to just ask us a question just a random question from from the out of the story maybe a question just one of us a question that can that can rever with even as we are almost winding up and yeah like okay from out of the story the question I'll poses how how would you characterize the worshippers the worshippers gathered at the S sacred service the now the first part how would you characterize the worshippers gathered at the sacred service sorry okay um uh getting to that how would you characterize the worshippers gathered at this sacred service um I'd like to just reflect on the whole question in it um what is the attitude towards the word word of God how long are they engaged in worship okay so I'll take an example of uh us being in church I think that will work cuz for for example um we all come from different places to to to to come to church meaning that um everybody everybody who comes to church has a particular purpose of being there um um each individual uh personally would have that um that reason why he would like to know the word of God and I feel like the attitude towards the word of God um speaking of our our our our topic our lesson for today hungry for more I'd like to characterize this person to like be someone who is who having that Hunger for More cuz he or she is willing to like know more about God something like that yeah thank you very much I think in the interest of time um I think we can just take that one question then I quickly will take us to to the Friday Part which is asking as a question today as you summarize have you ever clapped out of Praise when no one else cled or said amen all by yourself I think for me yes I think I found myself sometimes walking just randomly I workpl you know where there's a certain engagement I had and sometimes just walk by just smiling and and being happy on your own that one is possible even when you've listened to a message and even when others feel ungrateful even in the presence of God and even a church think about how how God feels when we come to him in worship and how glad he is when we are there it is hard to imagine God finally getting out of our attention only to inform us of the correct posture and program that he prefers us to praise him with if this story gives us anything to think about it is a simple way God calls us to return to him and in a personal way which freely worship and show out gratitude so my challenge today is let's be grateful let's remain as we earn for more as you that's for more I think what was today's topic by the way hungry for more as we are hungry for more as you are looking forward to be best in whever let's always be grateful so to all our panelist maybe you can give us uh 30 second closing points you know what what stands out for you this lesson yeah so we can start from my sister Ashley um the closing points that I have gathered from today's lesson is that we should learn how to show gratitude towards God's mercy as he had sent uh as he as um in this story he brought the Hebrews back to Jerusalem after the Exile since he is a God who loves us so much who forgives our sins and has um inspired the leaders of Ezra and Nehemiah to show the people his law in order to bring them back to himself in order to restored the nation Israel to back it how it was so uh this uh story is very inspiring and I've learned various ways of how to show gratitude towards God I think thank you very much I think I request my sister to read Ecclesiastes 51 to2 which I think can be The Parting Shot which is in the lesson okay so uh Ecclesiastes 5 verse 1-2 it says guide your steps when you go to the house of God go near to listen rather than to offer the sacrifices of full who do not know what they do wrong do not be quick with your mouth do not be Hasty in your heart to utter anything before God God is in heaven and you are on earth so let your Words Be Few thank you do you have any other one minute parting shot yeah 10 seconds Parting Shot okay so from that book basically what we being told is you check yourself before you wreck your yourself basically as you come to church be humble walk in the presence of God instead of bluering of what you want God to do for you and what you can do for God there's actually nothing we can do to God but you should be humble and as you're in the presence of God humble yourself and be happy that you're in the presence of God do not you should come to church and listen to what God has to offer to you not uh come to offer the sacrifices of fools for example the people who are in Malachi who are offering sacrifices of blind sheep lame animals and God was not happy with that and he said that it's better that you'd actually close the doors to the temple other than giving me these sacrifices so the uh The Parting short is we should be humble as we walk into the Church of God and have receiving Hearts to receive the word of God yes um thank you uh I feel like for me my part short comes from the punch lines um the last one actually Acts 3: 19 it says repent then and turn to God so that your sins may be wiped out that times of refreshing may come from the Lord I feel like this verses really communicates a lot cuz even in the further insights we see that um from the time of Nehemiah as long as the people were true in the oath they had taken as they were obedient to God word so long as we followed What God tell us tells us to do um the Lord will fulfill his promises by pouring to us his Rich blessings yeah okay my parting shots are like we should always do the right things even if the leaders are not there unlike the Israelites who did the kept the law of the Lord when nemiah and Ezra were present but when as at the moment when when they left they they turned their way so we should always keep the love of the Lord even if no one is watching us yes thank you very much um for that I bet they've said every Parting Shot mine is when you view your world with an attitude of gratitude then you opening up to that which is positive in this world so and and also someone say that a glimpse you know when um a glimpse of gratitude opens up everything so let's be grateful so to close I would request us to Bon as we have a closing word of prayer we'll be using h amen

TIMESTAMPED TRANSCRIPT:

[44.2s] humble prayer through Jesus Christ amen
[47.9s] so our mission reading for today is
[50.0s] coming from the United States of America
[52.0s] in a state called Alaska and the topic
[54.8s] of our reading is mysterious light this
[57.6s] reading is about uh a camp where they
[62.2s] took a boy to hospital on the other side
[64.6s] of the island then on coming back they
[66.8s] had failures but then God showed them
[69.4s] light so I'll proceed to read it on a
[72.5s] summer night six people made an
[74.4s] emergency trip to the hospital in
[76.5s] Dillingham Alaska to reach the hospital
[79.5s] from from Camp Polaris the sick child

[87.7s] minutes once the child was safe L at the
[90.6s] hospital the five grown-ups returned to
[93.0s] the boat on the lake it was about 2:00
[95.8s] in the morning the sky was Pitch Black
[98.7s] and the water was calm it was difficult
[101.2s] to see anything the boat had special
[104.2s] navigation equipment that allowed it to

[109.2s] important piece of the equipment didn't
[111.2s] work the
[112.9s] SAA which measures the depth of the
[115.4s] water was broken this was a serious
[118.2s] problem because the L was shallow in
[120.9s] some places and if the boat hit a sand
[123.9s] or a rock it might get stuck or was even
[128.2s] sink but none of the grown-ups wanted to
[130.9s] stay on the lake show all night everyone
[133.9s] everyone wanted to return to the camp
[136.4s] and sleep in warm sleeping bugs okay
[139.6s] let's go said one grownup who was acting
[143.2s] as the boat's Captain he gunned the
[145.6s] motor and it Rod to life with a prayer
[148.3s] for safety the five grown set off for
[150.7s] the camp the boat sped smoothly over the
[154.2s] the open Waters at first it was easy
[157.6s] sailing no Islands or other obstacles
[160.3s] blocked the way but it was dark the boat
[164.0s] Riders kept praying as they headed in
[166.2s] the direction of the camp finally two
[169.0s] islands appeared on the navigation SK uh
[171.5s] screen the islands were located right in
[174.2s] front of the shoreline with a
[176.7s] camp the captain steer the bo the boat
[180.2s] between the islands and slowed down the
[182.9s] engine the engine seized its angry row
[186.0s] and settled into a steady chugging sound
[189.4s] the captain was worried I can't see
[191.9s] anything he said I don't want to hit the
[194.4s] dock what am I supposed to do then
[197.4s] everyone was worried all the camp lights
[199.8s] were out because everyone at the camp
[201.8s] was asleep no one on the boat could see
[204.4s] the camp in the
[205.8s] dark someone had an idea saying move the
[209.2s] boat forward slowly keeping the motor on
[212.1s] low speed the captain slowly did that
[215.2s] suddenly a bright light appeared in the
[217.3s] middle of the camp the brilliant white
[220.0s] light cast dazzling Rays over the camp
[223.6s] the grown-ups on the boat could see the
[225.8s] boys cabins they could see the girls
[228.0s] cabins
[229.5s] equally they could see the bathrooms and
[232.8s] most important they could see the dock
[235.1s] and the shoreline the captain guided the
[237.6s] boat past the dock and onto the the show
[240.8s] everyone jumped off the boat it felt
[243.5s] good to have Solid Ground under their
[245.6s] feet the grown-ups looked to see where
[248.5s] the light was coming from they wanted to
[250.9s] thank the person who had switched it on
[253.4s] but the lights went
[255.4s] off when the morning sun had risen they
[259.0s] tried to find the person who had turned
[260.7s] on the light the captain
[263.9s] felt the captain felt certain that it
[267.1s] must have been the camp director thank
[269.6s] you for turning that light on he said we
[272.5s] we never would have made it without it
[274.8s] but the camp director said it wasn't him
[277.2s] what light he
[280.2s] said I didn't even know what that you
[282.7s] were coming the director said no one at
[285.4s] the camp had turned on the light the
[287.0s] boat Riders believe that there is only
[290.0s] one answer an angel showed up with a
[293.8s] bright light on The Dark Night the light
[297.2s] showed them where to go and interesting
[300.4s] fact is that camp Polaris is located
[302.8s] outside Dillingham in Alaska and is the
[306.1s] only 7th Day Adventist summer camp that
[308.9s] caters especially to Alaska native
[311.7s] children part of a 13th Sabbath Sabbath
[314.9s] offering in 2015 helped to improve the
[318.3s] camp with new cabins and real toilets

[325.6s] we thank you so much for the mission

[604.7s] today's lesson which is entitled H
[607.1s] hungry for more that is lesson 10 um you
[610.4s] know we've been speaking about H um um
[615.6s] King Nehemiah in the past um two or so
[619.2s] Saturdays and equally even so slightly
[622.5s] before that and we continue about that
[624.6s] and today's lesson is interesting
[626.8s] entitled hungry for more whereby we are
[628.7s] trying we are trying to learn after
[631.0s] nemiah LED people into prayers after he
[633.8s] led people into prayers and all that and
[636.7s] and and and equally after that last
[639.0s] week's lesson was speaking about
[641.1s] Nehemiah being the Visionary leader and
[644.2s] who was also a doer then today we are
[646.3s] trying to find out what is this that
[648.1s] they are hungry for more after getting
[650.8s] to find a day that they were you know
[652.8s] they were trying to get a day to worship
[655.1s] God and to be grateful so we want to
[658.0s] learn this day what is it that they were
[660.6s] grateful for but even as we proceed on
[662.7s] and before we start the lesson at large
[665.3s] I would want to request my panelist to
[667.6s] do invite them uh to mention their names
[670.6s] and greet us and starting from my
[672.4s] farthest left hi everyone my name is Le
[677.0s] hi my name is
[678.4s] Winston hello my name is Christel fella
[682.8s] hello everyone my name is Ashley serma
[686.2s] yeah so I would want to
[687.7s] request um my good good friend Ashley to
[690.5s] pray with us so that we can
[692.6s] start let's bow our heads for a prayer
[696.1s] dear heavenly father we thank you so
[697.7s] much for this wonderful day as we about
[700.2s] to read this lesson I please ask that
[703.2s] you may Inspire us that you may let the
[706.1s] holy spirit guide us to understand what
[708.4s] you have written in your holy word this
[710.8s] I pray in Jesus mighty holy name
[713.8s] amen amen amen yeah thank you for
[716.8s] leading us through so maybe to start
[719.1s] with with this day the question I would
[721.7s] want to ask you guys have you gotten to
[725.5s] a point whereby you really yearning for
[728.7s] more you know like um like after the
[733.1s] temple had been
[734.4s] reconstructed the Israelites were still
[736.8s] yearning for more so have you gotten to
[739.4s] a point whereby you still yearning for
[741.6s] more you know you you get to a point and
[744.1s] you are like I think I've been blessed
[746.9s] but I still wish to get more however as
[750.2s] as as before I invite um my dear
[752.4s] panelist to take us through how was your
[754.5s] um what do you think section I would
[756.8s] want to take us through to Pro
[759.7s] Philippians 1:6 that says being
[762.4s] confident of this that he who began a
[764.5s] good work in you will carry it on to
[767.7s] completion at the day of Christ Jesus so
[770.6s] that means the same Lord that has led us
[774.3s] and has begun the good work in each and
[777.2s] every one of us is still eager to
[779.7s] continue in the same moving forward but
[782.2s] as we pause just take a pause and think
[784.5s] about it let me invite um my dear
[787.7s] panelist to take us do what do you think
[789.7s] section and then we proceed on thank
[794.3s] you hello so for the what do you think
[798.5s] section this section will cover about
[802.0s] the meaningful ways in which we respond
[805.7s] to God's Mercy In Worship there are
[808.7s] various ways in which you can show
[810.6s] gratitude and uh one of them is through
[816.3s] joyful
[817.6s] celebration uh thoughtful
[820.2s] reflection faithful
[822.5s] obedience frequently retelling the story
[825.6s] of redemption and excellence in worship
[829.8s] praise and
[831.3s] music I'd like to ask uh fuel for which
[837.2s] way does she think is the best way of
[840.5s] showing gratitude and commit commitment
[843.2s] to God for his grace well I think the
[847.2s] best way to show gratitude and
[849.0s] commitment to God for his Graces is uh
[852.7s] first of all when you receive God's
[854.1s] blessings I think the best thing to do
[856.0s] is you can celebrate it you joyfully
[858.4s] celebrate what the Lord has done for you
[860.5s] then after that you can start thinking
[862.2s] of maybe God has done so much for me why
[864.7s] don't I have a future in the church so a
[867.6s] thoughtful reflection you start thinking
[869.4s] about your life and how you want to come
[872.5s] back to the ways of the Lord then
[874.7s] Faithfully faithful obedience so after
[877.6s] the thoughtful reflection you can uh as
[880.4s] you come back to church the faithful
[882.4s] obedience you have to obey his word then
[885.4s] frequently retelling of the story of
[888.1s] redemption uh after all everything that
[890.6s] God has done for you you have to go out
[892.7s] and tell the testimonies to everyone so
[895.4s] that they can also be welcomed in church
[898.0s] through your testimony
[899.9s] then excellence in worship praise and
[902.3s] music so after all of this you are now a
[905.6s] member of the church and you have to
[907.2s] worship and praise God uh using music
[911.2s] and various
[912.3s] ways thank you um I'd also like to ask
[917.7s] uh Peter leis uh what's does he think
[921.9s] the best way to show gratitude and
[924.3s] commitment to God for his grace
[927.8s] is okay okay according to me the best
[931.4s] way I can show gratitude to God's and
[935.0s] commitment to God's grace is through
[938.3s] Faithfully obeying his Commandments
[942.4s] yes thank
[944.2s] you um just to add on that also my my
[948.5s] thought on this um I feel like all of
[951.9s] these points are very very essential cuz
[955.3s] when you look at all of them joyful
[956.9s] celebration thoughtful reflection
[959.3s] faithful obedience uh frequent telling
[963.1s] uh the story of redemption excellence in
[966.0s] worship praise and music I feel like all
[968.6s] of them are very like the things that we
[972.5s] should actually do but I feel like you
[974.9s] know the most important one or the best
[977.0s] way to show gratitude and commitment for
[980.2s] God for his grace I feel like um the the
[984.8s] most important one is faithful obedience
[988.1s] cu you know when we speak of obedience
[991.0s] it means that we understand the fact
[993.6s] that um God has done so much for us and
[997.7s] obeying in his commands means that we
[1000.3s] respect the fact that he has done so
[1001.9s] much for us and it's kind of
[1004.2s] like um something that we return back to
[1007.2s] him
[1008.7s] yeah thank you all for your views and I
[1012.4s] also agree that the best way to show
[1016.0s] gratitude is through faithful obedience
[1018.4s] as
[1019.4s] Jesus had said before that if we love
[1022.7s] him we will keep his Commandments in
[1025.7s] order to better our lives and for those
[1028.1s] around us thank
[1030.0s] you wow what an elaborate what an
[1033.1s] elaborate uh discussion on how to show
[1036.7s] gratitude indeed I think um if there's
[1039.7s] something that we lack in this
[1041.2s] generation today is aspect of gratitude
[1044.4s] we find that we as young people we
[1047.7s] mostly
[1049.6s] sometimes just love comparing and
[1051.5s] contrasting and you forget that you're
[1053.1s] supposed to be grateful you find that
[1055.7s] most of the young people in schools be
[1057.6s] teenagers be the guys in campus just
[1060.8s] someone who just started work you know
[1062.6s] sometimes we never have some to be
[1065.1s] grateful you know and I think this day
[1068.0s] we are being challenged that we as
[1070.3s] Believers much more so that we should
[1072.7s] not be that generation that was written
[1075.4s] in the Bible The Ungrateful Generation
[1077.6s] The Generation that will be be lovers of
[1079.5s] self lovers of everything and money
[1082.3s] other than lovers of God I pray today
[1085.6s] that we can be grateful
[1088.0s] indeed in everything we've always
[1091.5s] learned that be anxious for nothing but
[1095.0s] in everything we must learn to give
[1097.4s] thanks for this is a perfect will of God
[1100.0s] so that is a challenge I'm challenging
[1101.5s] us even as you proceed on the lesson and
[1104.5s] you know as I was going through the
[1106.1s] lesson I realized that there was a
[1108.0s] certain illust ation an interesting one
[1111.1s] that the author of The Lesson takes us
[1113.7s] through I would want to request my
[1117.2s] sister um to take a f take us through
[1120.4s] the illustration so that we can get to
[1122.4s] learn maybe in a minute or two even as
[1124.8s] we proceed on with the rest of the
[1126.9s] lesson so the illustration that is being
[1129.7s] brought before us is about um the way uh
[1134.5s] we can have a big match in a stadium
[1137.3s] then thousands and thousands of people
[1138.8s] people flock the area so that they can
[1141.5s] um see the match then uh apparently in
[1145.0s] this situation they had to sing the
[1146.9s] national anthem and during the national
[1149.8s] anthem the the author rather saw that
[1153.8s] people's acquaintance just changed when
[1156.6s] the national anthem was being sung and
[1159.2s] so uh the the there was a man who was
[1161.9s] sitting next to him next to her and
[1165.5s] so when when she looked at the man she
[1169.0s] she noticed that the man was a bit
[1170.7s] different from the rest he somehow uh
[1173.8s] his posture changed he it's like he
[1176.2s] respected the national anthem then he
[1178.4s] turned to the man and he asked him uh uh
[1181.7s] what do you what do you feel when uh
[1184.2s] people when people are disrespecting the
[1187.1s] national anthem so the man started by
[1189.5s] introducing himself he said that he
[1191.1s] worked in a marine he was a marine
[1194.6s] police and uh so he he said that at
[1197.5s] first he felt angry
[1199.4s] but now all he does is just hope and
[1201.8s] pray that everyone will someday get a
[1204.1s] chance to feel the pride and respect
[1206.8s] that he has for his own country so from
[1209.8s] this we have that sometimes we hear
[1211.4s] people describe a significant experience
[1213.6s] as having a moment in this week's lesson
[1216.9s] the people of God stop and have a moment
[1220.0s] together learning crying shouting for
[1223.4s] joy and feasting in celebration of God's
[1225.5s] amazing love and care for his children
[1230.0s] wow wow so it actually shows you if if
[1233.9s] you guys got my point it actually or her
[1237.6s] Point as well it actually shows you that
[1241.2s] if the national anthem is sung if the
[1244.8s] flag for example maybe if you are in
[1247.2s] Kenya or in America if the flag is being
[1249.7s] raised you find that guys stop for the
[1252.6s] honor of the same and in the same honor
[1255.7s] that we give to the national anthem of
[1257.8s] whichever country that you're coming
[1259.2s] from or you tending from or if possibly
[1262.8s] you are participating in a national
[1264.3s] event you realize that there has to be
[1266.5s] an emblem there has to be a way that
[1268.7s] they have to show that how they honor
[1271.2s] their certain country and so we've been
[1272.6s] challenged today that we must also have
[1275.1s] give the same respect to whichever
[1277.2s] aspect or sphere of life that comes to
[1279.2s] be and equally so even to the things of
[1282.0s] God we are to have relevance we are to
[1285.1s] have honor we are to have respect and
[1287.8s] above all we ourselves ought to be
[1290.2s] people who carry ourselves in the best
[1292.4s] way whenever we are in the house of God
[1295.1s] and you know I think that that was a
[1296.4s] great illustration and actually by
[1299.3s] respect also we affirm the aspect of
[1301.7s] gratitude because if you respect the
[1305.7s] national anthem that it actually also
[1307.4s] shows that you are grateful you know you
[1309.8s] you appreciate your country similar case
[1312.0s] even our engagements every other day so
[1315.3s] I think there's a part on the Tuesday
[1319.4s] part um there's one of the connecting to
[1322.6s] life that actually takes us to the
[1324.6s] Tuesday part and I would want that is a
[1326.7s] Monday part I would want one of us to
[1330.0s] take us through the key text that is my
[1332.7s] brother Peter I think you can take us
[1334.2s] through nemiah 88 and then you guide us
[1337.5s] through the Monday part even as we will
[1339.6s] be going into the story that is a brief
[1342.8s] of what the lesson is all about so
[1345.0s] please take us to Nehemiah 88 and the
[1347.7s] Monday part thank you okay neem 8 8:8
[1352.9s] and it says they read from the book of
[1355.7s] The Law of God making it clear giving
[1358.4s] the meaning so that the people
[1360.9s] understood what was being
[1364.3s] read now the Monday
[1376.3s] part May read it so that we can get the
[1379.8s] question how many times have you opened
[1382.5s] God's word and struggled to understand
[1384.5s] the meaning of the point of the passage
[1387.8s] some some some feel as if the Bible is a
[1391.3s] magic book that if you only open the
[1394.2s] page that then something should happen
[1396.9s] but more
[1398.4s] often more often than not
[1401.2s] bibl Bible study and your Devotion to
[1404.5s] God comes as a result of simple contest
[1408.8s] conver conversion and communication to
[1412.2s] connect with God in a more regular way
[1415.0s] so that the word of God and your overall
[1418.2s] experience is familiar instead of
[1423.2s] awkward so the question is
[1427.8s] like how many times have you opened
[1431.4s] the open God's word and struggle to
[1434.4s] understand the meaning or the point of
[1436.2s] the passage
[1441.4s] Ashley uh okay for that question there
[1445.9s] are some times when I would open a Bible
[1450.3s] and uh pick a specific passage to read
[1453.7s] it would be easy for me to understand as
[1456.5s] it may be a famous story like uh the
[1459.6s] story about David a story about Samson
[1463.1s] but there are also other times when I'd
[1464.9s] open and The Passage would leave me with
[1468.2s] um um many questions on what this means
[1472.2s] how it's important uh how how I'm able
[1475.8s] to apply it to my life and I've often uh
[1480.0s] gotten the advice that the Bible is its
[1483.6s] own interpretor where uh if you read
[1487.0s] another part of the Bible it will find
[1489.7s] you'll find that you'll get the answers
[1491.7s] to the question uh you're asking
[1494.1s] yourself and you're reading another
[1496.1s] passage from a certain part of the holy
[1499.2s] word yeah okay for me multiple times
[1504.1s] have I open but like sometimes I don't
[1507.2s] understand
[1508.2s] the the context of the Bible or like
[1512.6s] that certain topic I I can't understand
[1514.9s] it so like what I usually do is I pray
[1517.8s] to God for the spirit of understanding
[1520.5s] so that when I read the the word I can
[1525.0s] understand it so Mr Kevin how do you do
[1528.7s] about
[1529.7s] it I think um if I came across um if I
[1533.5s] go too well there's also a point that
[1535.1s] you mentioned that but more often than
[1537.2s] not Bible study and your Devotion to God
[1540.4s] come as a result of simple consistent
[1544.2s] conversation and communication and I
[1547.7s] think I came across a quote in the
[1550.1s] course of last week that says that the
[1552.4s] rarest of all human qualities is
[1555.7s] consistency so what do I mean by that
[1558.6s] you may pray to God in the
[1561.6s] morning and then the next time you'll
[1564.4s] pray is in the evening and you make it
[1567.2s] happy that every day you'll do so what
[1570.0s] about if you decided I'm going to pray
[1572.3s] to God on a Monday only when I'm eating
[1575.5s] food and possibly your best plate maybe
[1578.3s] it's some nice healthy snack or it's
[1580.6s] just any other regular meal or you
[1583.1s] decide then after you pray on Monday the
[1585.4s] next time you'll pray is only when
[1586.6s] you're having a meal so that means
[1588.5s] possibly and you pray maybe you know I
[1590.4s] once interacted with a friend who
[1591.8s] mentioned my friend we pray in the
[1593.8s] morning for all the prayers of the whole
[1595.4s] day so that means you pray for food you
[1597.5s] pray for Journey masses and everything
[1599.1s] in the morning and that is it for the
[1600.4s] whole day so the question I'm finding
[1604.2s] here for myself is so if that's the only
[1606.6s] prayer you pray you only pray once in
[1608.7s] the morning how many times do you need
[1611.0s] God's
[1612.2s] blessings is it only in the morning or
[1615.0s] through the day and and I think the
[1616.7s] answer is you need God's blessings cons
[1620.8s] consistently like every other time so
[1623.3s] that means if you only pray in the
[1624.6s] morning then there's trouble so there
[1626.7s] are those guys who only pray when they
[1628.3s] eating and they pray once and they don't
[1630.3s] pray every day maybe Monday maybe
[1632.4s] Saturday maybe Sunday so I think for me
[1634.3s] if I was to look through this question
[1636.5s] then many times I may not have
[1638.4s] understood a Bible verse but with
[1641.2s] looking back to it with a consistent you
[1644.6s] know praying about it with engaging with
[1647.7s] people by the way I read this verse what
[1650.0s] do you think about it then that makes
[1652.6s] the difference that makes the
[1656.1s] difference yeah so I think um if if if
[1659.1s] you're done then we can there's also
[1660.6s] another question that I want to leave
[1662.6s] with you my dear viewer take a moment to
[1664.9s] think about what you can do to connect
[1666.8s] with God in a more regular way so that
[1669.0s] the word of God and your overall
[1671.2s] experience is familiar instead of
[1674.4s] awkward you know most of us um we find
[1678.8s] ourselves connecting to God only when
[1683.0s] everything is working out you know and
[1685.9s] and I think you have got this well
[1687.8s] consistency is key so I think for me to
[1690.2s] do to you my viewer I want to challenge
[1692.3s] you to ask yourself in your every other
[1695.2s] day lives or whatever you do on a daily
[1697.9s] basis maybe you are working maybe you're
[1699.5s] in school do you find time to spend with
[1702.0s] God do you read a verse or two and above
[1705.1s] all do you even share that which you
[1706.5s] read I think that really stands out and
[1709.4s] and consistency truly is key showing up
[1713.1s] every morning there's there's a song
[1715.6s] they taught us while we were young and
[1717.4s] and maybe while some of us are still
[1718.8s] learning they usually say r b how did
[1721.9s] that song go like um my sister how did
[1724.2s] that song go like read your Bible pray
[1728.8s] every day pray every day pray every day
[1734.6s] read your Bible pray every day if you
[1739.0s] want to
[1742.0s] grow if you want to
[1746.4s] grow if you want to
[1751.4s] grow read your Bible pray every day if
[1757.2s] you want to
[1760.8s] grow so my dear brother my dear sister
[1764.3s] pause and think about that let's go into
[1767.0s] the story I would want my brother just
[1769.0s] in a minute or two just tell us what is
[1770.7s] the story all about you know we've been
[1772.1s] speaking about gratitude we spoken about
[1774.4s] consistency we spoken about sometimes
[1777.2s] understanding other times not
[1778.4s] understanding maybe you can give us in a
[1780.1s] nutshell maybe in three or four minutes
[1782.4s] what do you understand what do the story
[1784.0s] and where does it come from okay theend
[1787.7s] the end the story comes from the book of
[1789.6s] nemiah chapter 8 verse 2 to
[1793.3s] 15 and it's about Ezra Ezra the teacher
[1797.6s] of the law
[1799.0s] he brought the the word of God the the
[1802.1s] law the book of law to the people of
[1804.7s] Israel and the audience were were many
[1808.5s] the Israelites both women and men and
[1812.4s] Ezra to stood and T about the
[1816.2s] book and the the Israelites
[1820.4s] listened and the
[1823.2s] Levites Al the Levites they read from
[1826.7s] the book clearly G meaning so that the
[1829.2s] people understood what was being
[1831.9s] read and then when the people the
[1836.0s] Israelites had the about the law they
[1840.2s] were like they they were sorrowful they
[1843.0s] had sorrow in their heart for they did
[1845.6s] not know what what was in the book of
[1847.9s] the laws and they they thought that they
[1850.4s] had broken the law but Nar the
[1855.1s] governor said to to them that they
[1858.4s] should
[1859.2s] not they should not mourn for that the
[1863.2s] day of the Lord they should they should
[1865.7s] go and enjoy
[1868.6s] the they should go and enjoy theel
[1871.7s] through eating and drinking sweet
[1875.4s] drinks
[1877.0s] yeah yes I think that's a
[1881.3s] summary which verse uh Which chapter of
[1883.6s] the Bible does it come from uh the book
[1885.8s] of NE chapter 8:2 2 to 15 um um you said
[1890.9s] chapter 8: 2 2 to 15 as you try to
[1894.6s] digest that and even as you come to the
[1896.4s] end I would want to request my brother
[1898.4s] to take us through the flashlight and a
[1900.3s] little bit about H um Spirit of Prophecy
[1904.3s] it comes from chapter 56 um 57 of
[1907.3s] prophet and Kings chapter 56 is entitled
[1910.4s] instructed in the law of God in chapter
[1912.6s] 57 Reformation so maybe he can also just
[1915.9s] briefly tell us what um the spirit of
[1919.0s] Prophecy is guiding us on today's
[1921.5s] thought um thank you so much CH Kevin um
[1925.0s] beginning with the flashlight of today's
[1927.8s] story um just from prophets and Kings
[1930.7s] just as Ching said um we get the the
[1935.1s] chapter is chapter chapter 56 and 57
[1938.7s] from the prophets and Kings so beginning
[1941.1s] with the flashlight it says that every
[1943.8s] true turning to the Lord brings abiding
[1946.9s] joy into the life when a sinner yields
[1949.4s] to the influence of the Holy Spirit he
[1952.3s] sees his own guilt and defilement in
[1955.0s] contrast with the Holiness of the great
[1957.5s] serer of Hearts it is GL it is God's
[1960.5s] glory to encircle sinful repentant human
[1963.8s] beings in the arms of his love to bind
[1966.4s] up their wounds to cleanse them from sin
[1969.2s] and to clothe them with the garments of
[1971.4s] Salvation so basically in the prophets
[1974.0s] and Kings what is being brought out in
[1976.2s] the story section it's it's just um
[1979.2s] nehemiah's efforts yeah to restore true
[1983.6s] worship of God and we see that his
[1986.2s] efforts actually um they were crowned
[1989.3s] success or more less he succeeded in it
[1992.4s] and basically what elen G white is
[1994.7s] trying to tell us in the prophets and
[1997.6s] Kings chapter 56 and 57 um he's
[2001.6s] basically just reminding us he she she
[2005.3s] reminds people of how much God Waits to
[2007.9s] restore and rejoice with the sinner who
[2010.5s] comes to God in faith she states it is
[2013.6s] God's glory to encircle sinful repentant
[2016.4s] human beings in the arms of his love to
[2018.7s] bind up their wounds to cleanse them
[2020.5s] from sin and to clothe them with the
[2022.4s] garments of Salvation yeah so I think
[2025.0s] that is has also touched on the Tuesday
[2027.4s] part because it's basically what elen is
[2030.1s] trying to tell us in the prophets and
[2032.4s] kings and I think maybe just to add on
[2035.8s] chapter 57 which is entitled formation
[2039.5s] um the very first paragraph which I read
[2041.9s] that is PK 669 .1 says solemnly and
[2047.8s] publicly the people of Judah had pledged
[2051.0s] themselves to obey the law of God but
[2053.4s] when the influence of Ezra and
[2056.5s] Nehemiah was for a Time withdrawn there
[2059.8s] were many who departed from the Lord
[2062.4s] Nehemiah had returned to Persia during
[2065.2s] the absence from Jerusalem evils crept
[2067.5s] in
[2068.2s] that threatened to pervert the nation
[2071.2s] idolators not only gained a foothold in
[2075.0s] the city but contain contaminated by the
[2078.1s] presence of the very prisons of the
[2080.5s] temple and equally say that through many
[2084.4s] other sources people just diverted their
[2087.2s] way so what does that teach you that
[2089.5s] King nemiah and Ezra and you see we we
[2093.2s] actually been speaking about Ezra and
[2094.8s] act Nah when just for a minute
[2098.3s] they were withdrawn or they left or
[2100.3s] their presence was not felt people
[2102.2s] started slowly creeping out of the way
[2105.0s] that had been shown to them so what does
[2106.8s] that tell me and you what does that
[2109.2s] inform you young person listening to us
[2111.9s] that at times if you don't keep to the
[2114.8s] principles and the precepts that we have
[2116.7s] been taught if you don't follow our
[2119.2s] guidelines if you don't keep ourselves
[2121.3s] consistent every other day like reading
[2124.6s] the word of God like following a certain
[2127.3s] content and for a minute we decide to
[2129.8s] stay off then
[2132.6s] slowly all the things that we had been
[2135.0s] working on start creeping back and that
[2137.6s] is what that shows you because two weeks
[2139.8s] ago we discussed about nemiah the
[2141.4s] praying Prophet last week we discussed
[2143.6s] about nemiah um him being a Visionary
[2146.7s] and a doer and him standing with God's
[2150.7s] word so today my challenge is to you my
[2154.3s] viewer are there things that after you
[2157.3s] relax on you reading your Bible praying
[2160.2s] to God and seeking him that slowly they
[2163.7s] started creeping back then you think to
[2165.7s] reconsider and get back to your
[2168.0s] consistent every other day daily pattern
[2171.2s] so I would want to as as you know that
[2173.4s] was a very nice illustration I would
[2175.2s] want to take it back to my brother Peter
[2177.8s] to just ask us a question just a random
[2180.2s] question from from the out of the story
[2182.5s] maybe a question just one of us a
[2184.9s] question that can that can rever with
[2187.8s] even as we are almost winding up and
[2193.0s] yeah like okay from out of the story the
[2197.5s] question I'll poses how how would you
[2201.3s] characterize the
[2202.8s] worshippers the worshippers gathered at
[2205.8s] the S sacred
[2208.8s] service the now the first part how would
[2211.4s] you characterize the worshippers
[2212.9s] gathered at the sacred service
[2218.4s] sorry okay
[2220.7s] um uh getting to that how would you
[2223.8s] characterize the worshippers gathered at
[2226.4s] this sacred service um I'd like to just
[2229.6s] reflect on the whole question in it um
[2232.8s] what is the attitude towards the word
[2235.0s] word of God how long are they engaged in
[2237.9s] worship okay so I'll take an example of
[2242.4s] uh us being in church I think that will
[2246.0s] work cuz for for example um we all come
[2250.4s] from different places to to to to come
[2252.7s] to church meaning that um everybody
[2255.8s] everybody who comes to church has a
[2258.4s] particular purpose of being there um um
[2262.1s] each individual uh personally would have
[2265.2s] that um that reason why he would like to
[2268.5s] know the word of God and I feel like the
[2271.4s] attitude towards the word of God um
[2275.1s] speaking of our our our our topic our
[2278.4s] lesson for today hungry for more I'd
[2281.0s] like to characterize this person to like
[2283.2s] be someone who is who having that Hunger
[2285.7s] for More cuz he or she is willing to
[2288.5s] like know more about God something like
[2291.1s] that
[2292.4s] yeah thank you very much I think in the
[2294.7s] interest of time um I think we can just
[2296.9s] take that one question then I quickly
[2299.4s] will take us to to the Friday Part which
[2302.2s] is asking as a question today as you
[2304.2s] summarize have you ever clapped out of
[2306.4s] Praise when no one else cled or said
[2308.3s] amen all by yourself I think for me yes
[2312.1s] I think I found myself sometimes walking
[2314.1s] just randomly I workpl you know where
[2317.8s] there's a certain engagement I had and
[2319.9s] sometimes just walk by just smiling and
[2322.9s] and being happy on your own that one is
[2324.5s] possible even when you've listened to a
[2327.6s] message and even when others feel
[2329.3s] ungrateful even in the presence of God
[2331.8s] and even a church think about how how
[2334.0s] God feels when we come to him in worship
[2336.4s] and how glad he is when we are there it
[2339.2s] is hard to imagine God finally getting
[2341.1s] out of our attention only to inform us
[2343.2s] of the correct posture and program that
[2346.0s] he prefers us to praise him with if this
[2348.2s] story gives us anything to think about
[2350.0s] it is a simple way God calls us to
[2352.5s] return to him and in a personal way
[2355.3s] which freely worship and show out
[2357.6s] gratitude so my challenge today is let's
[2360.2s] be grateful let's remain as we earn for
[2363.9s] more as you that's for more I think what
[2366.6s] was today's topic by the way hungry for
[2369.0s] more as we are hungry for more as you
[2370.8s] are looking forward to be best in whever
[2373.7s] let's always be grateful so to all our
[2375.5s] panelist maybe you can give us uh 30
[2377.9s] second closing points you know what what
[2380.5s] stands out for you this lesson yeah so
[2382.8s] we can start from my sister
[2386.4s] Ashley um the closing points that I have
[2389.3s] gathered from today's lesson is that we
[2392.3s] should learn how to show gratitude
[2395.7s] towards God's mercy as he had sent uh as
[2401.0s] he as um in this story he brought the
[2406.1s] Hebrews back to Jerusalem after the
[2408.8s] Exile since he is a God who loves us so
[2413.2s] much who forgives our sins and has um
[2417.2s] inspired the leaders of Ezra and
[2419.6s] Nehemiah to show the people his law in
[2424.0s] order to bring them back to himself in
[2426.4s] order to restored the nation Israel to
[2429.8s] back it how it was so uh this uh story
[2434.2s] is very inspiring and I've learned
[2437.3s] various ways of how to show gratitude
[2439.2s] towards God I think thank you very much
[2442.1s] I think I request my sister to read
[2444.0s] Ecclesiastes 51 to2 which I think can be
[2447.5s] The Parting Shot which is in the
[2450.0s] lesson okay so uh
[2453.0s] Ecclesiastes 5 verse
[2455.7s] 1-2 it says guide your steps when you go
[2459.0s] to the house of God go near to listen
[2461.8s] rather than to offer the sacrifices of
[2464.0s] full who do not know what they do wrong
[2466.9s] do not be quick with your mouth do not
[2468.8s] be Hasty in your heart to utter anything
[2471.0s] before God God is in heaven and you are
[2473.7s] on earth so let your Words Be Few thank
[2476.6s] you do you have any other one minute
[2478.7s] parting shot yeah 10 seconds Parting
[2481.0s] Shot okay so from that book basically
[2484.1s] what we being told is you check yourself
[2486.4s] before you wreck your yourself basically
[2488.8s] as you come to church be humble walk in
[2491.4s] the presence of God instead of bluering
[2493.9s] of what you want God to do for you and
[2496.2s] what you can do for God there's actually
[2497.9s] nothing we can do to God but you should
[2500.2s] be humble and as you're in the presence
[2501.7s] of God humble yourself and be happy that
[2505.0s] you're in the presence of God do not you
[2507.0s] should come to church and listen to what
[2508.9s] God has to offer to you not uh come to
[2512.7s] offer the sacrifices of fools for
[2515.0s] example the people who are in Malachi
[2517.5s] who are offering sacrifices of blind
[2520.2s] sheep lame animals and God was not happy
[2522.8s] with that and he said that it's better
[2525.2s] that you'd actually close the doors to
[2527.6s] the temple other than giving me these
[2530.6s] sacrifices so the uh The Parting short
[2534.3s] is we should be humble as we walk into
[2536.2s] the Church of God and have receiving
[2539.5s] Hearts to receive the word of
[2542.3s] God yes um thank you uh I feel like for
[2546.4s] me my part short comes from the punch
[2548.7s] lines um the last one actually Acts 3:
[2552.0s] 19 it says repent then and turn to God
[2556.4s] so that your sins may be wiped out that
[2558.8s] times of refreshing may come from the
[2561.3s] Lord I feel like this verses really
[2564.6s] communicates a lot cuz even in the
[2566.3s] further insights we see that um from the
[2569.4s] time of Nehemiah as long as the people
[2572.0s] were true in the oath they had taken as
[2574.8s] they were obedient to God word so long
[2578.2s] as we followed What God tell us tells us
[2581.8s] to do um the Lord will fulfill his
[2585.2s] promises by pouring to us his Rich
[2587.8s] blessings
[2589.5s] yeah okay my parting shots are like we
[2592.8s] should always do the right things even
[2594.7s] if the leaders are not there unlike the
[2597.4s] Israelites who did the kept the law of
[2600.8s] the Lord when nemiah and Ezra were
[2604.0s] present but when as at the moment when
[2607.1s] when they left they they turned their
[2609.6s] way so we should always keep the love of
[2612.0s] the Lord even if no one is watching us
[2615.0s] yes thank you very much um for that I
[2618.6s] bet they've said every Parting Shot mine
[2621.8s] is when you view your world with an
[2623.9s] attitude of gratitude then you opening
[2625.9s] up to that which is positive in this
[2629.6s] world so and and also someone say that a
[2632.4s] glimpse you know when um a glimpse of
[2636.0s] gratitude opens up everything so let's
[2639.4s] be grateful so to close I would request
[2642.5s] us to Bon as we have a closing word of
[2647.2s] prayer we'll be using
[2691.5s] h
[2709.0s] amen
