FULL TRANSCRIPT:
hello and good evening welcome to today's prayer session prayer service for the midweek my name is Paul anduru and I'd like us to pray so that we can begin let us pray our kind and loving master in heaven we come before you this evening we thank you so much for allowing us to be alive this day it is because you want us to learn something from you and we ask that you may lead us even as we share something small we ask that you may take charge of our minds of our hearts of our thoughts help us to think about the words that will come from this Pulpit we ask that you may lead my thoughts that you may guide my uh words that all may be according to your will I thank you for always listening to my prayer I ask that you may forgive any sin that may hinder our prayers from getting to you I pray all this in Jesus name amen welcome all to today's session uh welcome for those of us who are inside the church and also those of us who are watching online those who are in their homes in their offices kibon so today's uh topic is the Heavenly merchantman so a merchantman is simply a salesperson in uh current English words yeah yeah so to begin I want to take us through some misconceptions that we have as Christians in our world today so many of us have fallen into a pattern of viewing righteousness as a destination to be reached through our own efforts striving and constant trying then we often find ourselves checking our progress It's like we have some marking scheme that we check our progress on how am I doing in my victory over sin what's my spiritual progress today those are some of the questions that probably most of us if not many of us if not some of us ask while there are several quotes in the spirit of Prophecy that might Mis that might be misunderstood as supporting this notion there's a deeper truth that I want us to share today so we'll go through the scriptures and the spirit of Prophecy just to get light on the same so uh our key text comes from The Book of Matthew Chapter 13 Verse 45 and 46 Matthew 13:45 and 46 this is a parable that Jesus was giving to those who are around him at that particular time and it is the parable of the par of great priz 45 says again the Kingdom of Heaven is like unto a merchant man seeking goodly PS I'll repeat again the Kingdom of Heaven is like a merchant man seeking Godly par 46 who when he had found one pal of great price went and sold all he had bought yes so the spirit of Prophecy provides two complimenting definitions of this P of great priz which I want to share with us first is Christ himself is the P then the second one is the righteousness of Christ is as pure white PE with no defect and no stain all this come from Christ object lessons page 1 15 that is chapter 9 of the book the parable about the pal so these definitions aren't conflicting in any way because uh another quote from the thoughts of Mount blessings speaks on the same that is thoughts of the from the Mount of blessings page 18 explains that the righteousness of God is embodied in Christ we receive righteousness by receiving him so the righteousness of God is embodied in Christ we receive righteousness by receiving him this aligns with first selected messages page P 399 paragraph 1 that says the righteousness of Christ as pure white PE has no defect no stain no guilt this righteousness may be ours salvation with its blood B in estimate inestimable Treasures is the P of great prize so in essence it doesn't matter whether you call the pal righteousness of Christ or whether you call the pal Christ or whether you even refer to the pal as salvation because it is all found in one person which is Jesus Christ the Divine Merchant man got it and he bought the P that is from uh Matthew 13:46 yes so this is not righteousness is not something that we have provoked or that we attain to by our own efforts or by doing any work it is a Divine transaction I'd like us to turn to Revelation 3:18 Revelation 3:8 to 20 will be our Focus but we'll start reading from verse 14 this is the message that uh Christ gives to the Church of the laudations which I believe is the church in the last days which we are part of and unto the angel of the laudation WR this things sayith the amen the faithful and true witness the beginning of the creation of God I Know Thy works that thou art neither cold nor hot I would that I would thou what cold or hot so then because Thou Art lukewarm and neither cold or hot I will speak thee out of my mouth because thou sayest I am rich and increased with goods and have and have need of nothing and knowest not that thou art wretched and miserable and poor and blind and naked our Focus Verse 18 I Cel thee to buy of me gold tried in fire that thou mayest be rich and white rment that thou mayest be clothed and that the shame of thy nakedness do not do not appear and anoint thine eyes eyes with thyself that thou mayest see as many as I have as I love I rebuke and chesten be zealous therefore and repent 20 behold I stand at the door and knock If any man hear my voice and open the door I will come into him and will saap with him and he with me yes stop at that so from uh specifically verse uh 18 we find a statement um which says I canel Thee to buy of me tried gold in fire that thou mayest be rich and white rayment focus is white rment so what is the white rment um there's a quote from uh LG White writing from Christ object lesson page 113 um and also um uh CH volume five of the testimonies to the church page 233 which tells us that the the white rment is the righteousness of Christ yeah and Christ tells us to buy of him the righteousness it does not tell us to work for it tells us to buy a question may come but how do we buy this righteousness so the true witness which is Jesus Christ says this that we are to buy from him and Isaiah 55 vers uh one gives us something which I want us to read after I've read some quotes from U uh some of the quotations I got from the spirit of Prophecy so the the spirit of Prophecy uses specific specific terminology to describe this transaction the transaction of buying this white rment from Christ which is his righteousness from first selected messages page 381 he says we can do this that is buying only as we grasp yeah Living Faith enables the possessor to lay hold that is from 364 page 364 of the same book first selected messages another one from uh Christ object lessons page 114 Faith lays hold upon the upon the virtue of Christ then also page 96 of Christ object lesson says through faith in Christ The Sinner may claim first selected messages 367 says by faith he can bring to God the merits of Christ so the righteousness of Christ embodied in Christ is as pure white pearl but the key thought in Matthew 13:45 and 46 is how the merchant man obtains the P what did he do he sold all that he had and bought it this is what Jesus himself taught but it doesn't seem to be in harmony with other teachings in the Bible that is buying the P that is the righteousness sound so worldly and materialistic because most of the time we find that in the Bible uh Salvation is depicted as a free gift yes but uh I believe these two Notions are not at opposing ends but uh there's a way that this works so how can such a teaching fit into the rest of the Bible the teaching of buying righteousness so Isaiah 55 which I had mentioned verse one Isaiah 51:1 says Ho everyone that thirsted Come Ye to the waters and he that hath no money Come Ye buy itat yeah come buy wine and milk without money and without price so it gives some paradox right yes buy without money and without a price how can we buy something without money it doesn't make sense to today's world the answer lies in Understanding God's economy how can you buy without money I'll explain the same way much of the world conducts it its business in the olden days where there was butter trade system I believe most of us are familiar if not all of us so you simply trade what you have for that which you need and you do not have for example in the village I remember mommy would take some Maze and give it to somebody else and she would get beans and maybe sometimes give it to somebody else and get some eggs or some chicken so there was no man involved so that means even the poor are able to trade what they have for what they do not have so long as you can you have something it doesn't need to be money but something that you can exchange maybe even your skills for food so what do we trade in in order to buy righteousness from Christ in the parable of the pal sorry in the parable the pal is not represented as a gift the merchant man bought it at a price of all that he had that is Matthew chter 13 verse 45 and 46 many question the meaning of this since Christ is represented as a gift in the scriptures that is what I had alluded to earlier Christ object lessons page 116 explains he is a gift but only to to those who give themselves soul body and spirit to him without Reserve that means Christ is a gift to those who empty themselves to him not withholding any anything so Jesus in Revelation 3:2 says or represents himself as a sales person coming to knock at our doors and he's knocking at the door of your heart even today he is the great vendor a Heavenly Merchant man he is selling and what is he selling he is selling his righteousness the white reignment he urges that we transact our business with him in the book Desire of Ages page 347 uh the servant of the Lord says saving faith is a transaction by which those who receive Christ join themsel in Covenant relation with God so a question may come uh what if I do not value Pals what if there's not that desire to be able to buy this righteousness of of of of God am I lost eternally that is not the case because there uh the Holy Spirit has a role in this the Holy Spirit according to John 16:8 11 when Christ was leaving he told his disciples that once the Holy Spirit comes he will lead them into all truth and he will guide them and even convict them convict them of judgment and all these things that are to come so the Holy Spirit plays a crucial role in this transaction so in of ourselves as human beings with our nature there's no way we can have an esteem for this SP there's no way we can have an esteem for the righteousness of Christ unless we are under the guidance of the Holy Spirit So my answer to the question whether you are lost no you are not lost unless you grieve the spirit of God unless you do not submit yourself to the leading of the holy spirit so the Holy Spirit prays these two roles he reveals the righteousness sorry he reveals the preciousness of the par that is from Christ object lessons chapter 9 that is Page 118 and two he gives us the realization of our state that is we cannot compare our righteousness with the righteousness of of Christ because Isaiah refers to our righteousness as that of filthy rugs Ted clothes then he also helps us to realize our own spiritual poverty and need so the Lordan Church thinks that it is Rich and has all these Goods that he needs yet we do not we as a ludan we do not realize our spiritual poverty and need but the only but the holy spirit is the one that can reveal this to us so as as a Christian what motivates us or what should motivate us to be able to give up everything for this SP the answer is found in the in appreciation and love Jesus uh in John chapter 14:15 tells us if you love me you will keep my commandments so all these things that we do if they're not done in love then they become a really heavy burden upon us and um that will help that will make us just do them for the sake of doing and not with the understanding that is required so when the Holy Spirit reveals Christ's Beauty and righteousness our response isn't one of Duty but of Joy education the book of Education page 297 states that Duty becomes becomes a delight and sacrifice a pleasure it becomes easy Once the Holy Spirit reveals Christ's Beauty and righteousness to us this is not about being perfect before receiving Christ don't get me wrong Jeremiah 31:5 reminds us that Jesus or God loves us with an everl lasting love Christ accept us as we are offering his righteousness as a gift to those who will recognize its value and choose to receive it remember the only way we can recognize its value is through the indwelling of the Holy Spirit the whole of this process of buying our righteousness is a transaction of Faith Christ object relationss page 96 and first selected messages page 360 tells us that genuine Faith appropriates the righteousness of Christ appropriate means for example you go to somebody's house and you ask him ah this is your house yes they say yes do you have the keys to this this house they say yes you tell them give me this key to this house they give you to the key and then you tell them okay now you can leave this house is mine that is what appropriation means we are taking possession of what is there so you must know Christ and appropriate the gift of his righteousness the only way in which a sinner can obtain righteousness by faith is he can bring to God the merits of Christ there's nothing we can do by our own strength or might or by our own efforts that can earn us righteousness that can give us the white reignment that will be an attribute of those who will see God face to face but only through appropriating or taking upon ourselves the merits of Christ and presenting that to God can God accept us so when Christ was exalted and glorified by the apostles that is from acts when they presented the glory of Jesus like the Splendor of a great PE shining in all its beauty then thousands were converted but let us remember that this glory is the righteousness of Christ he is perfect gracious loving character the latter Reign and the finishing of God's work will come when the glory of Christ is presented in the spirit's power I know many of us have heard about the latter rain and many of us have read about it but it can only come when Christ's glory is presented through the power or in the power of the Holy Spirit the spirit only awaits our demand and reception that's are two things the spirit is waiting for for us to ask and once we are given for us to receive it Christ is again to be revealed in his fullness by the holy spirit's power men will be able to discern the value of the precious pal when the spirit reveals it to them and with the Apostle Paul they will say what things were gained to me th I counted loss for Christ yeah doubtless and I count all things but laws for the Excellency of the knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord that is from Philippians 3:7 which is quoted from Christ object lessons page 120 so in closing I want to say this the obtaining of righteousness is not about as climbing the ladder to get somewhere or walking or taking things from other people or copying other people it's about recognizing the Supreme value of Christ and his righteousness and joyfully trading in all that we are for all that he is I'll repeat that the obtaining of righteousness is not about our climbing working or taking from other people or copying others it's about recognizing the Supreme value of Christ and his righteousness and joyfully trading all that we are for all that he is when we truly see the preciousness of this PA giving ourselves fully to Christ becomes less of a burden it actually ceases to become a burden but a privilege not a duty but a delight may God bless us even as we close I want to send an appeal to all of us me included I don't know what we are struggling with I don't know what you're holding on to that is too precious than the pile of great prize which is Jesus Christ I ask that this day you may be able to let it go and that you may be able to take up what Christ is giving us through his salvation through his death death on the cross John 3:16 Says that for God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son that whosoever believes in Him should not perish but have everlasting life I don't know why we find it hard to Trad in what we have for what Christ has or has given to us I ask to just all this evening that we may ask God to send us his holy spirit that he may be able to lead us that he may be able to Cel us that he may be able to help us appropriate Christ's righteousness to be our own and that one day we may be able to see Jesus face to face if you like me are seeking to see Jesus face to face I'd like you to pray with me let us pray Father in heaven we thank you so much for your word Lord we thank you for that you which we were able to share Lord I ask that what I have shared with my brethren wherever they are that that may also be lived out in my life I ask that you may send your spirit to be with all of us both those who are watching and and myself those who are seated here also that he may be able to lead us that we may be able to realize or see our righteousness as it truly is and also that we may be able to recognize how precious Christ is to us that we may be able to accept the gift that he gave to us when he died on the cross Lord I ask that for most of us or all of us or some of us who are struggling that you may help us that you may walk with us this journey that one day we may be able to see you face to face when we are we are clothed with the righteousness of Christ because this is our only get P to Heaven Lord help us to be able to buy and to stop trying very hard to achieve this by our own strength in your word you say that you are the one who does both to Will and to do of your good pleasure we ask that you may help us to allow you to come into your our hearts that you may be able to lead us you may be able to guide us I pray all this trusting and believing knowing that you've heard and answered all this through Jesus your son amen amen

TIMESTAMPED TRANSCRIPT:
[0.8s] hello and good evening welcome to
[3.2s] today's prayer session prayer service
[6.0s] for the midweek my name is Paul anduru
[9.0s] and I'd like us to pray so that we can
[11.0s] begin let us pray our kind and loving
[14.2s] master in heaven we come before you this
[15.9s] evening we thank you so much for
[17.7s] allowing us to be alive this day it is
[20.0s] because you want us to learn something
[21.6s] from you and we ask that you may lead us
[24.4s] even as we share something small we ask
[26.5s] that you may take charge of our minds of
[28.8s] our hearts of our thoughts help us to
[31.6s] think about the words that will come
[33.2s] from this Pulpit we ask that you may
[35.4s] lead my thoughts that you may guide my
[37.9s] uh words that all may be according to
[40.6s] your will I thank you for always
[43.3s] listening to my prayer I ask that you
[45.7s] may forgive any sin that may hinder our
[48.1s] prayers from getting to you I pray all
[50.2s] this in Jesus name amen welcome all to
[54.0s] today's session uh welcome for those of
[57.3s] us who are inside the church and also
[59.3s] those of us who are watching online
[61.8s] those who are in their homes in their
[63.3s] offices
[65.1s] kibon so today's uh topic is the
[69.9s] Heavenly
[71.6s] merchantman so a merchantman is simply a
[75.2s] salesperson in uh current English words
[79.8s] yeah yeah
[81.6s] so to begin I want to take us through
[84.5s] some misconceptions that we have as
[87.0s] Christians in our world today so many of
[90.3s] us have fallen into a pattern of viewing
[93.5s] righteousness as a destination to be
[96.1s] reached through our own
[98.6s] efforts striving and constant
[102.0s] trying then we often find ourselves
[104.4s] checking our progress It's like we have
[107.1s] some marking scheme that we check our
[109.2s] progress
[110.4s] on how am I doing in my victory over
[115.0s] sin what's my spiritual progress today
[119.0s] those are some of the questions that
[120.9s] probably most of us if not many of us if
[125.7s] not some of us
[127.8s] ask while there are several quotes in
[130.5s] the spirit of
[132.0s] Prophecy that might Mis that might be
[134.8s] misunderstood as supporting this notion
[137.4s] there's a deeper truth that I want us to
[139.5s] share
[141.1s] today so we'll go through the scriptures
[145.4s] and the spirit of Prophecy just to get
[147.9s] light on the same
[150.8s] so uh our key text comes from The Book
[153.4s] of Matthew Chapter
[155.2s] 13 Verse 45 and
[158.5s] 46 Matthew 13:45 and
[163.2s] 46 this is a parable that Jesus was
[165.6s] giving to those who are around him at
[168.2s] that particular time and it is the
[170.3s] parable of the par of great
[173.1s] priz 45 says again the Kingdom of Heaven
[177.1s] is like unto a merchant man seeking
[179.4s] goodly PS I'll repeat again the Kingdom
[182.8s] of Heaven is like a merchant man seeking
[185.2s] Godly par 46 who when he had found one
[189.3s] pal of great price went and sold all he
[193.8s] had
[195.2s] bought
[197.6s] yes so the spirit of Prophecy provides
[202.0s] two complimenting definitions of this P
[204.8s] of great priz which I want to share with
[208.4s] us first
[210.5s] is Christ himself is the
[213.2s] P then the second one is the
[215.6s] righteousness of Christ is as pure white
[219.1s] PE with no defect and no stain all this
[222.5s] come from Christ object lessons page 1
[226.0s] 15 that is chapter 9 of the book the
[229.1s] parable about the
[231.4s] pal so these definitions aren't
[233.8s] conflicting in any way
[236.7s] because uh another quote from the
[239.0s] thoughts of Mount blessings speaks on
[241.0s] the same that is thoughts of the from
[242.7s] the Mount of blessings page 18 explains
[245.6s] that the righteousness of God is
[247.4s] embodied in Christ we receive
[250.7s] righteousness by receiving
[258.6s] him so the righteousness of God is
[261.0s] embodied in Christ we receive
[262.4s] righteousness by receiving him this
[265.9s] aligns with first selected messages page
[269.7s] P 399 paragraph 1 that says the
[274.0s] righteousness of Christ as pure white PE
[277.4s] has no defect no stain no guilt this
[282.9s] righteousness may be
[284.9s] ours salvation with its blood B in
[289.5s] estimate inestimable Treasures is the P
[293.3s] of great
[295.0s] prize so in essence it doesn't matter
[298.4s] whether you call the pal
[300.5s] righteousness of Christ or whether you
[303.8s] call the pal Christ or whether you even
[306.7s] refer to the pal as
[308.3s] salvation because it is all found in one
[311.4s] person which is Jesus Christ the Divine
[314.6s] Merchant man got it and he bought the P
[318.3s] that is from uh Matthew
[322.5s] 13:46
[324.5s] yes so this is not righteousness is not
[327.7s] something that we have provoked or that
[330.1s] we attain to by our own efforts or by
[333.2s] doing any work it is a Divine
[336.7s] transaction I'd like us to turn to
[338.7s] Revelation
[341.0s] 3:18 Revelation 3:8 to 20 will be our
[345.8s] Focus but we'll start reading from verse
[349.2s] 14 this is the message that uh Christ
[353.4s] gives to the Church of the laudations
[355.1s] which I believe is the church in the
[357.3s] last days which we are part of
[360.2s] and unto the
[361.6s] angel of the laudation WR this things
[365.8s] sayith the amen the faithful and true
[368.8s] witness the beginning of the creation of
[371.9s] God I Know Thy works that thou art
[375.1s] neither cold nor hot I would
[379.4s] that I would thou what cold or hot so
[383.7s] then because Thou Art
[385.8s] lukewarm and neither cold or hot I will
[389.2s] speak thee out of my mouth because thou
[393.2s] sayest I am rich and increased with
[396.1s] goods and
[398.3s] have and have need of nothing and
[401.0s] knowest not that thou art wretched and
[404.9s] miserable and poor and blind and naked
[409.1s] our Focus Verse 18 I Cel thee to buy of
[413.2s] me gold tried in fire that thou mayest
[416.9s] be rich and white rment that thou mayest
[420.8s] be clothed and that the shame of thy
[423.6s] nakedness do not do not appear and
[427.4s] anoint thine eyes eyes with thyself that
[431.2s] thou mayest see as many as I have as I
[435.6s] love I rebuke and chesten be zealous
[438.6s] therefore and repent 20 behold I stand
[442.1s] at the door and knock If any man hear my
[444.5s] voice and open the door I will come into
[447.7s] him and will saap with him
[450.0s] and he with me yes stop at that so from
[455.1s] uh specifically verse uh 18 we find a
[460.7s] statement um which says I canel Thee to
[464.2s] buy of me tried gold in fire that thou
[468.0s] mayest be rich and white rayment focus
[470.7s] is white rment so what is the white
[475.8s] rment um there's a quote from uh LG
[479.2s] White writing from Christ object lesson
[481.5s] page
[483.9s] 113
[485.7s] um and also
[488.4s] um uh CH volume five of the testimonies
[492.0s] to the church page
[494.0s] 233 which tells us that the the white
[496.6s] rment is the righteousness of Christ
[499.6s] yeah and Christ tells us to buy of him
[502.8s] the righteousness it does not tell us to
[504.6s] work for it tells us to buy
[509.6s] a question may come but how do we buy
[512.3s] this
[513.6s] righteousness so the true witness which
[515.7s] is Jesus
[516.8s] Christ says
[519.8s] this that we are to buy from him and
[524.3s] Isaiah 55 vers uh
[527.0s] one gives us something which I want us
[529.7s] to read after I've read some quotes from
[532.4s] U uh some of the quotations I got from
[535.6s] the spirit of Prophecy so the the spirit
[538.3s] of Prophecy uses specific specific
[540.3s] terminology to describe this transaction
[543.6s] the transaction of buying this white
[545.2s] rment from Christ which is his
[547.1s] righteousness from first selected
[549.0s] messages page 381 he
[551.8s] says we can do this that is buying only
[556.5s] as we
[557.6s] grasp yeah Living Faith enables the
[561.8s] possessor to lay hold that is from 364
[565.4s] page 364 of the same book first selected
[569.0s] messages
[570.5s] another one from uh Christ object
[572.4s] lessons page
[573.9s] 114 Faith lays hold upon the upon the
[578.3s] virtue of
[579.6s] Christ then also page 96 of Christ
[582.4s] object lesson says through faith in
[585.6s] Christ The Sinner may
[588.7s] claim first selected messages 367 says
[592.3s] by faith he can bring to God the merits
[595.4s] of Christ so the righteousness of Christ
[598.2s] embodied in Christ is as pure white
[600.6s] pearl but the key thought in Matthew
[604.6s] 13:45 and 46 is how the merchant man
[608.6s] obtains the P what did he do he sold all
[613.8s] that he had and bought it this is what
[618.0s] Jesus himself taught but it doesn't seem
[621.8s] to be in harmony with other teachings in
[624.2s] the Bible that is buying the P that is
[627.7s] the righteousness sound so worldly and
[630.7s] materialistic because most of the time
[633.6s] we find that in the Bible uh Salvation
[637.5s] is depicted as a free gift yes but uh I
[642.6s] believe these
[645.4s] two Notions are not at opposing ends but
[650.0s] uh there's a way that this works so how
[653.3s] can such a teaching fit into the rest of
[655.4s] the Bible the teaching of buying
[657.4s] righteousness
[659.5s] so Isaiah 55 which I had mentioned verse
[663.4s] one Isaiah 51:1 says
[667.7s] Ho everyone that
[670.4s] thirsted Come Ye to the waters and he
[673.4s] that hath no money Come Ye buy itat yeah
[679.8s] come buy wine and milk without money and
[684.4s] without
[686.4s] price so it gives some paradox
[690.0s] right
[691.3s] yes buy without money and without a
[695.0s] price how can we buy something without
[697.6s] money it doesn't make sense to today's
[701.2s] world the answer lies in Understanding
[704.5s] God's
[705.5s] economy how can you buy without money
[708.0s] I'll
[709.0s] explain the same way much of the world
[712.4s] conducts it its business in the olden
[715.8s] days where there was butter trade system
[718.7s] I believe
[720.3s] most of us are familiar if not all of us
[723.1s] so you simply trade what you have for
[726.0s] that which you need and you do not have
[728.6s] for example in the village I
[731.6s] remember mommy would take some Maze and
[734.7s] give it to somebody else and she would
[736.4s] get beans and maybe sometimes give it to
[739.8s] somebody else and get some eggs or some
[742.2s] chicken so there was no man involved
[749.7s] so that means even the poor are able to
[752.5s] trade what they have for what they do
[754.8s] not have so long as you can you have
[757.7s] something it doesn't need to be money
[761.4s] but something that you can exchange
[762.8s] maybe even your skills for
[766.2s] food so what do we trade in in order to
[769.3s] buy righteousness from
[770.9s] Christ in the parable of the
[775.7s] pal sorry in the parable the pal is not
[779.2s] represented as a gift the merchant man
[782.4s] bought it at a price of all that he had
[786.4s] that is Matthew chter 13 verse 45 and
[790.0s] 46 many question the meaning of this
[793.0s] since Christ is
[794.3s] represented as a gift in the scriptures
[797.2s] that is what I had alluded to earlier
[800.2s] Christ object lessons page 116 explains
[804.4s] he is a gift but only to to those who
[808.1s] give themselves
[809.8s] soul body and spirit to him without
[814.3s] Reserve that means Christ is a gift to
[817.9s] those who empty themselves to him not
[822.1s] withholding any anything so Jesus in
[824.6s] Revelation 3:2
[827.5s] says or represents himself as a sales
[830.6s] person coming to knock at our doors and
[834.0s] he's knocking at the door of your heart
[835.5s] even
[836.5s] today he is the great vendor a Heavenly
[839.6s] Merchant man he is selling and what is
[842.2s] he
[843.0s] selling he is
[844.8s] selling his
[847.0s] righteousness the white reignment he
[849.9s] urges that we transact our business with
[852.5s] him in the book Desire of Ages page
[856.3s] 347 uh the servant of the Lord says
[859.7s] saving faith is a transaction by which
[862.8s] those who receive Christ join themsel in
[866.6s] Covenant relation with God
[872.3s] so a question may come uh what if I do
[876.1s] not value Pals what if there's not that
[879.8s] desire to be able to buy this
[882.1s] righteousness of of of of
[887.2s] God am I lost eternally that is not the
[891.4s] case because there uh the Holy Spirit
[894.4s] has a role in this the Holy Spirit
[897.2s] according to John 16:8 11 when Christ
[900.9s] was leaving he told his disciples that
[903.4s] once the Holy Spirit comes he will lead
[905.8s] them into all truth and he will guide
[907.6s] them and even convict them convict them
[910.5s] of judgment and all these things that
[913.6s] are to come so the Holy Spirit plays a
[916.7s] crucial role in this
[919.5s] transaction so in of ourselves as human
[922.8s] beings with our nature there's no way we
[926.4s] can have an esteem for this SP
[929.6s] there's no way we can have an esteem for
[931.5s] the righteousness of Christ
[934.8s] unless we are under the guidance of the
[937.2s] Holy Spirit So my answer to the question
[941.2s] whether you are lost no you are not lost
[944.6s] unless you grieve the spirit of
[947.0s] God unless you do not submit yourself to
[950.0s] the leading of the holy
[951.7s] spirit so the Holy Spirit prays these
[955.5s] two roles he reveals the righteousness
[960.6s] sorry he reveals the preciousness of the
[963.0s] par that is from Christ object lessons
[966.0s] chapter 9 that is Page 118 and
[972.5s] two he gives us the realization of our
[976.7s] state that is we cannot compare our
[979.6s] righteousness with the righteousness of
[981.6s] of Christ because Isaiah refers to our
[984.6s] righteousness as that of filthy rugs Ted
[988.1s] clothes
[990.6s] then he also helps us to realize our own
[994.1s] spiritual poverty and
[997.5s] need so the Lordan Church thinks that it
[1001.1s] is
[1002.0s] Rich and has all these Goods that he
[1005.1s] needs yet we do not we as a ludan we do
[1008.6s] not realize our spiritual poverty and
[1010.8s] need but the only but the holy spirit is
[1014.4s] the one that can reveal this to
[1017.4s] us so as as a Christian what motivates
[1020.7s] us or what should motivate us to be able
[1025.0s] to give up everything for this
[1027.8s] SP the answer is found in the in
[1031.6s] appreciation and
[1034.9s] love Jesus uh in John chapter 14:15
[1039.2s] tells us if you love me you will keep my
[1042.7s] commandments so all these things that we
[1045.6s] do if they're not done in love then they
[1048.2s] become a really heavy burden upon us and
[1053.3s] um that will help that will make us just
[1055.9s] do them for the sake of doing and not
[1059.2s] with the understanding that is required
[1061.8s] so when the Holy Spirit reveals Christ's
[1064.1s] Beauty and
[1065.9s] righteousness our
[1067.9s] response isn't one of Duty but of
[1072.9s] Joy education the book of Education page
[1076.6s] 297 states that Duty becomes becomes a
[1079.4s] delight and sacrifice a pleasure it
[1082.5s] becomes
[1085.0s] easy Once the Holy Spirit reveals
[1088.8s] Christ's Beauty and righteousness to
[1092.8s] us this is not about being perfect
[1096.4s] before receiving Christ don't get me
[1098.9s] wrong Jeremiah 31:5 reminds us
[1103.0s] that Jesus or
[1106.9s] God loves us with an everl lasting
[1111.0s] love Christ accept us as we are offering
[1115.1s] his righteousness as a gift to those who
[1119.2s] will recognize its value and choose to
[1121.6s] receive
[1123.0s] it remember the only way we
[1126.2s] can recognize its value is
[1129.5s] through the indwelling of the Holy
[1133.4s] Spirit the whole of this process of
[1135.7s] buying our righteousness
[1139.4s] is a transaction of
[1142.9s] Faith Christ object
[1145.4s] relationss page 96 and first selected
[1148.4s] messages page
[1150.6s] 360 tells us that genuine Faith
[1154.2s] appropriates the righteousness of
[1157.5s] Christ appropriate
[1160.2s] means for example you go to somebody's
[1164.0s] house and you ask him ah this is your
[1166.4s] house yes they say yes do you have the
[1168.3s] keys to this this house they say yes you
[1171.4s] tell them give me this key to this house
[1174.2s] they give you to the key and then you
[1176.2s] tell them okay now you can leave this
[1178.0s] house is mine that is what appropriation
[1180.4s] means we are taking possession
[1183.2s] of what is
[1187.4s] there so you must know Christ and
[1189.9s] appropriate the gift of his
[1193.0s] righteousness the only way in which a
[1195.4s] sinner can obtain righteousness by faith
[1198.4s] is he can bring to God the merits of
[1202.0s] Christ there's nothing we can do by our
[1204.5s] own strength or might or by our own
[1207.2s] efforts that can earn us righteousness
[1210.2s] that can give us the white reignment
[1212.0s] that will be an attribute of those who
[1215.7s] will see God face to face but only
[1219.4s] through appropriating or taking upon
[1223.2s] ourselves the merits of Christ and
[1225.6s] presenting that to God can God accept us
[1230.1s] so when Christ was exalted and glorified
[1232.8s] by the apostles that is from
[1236.3s] acts when they presented the glory of
[1239.0s] Jesus like the Splendor of a great PE
[1241.2s] shining in all its beauty then thousands
[1244.3s] were
[1245.3s] converted but let us remember that this
[1247.8s] glory is the righteousness of Christ he
[1251.4s] is perfect gracious loving
[1255.0s] character the latter Reign and the
[1257.2s] finishing of God's work will come when
[1259.8s] the glory of Christ is presented in the
[1262.9s] spirit's
[1263.9s] power I know many of us have heard about
[1266.7s] the latter rain and many of us have read
[1268.7s] about it but it can only come when
[1272.4s] Christ's
[1274.0s] glory is presented through the power or
[1277.7s] in the power of the Holy
[1280.6s] Spirit the
[1282.4s] spirit only awaits our demand and
[1286.6s] reception that's are two things the
[1288.9s] spirit is waiting for for us to ask and
[1291.8s] once we are given for us to receive
[1294.4s] it Christ is again to be revealed in his
[1297.6s] fullness by the holy spirit's
[1300.1s] power men will be able to discern the
[1303.0s] value of the precious pal when the
[1305.4s] spirit reveals it to them and with the
[1309.1s] Apostle Paul they will say what things
[1312.7s] were gained to me th I counted loss for
[1317.1s] Christ
[1319.0s] yeah doubtless and I count all things
[1322.3s] but laws for the Excellency of the
[1324.7s] knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord that
[1328.1s] is from Philippians 3:7 which is quoted
[1331.4s] from Christ object lessons page
[1335.5s] 120 so in closing I want to say
[1338.7s] this the obtaining of righteousness is
[1341.3s] not about as climbing the ladder to get
[1345.2s] somewhere or walking
[1348.7s] or taking things from other people or
[1351.0s] copying other people it's about
[1353.5s] recognizing the Supreme value of Christ
[1356.9s] and his
[1358.1s] righteousness and joyfully trading in
[1362.2s] all that we are for all that he
[1367.4s] is I'll repeat
[1369.9s] that the obtaining of righteousness is
[1372.6s] not about our climbing working or taking
[1375.8s] from other people or copying others it's
[1379.0s] about recognizing the Supreme value of
[1381.7s] Christ and his
[1383.7s] righteousness and joyfully trading all
[1386.5s] that we are for all that he
[1390.4s] is when we truly see the preciousness of
[1393.3s] this PA giving ourselves fully to Christ
[1398.0s] becomes less of a burden it actually
[1401.2s] ceases to become a burden but a
[1404.3s] privilege not a duty but a delight
[1410.0s] may God bless us even as we
[1413.3s] close I want to send an appeal to all of
[1416.4s] us me
[1418.1s] included I don't know what we are
[1420.0s] struggling with I don't know what you're
[1423.0s] holding on to that is too precious than
[1426.0s] the pile of great prize which is Jesus
[1429.2s] Christ I ask that this day you may be
[1432.6s] able to let it go and that you may be
[1435.3s] able to take up what Christ is giving us
[1438.6s] through his salvation through his death
[1440.6s] death on the
[1442.4s] cross John 3:16 Says that for God so
[1445.9s] loved the world that he gave his only
[1448.3s] begotten son that whosoever believes in
[1451.4s] Him should not perish but have
[1454.0s] everlasting life I don't know
[1457.2s] why we find it
[1459.7s] hard to Trad in what we have for what
[1464.4s] Christ has or has given to us I ask to
[1468.2s] just all this evening that we may ask
[1471.0s] God to send us his holy spirit that he
[1474.0s] may be able to lead us that he may be
[1475.9s] able to Cel us that he may be able to
[1478.6s] help us
[1480.7s] appropriate Christ's righteousness to be
[1483.8s] our own and that one day we may be able
[1487.1s] to see Jesus face to face if
[1491.8s] you like me are seeking to see Jesus
[1496.3s] face to face I'd like you to pray with
[1499.3s] me let us pray Father in heaven we thank
[1503.6s] you so much for your word Lord we thank

[1522.0s] life I ask that you may send your spirit
[1524.6s] to be with all of us both those who are
[1527.7s] watching and and myself those who are
[1529.6s] seated here also that he may be able to
[1533.0s] lead us that we may be able to realize
[1536.7s] or
[1537.5s] see our righteousness as it truly is and
[1542.1s] also that we may be able to recognize
[1544.8s] how precious Christ is to us that we may
[1549.0s] be able to accept the gift that he gave
[1552.1s] to us when he died on the cross Lord I
[1555.1s] ask that for most of us or all of us or
[1559.8s] some of us who are struggling that you
[1562.0s] may help us that you may walk with us
[1565.0s] this journey that one day we may be able
[1567.4s] to see you face to
[1569.1s] face when we are we are clothed with the
[1572.0s] righteousness of Christ because this is
[1574.3s] our only get P to Heaven Lord help us to
[1578.4s] be able to buy and to stop trying very
