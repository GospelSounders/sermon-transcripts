FULL TRANSCRIPT:
good morning good afternoon good day happy Sabbath from wherever you're watching us from uh it's so wonderful to have you here with us as we discuss the book When God Says remember welcome this is the Teens book club and my name is bisak lumba but before we start let's sh a prayer dear father in Heaven oh Lord God we come before you at this time we like to thank you so much father for another opportunity to read from this book now father as we look to discuss it be with us keep us and protect us in Jesus name I pray amen amen well we are now discussing the final chapter of this book When God Says remember whose flag will fly whose flag will fly and with me here to give us a little bit of an introduction and discuss the book is subira subira say hi introduce yourself and give us an introduction hello my name is subir and I'm a teen I'm so excited to delve into this chapter chapter nine you have made it if you have been with us all the way from chapter one rest for The Rush all the way now to whose flag will fly Amen to give you a quick summary on what this chapter is about oh let us all accept the truth that we are born in the enemy's flag we are citizens of sin but there is hope okay I'm going to use the analogy of flag nationality and passport all in one to give us a big picture on what our Salvation looks like see our spiritual passport is of Earth but unlike other passports that you use to travel into other nations Heaven is not a vacation destination if anything Heaven is a reality Heaven is a lifestyle Heaven is the place we want to be and so what does that mean for our fles it means that because our nationality is of sin is of the earth something needs to happen a transformation needs to happen see we look at the Book of Daniel with K King Nebuchadnezzar and I really want us to understand what worship is what Allegiance is because whose flag will fly ties directly to whose Allegiance will we have a connection to so The Book of Daniel King Nebuchadnezzar demands worship worship of the golden image see the king's act of worship is not a sign of just mere I want all the praise but actually it is a sign of loyalty and so Christianity in its truest form is a test of our Allegiance all religions are calling for you to obey one true God and so whom will you bow down to and Satan really loves Your Allegiance in fact he does not care about you he cares about your loyalty Your Allegiance look at Matthew 4:8-9 and I'll ask teacher bismar to please read it for us Matthew 4: 8-9 yes the context is Jesus being in the desert and he's wandering for 40 days 40 nights but he's tempted by the devil what does it say it says again devil took him up on an exceedingly high mountain and showed him all the kingdoms of the world and their glory and he said to him all these things will I give you if you will fall down and worship Me O so what what is the devil asking for worship worship and what is the effect If he if Jesus is to give the devil this worship he gives him his Allegiance Allegiance but also the world mhm the devil is offering the world for Jesus to Bow Down and Worship Him it is the devil will go at such great length to gain your soul and so the question really what is the cost of your soul our society looks at selling your soul but honestly it is a big battle of Allegiance if you commit to the devil if you get on his side that's game he he'll give you the world essentially and so really asking questions here for us to get some discussion going on because we're born into the enemy's flag what is the hope that is offered in the word regarding our citizenship amen amen no we have tremendous hope we have tremendous hope uh in the Bible in regard to our citizenship God does not leave us at pains to to discover who we TR are you know God lets us know precisely who we are and there are various texts in the Bible that uh that God has actually given us in order for us to know that we are citizens of Heaven um one he created us all right so just from the very onset you know you already know uh that God is with us secondly uh throughout the Book of Matthew uh uh Jesus comes to die for us you know or rather throughout the gospels not only the Book of Matthew Jesus actually comes to die for us to claim us from our sins uh and even throughout the Bible you know we have Paul I think in Colossians chter 3:5 uh but we should we should check that I think it's maybe Corinthians or Colossians you know he says that we are bought with a price you know and not perishable things but with the blood of Christ can you imagine we are citizens of Heaven you know and throughout the Bible you know throughout this Love Letter by God he's constantly reminding us of who we are indeed the whole Bible is a story of what God is doing to save us from our sins AB to save us from our condition now all right yes our condition of sinfulness our condition where we have been sold to the devil all right and to alleviate us and take us to heaven where we should be absolutely like teacher bismar is saying we have a chance to change our citizenship it is not like other countries where there are certain policies and regulations and migration is not even possible but the spiritual migration requires Faith requires trus and God welcomes us to become citizens of Heaven amen and such a passport is Limitless amen it ensures eternity eternity it ensures relationship um it ensures Joy joy and peace and all these things are necessary but how can we have this Allegiance how can we show God that we are with you see God requires consistency like all of us do that we require of him but our actions our faith those are signs of Allegiance but I want to pose a question to teacher bismar so our actions little signs of Allegiance and if so how can we be more intentional with them yeah yeah I think that actions are a sign of Allegiance I think you have rightfully said you you pointed out to the book of uh of Daniel H so King Nebuchadnezzar required of these three Hebrew boys actions you know they were whenever when they were to hear the sound of the music they were to bow down right and if they didn't then there were consequences to that you know they were to face the fiery furnace right similarly in our own lives uh their actions that demonstrate our Allegiance you know uh you know we are told that uh faith without actions is dead right and that God also tells us Jesus tells us in the Book of Matthew if you love me keep my Commandments you know so these actions ideally actually tell where our Allegiance lies it tells who we follow uh one of the examples that's given in the Bible is the example or rather in the book by Mark Finley uh is the example of the Sabbath you know and how keeping the Sabbath is actually a a a a showcase h a demonstration of where our Allegiance lies uh it's in the Commandment itself it's in the Commandment itself remember to keep the Sabbath day holy all right six days you shall labor and do all your work but the seventh day is the Sabbath of the Lord your God so it's a Sabbath to God right and in keeping it we actually demonstrate our allegiance to God as well yes yeah I just wanted to make a clarification the verse that I that I uh had uh mentioned earlier is 1 Corinthians chapter 6:9 for we are bought with a price therefore glorify God in your body and in your spirit thank you for that and actually Mark Finley posits that the Sabbath is the flag but I would like to present a different argument that in fact the flag is more consistent with our Allegiance the Flag represents our citizenship the flag showcases the country or perhaps the kingdom that we are part of and that I pray is the Heavenly Kingdom God has the world the world in his hands and with just a flicker of a finger that could change drastically what happens but here's the thing he wants you fly in his fly his flag rest in his steadfast love see Sabbath is a way to do that Sabbath showcases Your Allegiance contrary to the rest of the world they may keep all the other laws but in the entirety of the law we must also keep the Sabbath amen amen so God redeems you and I for in heaven and I think Ellen G white says it's the most amazing way a redeemed soul is of surpassing worth Heaven rejoices when one who was lost but is now found so God is offering you an opportunity fly his flag become part of his Nation by a simple yes and amen having faith in Christ and God but as we end the book would we like to have a few parting shorts what are things that we want the readers to take home teacher bismar amen amen I think this book has been a wonderful read uh throughout the book entirely you know rest for the rushed uh set free to obey A Day to Remember History's Greatest hoax uh and all the chapters that are there uh one thing that I have taken from the book is that God has set aside the Sabbath for us you know it's really a benefit to us ladies and gentlemen you know you might think that it's merely formalism legalism but there are actual and true benefits that come from keeping the Sabbath right actual and true benefits that come Rejuvenation of your health wealth and and well-being you know um time to spend with your family and mostly importantly time to reconnect with your creator yes I think in this chapter I am deeply reminded of a God who cares a God who loves and the provision of the Sabbath transcends just mere rest and Rejuvenation but also salvation we are granted this amazing opportunity to dwell with Christ even when we don't even deserve it if anything imagine God providing this seven days work week in which we are worked and worked and worked but he wants us to pause to reflect to work on our spiritual character and so as you read this book I pray that you too May learn these amazing gems that we are called to rest on the Sabbath and rest in the fact that God truly saves amen amen in the concluding part of this book uh there is a personal appeal that cites the Book of John chapter 1 verse John chapter 13:1 17 rather um and that says happy is he who knows these things and does them and so my prayer for you uh is that you may find joy in keeping the Sabbath let's pray dear father in Heaven oh Lord God we come before you thank you Father for the opportunity to read this book and to understand father your glorious and loving wishes for us in keeping the Sabbath be with us now keep us and protect us in Jesus name I pray amen amen and amen until next time goodbye

TIMESTAMPED TRANSCRIPT:
[0.4s] good morning good afternoon good day
[3.3s] happy Sabbath from wherever you're
[5.0s] watching us from uh it's so wonderful to
[7.9s] have you here with us as we discuss the
[10.5s] book When God Says remember welcome this
[13.7s] is the Teens book club and my name is
[15.8s] bisak lumba but before we start let's sh
[18.1s] a prayer dear father in Heaven oh Lord
[20.4s] God we come before you at this time we
[22.5s] like to thank you so much father for
[23.7s] another opportunity to read from this
[26.0s] book now father as we look to discuss it
[30.0s] be with us keep us and protect us in
[32.1s] Jesus name I pray amen amen well we are
[36.4s] now discussing the final chapter of this
[38.9s] book When God Says remember whose flag
[42.3s] will fly whose flag will fly and with me
[46.1s] here to give us a little bit of an
[47.7s] introduction and discuss the book is
[49.4s] subira subira say hi introduce yourself
[51.6s] and give us an introduction hello my
[54.0s] name is subir and I'm a teen I'm so
[56.4s] excited to delve into this chapter
[58.4s] chapter nine you have made it if you
[60.7s] have been with us all the way from
[62.4s] chapter one rest for The Rush all the
[66.2s] way now to whose flag will fly Amen to
[69.6s] give you a quick summary on what this
[71.3s] chapter is about oh let us all accept
[75.4s] the truth that we are born in the
[78.0s] enemy's flag we are citizens of sin but
[83.2s] there is
[84.0s] hope okay I'm going to use the analogy
[88.0s] of flag nationality and passport all in
[91.2s] one to give us a big picture on what our
[94.2s] Salvation looks like see our spiritual
[97.7s] passport is of Earth but
[101.0s] unlike other passports that you use to
[103.6s] travel into other
[105.3s] nations Heaven is not a vacation
[108.8s] destination if anything Heaven is a
[112.2s] reality Heaven is a lifestyle Heaven is
[115.6s] the place we want to be and so what does
[118.8s] that mean for our fles
[120.7s] it means that because our nationality is
[123.6s] of sin is of the earth something needs
[126.6s] to happen a transformation needs to
[130.5s] happen see we look at the Book of Daniel
[134.0s] with K King Nebuchadnezzar and I really
[136.6s] want us to understand what worship is
[139.0s] what Allegiance is because whose flag
[142.2s] will fly ties directly to whose
[145.5s] Allegiance will we have a connection to
[149.6s] so The Book of Daniel King
[151.3s] Nebuchadnezzar demands worship worship
[154.4s] of the golden image see the king's act
[157.6s] of worship is not a sign of just mere I
[161.3s] want all the praise but actually it is a
[164.6s] sign of loyalty and so Christianity in
[168.4s] its truest form is a test of our
[171.2s] Allegiance all religions are calling for
[173.9s] you to obey one true God and so whom
[179.1s] will you bow down
[181.5s] to and Satan really loves Your
[184.3s] Allegiance in fact he does not care
[186.9s] about you he cares about your loyalty
[190.1s] Your Allegiance look at Matthew 4:8-9
[194.5s] and I'll ask teacher bismar to please
[196.1s] read it for us Matthew 4: 8-9 yes the
[200.1s] context is Jesus being in the desert and
[203.5s] he's wandering for 40 days 40 nights but
[206.3s] he's tempted by the devil what does it
[208.8s] say it says again devil took him up on
[211.1s] an exceedingly high mountain and showed
[213.4s] him all the kingdoms of the world and
[215.0s] their glory and he said to him all these
[217.9s] things will I give you if you will fall
[220.2s] down and worship Me O so what what is
[224.4s] the devil asking for worship worship and
[228.3s] what is the effect If he if Jesus is to
[230.9s] give the devil this worship he gives him
[233.6s] his Allegiance Allegiance but also the
[237.8s] world mhm the devil is offering the
[241.9s] world for Jesus to Bow Down and Worship
[244.8s] Him it
[247.1s] is the devil will go at such great
[250.0s] length to gain your soul and so the
[253.2s] question really what is the cost of your
[255.4s] soul our society looks at selling your
[258.4s] soul but honestly it is a big battle of
[262.0s] Allegiance if you commit to the devil if
[265.8s] you get on his
[267.8s] side that's game he he'll give you the
[270.4s] world essentially and so really asking
[273.8s] questions here for us to get some
[275.6s] discussion going on because we're born
[278.3s] into the enemy's flag what is the hope
[281.4s] that is offered in the word regarding
[284.0s] our
[284.8s] citizenship amen amen no we have
[287.8s] tremendous hope we have tremendous hope
[290.8s] uh in the Bible in regard to our
[292.9s] citizenship God does not leave us at
[296.0s] pains to to discover who we TR are you
[300.7s] know God lets us know precisely who we
[305.2s] are and there are various texts in the
[307.0s] Bible that uh that God has actually
[310.0s] given us in order for us to know that we
[312.8s] are citizens of Heaven um one he created
[317.1s] us all right so just from the very onset
[319.8s] you know you already know uh that God is
[323.6s] with us secondly uh throughout the Book
[327.0s] of Matthew uh uh Jesus comes to die for
[331.2s] us you know or rather throughout the
[333.2s] gospels not only the Book of Matthew
[335.0s] Jesus actually comes to die for us to
[336.8s] claim us from our sins uh and even
[339.7s] throughout the Bible you know we have
[341.5s] Paul I think in Colossians chter 3:5 uh
[345.7s] but we should we should check that I
[347.3s] think it's maybe Corinthians or
[348.6s] Colossians you know he says that we are
[350.7s] bought with a price you know and not
[353.4s] perishable things but with the blood of
[356.4s] Christ can you imagine we are citizens
[359.8s] of Heaven you know and throughout the
[362.2s] Bible you know throughout this Love
[363.8s] Letter by God he's constantly reminding
[366.1s] us of who we are indeed the whole Bible
[369.1s] is a story of what God is doing to save
[372.3s] us from our sins AB to save us from our
[375.8s] condition now all right yes our
[377.9s] condition of sinfulness our condition
[379.9s] where we have been sold to the devil all
[382.2s] right and to alleviate us and take us to
[385.5s] heaven where we should be absolutely
[388.3s] like teacher bismar is saying
[390.4s] we have a chance to change our
[392.3s] citizenship it is not like other
[394.2s] countries where there are certain
[396.2s] policies and regulations and migration
[398.8s] is not even possible but the spiritual
[401.6s] migration requires Faith requires trus
[405.8s] and God welcomes us to become citizens
[408.7s] of Heaven amen and such a passport is
[411.9s] Limitless amen it ensures eternity
[415.1s] eternity it ensures
[417.4s] relationship um it ensures Joy joy and
[420.2s] peace and all these things are necessary
[422.8s] but how can we have this Allegiance how
[425.1s] can we show God that we are with you see
[429.5s] God requires consistency like all of us
[432.0s] do that we require of him but our
[434.8s] actions our faith those are signs of
[438.2s] Allegiance but I want to pose a question
[440.3s] to teacher
[441.8s] bismar so our actions little signs of
[445.2s] Allegiance and if so how can we be more
[449.0s] intentional
[450.3s] with them yeah yeah I think that actions
[453.4s] are a sign of Allegiance I think you
[455.7s] have rightfully said you you pointed out
[457.6s] to the book of uh of Daniel H so King
[460.5s] Nebuchadnezzar required of these three
[462.7s] Hebrew boys actions you know they were
[465.5s] whenever when they were to hear the
[467.0s] sound of the music they were to bow down
[469.7s] right and if they didn't then there were
[471.8s] consequences to that you know they were
[473.8s] to face the fiery furnace right
[476.2s] similarly in our own lives uh their
[478.9s] actions that demonstrate our Allegiance
[482.6s] you know uh you know we are told that uh
[485.4s] faith without actions is dead right and
[487.9s] that God also tells us Jesus tells us in
[489.9s] the Book of Matthew if you love me keep
[492.4s] my Commandments you know so these
[494.5s] actions ideally actually tell where our
[497.5s] Allegiance lies it tells who we follow
[500.6s] uh one of the examples that's given in
[503.0s] the Bible is the example or rather in
[504.8s] the book by Mark Finley uh is the
[507.6s] example of the Sabbath you know and how
[510.2s] keeping the Sabbath is actually a a a a
[513.4s] showcase h a demonstration of where our
[516.9s] Allegiance lies uh it's in the
[519.4s] Commandment itself it's in the
[520.8s] Commandment itself remember to keep the
[522.8s] Sabbath day holy all right six days you
[525.6s] shall labor and do all your work but the
[528.0s] seventh day is the Sabbath of the Lord
[531.2s] your God so it's a Sabbath to God right
[534.5s] and in keeping it we actually
[536.2s] demonstrate our allegiance to God as
[538.1s] well yes yeah I just wanted to make a
[540.6s] clarification the verse that I that I uh
[543.8s] had uh mentioned earlier is 1
[546.2s] Corinthians chapter 6:9 for we are
[548.6s] bought with a price therefore glorify
[550.7s] God in your body and in your spirit
[553.2s] thank you for that and actually Mark
[555.6s] Finley posits that the Sabbath is the
[557.6s] flag but I would like to present a
[559.7s] different argument that in fact the flag
[563.0s] is more consistent with our Allegiance
[565.8s] the Flag represents our citizenship the
[568.4s] flag showcases the country or perhaps
[570.8s] the kingdom that we are part of and that
[573.8s] I pray is the Heavenly Kingdom God has
[577.4s] the world the world in his hands and
[580.6s] with just a flicker of a finger that
[582.2s] could change drastically what happens
[585.2s] but here's the thing he wants you fly in
[589.6s] his fly his flag rest in his steadfast
[593.1s] love see Sabbath is a way to do that
[597.0s] Sabbath showcases Your Allegiance
[599.4s] contrary to the rest of the world they
[601.4s] may keep all the other laws but in the
[604.4s] entirety of the law we must also keep
[607.6s] the Sabbath amen amen so God redeems you
[611.2s] and I for in heaven and I think Ellen G
[614.8s] white says it's the most amazing way a
[618.4s] redeemed soul is of surpassing worth
[621.6s] Heaven rejoices when one who was lost
[624.6s] but is now found so God is offering you
[627.4s] an opportunity fly his flag become part
[630.7s] of his Nation by a simple yes and amen
[634.9s] having faith in Christ and God but as we
[638.8s] end the book would we like to have a few
[641.6s] parting shorts what are things that we
[643.8s] want the readers to take home teacher
[646.3s] bismar amen amen I think this book has
[648.9s] been a wonderful read uh throughout the
[651.3s] book entirely you know rest for the
[653.4s] rushed uh set free to obey A Day to
[655.8s] Remember History's Greatest hoax uh and
[658.5s] all the chapters that are there uh one
[661.2s] thing that I have taken from the book is
[663.8s] that God has set aside the Sabbath for
[666.3s] us you know it's really a benefit to us
[668.7s] ladies and gentlemen you know you might
[670.5s] think that it's merely formalism
[672.8s] legalism but there are actual and true
[675.5s] benefits that come from keeping the
[678.5s] Sabbath right actual and true benefits
[680.7s] that come Rejuvenation of your health
[683.6s] wealth and and well-being you know um
[687.1s] time to spend with your family and
[688.9s] mostly importantly time to reconnect
[692.6s] with your creator yes I think in this
[696.0s] chapter I am deeply reminded of a God
[699.9s] who cares a God who loves and the
[702.9s] provision of the Sabbath transcends just
[705.3s] mere rest and Rejuvenation but also
[708.6s] salvation we are granted this amazing
[711.8s] opportunity to dwell with Christ even
[714.5s] when we don't even deserve it if
[716.6s] anything imagine God providing this
[718.7s] seven days work week in which we are
[720.8s] worked and worked and worked but he
[723.4s] wants us to pause to reflect to work on
[726.4s] our spiritual character and so as you
[729.7s] read this book I pray that you too May
[732.1s] learn these amazing gems that we are
[735.3s] called to rest on the Sabbath and rest
[738.3s] in the fact that God truly saves amen
[741.7s] amen in the concluding part of this book
[744.2s] uh there is a personal appeal that cites
[747.2s] the Book of John chapter 1 verse John
[749.7s] chapter 13:1 17 rather um and that says
[753.2s] happy is he who knows these things and
[756.2s] does them and so my prayer for you uh is
[759.3s] that you may find joy in keeping the
[762.2s] Sabbath let's pray dear father in Heaven
[764.8s] oh Lord God we come before you thank you
[767.0s] Father for the opportunity to read this
[769.0s] book and to understand father your
[771.3s] glorious and loving wishes for us in
[773.6s] keeping the Sabbath be with us now keep
[776.1s] us and protect us in Jesus name I pray
[778.8s] amen amen and amen until next time
[782.2s] goodbye
