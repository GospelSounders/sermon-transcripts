FULL TRANSCRIPT:
good morning good afternoon good evening welcome to lesson two the teens's Cornerstone lesson and our title is seeing is believing with a question mark right so we're going to be answering that question is seeing believing or is it not before we begin quick intro from my left all the way to the right hi my name is Silas all right that's Silas um my name is barara MHM it's nice to be part of this panel all right my name is Ariana and I'm Sid okay my name is jonan I'll be moderating this panel but before we begin I'd like to ask barara to for of prayer let's bow our heads for of prayer uh merciful and ever living God thank you for allowing us to meet this moment dear Lord to discuss this lesson I pray for wisdom and understanding that comes from you even as we discuss it Jesus name I pray amen amen amen um seeing is believing is it or is it not what do you guys think before you even begin do do you have to say something to believe or you can just believe without seeing s to some extent I feel like you need to see something for you to believe it you need to see something yeah mhm cuz it's it's like it's like saying oh Jesus has come back and you haven't seen it are you going to believe it well in that case yeah you have to see it you have to see it to believe it all right but in other cases you don't really have to see in order to believe it like we as Christians believe that um God exists and we haven't seen him true true so it's it's sitting on the fence it's 50/50 all right thanks for that um I'd like to ask Silas to open book book of Hebrews 11:1 Hebrews 11:1 and as he's opening this our lesson today is about faith right and uh it's Faith from unofficial some of that was very SE in the government at that time that what we'll be talking about but before we get to that let us really know what is Faith Hebrews 11:1 you can also just flip your Bibles to that verse Silas if you're there you can just read it Hebrews 11:1 says no faith is the substance of things hoped for the evidence of Things Not Seen mhm thank you faith is the substance or the evidence of substance sorry of things hoped for evidence of Things Not Seen faith has been described as taking the next step without seeing the the full staircase if you're walking in a dark place you can't really see but you just keep walking down until you feel you've reached the last step right so that is Faith and uh we always have a fundamental belief that is tying to our lesson our fundamental belief for today is our very first fundamental belief that is the holy scriptures which is where we Bas everything from and believing in the Holy scriptures requires a lot of faith cuz let's be honest the stories that are in the Bible none of us are there to experience them right from the first um actually the whole of Genesis Moses was not there to see all that happened he wasn't there for creation but he wrote it and we believe creation happened in six days right all those things Daniel writes about the Visions he saw but we still believe in it we don't know if that guy was just seeing his own things but we believe that that is how it is right so let's get to our lesson now and uh our lesson today so you can just open your Bibles it's from The Book of John chapter 4 this is just a continuation of what we had in the previous lesson lesson one about the Samaritan woman so that is where our story comes from that's John 4 from verse 46 to 54 but before we get to that there is a picture in our lesson the people say picture is of a thousand words so how many words can you get of this picture what do you guys see what do you guys see Barbara um I see a guy who is lying on the bed mhm and I think think he's sick mhm I also see some medicine and a glass which is empty I assume he has already taken the medicine and he's now resting okay yeah all right thanks for that AR what do you see um I see the man on a phone call and he looks like he's reaching out to someone it's like maybe this guy was saying I was sick and he actually believe that he was sick but now that he's seen that he was actually sick he like oh he's actually sick like I think we need a doctor or someone to come and help him out right interesting perspective okay I didn't think of that Sid what do you see I see a man with a hot water bottle okay yeah so I'm assuming maybe he has a fever or something yeah could be uh-huh and I see a thermometer on the table there oh yeah uh-huh all right um Silas what what can you tell us from that picture bar can just share uh he's he he looks a bit uh worried or the guy on the phone looks a bit worried and the one on the bed looks like uh he's sort of depressed and doesn't know what to do according to his situation all right okay yeah um that's that's the scenario in our lesson set up today so as we get into the lesson uh Silas you can open uh John 4 which is where our lesson comes from John 4:48 to verse 50 and as he's getting that I'd like to ask Barbara to read the flashlight um our flashlight comes from Desire of Ages page 200 it says the nobl man wanted to see the Fulfillment of his prayers before he believe before he should believe but but he had to accept the word of Jesus that his request Was Heard and the blessing granted his lesson this lesson we also have to learn not because we see or feel that God hears us are we to believe we are to trust in his promises mhm when we have asked for his blessings we should believe that we receive it and thank him that we have received it all right thank you for that barabara uh we'll shortly expound on that once we get into the story uh Silas John 4:48 to: 50 that's our key text uh it says then said Jesus unto him except ye see signs and wonders he will not believe the noble saith unto him sir come down and my child die Jesus said unto him go thy way thy son liveth and the man believed the word that Jesus had spoken unto him and he went his way thanks for that so this these two actually tie in the key text and the flashlight it's all a matter of belief we told in the end at the beginning he doubted but in the end he actually believed and his son was actually well so we'll go to the what do you think section and ask to ask S to lead us through that okay so have you ever experienced a trust building activity such as a r challenge course or a trustful or been entrusted to perform a highly responsible job such as babysitting if so write what you have learned through such activities mhm so just to explain to the audience or probably some of us who might not understand what a trustful exercise is this is where you have two people standing facing One Direction one in front of another okay and the person at the front is supposed to fall on their back and Trust the one behind them will hold them right so that's a trust for ex so probably can now get insights from the side yeah start from silus what do you think on over trust trustful exercise what does it take a trustful exercise takes two people the person in front should trust the person behind them to cat them and the person behind should provide reason to be trusted mhm so it's you need to be trusted and you need to trust the person as well yes all right um barara are there some people who if you were to do that exercise with them that you would not trust them enough to hold you if you want to fall back uh technically speaking yes um I'll give an example of my best friend um she's one person who you can trust her in many other aspects of keeping secrets and every other stuff like that but trusting her that when I fall she will pick me up or that she's I'm in front of her and she's behind me and that she'll catch me I don't think I can do that all right yeah she's this person who will just look just move behind and she'll be like ah even though you fall like you know we just have a good love and things move on yeah okay interesting interesting take with that Ariana let's switch it now to babysitting yeah um I'm sure you've had like a newborn baby baby how how is the experience like is it yeah just just how how is it okay so um babies are very delicate beings they've just been born and they have this attachment to the mother that when you want to carry the child the mother would be like okay are are you sure you know are you going to be do you need to sit down you know so they need there they're very cautious because they want to trust that the baby maybe wouldn't fall mhm so I feel like babysitting is a two-way path as Silas said mhm the person who wants me to babysit needs to trust me that I will be able to take care of the child and also I need to give a reason for why they need to they need to they need me to babysit the child so I need to give them a reason why they should trust me yeah yeah all right thanks for that Sid same thing babysitting you have a younger brother how how is the experience with with babysitting and you know trust babysitting children that are like this this small yeah it's it's a difficult task mhm cuz they're very 1 second here one second gone yeah uhhuh so I feel like you you would need trust from the parents then you need to give them reason to trust you true and then you also need to trust yourself that you're going to take care of the child true all right thank for that um so what I'm getting from this is there actually about three three or four parts to the trust so there's one trusting the person who is okay being trustworthy number one trusting the person who's trusting you as well and having that person also trust you and also now trust that in yourself that you have the ability to do do what you're required to do so all those things now combined into one if we were to bring that into Christianity and the aspect of having miracles in our lives do you think the same thing applies yeah I think that uh if you trust that God can do it and you believe before he does it it will happen true thank you for that um we'll actually see that in the story God requires of us to have faith the Bible speaks about um if you ask of these things in my name in faith I will grant them unto you just to paraphrase the verse uh that Christ talks about he was teaching his disciples how to pray the Book of Luke yep so um i' like to ask Ariana to read the did you know section did you know section then we move into the story okay they did you know section on the matter of seeing is believing a classic study conducted decades ago involved testing infants to see whether or not people were born with the fear of falling newly crawling infants were placed one at a time on a table a platform of clear plexiglass formed a bridge to an identical table almost all the little ones refused to crawl across the P plexiglass because the transparent Bridge gave the impression they could fall hm interesting interesting um so so I I think what what I'm getting from that is when we see something we're afraid of we wouldn't trust what is holding us case in point Israelites as they left Egypt they had seen all those 10 Miracles and the the 10 plagues just hit the Egyptians these guys sailed through them like nothing ever happened to them but they get to a point where they're about to cross a Red Sea the Egyptians are behind them despite all that what did they do they panicked they started crying to Moses why do you bring us out of Egypt you're going to die just take us back there or there no enough Graves they forgot all that God had done for them same thing the scenario in the D know section kids can see they are on glass right this is something that's supporting them but they can see below that's that's a place they don't want to fall into so they they stop trusting what is hold what has been holding them up the whole time and I I feel like in our lives you tend to do that a lot you have done your exams Ariana you've had eight papers you sailed through seven of them you're good get to the eighth paper that thing is tough like you know and you start wondering God why then we forget he's LED you through the other seven papers yeah anyway with that let's get to the story so our story comes from John 4 from verse 46 to 54 43 to 54 I'll ask Aran to just give us a a summary of what's happening there okay so um our into the story is a very familiar story with us it's about Jesus when he visited Cana of Galilee and the Roman soldier had a six son in cap and he begged for Jesus to go and heal his son but Jesus asked him unless you people see signs and wonders you will never believe and the Roman soldier said sir please get down and heal my son and Jesus said go home your son will leave and the Roman soldier took the word of Jesus and departed and when Jesus was on his way to Judea where he was going um the Servants of the Roman soldier approached Jesus and told him that the Roman soldier's son was actually healed and when the Roman soldier um reached home and he realized that the minute that Jesus said that his son will live is the minute that he got healed and that made the whole household to believe in the works of Jesus Amen thank you for that thank you for that um just to add on to that I said said out of the story section if you just go to it there's a a short paragraph there before we answer some of the questions there could you kindly read that for us out of the story there's the first paragraph there upon asking that his child be healed the Royal officer or the RO official took Jesus at his word and left for whom believing that he had healed his son this is a change from his wanting to see wanting to see the Fulfillment of his prayer before he should believe yeah so Ellen White actually expounds on what really happened okay so from where Jesus was in Cana to capernum where the the Roman official lived it was about a 5 to 6 hour journey home whether I don't if it's on foot or on horse but it took 5 to 6 hours and it was around that's the 7th hour that's around 1:00 p.m. when Jesus healed the son so eleno takes pounds and says that the soldier did not run home immediately Jesus said that he actually waited until he went home the next day that is when the servant told him your son is healed that takes a lot of faith but that was not the faith the soldier had at the very beginning so there's a question here why do you think the official came to see Jesus in the first place Romans had the best of doctors yeah there are actually some hubs that the Romans used in that time that healed diseases that were so complex that right now we we cannot heal the same diseases because the Romans finished those hubs in that time you can go confirm that fact so why do you think instead of going to doctors he came to see Jesus a Jew the guy who I mean someone from the you know the the country they had colonized Barbara why do you think he came to see Jesus um so I'd say that he came to see Jesus because probably or somehow through some n he heard about Jesus turning the water into wine so he was just like ah if this guy can turn water into wine so there's a probability that he can heal my son but also we can also say that maybe he was also trying to test Jesus or something like that because like he's someone who doesn't have the faith and doesn't believe in it because as we can see from the text he he wanted to see the Fulfillment of his n so that he can believe that Jesus is truly God's child or the Messiah that has been sent and so that he could believe so I think in as much as he came to seek for the healing of his son I think he also came to test Jesus in some way or another true I actually agree with you thank you for that um so if we can go back a bit that's uh John chapter 4 I'll ask Silas to read that John chapter 4 we can read uh from verse 39 to 42 just to get how he heard about Jesus that's John 439 and 42 that's the few verses before our story silus it says and many of the Samaritans of that City believed on him for the saying of the old woman which testified he told me all that I ever did and verse 42 says and said unto the woman now we believe not because of thy saying for we have heard him ourselves and know that this is indeed the Christ the savior of the world mhm so from that we can see the people of that City believed in Jesus why because they actually saw him so as much as they had experienced Jesus they still had that human aspect of I have to see to believe and that is the same thing the Centurion um I mean the Roman soldier had he had heard about Jesus but he had to come see if it's really true so as you're saying he was testing Jesus so when he came he had doubts and this is why people came to Jesus just to have their needs met so that they can see they'll trust him do you think we do the same in our in our time right now now do you think we give conditions to God yeah we we tell God uh god um I believe in you I believe you can do something but God just give me an A in this exam right so we wait to see if I get the air I'm like ah God is trustworthy all right so I can trust him with more we tend to do that a lot but this Roman soldier realized it's not all about getting what I want first before I believe Jesus so the next question right what do you think cost his changed view why do you think he decided to trust Jesus after all that said why do you think he decid trust Jesus at the very beginning he wanted Jesus to follow him home but then he was like you know you can just say a word and my son will be healed what do you think caused that change of heart he to tie that to a trustful exercise he wanted to how do I put this so if he if he had he had followed Jesus back to his place mhm I feel like he would have like maybe an excuse maybe oh um I was tired I couldn't heal him so in his head he was like okay I could tell him he heals my child from here mhm then if that doesn't work and he doesn't have an excuse I can have now him sent for him and tell him to come here I I'm not so sure that's what I think all right I I get your point uhhuh okay I think uh there were two reasons he did that all right the first reason would be that he was testing Jesus and testing him for his own word mhm at first but before he met Jesus he didn't necessarily believe but after meeting Jesus maybe from how Jesus spoke to him he he had a reason to believe that his word could actually be true all right thank you for that I think I could just try to add on that like in from into the story or from the verse that the story comes from we see that Jesus says unless you people see signs and wonders only will you believe right so I think he he was like why why don't I take him for his word why why why do I have to put a condition to me believing in him MH yeah all right true true I agree um so when Jesus prompted that you don't necessarily have to see to believe that's when he decided there is actually another aspect to this yeah and just to bring that home now to our current world in Matthew 24 Christ talked about there will be false Christ and false prophets people who will perform many miracles and wonders to try to deceive even the very elect guys who understand God's word and as human beings being people who we more of I have to see to believe many people are going to fall for that right so this is just to wrap it up it takes a lot for us to trust Jesus take him at his word yeah so many miracles Christ did actually all the Miracles Christ did required an amount of faith in the people take an example of jy's daughter she was sick when J went to see Jesus but by the time they going home when they're getting home what had happened happened she had died but Christ required Faith from the father that's gyus for the daughter to be alive another example is Lazarus when Christ called Lazarus out of the Grave when he went there first he met the sisters the sisters were doubting he's been dead for 4 days this Four 3 days 4 days yes he's been dead for 4 days can he even come up again but Christ told him I am the resur ction sorry and the life whosoever Believes In Me they will have life and it took the faith of the sisters for Lazarus to be alive so question to us there's probably a miracle in someone's life that is dependent on your faith I ever come to think of it that way there's someone who you're praying for or a family member who's relying on your prayers and your faith for their prayer to be answered so just trust in God that's all it requires of us so as we finish up as we finish up I like us to read um okay John 20 verse 25 that's in the punch lines Ariana can read that for us John 20:25 it says so the other disciples told him we have seen the Lord but he he said to them unless I see the nail marks in his hands and put my finger where the nails were and put my hand into his side I will not believe mhm these are the disciples who with Jesus for 3 years but still could not believe without seeing yeah so it's a human thing we might we might be with God for the longest time in our lives as as Christians but it takes a lot for us to trust in God without actually um seeing what he's going to do so to finish uh further Insight Barra you can read that for us further insight um when we have asked for his Blessing we should believe that we receive it and thank him that we have received it then we are to go about our duties assured that the blessing will be realized when we need it most thank you we just need to believe um let me just give a final lastation as we close up in our world right now we people no longer believe in things that are completely absolute things that are set on Stone we always try to find a a caveat to things or just a way to just maneuver around for example when When We Were Young we knew if it's a red light in the traffic it means stop but this days it's more of stop but if there's no traffic I can go or if there's no police officer I can still go right but the only true and sure thing that we can always rely on 100% is the word of God and that is the only way we can grow our faith in God human as we are so this is just a call to us all spend some time this week reading the word of God to just build your faith and your trust in him thank you so much my panelist for guiding us through this lesson today and thank you VI for joining us any parting remarks as we close up um all I'd say is all you need to do is trust in God and he will see you through all the Troubles of this Earth amen just trust in God that's all it takes anyone anything on this side um I think my parting remark will be that um we need to um take Jesus for his word and believe that whatever we have asked him he will surely give us no matter how long it takes even if we don't receive it I am we should believe that he is planning something greater and more better for us amen him te so sweet to trust in Jesus just to take him at his word that is all it takes thank you so much i' like to ask um s prayed silus to off a word of prayer as we finish up let's pray Our Father above in heaven we thank you for this day we thank you for your love and your care we thank you for teaching us this day that we need to believe in you that you will give us what we ask for and you have our best interest at heart we thank you for this day in Jesus name we pray amen amen

[39.3s] I'll be moderating this panel but before
[41.2s] we begin I'd like to ask barara to for
[43.1s] of prayer let's bow our heads for of
[46.0s] prayer uh merciful and ever living God

[65.0s] seeing is
[66.6s] believing is it or is it
[68.9s] not what do you guys think before you
[71.1s] even begin do do you have to say
[73.6s] something to believe or you can just
[75.4s] believe without seeing s to some extent
[78.4s] I feel like you need to see something
[81.4s] for you to believe it you need to see
[83.5s] something yeah mhm cuz it's it's like
[86.8s] it's like saying oh Jesus has come back
[89.4s] and you haven't seen it are you going to
[90.8s] believe it well in that case yeah you
[92.4s] have to see it you have to see it to
[93.9s] believe it all right but in other cases
[96.2s] you don't really have to see in order to
[99.5s] believe it like we as Christians believe
[104.6s] that um God exists and we haven't seen
[108.5s] him true true so it's it's sitting on
[112.8s] the fence it's 50/50 all right thanks
[114.9s] for that um I'd like to ask Silas to
[119.1s] open book book of Hebrews
[121.3s] 11:1 Hebrews
[123.3s] 11:1 and as he's opening this our lesson
[127.2s] today is
[128.5s] about faith right and uh it's Faith from
[133.6s] unofficial some of that was very SE in
[135.4s] the government at that time that what
[137.3s] we'll be talking about but before we get
[138.9s] to that let us really know what is Faith
[141.4s] Hebrews 11:1 you can also just flip your
[144.0s] Bibles to that verse Silas if you're
[147.4s] there you can just read it Hebrews 11:1
[150.0s] says no faith is the substance of things
[153.0s] hoped for the evidence of Things Not
[155.6s] Seen mhm thank you faith is the
[159.3s] substance or the evidence of substance
[162.4s] sorry of things hoped for evidence of
[164.5s] Things Not Seen faith has been described
[167.4s] as taking the next step without seeing
[170.1s] the the full staircase if you're walking
[172.3s] in a dark place you can't really see but
[175.2s] you just keep walking down until you
[176.6s] feel you've reached the last step right
[179.8s] so that is Faith and uh we always have a
[182.4s] fundamental belief that is tying to our
[184.3s] lesson our fundamental belief for today
[187.2s] is our very first fundamental belief
[189.9s] that is the holy scriptures which is
[192.1s] where we Bas everything from and
[195.4s] believing in the Holy scriptures
[196.9s] requires a lot of faith cuz let's be
[199.8s] honest the stories that are in the Bible
[203.0s] none of us are there to experience them
[205.1s] right from the first um actually the
[208.0s] whole of Genesis
[210.0s] Moses was not there to see all that
[211.8s] happened he wasn't there for creation
[213.8s] but he wrote it and we believe creation
[215.6s] happened in six days right all those
[217.6s] things Daniel writes about the Visions
[220.5s] he saw but we still believe in it we
[224.1s] don't know if that guy was just seeing
[225.4s] his own things but we believe that that
[227.4s] is how it is right so let's get to our
[230.4s] lesson
[231.5s] now and uh our lesson today so you can
[235.0s] just open your Bibles it's from The Book
[236.7s] of John chapter 4 this is just a
[239.8s] continuation of what we had in the
[241.6s] previous lesson lesson one about the
[243.6s] Samaritan woman so that is where our
[245.9s] story comes from that's John 4 from
[248.0s] verse 46 to 54 but before we get to that
[251.5s] there is a picture in our lesson the
[254.3s] people say picture is of a thousand
[256.1s] words so how many words can you get of
[258.4s] this picture what do you guys see what
[260.8s] do you guys
[262.4s] see Barbara um I see a guy who is lying
[268.0s] on the bed mhm and I think think he's
[270.4s] sick mhm I also see some medicine and a
[276.5s] glass which is empty I assume he has
[280.1s] already taken the medicine and he's now
[282.9s] resting okay yeah all right thanks for
[285.0s] that AR what do you
[287.1s] see
[288.8s] um I see the man on a phone call and he
[292.8s] looks like he's reaching out to someone
[295.4s] it's
[296.3s] like maybe this guy was saying I was
[298.7s] sick and he actually believe that he was
[300.6s] sick but now that he's seen that he was
[302.3s] actually sick he like oh he's actually
[304.6s] sick like I think we need a doctor or
[306.9s] someone to come and help him out right
[308.7s] interesting perspective okay I didn't
[310.2s] think of that Sid what do you see I see
[312.3s] a man with a hot water
[316.4s] bottle okay yeah so I'm assuming maybe
[319.6s] he has a fever or something yeah could
[322.4s] be uh-huh and I see a thermometer on the
[326.1s] table there oh yeah uh-huh all right um
[330.2s] Silas what what can you tell us from
[331.9s] that picture bar can just share uh he's
[335.7s] he he looks a bit uh worried or the guy
[339.6s] on the phone looks a bit worried and the
[341.5s] one on the bed looks like uh he's sort
[344.8s] of depressed and doesn't know what to
[347.8s] do according to his situation all right
[351.7s] okay yeah um that's that's the scenario
[354.4s] in our lesson set up today so as we get
[357.0s] into the lesson uh Silas you can open uh
[359.9s] John 4 which is where our lesson comes
[362.2s] from John 4:48 to verse 50 and as he's
[367.2s] getting that I'd like to ask Barbara to
[369.2s] read the
[370.4s] flashlight
[372.3s] um our flashlight comes from Desire of
[376.0s] Ages page 200 it says the nobl man
[380.1s] wanted to see the Fulfillment of his
[382.4s] prayers before he
[384.3s] believe before he should believe but but
[387.8s] he had to accept the word of Jesus that
[390.7s] his request Was Heard and the blessing
[392.9s] granted his
[394.9s] lesson this lesson we also have to learn
[399.0s] not because we see or feel that God
[401.6s] hears us are we to believe we are to
[405.4s] trust in his promises mhm when we have
[408.8s] asked for his blessings we should
[411.2s] believe that we receive it and thank him
[414.2s] that we have received it all right thank
[416.5s] you for that barabara uh we'll shortly
[418.8s] expound on that once we get into the
[420.6s] story uh Silas John 4:48 to: 50 that's
[425.3s] our key
[427.2s] text uh it
[429.4s] says then said Jesus unto him except ye
[434.1s] see signs and wonders he will not
[436.6s] believe the noble saith unto him sir
[440.4s] come down and my child die Jesus said
[443.8s] unto him go thy way thy son liveth and
[447.1s] the man believed the word that Jesus had
[449.2s] spoken
[450.2s] unto him and he went his way thanks for
[454.2s] that so this these two actually tie in
[457.1s] the key text and the flashlight it's all
[459.4s] a matter of belief we told in the end at
[462.0s] the beginning he doubted but in the end
[464.0s] he actually believed and his son was
[465.3s] actually well so we'll go to the what do
[467.6s] you think section and ask to ask S to
[469.6s] lead us through that okay so have you
[471.4s] ever experienced a trust building
[473.6s] activity such as a r challenge course or
[476.0s] a trustful or been entrusted to perform
[478.8s] a highly responsible job such as
[481.9s] babysitting if so write what you have
[484.4s] learned through such activities mhm so
[488.2s] just to explain to the audience or
[490.0s] probably some of us who might not
[491.4s] understand what a trustful exercise is
[494.3s] this is where you have two people
[497.0s] standing facing One Direction one in
[498.8s] front of another okay and the person at
[501.6s] the front is supposed to fall on their
[505.3s] back and Trust the one behind them will
[507.4s] hold them right so that's a trust for ex
[510.2s] so probably can now get insights from
[513.0s] the side yeah start from silus what do
[515.7s] you think on over trust trustful
[518.6s] exercise what does it take a trustful
[521.1s] exercise takes two people the person in
[523.9s] front should trust the person behind
[526.3s] them to cat them and the person behind
[528.8s] should provide reason to be trusted mhm
[532.2s] so it's you need to be trusted and you
[534.8s] need to trust the person as well yes all
[537.2s] right um barara
[540.1s] are there some people who if you were to
[543.4s] do that exercise with them that you
[545.4s] would not trust them enough to hold you
[548.1s] if you want to fall
[550.1s] back uh technically speaking yes um I'll
[554.9s] give an example of my best friend um
[558.1s] she's one person who you can trust her
[560.8s] in many other aspects of keeping secrets
[564.3s] and every other stuff like that but
[566.7s] trusting her that when I fall she will
[569.6s] pick me up or that she's I'm in front of
[572.9s] her and she's behind me and that she'll
[574.5s] catch me I don't think I can do that all
[576.9s] right yeah she's this person who will
[579.0s] just look just move behind and she'll be
[582.1s] like ah even though you fall like you
[584.4s] know we just have a good love and things
[587.0s] move on yeah okay interesting
[589.0s] interesting take with that Ariana let's
[591.4s] switch it now to
[593.8s] babysitting yeah um I'm sure you've had
[598.5s] like a newborn baby baby how how is the
[600.5s] experience like is it yeah just just how
[603.8s] how is it okay so um babies are very
[608.1s] delicate beings they've just been born
[610.5s] and they have this attachment to the
[612.5s] mother that when you want to carry the
[615.0s] child the mother would be like okay are
[617.4s] are you sure you know are you going to
[619.6s] be do you need to sit down you know so
[621.6s] they need there they're very cautious
[624.5s] because they want to trust that the baby
[627.5s] maybe wouldn't fall mhm
[630.0s] so I feel like babysitting is a two-way
[634.0s] path as Silas said mhm the person who
[637.4s] wants me to babysit needs to trust me
[640.3s] that I will be able to take care of the
[642.5s] child and also I need to give a reason
[644.6s] for why they need to they need to they
[647.8s] need me to babysit the child so I need
[650.4s] to give them a reason why they should
[652.2s] trust me yeah yeah all right thanks for
[654.6s] that Sid same thing babysitting you have
[657.0s] a younger brother how how is the
[658.6s] experience with with babysitting and you
[660.6s] know
[662.3s] trust babysitting children that are like
[666.1s] this this small yeah it's it's a
[670.0s] difficult task mhm cuz they're
[673.3s] very 1 second here one second gone yeah
[677.2s] uhhuh so I feel like you you would need
[681.9s] trust from the parents then you need to
[687.3s] give them reason to trust you true
[689.8s] and then you also need to trust yourself
[691.6s] that you're going to take care of the
[693.1s] child true all right thank for that um
[697.3s] so what I'm getting from this is there
[700.1s] actually about three three or four parts
[702.4s] to the trust so there's one trusting the
[705.0s] person who is okay being trustworthy
[708.6s] number one trusting the person who's
[710.8s] trusting you as well and having that
[713.1s] person also trust you and also now trust
[716.3s] that in yourself that you have the
[718.7s] ability to do do what you're required to
[720.2s] do so all those things now combined into
[723.1s] one if we were to bring that into
[725.5s] Christianity and the aspect of having
[727.7s] miracles in our lives do you think the
[729.9s] same thing
[732.8s] applies yeah I think that uh if you
[737.1s] trust that God can do it and you believe
[740.2s] before he does it it will happen true
[743.0s] thank you for that um we'll actually see
[745.0s] that in the story God requires of us to
[747.7s] have faith the Bible speaks about um if
[752.2s] you ask of these things in my name in
[754.7s] faith I will grant them unto you just to
[756.6s] paraphrase the verse uh that Christ
[758.7s] talks about he was teaching his
[760.1s] disciples how to pray the Book of Luke
[763.1s] yep so um i' like to ask Ariana to read
[766.9s] the did you know section did you know
[769.4s] section then we move into the
[771.6s] story okay they did you know section on
[774.6s] the matter of seeing is believing a
[776.8s] classic study conducted decades ago
[779.6s] involved testing infants to see whether
[782.0s] or not people were born with the fear of
[784.8s] falling newly crawling infants were
[787.7s] placed one at a time on a table a
[790.4s] platform of clear plexiglass formed a
[793.9s] bridge to an identical table almost all
[797.1s] the little ones refused to crawl across
[799.0s] the P plexiglass because the transparent
[802.5s] Bridge gave the impression they could
[804.5s] fall hm interesting interesting um so so
[809.3s] I I think what what I'm getting from
[810.9s] that is when we see something we're
[813.7s] afraid of we wouldn't trust what is
[815.9s] holding
[817.2s] us case in point Israelites as they left
[822.2s] Egypt they had seen all those 10
[824.2s] Miracles and the the 10 plagues just hit
[826.8s] the Egyptians these guys sailed through
[829.7s] them like nothing ever happened to them
[832.9s] but they get to a point
[834.9s] where they're about to cross a Red Sea
[838.0s] the Egyptians are behind them
[840.6s] despite all that what did they
[842.5s] do they panicked they started crying to
[845.6s] Moses why do you bring us out of Egypt
[848.1s] you're going to die just take us back
[850.3s] there or there no enough Graves they
[852.5s] forgot all that God had done for them
[855.2s] same thing the scenario in the D know
[857.2s] section kids can see they are on glass
[861.0s] right this is something that's
[862.0s] supporting them but they can see below
[865.1s] that's that's a place they don't want to
[866.4s] fall
[867.6s] into so they they stop trusting what is
[870.3s] hold what has been holding them up the
[871.8s] whole
[872.6s] time and I I feel like in our lives you
[875.0s] tend to do that a
[876.3s] lot you have done your exams Ariana
[880.9s] you've had eight papers you sailed
[883.1s] through seven of them you're good get to
[885.4s] the eighth paper that thing is tough
[888.2s] like you know and you start wondering
[891.2s] God
[892.2s] why then we forget he's LED you through
[894.9s] the other seven papers yeah anyway with
[898.4s] that let's get to the story so our story
[901.1s] comes from John 4 from verse 46 to 54 43
[909.7s] to 54 I'll ask Aran to just give us a a
[912.4s] summary of what's happening there okay
[915.0s] so um our into the story is a very
[918.8s] familiar story with us it's about Jesus
[922.4s] when he visited Cana of Galilee and the
[925.6s] Roman soldier had a six son in cap
[929.7s] and he begged for Jesus to go and heal
[932.0s] his son but Jesus asked him unless you
[935.7s] people see signs and wonders you will
[938.3s] never believe and the Roman soldier said
[941.4s] sir please get down and heal my son and
[944.4s] Jesus said go home your son will leave
[948.7s] and the Roman soldier took the word of
[951.0s] Jesus and departed and when Jesus was on
[954.6s] his way to Judea where he was going um
[959.2s] the Servants of the Roman soldier
[961.2s] approached Jesus and told him that the
[963.9s] Roman soldier's son was actually healed
[967.3s] and when the Roman soldier um reached
[970.8s] home and he realized that the minute
[972.5s] that Jesus said that his son will live
[974.6s] is the minute that he got healed and
[977.1s] that made the whole household to believe
[980.5s] in the works of Jesus Amen thank you for
[984.1s] that thank you for that um just to add
[987.4s] on to that I said said out of the story
[990.4s] section if you just go to it there's a a
[993.1s] short paragraph there before we answer
[994.7s] some of the questions there could you
[996.2s] kindly read that for us out of the story
[998.2s] there's the first paragraph there upon
[1001.2s] asking that his child be healed the
[1003.8s] Royal officer or the RO official took
[1007.4s] Jesus at his word and left for whom
[1010.4s] believing that he had healed his son
[1013.0s] this is a change from his wanting to see
[1016.2s] wanting to see the Fulfillment of his
[1018.1s] prayer before he should
[1021.4s] believe yeah so Ellen White actually
[1024.2s] expounds on what really happened okay so
[1027.7s] from where Jesus was in Cana to capernum
[1031.3s] where the the Roman official lived it
[1034.7s] was about a 5 to 6 hour journey home
[1038.3s] whether I don't if it's on foot or on
[1040.3s] horse but it took 5 to 6 hours and it
[1043.5s] was around that's the 7th hour that's
[1046.4s] around 1:00 p.m. when Jesus healed the
[1049.0s] son so eleno takes pounds and says that
[1053.4s] the soldier did not run home immediately
[1055.2s] Jesus said that he actually waited until
[1058.7s] he went home the next day that is when
[1061.6s] the servant told him your son is healed
[1063.9s] that takes a lot of faith but that was
[1066.2s] not the faith the soldier had at the
[1068.2s] very beginning so there's a question
[1070.5s] here why do you think the official came
[1073.0s] to see Jesus in the first
[1075.0s] place Romans had the best of
[1077.6s] doctors yeah there are actually some
[1080.0s] hubs that the Romans used in that time
[1082.4s] that healed diseases that were so
[1084.5s] complex that right now we we cannot heal
[1087.0s] the same diseases because the Romans
[1088.5s] finished those hubs in that time you can
[1090.3s] go confirm that fact so why do you think
[1092.5s] instead of going to doctors he came to
[1094.6s] see Jesus a Jew the guy who I mean
[1098.0s] someone from the you know the the
[1100.0s] country they had colonized Barbara why
[1102.1s] do you think he came to see Jesus um so
[1105.4s] I'd say that he came to see Jesus
[1108.1s] because probably or somehow through some
[1112.0s] n he heard about Jesus turning the water
[1114.5s] into wine so he was just like ah if this
[1117.9s] guy can turn water into wine so there's
[1120.4s] a probability that he can heal my son
[1123.2s] but also we can also say that maybe he
[1126.6s] was also trying to test Jesus or
[1128.9s] something like that because like he's
[1131.9s] someone who doesn't have the faith and
[1135.6s] doesn't believe in it because as we can
[1138.2s] see from the text he he wanted to see
[1141.9s] the Fulfillment of his n so that he can
[1145.4s] believe that Jesus is truly God's child
[1150.8s] or the Messiah that has been sent and so
[1153.8s] that he could believe so I think in as
[1156.6s] much as he came to seek for the healing
[1160.2s] of his son I think he also came to test
[1164.2s] Jesus in some way or another true I
[1166.4s] actually agree with you thank you for
[1167.8s] that um so if we can go back a bit
[1172.0s] that's uh John chapter 4 I'll ask Silas
[1174.6s] to read that John chapter 4 we can read
[1178.4s] uh from verse 39 to 42 just to get how
[1182.1s] he heard about Jesus that's John 439 and
[1185.4s] 42 that's the few verses before our
[1188.4s] story silus it says and many of the
[1191.7s] Samaritans of that City believed on him
[1194.8s] for the saying of the old woman which
[1197.4s] testified he told me all that I ever did
[1202.2s] and verse 42 says and said unto the
[1205.5s] woman now we believe not because of thy
[1208.4s] saying for we have heard him ourselves
[1211.0s] and know that this is indeed the Christ
[1213.4s] the savior of the world mhm so from that
[1216.7s] we can see the people of that City
[1219.8s] believed in Jesus why because they
[1222.8s] actually saw
[1224.0s] him so as much as they had experienced
[1226.8s] Jesus they still had that human aspect
[1229.2s] of I have to see to believe and that is
[1232.2s] the same thing the Centurion um I mean
[1234.6s] the Roman soldier had he had heard about
[1237.2s] Jesus but he had to come see if it's
[1240.1s] really true so as you're saying he was
[1242.2s] testing Jesus so when he came he had
[1245.0s] doubts and this is
[1247.9s] why people came to Jesus just to have
[1251.4s] their needs met so that they can see
[1254.0s] they'll trust
[1255.7s] him do you think we do the same in our
[1257.9s] in our time right now now do you think
[1260.0s] we give conditions to God yeah we we
[1263.3s] tell God uh
[1264.9s] god um I believe in you I believe you
[1268.1s] can do something but God just give me an
[1270.5s] A in this exam right so we wait to see
[1275.8s] if I get the air I'm like ah God is
[1277.4s] trustworthy all right so I can trust him
[1279.2s] with more we tend to do that a lot
[1283.2s] but this Roman soldier realized it's not
[1287.5s] all about getting what I want first
[1290.2s] before I believe Jesus so the next
[1292.8s] question right what do you think cost
[1296.3s] his changed view why do you think he
[1299.2s] decided to trust Jesus after all
[1302.3s] that said why do you think he decid
[1304.8s] trust
[1306.0s] Jesus at the very beginning he wanted
[1308.4s] Jesus to follow him home but then he was
[1310.8s] like you know you can just say a word
[1313.8s] and my son will be healed what do you
[1315.6s] think caused that change of heart
[1318.9s] he to tie that to a trustful exercise he
[1321.4s] wanted
[1322.4s] to how do I put this so if he if he
[1327.2s] had he had followed Jesus back to his
[1332.2s] place
[1333.4s] mhm I feel like he would have like maybe
[1338.8s] an excuse maybe oh um I was tired I
[1342.3s] couldn't heal him so in his head he was
[1345.5s] like okay I could tell him he heals my
[1348.3s] child from here mhm then if that doesn't
[1352.8s] work and he doesn't have an excuse I can
[1355.6s] have now him sent for him and tell him
[1358.8s] to come
[1360.3s] here I I'm not so sure that's what I
[1363.1s] think all right I I get your point uhhuh
[1365.8s] okay I think uh there were two reasons
[1368.5s] he did that all right the first reason
[1370.7s] would be that he was testing Jesus and
[1375.3s] testing him for his own word mhm at
[1378.6s] first but before he met Jesus he didn't
[1383.3s] necessarily believe but after meeting
[1387.4s] Jesus maybe from how Jesus spoke to him
[1391.4s] he he had a reason to believe that his
[1395.3s] word could actually be true all right
[1397.9s] thank you for that I think I could just
[1400.2s] try to add on that like in from into the
[1403.9s] story or from the verse that the story
[1406.3s] comes from we see that Jesus says unless
[1410.0s] you people see signs and wonders only
[1414.2s] will you believe right so I think he he
[1417.4s] was like why why don't I take him for
[1420.2s] his word why why why do I have to put a
[1423.9s] condition to me believing in him MH yeah
[1428.7s] all right true true I agree um so when
[1432.3s] Jesus prompted that you don't
[1434.5s] necessarily have to see to believe
[1436.4s] that's when he decided there is actually
[1438.6s] another aspect to this yeah and just to
[1442.4s] bring that home now to our current world
[1445.3s] in Matthew 24 Christ talked about there
[1448.0s] will be false Christ and false prophets
[1450.0s] people who will perform many miracles
[1451.6s] and wonders to try to deceive even the
[1454.0s] very elect guys who understand God's
[1457.3s] word and as human beings being people
[1460.9s] who we more of I have to see to believe
[1464.4s] many people are going to fall for that
[1466.8s] right so
[1468.9s] this is just to wrap it
[1471.2s] up it takes a lot for us to trust Jesus
[1476.4s] take him at his
[1478.3s] word yeah so many miracles Christ did
[1482.7s] actually all the Miracles Christ did
[1484.7s] required an amount of faith in the
[1488.0s] people take an example of jy's daughter
[1491.7s] she was
[1492.7s] sick when J went to see Jesus but by the
[1496.0s] time they going home when they're
[1497.3s] getting home what had happened happened
[1499.3s] she had died but Christ required Faith
[1504.2s] from the father that's gyus for the
[1507.1s] daughter to be
[1508.5s] alive another example is Lazarus when
[1511.5s] Christ called Lazarus out of the Grave
[1513.4s] when he went there first he met the
[1515.3s] sisters the sisters were doubting he's
[1517.2s] been dead for 4 days this Four 3 days 4
[1520.9s] days yes he's been dead for 4 days can
[1523.0s] he even come up again but Christ told
[1525.9s] him I am the resur ction sorry and the
[1529.3s] life whosoever Believes In Me they will
[1532.0s] have life and it took the faith of the
[1535.2s] sisters for Lazarus to be alive so
[1538.7s] question to us there's probably a
[1541.2s] miracle in someone's life that is
[1543.3s] dependent on your faith I ever come to
[1546.1s] think of it that way there's someone who
[1548.7s] you're praying for or a family member
[1550.8s] who's relying on your prayers and your
[1553.0s] faith for their prayer to be
[1556.4s] answered so just trust in God that's all
[1560.2s] it requires of us so as we finish up as
[1564.0s] we finish up I like us to read
[1567.2s] um okay John 20 verse 25 that's in the
[1571.4s] punch lines Ariana can read that for
[1573.7s] us John 20:25 it says so the other
[1578.2s] disciples told him we have seen the Lord
[1581.2s] but he he said to them unless I see the
[1583.9s] nail marks in his hands and put my
[1586.3s] finger where the nails were and put my
[1588.9s] hand into his side I will not believe
[1592.2s] mhm these are the disciples who with
[1594.4s] Jesus for 3 years but still could not
[1597.3s] believe without seeing yeah so it's a
[1599.9s] human thing we might we might be with
[1602.7s] God for the longest time in our lives as
[1604.7s] as Christians but it takes a lot for us
[1607.7s] to trust in God without actually um
[1610.6s] seeing what he's going to do so to
[1613.4s] finish uh further Insight Barra you can
[1616.0s] read that for us further insight um when
[1619.3s] we have asked for his Blessing we should
[1622.3s] believe that we receive it and thank him
[1624.9s] that we have received it then we are to
[1628.5s] go about our duties assured that the
[1631.6s] blessing will be realized when we need
[1634.4s] it most thank
[1637.0s] you we just need to
[1639.6s] believe um let me just give a final
[1642.1s] lastation as we close up in our world
[1645.5s] right now we people no longer believe in
[1648.5s] things that are completely absolute
[1650.0s] things that are set on Stone we always
[1651.5s] try to find a a caveat to things or just
[1654.4s] a way to just maneuver around for
[1657.5s] example when When We Were Young we knew
[1660.3s] if it's a red light in the traffic it
[1662.1s] means stop but this days it's more of
[1665.9s] stop but if there's no traffic I can go
[1669.0s] or if there's no police officer I can
[1670.4s] still go right but the only true and
[1673.5s] sure thing that we can always rely on
[1676.0s] 100% is the word of God
[1678.9s] and that is the only way we can grow our
[1680.4s] faith in God human as we are so this is
[1683.5s] just a call to us all spend some time

[1689.2s] just build your faith and your trust in

[1700.6s] remarks as we close up

[1711.9s] Troubles of this Earth amen just trust
[1715.0s] in God that's all it takes anyone
[1717.4s] anything on this side um I think my
[1720.8s] parting remark will be that um we need
[1725.3s] to um take Jesus for his word and
[1729.6s] believe that whatever we have asked him
[1732.0s] he will surely give us no matter how
[1733.8s] long it takes even if we don't receive
[1736.4s] it I am we should believe that he is
[1739.2s] planning something greater and more
[1741.5s] better for us amen him te so sweet to
[1744.6s] trust in Jesus just to take him at his
[1748.2s] word that is all it takes thank you so
