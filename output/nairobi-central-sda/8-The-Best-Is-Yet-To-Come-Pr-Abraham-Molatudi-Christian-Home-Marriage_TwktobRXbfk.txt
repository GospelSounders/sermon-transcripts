FULL TRANSCRIPT:
I take this time to greet you all in the wonderful name of our Lord and Savior Jesus amen we have had a wonderful time um with the church but in particular me and my wife H have had a wonderful time here in Nairobi Central Church and uh Kenya in general we are we are ending this week of prayer and uh today and tomorrow we will be on our way to South Africa I cannot wait to see my grandchildren particularly my grandson I've got a 5-year-old grandson and some time back I was sent a a a video of my grand son while they were watching TV uh it was him the little sister and his parents and in the middle of just that TV program I am told they took a video and they sent it to me and then he he stood in front of the of the video I mean of the TV and he said stop now everybody stop I'm going to preach preach he's five and after preaching and then he said do I sound like grandpa I can't wait to see him so so um I've had a wonderful time thanks to the pastors thanks to the elders thanks to the Family Life Council thanks to the church at large thanks thanks to the catering team thanks to each one of you you've made it a lot easier for us to be here for this entire week um I'm I'm I'm a person who gets homesick easily but I can tell you that this 10 days I've not missed home much and probably I will realize when I get home how much I missed it but for now I'm I've been I've been been good I draw your attention to John Chapter 2 John Chapter 2 John Chapter 2 his mother said to the servants do whatever he tells you to do do whatever he tells you to do may the good Lord add a blessing to the reading of his word in Jesus name let everybody say Amen your heads are bow and your eyes are closed our God and our father into your hands I commit myself this morning in Jesus name amen there was a wedding in Cara of Galilee now the wedding in Cara of Galilee was a very big wedding now weddings in those days were big festivities Bible scholars tell us that these festivities lasted for many days sometimes they would take a week other times they would take two weeks sometimes they would run up to a month but they were big events there was no private wedding those days so neighbors were invited The Village was invited and family members would be invited to the wedding and so you can imagine there would be a lot of people in that wedding and so the Bible says there was a wedding in kind of Galilee and Not only was there a wedding in Cara of Galilee the Bible specifies when you read that chapter that Jesus and his disciples were invited to that way now I have read a commentary some time back it says Jesus was invited in his capacity as a family member to that wedding and and and you pick that up that you picked that up that Jesus was a family member there by Mary's role in that wedding that is Mary the mother of Jesus Christ so the Bible says so they came to that wedding in do a big thing now I want to say something just before I move on please weddings must not be a private Affair the reason why weddings must not be a private Affair it is because weddings need Witnesses there's a reason why we need Witnesses when you have witnesses to your wedding we are going to make it difficult for you to divorce even if you want to because if you called us to your wedding the day you divorce you must also call us because you can't just call us to your wedding and then when you divorce you do it secretly so those days it was difficult to divorce because when you married everybody was there you couldn't divorce in secret because when you walked in town everybody would be asking you where's your wife and where's your husband so they make your life miserable and so weddings must not be a private matter May weddings must be a family matter must be a community matter you must have Realize by now that I I'm an africanist I I subscribe to African cosmology and African philosophy and I can tell you that in an African setup African cosmology marriage is not a private thing when you marry you not only marry this person that you're getting married to but you marry the family you marrying the entire Village you marry everybody there you marry the cats and the dogs you marry everything that belongs to that family and that's what a a wedding should be so the Bible says and they invited Jesus and Jesus was there and so while they were having those festivities the Bible says they ran out of wine they just ran out of wine reason why they would ran out of wine is because the festivities too long I mean took too long and there were too many people they ran out of wine now I need to make you aware that wine was very important those days particularly when you have festivities wine to a Jewish wedding was what food is to an African wedding you see when Africans come together to a wedding we will come to church here and you will be dressing nicely beautiful white dress and beautiful suit and and and and all those things let me tell you something man when we are sited here looking at that ceremony and the beauty and the steps and the music and all this that and the other what is going on in the African mind while we're sitting here is are we going to eat after this we see all these things but is there food after this and that's what a wedding was like those days are we going to have wine after this and now you can imagine when you run out of wine in the Jewish wedding is like running out of food in an African wedding so they ran out of wine and you can imagine the wedding had to come to an end by virtue of the wine having run out fortunately there was Mary there the Bible says and so Mary went to Jesus Christ her son now by that time Jesus Christ was with his disciples and by the way by the time Jesus Christ left home he didn't have any disciples but Mary Miss Jesus Christ for the first time after Jesus had been tempted on on the mountain for the first time she sees her sign walking with disciples and so the Bible says then she went to him and said they have run out of wine and then Jesus says so what is that got to do with me my time has not come and then Mary did not entertain that response but turn to the other people that were there and said to this people whatever he tells you to do that you must do so the Bible says there were gallons there or containers rather of water that the Jews used for ceremonial washing and Jesus said to those who were standing there now F these containers with water and they filled the containers with water after filling the containers with water and then Jesus said now you can draw from these containers and then you can take to the master of the banquet and then they took that to the must of the banquet and the must of the banquet tasted this water that had been turned into wine and realized that the wine that he was drinking was different from the wine he had been drinking through other festivities then he went to the groom and he said to the groom you've done something that is not ordinarily done in our weddings what you have done is or what is generally done is the groom will give out the best wine first and when people have had enough to drink then he will bring out the bad wine after but you have saved the best for last and I'm here this morning to tell you that the Best Is Yet To Come The Best Is Yet To Come Now I want to tell you that we've been talking about marriages and relationships we've been talking about family and sometimes the danger that we find ourselves in is to predicate our relationships and our marriages and our families we found these on the wines of this world I can tell you right now that the wines of this world have a way of running out in the middle of the festivities if the wine of your marriage is a wine of this world be sure that at some point or another that wine is going to run out if your family is predicated on the wines of this world breathe my lips and read them well that wine is going to run out there are people who predicate their marriages on the wine of beauty you have somebody thinking that they can sustain their marriage on beauty and I told you during the week that there's no one in this world who has a contract with nature that they will remain beautiful forever if you're going to predicate your marriage on handsomeness I've got news for you ask me if you don't believe it when I got married I had biceps and triceps and I was I was something and my wife was the most beautiful person on Earth and I can tell you now we look at ourselves today 38 years later we look at ourselves and we say how are the mighty Fallen now if we had predicated our marriage on that we would be in trouble and some predicate their marriages on the wine of money and I can tell you that money has a way of running out and if it doesn't run out money loses value I preached about this at at the University of East Africa bartin some time back and Professor Mato was sitting there and I said money runs out and money loses value and he said to me well pastor while we having lunch she said pastor I know you're coming from South Africa and you are speaking from Theory but let us tell you who come from Zimbabwe how money can lose value he says you know in Zimbabwe at that time of course money was losing value every second he says for instance when you go to the shop to go and buy a toilet paper it used to be counted than in millions the currency of Zimbabwe he says when you go there and you ask for the price of the toilet paper and they say to you it is $110,000 he says pay the $10,000 get the toilet paper don't get the toilet paper first because by the time you come to the teal the price has gone up money loses value and I remember the the the treasur of the division at that time he came from South Africa but the division was in Zimbabwe at that time so he went to Zimbabwe and that time the economy plumed and the and and and and and the Curren plumed and they started counting the money in their millions and he made a joke about it he said you know when I was growing up I used to pray to God that Lord please help me that one day I should become a millionaire and he says but the problem with that prayer I did not specify the currency [Applause] and now I mean Zimbabwe I'm a millionaire money loses value there are those who predicate their marriages and their families on the wine of material things I can tell you that material things wear out material things lose their value they lose their lustra now if you are going to predicate your marriage and your family on the things of this world that are transient that are passing when these things are gone that marriage is gone and that family disintegrates and I've seen so many families in South Africa that have disintegrated because the man has lost his job because the man can't provide anymore because the business has collapsed because uh the money is not coming in as fast as it is going out and because that marriage was sustained and that family was sustained by the things of this world as soon as they disappear the marriage disappeared now I'm telling you that had this I mean this people in the wedding in K of Galilee were in trouble when they ran out of wi but that festivity my pastor was saved thank God it was saved and I want to share with you three or four things that saved that wedding in Carana of Galilee and these are the things that I want you to have in your marriage to have in your family to have in your relationship so that when the wines of this world run out you will not run into a serious problem the first thing that saved one one of the things that saved that wedding in K of Galilee was the presence of Jesus the Bible says and Jesus and his disciples were invited to the wedding now I'm here to suggest to you my pastors my elders my fellow church members my brothers and sisters invite Jesus into your relationships invite Jesus into your marriage invite Jesus into your family now now no no no Jesus was an African I believe that Jesus was an African but Jesus never behaved like an African amen somebody Jesus does not behave like an African Jesus never attends weddings where he was not invited Jesus never goes into to families where he's not invited he was an African but he did not behave like an African and we Africans by the way we get invited we get we go to weddings where we are not invited we go to funerals of people we don't even know and when we get to those weddings we sing more than everybody else and after we have sung and celebrated and only then do we ask who's getting married by the way here you don't even know and we go to funerals and we bury people we don't even know and we cry and we cry and we cry and then after crying we ask who's this man and they say it's not a man we are buing he a woman and you've been crying all along now I can tell you right now Jesus is a gentleman he's an African but he's a gentleman he will never ever come into your marriage or into your family or into your relationship without you inviting him Revelations 3:20 he says behold I stand at the door and I knock and if there's anyone in there who's hearing me let him open up the door and I will come in and I will s with him and he with me he is not going to G crush he's not going to force his will upon you invite Jesus and once Jesus is there and the wine of your marriage or of your family family is running out Jesus will be there to save it let me tell you something a marriage that is that that that is no Jesus in it a relationship that has no Jesus in it a family that is that has no Jesus in it is dangerous detrimental to your well-being mental physical emotional spiritual and I'll tell you why where there is no Jesus where there's no God human beings have a tendency of creating Gods out of themselves and we have not been created to be gods and once we start behaving like Gods we become dangerous to other human beings and we become dangerous to ourselves in invite Jesus into your marriage into your life into your family when the wine Runs Out Jesus has a way of replenishing that love that faithfulness that loyalty and everything you know it is because of Jesus that my wife and I are still married 38 years later even though we've gained weight even though I've lost hair amen somebody and I can tell you why it is like that you see 20 38 years ago my pastor 38 years ago all right I used to see my wife with my eyes all right then I told you during the week she had long hair beautiful big round eyes long eyelashes figure like a Coca-Cola bottle that was my wife then and I looked at her with my eyes now some of those features are gone now but we still merit and I still love her as much if not more and the question is why do I love her now more than I loved her then the answer is then I used to see her with my eyes but today Jesus has helped me I'm seeing her with my heart amen somebody my wife then was somebody I could live with but 38 years later she's somebody without whom I cannot leave and that's because Jesus is in our relationship some of the wine has disappeared amen somebody now I'm saying invite Jesus into your wedding because it's not a question of if it's a question of when that wine is bound to run out at one point or another don't let anybody fool you the things of this world yes they're important but they are not permanent invite Jesus it's Jesus who Sav the wedding in K of Galilee but the second thing too we have read a passage where Mary came to Jesus and said to Jesus they do not have wine and when Jesus said well what has that got to do with me and Mary said to the other people do whatever he tells you to do second principle when the wine of the this world is running out on your marriage family and relationship make sure that you surround yourself with the Marys of this world invite some marries into your world you know there's no marriage that can survive alone John Dar says no man lives alone and no man is an island and so there's no marriage that can survive alone there's no relationship that can survive alone there's no family that can survive alone you need intercessory prayer I have said sometime in South Africa I said the problem with Adventist we have not taken the power of intercessory prayer seriously there's power in intercessory prayer and I want to tell you that make sure as a family as a couple as as as as as as as boyfriend and girlfriend in the relationship intending to get married identify somebody or some people who are spirit filled to support your marriage and to support your family because you can't survive alone but I'm telling you that you need to pray to God to give you a spirit of discernment because not everybody that is seated here today is a Mary some of them are judases and you need to be careful Jesus said to 12 disciples and one of them was a was Judas and Jesus says about him he says some he says I have called all of you here all of you I have called you but one of you here is a devil one of you here is a son of petition I can tell you right now you need the spirit of God to tell you whose prayers you can depend on Whose prayers you should ask for you know I say to South Africans my pastor I'm married to a very beautiful woman and I know that um there are people in church who appreciate my wife you are not hearing me amen somebody and so when I am sick I choose whose prayers I'm asking for there are some prayers who can't trust amen so when others are praying oh may please Pastor mudi recover there could be somebody out there saying Lord you know I've been waiting for this moment please don't restore him and I'm saying to you it's not everybody's prayers you can trust may God give you the spirit of discernment and and and and and have a marry into your life I usually say and I'm going to tell you now never trust all tears amen somebody don't trust all tears not all tears are are are genuine you know scientists have made studies of tears and they've discovered that there are different types of Tears they say there is what is known as basil tears now these are tears that are always in your eye that enable your eye to move in its socket without the basil tears your why your eye couldn't move without wincing and then there is what is known as reflex tears these are the tears that will form in your eye when a speck of dust gets into your eye and this te these tears will actually help remove a foreign object out of your eye reflex tears and then you have what is known as psychogenic lactations these are the tears that are controlled by the autonomic nervous system which in turn is controlled by the nervous by the central nervous system on a subconscious basis some people cry when they're emotional some people cry when they are excited psychogenic lactations but then there is what is known as crocodile tears I I have a number I have a lot I have a number of geographic national material at home and some of them are on crocodiles and I like watching these materials and so I heard a scientist one day making a commentary he says when a crocodile catches his prey and locks it in his powerful jaws at a at a force of 3,000 pounds per square inch then the prey will give what is known as a distress call and when the prey gives a distress call then the crocodile will share tears and he says those tears are not the tears to sympathize with the victim but these are tears that enjoys the state of heav lessness of the victim I'm saying to you don't trust all tears some tears are crocodile tears so in your marriage in your in your in your relationship in your family identify a genuine Mary who will intervene but let me turn around and say all to all of us here can we be some marries in other people's marriages and relationships and families you know when Mary realized that they ran out of wine Mary did not make a joke out of that Mary did not say oh what did they think so they have a wedding and they did not budget well Mary did not create a joke out of it in that he saw this as an opportunity to intered on behalf of the family and I'm here to tell you when when a marriage runs into a problem when the relationship runs into a problem when a family runs into a problem that's not a cause for you to laugh and jle that's a cause for you to intervene on behalf of somebody now some people of course they enjoy other people's state of helplessness when they are in trouble and the reason why it is because you know they behave like they behave like short people you know short people a short person will stand up and will have everybody sit down and he will say I'm taller than them short men syndrome and I'm here to tell you that can we intercede on behalf of others that was Point number two have a marry in your life and be a marry yourself but this principle number three that will save your relationship that will save your marriage that will save your family when the wine of this world runs out Mary turned around and said to the servants do whatever he tells you to do principle number three do what Jesus tells you to do don't invite Christ into your marriage and then turn him into a verse he's not there as a verse as a decorating article he's there to give direction to your marriage to your family to your life do whatever he tells you to do and if you want that marriage to survive if you want that family to survive do what he tells you to do let me remind you of some of the things that I told you that you need to do husbands love your wives do what it tells you to do love your wives emphasis your don't go about loving other people's wives here and other people's women that you know you know the problem with us men is that we have so much love that we want to share everywhere but let me tell you something man you can never out love your wife's capacity to receive love the more you love her the more she develops the capacity to receive that love there will never come a time where your wife will say oh you've loved me so much now I've had enough go love others out there there will never come that time because the more you love her the more she develops the capacity to receive that love love your wife that's what Jesus says don't whatever he tells you to do and you ladies submit to your husbands and I told you that the strong word that comes from Paul submit respect and the reason why the reason why Paul has to say that because women are very strong and do you know some of these women some of these women are in professions that that that that that emphasizes that strength in them that makes them musculine and you know I often say I often say there are certain professions that women must not get into because they create a problem from work they create a problem at home you see when you are a nurse a lady who's a nurse is a problem at home and I'll tell you why because for 8 hours 10 hours this woman at hospital is exposed to weak men who are crying who are sick and she has control over them this one is crying of this pain that one is caring of this pain I shut up you you making noise what do you want now you'll eat next time now now now she's she's used to controlling this man who are weak and crying and dying then she gets home and then argument starts and she looks at you you think she's seeing a husband she's seeing a patient in you when she looks at you she thinks this one is just another patient this one probably in her mind she's saying you know what what he needs this one needs penicillin pado right now so some of this profession are a problem my mother was a teacher my wife was a teacher my mother taught for 35 years my wife taught for 35 years and I always tell my wife that teachers always a problem because they think everybody's a student when we have prayer meeting at home and I want to speak and my wife says Hey raise your hand first before you speak I'm like children here now I'm here to tell you that I don't care what profession you are in the Bible says respect your husband submit to your husband and Paul says be like your mother Sarah who said to his and to her husband my Lord do whatever he tells you to do or but there something else too that Jesus tells you children respect your parents respect your parents and you will live long in this world you will live long in the world to come you will live long you'll be blessed Paul says this is one instruction the only instruction that has a promise in it respect your parents they brought into this world you owe their existence to them you are educated today because of them clothes on your bag is because of them food in your stomach because of them you can you can walk with dignity and honor it is because of them respect your parents I told you during the week that the last thing you want to do is to have your parent go to the Grave with a broken heart because of you but what you need is when when your parent goes to the Grave before your father goes to the Grave before your mother goes to the Grave you want a situation where they will call you over and your parent will say to you my son my daughter I'm about to depart I'm about to cross over come let me Bless you that's what you need do whatever he tells you to do about the something else too you parents love your children unconditionally do not provoke them to anger when you love them when you support them when you are there with them when you pray for them you're are not doing them a favor they did not choose to be your children and the most likely is if they could have a choice they might not choose you as a parent so you're not doing them a favor do whatever he tells you to do and when you've done the best you can you've done what Jesus told you to do you've invited him you're doing whatever he tells you to do and you have a marry people who pray for you people who support you let me tell you something man even when the problems and the difficulties of this world will plague your marriage and your family and your relationship I've got good news for you the best is still ahead of you The Best Is Yet To Come you know when you walk with Jesus Jesus is different from everybody else you know I often say Jesus is not like human beings human beings the more you know them the likel it is that they will disappoint you you will see things about them that you never thought were real about them they will realize that they're not as perfect as you thought they were but Jesus is different the longer you serve him the sweeter he grows every day with Jesus is sweeter than the day before now I'm saying to you go home go to your wife go to your husband go to your children go to your parents with Jesus in your hearts praying and relying on him go back for The Best Is Yet To Come some of us of course we might not see joy and happiness in this world I'm closing now because the devil is plaguing us one way or the other but I've got news for you some of us don't come from good families and we have no idea that they will ever be good at all at any given point in time we married or rather we we are children to a father who's an epome of evil a mother who does not know what love is children who don't know what their parents are and our hearts are broken and our Spirits are broken and we cannot probably hope for anything in this world that's possible and some of us may even die in that situation but don't lose hope the reason why you are here and you're part of God's church and part of God's family it is because God knew that some of us would need a bigger family than the families that we're born in this is your family the Church of God is your family and this family is bigger than Nairobi Central Church one day Jesus will come the Bible says that the dead in Christ will rise first and we will be taken up to heaven to be with him forever and ever husband will be United with her with wife children with parents brother with sister no more crying no more pain no more dying will'll be in one family our hope will become a reality on that day if you don't experience that best now Jesus said I am coming to take you home take that hope for the best Is Yet To Come The Best Is Yet To Come your eyes are closed and your heads are bow Our God and our Father in heaven we thank you for your word we thank you for Jesus we thank you for the hope of glory we thank you that you are with us as husbands as wives as parents as children in our families and our families may not be that ideal but Lord thank you that you are with us if we embrace you if if we have you in our hearts in our relationships in our marriages despite the past that we have experienced that is not so good we will live this place today knowing and understanding that The Best Is Yet To Come we invite you Lord into our marriages into our homes our relationships for we know that the wines of this world one day are going to run out Jesus we ask that when they run out be there never leave us never abandon us but keep Us Faithful till that day Lord and you shall come to take your loved ones home and on that day Lord When the Saints Go Marching may we be in that number now to the god of Eternity invisible Incorruptible the only God be honor and glory in Jesus name

TIMESTAMPED TRANSCRIPT:
[0.5s] I take this time to greet you all in the
[2.6s] wonderful name of our Lord and Savior
[4.3s] Jesus
[6.0s] amen we have had a wonderful
[9.9s] time um with the church but in
[12.8s] particular me and my
[14.7s] wife H have had a wonderful time here in
[18.7s] Nairobi Central Church and uh Kenya in
[23.7s] general we are we are ending this week
[27.9s] of
[28.8s] prayer and uh
[31.0s] today and
[33.1s] tomorrow we will be on our way to South
[38.2s] Africa I cannot wait to see my
[42.4s] grandchildren particularly my
[45.8s] grandson I've got a 5-year-old
[49.3s] grandson and some time back I was
[53.0s] sent a a a
[57.5s] video of my grand son while they were
[61.9s] watching
[63.4s] TV uh it was him the little sister and
[68.7s] his parents and in the middle of just
[72.6s] that TV program I am told they took a
[76.2s] video and they sent it to me and then he
[79.0s] he stood in front of the of the video I
[82.4s] mean of the TV and he said stop
[86.4s] now everybody stop I'm going to preach
[92.2s] preach he's
[94.1s] five and after preaching and then he
[97.3s] said do I sound like
[102.4s] grandpa I can't wait to see
[105.7s] him so so um I've had a wonderful time
[109.8s] thanks to the pastors thanks to the
[112.8s] elders thanks to the Family Life Council
[116.9s] thanks to the church at large thanks
[119.9s] thanks to the catering team thanks to
[122.8s] each one of you you've made it a lot
[126.8s] easier for us to be here for this entire
[130.6s] week um I'm I'm I'm a person who gets
[134.2s] homesick easily but I can tell you that
[137.8s] this 10 days I've not missed home much
[142.3s] and probably I will realize when I get
[144.4s] home how much I missed it but for now
[148.1s] I'm I've been I've been been
[151.0s] good I draw your
[153.3s] attention to John Chapter
[156.6s] 2 John Chapter
[161.0s] 2 John Chapter 2 his mother said to the
[165.3s] servants do whatever he tells you to do
[171.8s] do whatever he tells you to do may the
[174.6s] good Lord add a blessing to the reading
[176.8s] of his word in Jesus name let everybody
[179.2s] say Amen
[181.0s] your heads are bow and your eyes are
[182.4s] closed our God and our father into your
[184.9s] hands I commit myself this morning in
[187.8s] Jesus name amen there was a wedding in
[192.2s] Cara of
[194.8s] Galilee now the wedding in Cara of
[199.0s] Galilee was a
[203.4s] very big
[206.4s] wedding now weddings in those days were
[209.8s] big
[211.4s] festivities Bible scholars tell us
[214.8s] that these festivities lasted for many
[220.4s] days sometimes they would take a week
[222.9s] other times they would take two weeks
[225.2s] sometimes they would run up to a
[227.5s] month but they were big
[231.2s] events there was no private wedding
[233.5s] those days so neighbors were invited The
[237.2s] Village was invited and family members
[240.3s] would be
[241.4s] invited to the
[243.4s] wedding and so you can imagine there
[246.4s] would be a lot of people in that wedding
[251.3s] and so the Bible says there was a
[252.7s] wedding in kind of
[254.2s] Galilee and Not only was there a wedding
[259.0s] in Cara of Galilee the Bible specifies
[262.3s] when you read that chapter that Jesus
[265.8s] and his disciples were invited to that
[269.5s] way
[271.1s] now I have read a commentary some time
[273.1s] back it says Jesus was invited in his
[277.8s] capacity as a family member to that
[281.7s] wedding and and and you pick that up
[285.0s] that you picked that up that Jesus was a
[287.0s] family member there by Mary's role in
[290.9s] that wedding that is Mary the mother of
[294.2s] Jesus Christ so the Bible says so they
[298.1s] came to that wedding in do a big thing
[300.5s] now I want to say something just before
[303.1s] I move on please weddings must not be a
[308.5s] private
[309.8s] Affair the reason why weddings must not
[312.7s] be a private Affair it is because
[315.2s] weddings need
[318.1s] Witnesses there's a reason why we need
[321.3s] Witnesses when you have witnesses to
[323.7s] your wedding we are going to make it
[326.0s] difficult for you to divorce even if you
[327.8s] want to because if you called us to your
[331.1s] wedding the day you divorce you must
[333.6s] also call us because you can't just call
[336.6s] us to your wedding and then when you
[338.6s] divorce you do it secretly so those days
[341.5s] it was difficult to divorce because when
[344.0s] you married everybody was there you
[346.8s] couldn't divorce in secret because when
[348.5s] you walked in town everybody would be
[350.4s] asking you where's your wife and where's
[352.2s] your husband so they make your life
[356.1s] miserable and so weddings must not be a
[359.4s] private
[360.7s] matter May weddings must be a family
[363.4s] matter must be a community
[365.9s] matter you must have Realize by now that
[369.5s] I I'm an
[370.9s] africanist I I subscribe to African
[373.9s] cosmology and African philosophy and I
[376.8s] can tell you that in an African setup
[379.0s] African cosmology marriage is not a
[381.5s] private thing when you marry you not
[384.6s] only marry this person that you're
[386.3s] getting married to but you marry the
[388.4s] family you marrying the entire Village
[392.3s] you marry everybody there you marry the
[394.4s] cats and the dogs you marry everything
[397.6s] that belongs to that family and that's
[400.0s] what a a wedding should be so the Bible
[403.3s] says and they invited Jesus and Jesus
[406.1s] was there and so while they were having
[411.9s] those
[412.9s] festivities the Bible says they ran out
[416.4s] of wine they just ran out of wine reason
[419.8s] why they would ran out of wine is
[421.1s] because the festivities too long I mean
[423.7s] took too long and there were too many
[426.6s] people they ran out of
[428.9s] wine now I need to make you aware that
[431.3s] wine was very important those days
[433.9s] particularly when you have
[435.8s] festivities wine to a Jewish wedding was
[439.2s] what food is to an African
[442.0s] wedding you see when Africans come
[445.7s] together to a wedding we will come to
[448.6s] church here
[450.4s] and you will be dressing nicely
[452.3s] beautiful white dress and beautiful suit
[455.5s] and and and and all those things let me
[458.4s] tell you something man when we are sited
[460.8s] here looking at that ceremony and the
[462.4s] beauty and the steps and the music and
[464.3s] all this that and the other what is
[465.8s] going on in the African mind while we're
[467.8s] sitting here is are we going to eat
[470.2s] after
[471.6s] this we see all these things but is
[474.7s] there food after this and that's what a
[478.4s] wedding was like those days are we going
[482.2s] to have wine after this and now you can
[486.3s] imagine when you run out of wine in the
[489.0s] Jewish wedding is like running out of
[491.6s] food in an African wedding so they ran
[495.6s] out of wine and you can imagine the
[498.4s] wedding had to come to an end by virtue
[502.7s] of the wine having run out fortunately
[506.2s] there was Mary there the Bible says and
[508.9s] so Mary went to Jesus Christ her
[512.6s] son now by that time Jesus Christ was
[515.6s] with his disciples and by the way by the
[518.4s] time Jesus Christ left home he didn't
[522.3s] have any disciples but Mary Miss Jesus
[525.7s] Christ for the first time after Jesus
[528.3s] had been tempted on on the mountain for
[530.7s] the first time she sees her sign walking
[534.8s] with disciples and so the Bible says
[538.4s] then she went
[540.0s] to him and said they have run out of
[544.6s] wine and then Jesus says so what is that
[547.6s] got to do with me my time has not come
[552.2s] and then Mary did not entertain that
[554.6s] response but turn to the other people
[557.4s] that were there and said to this people
[560.7s] whatever he tells you to do that you
[566.6s] must do so the Bible says
[570.6s] there were gallons there or containers
[574.0s] rather of water that the Jews used for
[577.8s] ceremonial washing and Jesus said to
[581.2s] those who were standing there now F
[584.5s] these containers with water and they
[588.4s] filled the containers with water after
[590.7s] filling the containers with water and
[592.6s] then Jesus said now you can draw from
[594.8s] these containers and then you can take
[597.6s] to the master of the banquet
[600.1s] and then they took that to the must of
[602.1s] the banquet and the must of the banquet
[604.1s] tasted this water that had been turned
[606.0s] into wine and realized that the wine
[609.5s] that he was drinking was different from
[613.9s] the wine he had been drinking through
[616.5s] other festivities then he went to the
[619.9s] groom and he said to the groom you've
[623.1s] done something that is not ordinarily
[628.3s] done in our
[630.2s] weddings what you have done is or what
[633.6s] is generally done
[636.5s] is the groom will give out the best wine
[643.7s] first and when people have had enough to
[646.7s] drink then he will bring out the bad
[650.8s] wine after but you have
[655.4s] saved the
[657.3s] best for last
[659.9s] and I'm here this morning to tell you
[662.0s] that the
[663.3s] Best Is Yet To Come The Best Is Yet To
[670.0s] Come
[672.6s] Now I want to tell you that we've been
[676.4s] talking about marriages and
[677.5s] relationships we've been talking about
[680.2s] family and sometimes the danger that we
[683.9s] find ourselves in is to predicate our
[687.4s] relationships and our marriages and our
[689.4s] families we found these on the
[693.5s] wines of this
[695.9s] world I can tell you right now that the
[699.4s] wines of this world have a way of
[702.6s] running out in the middle of the
[705.8s] festivities if the wine of your
[709.4s] marriage is a wine of this
[713.0s] world be sure that at some point or
[716.4s] another that wine is going to run out
[720.1s] if your family is predicated on the
[722.5s] wines of this world breathe my lips and
[725.5s] read them well that wine is going to run
[728.0s] out there are people who predicate their
[729.9s] marriages on the wine of
[733.4s] beauty you have somebody thinking that
[735.7s] they can
[737.2s] sustain their marriage on beauty and I
[741.0s] told you during the week that there's no
[742.4s] one in this world who has a contract
[745.2s] with nature that they will remain
[747.2s] beautiful forever if you're going to
[750.1s] predicate your marriage on handsomeness
[753.3s] I've got news for you ask me if you
[755.9s] don't believe it when I got married I
[758.6s] had biceps and triceps and I was I was
[762.8s] something and my wife was the most
[765.3s] beautiful person on Earth and I can tell
[768.0s] you now we look at ourselves today 38
[770.6s] years later we look at ourselves and we
[772.8s] say how are the mighty
[776.8s] Fallen now if we had predicated our
[779.7s] marriage on that we would be in
[782.9s] trouble and some predicate their
[785.6s] marriages on the wine of money and I can
[789.6s] tell you that money has a way of running
[791.1s] out and if it doesn't run out money
[793.6s] loses value I preached about this at at
[797.4s] the University of East Africa bartin
[799.3s] some time back and Professor Mato was
[801.4s] sitting there and I said money runs out
[804.9s] and money loses value and he said to me
[808.4s] well pastor while we having lunch she
[810.2s] said pastor I know you're coming from
[812.2s] South Africa and you are speaking from
[815.0s] Theory but let us tell you who come from
[818.0s] Zimbabwe how money can lose value he
[821.7s] says you know in Zimbabwe at that time
[824.6s] of course money was losing value every
[828.5s] second he says for instance when you go
[831.2s] to the shop to go and buy a toilet paper
[834.3s] it used to be counted than in millions
[837.5s] the currency of Zimbabwe he says when
[840.1s] you go there and you ask for the price
[843.3s] of the toilet paper and they say to you
[846.6s] it is
[848.4s] $110,000 he says pay the
[852.3s] $10,000 get the toilet paper don't get
[855.8s] the toilet paper first because by the
[858.6s] time you come to the teal the price has
[860.7s] gone
[862.3s] up money loses value and I remember the
[866.6s] the the treasur of the division at that
[868.8s] time he came from South Africa but the
[870.9s] division was in Zimbabwe at that time so
[873.0s] he went to Zimbabwe and that time the
[875.7s] economy plumed and the and and and and
[878.0s] and the Curren plumed and they started
[880.0s] counting the money in their millions and
[881.8s] he made a joke about it he said you know
[884.0s] when I was growing up I used to pray to
[886.8s] God that Lord please help me that one
[889.4s] day I should become a
[892.3s] millionaire and he says but the problem
[894.4s] with that prayer I did not specify the
[896.4s] currency
[897.7s] [Applause]
[899.6s] and now I mean Zimbabwe I'm a
[903.1s] millionaire money loses
[907.5s] value there are those who predicate
[910.8s] their marriages and their families on
[912.5s] the wine of material things I can tell
[916.3s] you that material things wear out
[918.3s] material things lose their value they
[921.0s] lose their lustra now if you are going
[924.7s] to predicate your marriage and your
[927.3s] family on the things of this world that
[929.4s] are transient that are
[931.4s] passing when these things are gone that
[935.7s] marriage is gone and that family
[938.0s] disintegrates and I've seen so many
[940.2s] families in South Africa that have
[942.7s] disintegrated because the man has lost
[945.0s] his job because the man can't provide
[947.6s] anymore because the business has
[949.8s] collapsed because uh the money is not
[954.2s] coming in as fast as it is going out and
[958.4s] because that marriage was sustained and
[961.2s] that family was sustained by the things
[964.1s] of this world as soon as they disappear
[966.6s] the marriage disappeared now I'm telling
[968.9s] you that had this I mean this people in
[973.3s] the wedding in K of Galilee were in
[976.6s] trouble when they ran out of
[980.3s] wi but that festivity my pastor was
[986.8s] saved thank God it was saved and I want
[990.9s] to share with you three or four things
[994.2s] that
[995.2s] saved that wedding in Carana of Galilee
[999.4s] and these are the things that I want you
[1001.9s] to have in your marriage to have in your
[1005.6s] family to have in your relationship so
[1008.4s] that when the wines of this world run
[1011.5s] out you will not run into a serious
[1015.0s] problem the first thing that saved one
[1018.3s] one of the things that saved that
[1020.9s] wedding in K of Galilee was the presence
[1024.5s] of Jesus the Bible says and Jesus and
[1029.2s] his
[1030.1s] disciples were invited to the wedding
[1036.4s] now I'm here to suggest to you my
[1040.0s] pastors my elders my fellow church
[1043.1s] members my brothers and sisters
[1046.5s] invite Jesus into your
[1049.9s] relationships invite Jesus into your
[1052.8s] marriage invite Jesus into your family
[1056.4s] now now no no no Jesus was an African I
[1061.3s] believe that Jesus was an African but
[1065.2s] Jesus never behaved like an African amen
[1068.9s] somebody Jesus does not behave like an
[1071.4s] African Jesus never attends weddings
[1074.3s] where he was not
[1076.6s] invited Jesus never goes into to
[1079.0s] families where he's not
[1080.9s] invited he was an African but he did not
[1083.3s] behave like an African and we Africans
[1085.2s] by the way we get invited we get we go
[1087.6s] to weddings where we are not invited we
[1089.5s] go to funerals of people we don't even
[1091.4s] know and when we get to those weddings
[1093.4s] we sing more than everybody
[1095.8s] else and after we have sung and
[1098.2s] celebrated and only then do we ask who's
[1100.6s] getting married by the way here you
[1102.7s] don't even know and we go to funerals
[1105.2s] and we bury people we don't even know
[1107.5s] and we cry and we cry and we cry and
[1110.6s] then after crying we ask who's this man
[1113.2s] and they say it's not a man we are buing
[1114.7s] he a
[1115.8s] woman and you've been crying all along
[1118.6s] now I can tell you right now Jesus is a
[1120.8s] gentleman he's an African but he's a
[1122.7s] gentleman he will never ever come into
[1127.7s] your marriage or into your family or
[1130.8s] into your relationship without you
[1133.8s] inviting
[1135.3s] him Revelations 3:20 he says behold I
[1139.0s] stand at the door and I
[1141.2s] knock and if there's anyone in there
[1144.6s] who's hearing me let him open up the
[1147.3s] door and I will come in and I will s
[1151.4s] with him and he with me he is not going
[1156.2s] to G crush he's not going to force his
[1158.7s] will upon you
[1161.4s] invite Jesus and once Jesus is there and
[1165.9s] the wine of your marriage or of your
[1168.4s] family family is running out Jesus will
[1173.2s] be there to save it let me tell you
[1177.6s] something a marriage that
[1180.9s] is that that that is no Jesus in it a
[1185.1s] relationship that has no Jesus in it a
[1189.2s] family that is that has no Jesus in it
[1192.9s] is
[1194.1s] dangerous detrimental to your well-being
[1198.0s] mental physical emotional spiritual and
[1201.6s] I'll tell you why where there is no
[1205.2s] Jesus where there's no God human beings
[1209.1s] have a
[1210.2s] tendency of creating Gods out of
[1214.4s] themselves and we have not been created
[1217.5s] to be gods and once we start behaving
[1220.8s] like Gods we become dangerous to other
[1224.0s] human beings and we become dangerous to
[1227.4s] ourselves in invite Jesus into your
[1233.5s] marriage into your life
[1237.1s] into your
[1239.1s] family when the wine Runs Out Jesus has
[1243.2s] a way of replenishing that love that
[1247.5s] faithfulness that loyalty and everything
[1250.8s] you know it is because of
[1253.9s] Jesus that my wife and I are still
[1256.3s] married 38 years later
[1259.2s] even though we've gained weight even
[1261.8s] though I've lost hair amen somebody and
[1265.8s] I can tell you why it is like that you
[1268.0s] see 20 38 years ago my pastor 38 years
[1272.4s] ago all right I used to see my wife with
[1277.1s] my
[1278.3s] eyes all right then I told you during
[1281.8s] the week she had long hair beautiful big
[1285.5s] round eyes long eyelashes
[1289.3s] figure like a Coca-Cola
[1292.1s] bottle that was my wife then and I
[1295.8s] looked at her with my
[1299.2s] eyes now some of those features are gone
[1302.2s] now but we still merit and I still love
[1305.4s] her as much if not more and the question
[1309.0s] is why do I love her now more than I
[1314.2s] loved her then the answer is then I used
[1318.8s] to see her with my eyes but today Jesus
[1323.0s] has helped me I'm seeing her with my
[1325.8s] heart amen
[1328.0s] somebody my wife then was somebody I
[1332.5s] could live with but 38 years later she's
[1336.8s] somebody without whom I cannot leave and
[1340.0s] that's because
[1342.0s] Jesus is in our relationship some of the
[1345.3s] wine has
[1347.1s] disappeared amen
[1349.3s] somebody now I'm saying invite Jesus
[1352.2s] into your wedding because it's not a
[1354.7s] question of
[1356.2s] if it's a question of when that wine is
[1360.9s] bound to run out at one point or another
[1365.4s] don't let anybody fool you the things of
[1368.5s] this world yes they're important but
[1371.3s] they are not
[1374.0s] permanent invite Jesus it's Jesus who
[1378.0s] Sav
[1379.3s] the wedding in K of Galilee but the
[1381.1s] second thing too we have read a passage
[1384.6s] where
[1386.0s] Mary came to Jesus and said to Jesus
[1390.4s] they do not have
[1394.2s] wine and when Jesus said well what has
[1396.9s] that got to do with me and Mary said to
[1400.5s] the other people do whatever he tells
[1403.8s] you to do second principle when the wine
[1408.1s] of the this world is running out on your
[1411.5s] marriage family and relationship make
[1415.5s] sure that you surround yourself with the
[1419.8s] Marys of this world invite some marries
[1424.0s] into your world you know there's no
[1426.9s] marriage that can survive alone John Dar
[1430.0s] says no man lives alone and no man is an
[1432.4s] island and so there's no marriage that
[1435.5s] can survive alone there's no
[1436.8s] relationship that can survive alone
[1438.6s] there's no family that can survive alone
[1441.0s] you need intercessory prayer I have said
[1446.5s] sometime in South Africa I said the
[1448.3s] problem with Adventist we have not taken
[1451.4s] the power of intercessory prayer
[1455.4s] seriously there's power in intercessory
[1459.2s] prayer and I want to tell you that make
[1462.4s] sure as a family as a couple as as as as
[1466.5s] as as as boyfriend and girlfriend in the
[1468.6s] relationship intending to get married
[1471.6s] identify somebody or some people who are
[1475.6s] spirit
[1476.6s] filled to support your marriage and to
[1480.3s] support your family because you can't
[1482.1s] survive alone but I'm telling you that
[1485.0s] you need to pray to God to give you a
[1488.6s] spirit of discernment because not
[1491.8s] everybody that is seated here today is a
[1494.5s] Mary some of them are judases
[1498.4s] and you need to be careful Jesus said to
[1501.2s] 12 disciples and one of them was a was
[1504.9s] Judas and Jesus says about him he says
[1510.2s] some he says I have called all of you
[1513.6s] here all of you I have called you but
[1516.6s] one of you
[1518.4s] here is a
[1520.4s] devil one of you here is a son of
[1524.4s] petition I can tell you right now you
[1526.6s] need the spirit of God to tell you whose
[1531.1s] prayers you can depend on Whose prayers
[1535.5s] you should ask for you know I say to
[1540.0s] South
[1540.8s] Africans my pastor I'm married to a very
[1543.7s] beautiful
[1544.9s] woman and I
[1547.1s] know
[1548.9s] that um there are people in
[1552.8s] church who appreciate my
[1555.7s] wife you are not hearing me
[1559.8s] amen
[1561.0s] somebody and so when I am
[1564.0s] sick I choose whose prayers I'm asking
[1569.5s] for there are some prayers who can't
[1572.0s] trust
[1573.6s] amen so when others are praying oh may
[1576.8s] please Pastor mudi recover there could
[1579.1s] be somebody out there saying Lord you
[1580.9s] know I've been waiting for this
[1584.4s] moment please don't restore him and I'm
[1588.0s] saying to you it's not
[1590.5s] everybody's prayers you can
[1593.8s] trust may God give you the
[1597.5s] spirit of
[1599.3s] discernment and and and and and have a
[1601.8s] marry into your
[1604.7s] life I usually say and I'm going to tell
[1607.1s] you now never trust all tears amen
[1612.7s] somebody don't trust all tears not all
[1617.0s] tears are are are
[1619.7s] genuine you know scientists have made
[1622.0s] studies of tears and they've discovered
[1624.4s] that there are different types of Tears
[1627.0s] they say there is what is known as basil
[1629.3s] tears now these are tears that are
[1631.4s] always in your eye that enable your eye
[1633.6s] to move in its socket without the basil
[1636.3s] tears your why your eye couldn't move
[1638.4s] without wincing and then there is what
[1640.7s] is known as reflex tears these are the
[1644.1s] tears that will form in your eye when a
[1646.0s] speck of dust gets into your eye and
[1648.2s] this te these tears will actually help
[1651.6s] remove a foreign object out of your eye
[1654.7s] reflex tears and then you have what is
[1657.3s] known as psychogenic
[1659.6s] lactations these are the tears that are
[1661.7s] controlled by the autonomic nervous
[1663.8s] system which in turn is controlled by
[1665.9s] the nervous by the central nervous
[1667.9s] system on a subconscious
[1670.4s] basis some people cry when they're
[1673.4s] emotional some people cry when they are
[1676.8s] excited
[1678.6s] psychogenic
[1680.2s] lactations but then there is what is
[1683.0s] known as crocodile
[1688.9s] tears I I have a number I have a lot I
[1693.5s] have a number of geographic national
[1696.4s] material at home and some of them are on
[1701.4s] crocodiles and I like watching these
[1705.1s] materials and so I heard a scientist one
[1707.8s] day making a commentary he says when a
[1710.6s] crocodile catches his prey and locks it
[1712.9s] in his powerful jaws at a at a force of
[1715.5s] 3,000 pounds per square inch then the
[1718.5s] prey will give what is known as a
[1720.4s] distress call and when the prey gives a
[1723.8s] distress call then the crocodile will
[1727.0s] share tears and he says those tears are
[1731.3s] not the tears to sympathize with the
[1733.9s] victim but these are tears that enjoys
[1737.1s] the state of heav lessness of the victim
[1740.0s] I'm saying to you don't trust all
[1743.1s] tears some tears are crocodile tears so
[1746.6s] in your marriage in your in your in your
[1749.9s] relationship in your family identify a
[1753.4s] genuine Mary who will intervene but let
[1756.1s] me turn around and say all to all of us
[1759.1s] here can we be some marries in other
[1763.8s] people's
[1764.9s] marriages and
[1766.9s] relationships and families you know when
[1770.4s] Mary realized that they ran out of wine
[1775.2s] Mary did not make a joke out of that
[1778.5s] Mary did not say oh what did they think
[1781.4s] so they have a wedding and they did not
[1783.4s] budget well Mary did not create a joke
[1786.9s] out of it in that he saw this as an
[1790.3s] opportunity to intered on behalf of the
[1794.1s] family and I'm here to tell you when
[1796.2s] when a marriage runs into a problem when
[1798.2s] the relationship runs into a problem
[1800.0s] when a family runs into a problem that's
[1802.8s] not a cause for you to
[1805.9s] laugh and
[1808.6s] jle that's a cause for you to intervene
[1813.6s] on behalf of somebody now some people of
[1817.4s] course they enjoy other people's state
[1822.1s] of
[1823.0s] helplessness when they are in trouble
[1825.8s] and the reason why it is because you
[1828.1s] know they behave like they behave like
[1830.2s] short people you know short people a
[1833.5s] short person will stand up and will have
[1835.5s] everybody sit down and he will say I'm
[1837.8s] taller than
[1840.1s] them short men
[1844.8s] syndrome and I'm here to tell you that
[1847.9s] can
[1849.1s] we
[1851.1s] intercede on behalf of others that was
[1855.5s] Point number two have a marry in your
[1857.7s] life
[1859.0s] and be a marry yourself but this
[1863.6s] principle number three that will save
[1866.5s] your relationship that will save your
[1869.4s] marriage that will save your family when
[1872.4s] the wine of this world runs out Mary
[1875.5s] turned around and said to the servants
[1878.4s] do whatever he tells you to do principle
[1884.0s] number
[1885.3s] three do what
[1888.6s] Jesus tells you to do don't invite
[1894.2s] Christ into your marriage and then turn
[1897.2s] him into a
[1899.3s] verse he's not there as a verse as a
[1901.8s] decorating article he's there to give
[1904.8s] direction to your marriage to your
[1906.8s] family to your life do whatever he tells
[1909.9s] you to do and if you want that marriage
[1912.8s] to survive if you want that family to
[1914.9s] survive do what he tells you to
[1918.8s] do let me remind you of some of the
[1921.0s] things that I told you that you need to
[1922.9s] do husbands love your wives do what it
[1928.0s] tells you to do love your wives emphasis
[1933.2s] your don't go about loving other
[1935.6s] people's wives here and other people's
[1938.6s] women that you know you know the problem
[1940.8s] with us men is that we have so much love
[1943.5s] that we want to share everywhere but let
[1945.3s] me tell you something man you can never
[1948.4s] out love your wife's capacity to receive
[1951.3s] love the more you love her the more she
[1954.6s] develops the capacity to receive that
[1957.1s] love there will never come a time where
[1960.2s] your wife will say oh you've loved me so
[1962.4s] much now I've had enough go love others
[1965.0s] out
[1966.3s] there there will never come that time
[1969.0s] because the more you love her the more
[1971.2s] she develops the capacity to receive
[1973.2s] that love love your
[1975.6s] wife that's what Jesus says don't
[1978.0s] whatever he tells you to do and you
[1980.1s] ladies
[1982.4s] submit to your husbands and I told you
[1985.8s] that the strong word that comes from
[1987.6s] Paul submit
[1991.0s] respect and the reason why the reason
[1994.5s] why Paul has to say that because women
[1997.4s] are very strong and do you know some of
[1999.5s] these women some of these women are in
[2002.0s] professions that that that that
[2006.8s] that emphasizes that strength in them
[2010.3s] that makes them
[2011.9s] musculine and you know I often say I
[2014.5s] often say there are certain professions
[2016.1s] that women must not get into because
[2018.2s] they create a problem from work they
[2020.5s] create a problem at home you see when
[2022.8s] you are a
[2024.4s] nurse a lady who's a nurse is a problem
[2028.4s] at
[2029.3s] home and I'll tell you why because for 8
[2033.0s] hours 10 hours this woman at hospital is
[2036.6s] exposed to weak men who are crying who
[2041.3s] are sick and she has control over them
[2045.0s] this one is crying of this pain that one
[2046.8s] is caring of this pain I shut up you you
[2048.8s] making noise what do you want now you'll
[2050.7s] eat next time now now now she's she's
[2053.7s] used to controlling this man who are
[2056.3s] weak and crying and dying then she gets
[2060.0s] home and then argument starts and she
[2063.3s] looks at you you think she's seeing a
[2065.4s] husband she's seeing a patient in you
[2070.5s] when she looks at you she thinks this
[2072.0s] one is just another patient this
[2076.9s] one probably in her mind she's saying
[2080.0s] you know what what he needs this one
[2081.8s] needs
[2083.0s] penicillin pado right now so some of
[2086.6s] this profession are a problem my mother
[2089.0s] was a teacher my wife was a teacher my
[2091.9s] mother taught for 35 years my wife
[2093.8s] taught for 35 years and I always tell my
[2096.2s] wife that teachers always a problem
[2098.8s] because they think everybody's a
[2102.0s] student when we have prayer meeting at
[2104.4s] home and I want to speak and my wife
[2106.3s] says Hey raise your hand first before
[2108.5s] you speak I'm like children here now I'm
[2111.8s] here to tell you that I don't care what
[2113.3s] profession you are in the Bible says
[2116.0s] respect your husband submit to your
[2119.2s] husband and Paul says be like your
[2122.0s] mother Sarah who said to his and to her
[2127.1s] husband my
[2129.5s] Lord do whatever he tells you to do or
[2134.1s] but there something else too that Jesus
[2135.8s] tells
[2136.8s] you children respect your
[2139.8s] parents respect your parents and you
[2143.3s] will live long in this world you will
[2146.9s] live long in the world to come you will
[2150.6s] live long you'll be
[2152.5s] blessed Paul says this is one
[2155.3s] instruction the only instruction that
[2157.1s] has a promise in it respect your parents
[2161.3s] they brought into this world you owe
[2163.3s] their existence to them you are educated
[2165.7s] today because of them clothes on your
[2167.6s] bag is because of them food in your
[2169.4s] stomach because of them you can you can
[2171.7s] walk with dignity and honor it is
[2174.5s] because of them respect your parents I
[2177.8s] told you during the week that the last
[2179.8s] thing you want to do is to have your
[2181.7s] parent go to the Grave with a broken
[2183.6s] heart because of you but what you need
[2186.8s] is when when your parent goes to the
[2189.1s] Grave before your father goes to the
[2191.4s] Grave before your mother goes to the
[2193.2s] Grave you want a situation where they
[2195.2s] will call you over and your parent will
[2197.8s] say to you my son my daughter I'm about
[2200.5s] to depart I'm about to cross over come
[2204.1s] let me Bless you that's what you need do
[2209.2s] whatever he tells you to do about the
[2211.6s] something else too you
[2215.6s] parents love your children
[2219.7s] unconditionally do not provoke them to
[2223.8s] anger when you love them when you
[2226.4s] support them when you are there with
[2228.8s] them when you pray for them you're are
[2231.4s] not doing them a
[2232.9s] favor they did not choose to be your
[2236.5s] children and the most likely is if they
[2239.7s] could have a choice they might not
[2242.3s] choose you as a
[2244.2s] parent so you're not doing them a favor
[2248.7s] do whatever he tells you to do and when
[2254.3s] you've done the best you can you've done
[2257.5s] what Jesus told you to do you've invited
[2260.0s] him you're doing whatever he tells you
[2261.9s] to do and you have a marry people who
[2265.2s] pray for you people who support you let
[2268.0s] me tell you something man even when the
[2271.0s] problems and the difficulties of this
[2273.0s] world will plague your marriage and your
[2274.6s] family and your relationship I've got
[2277.5s] good news for you the best is still
[2281.6s] ahead of you The Best Is Yet To Come you
[2289.0s] know when you walk with Jesus Jesus is
[2292.2s] different from everybody else you know I
[2295.4s] often say Jesus is not like human beings
[2299.1s] human beings the more you know them the
[2301.6s] likel it is that they will disappoint
[2305.3s] you you will see things about them that
[2308.6s] you never thought were real about them
[2311.1s] they will realize that they're not as
[2312.9s] perfect as you thought they were but
[2315.2s] Jesus is different the longer you serve
[2320.0s] him the sweeter he grows every day with
[2325.5s] Jesus is sweeter than the day before now
[2330.2s] I'm saying to you go
[2332.5s] home go to your wife go to your husband
[2336.0s] go to your children go to your parents
[2338.9s] with Jesus in your hearts
[2342.0s] praying and relying on
[2346.0s] him go
[2348.8s] back for The
[2351.3s] Best Is Yet To
[2355.2s] Come some of us of
[2358.4s] course we might not see joy and
[2360.9s] happiness in this world I'm closing
[2363.5s] now because the devil is plaguing us
[2368.2s] one way or the
[2371.6s] other but I've got news for you some of
[2374.8s] us don't come from good
[2377.0s] families and we have no idea that they
[2380.5s] will ever be good at all at any given
[2383.1s] point in
[2384.9s] time we married or rather we we are
[2388.2s] children to a father who's an epome of
[2391.4s] evil a mother who does not know what
[2394.3s] love is children who don't know what
[2396.4s] their parents are and our hearts are
[2398.4s] broken and our Spirits are
[2401.0s] broken and we cannot probably hope for
[2405.6s] anything in this world that's possible
[2408.0s] and some of us may even die in that
[2410.1s] situation but don't lose
[2412.6s] hope the reason why you are here and
[2416.1s] you're part of God's church and part of
[2418.2s] God's family it is because God knew that
[2422.0s] some of us would need a bigger family
[2425.1s] than the families that we're born in
[2428.0s] this is your family the Church of God is
[2431.2s] your family and this family is bigger
[2433.6s] than Nairobi Central
[2435.6s] Church one day Jesus will come the Bible
[2440.0s] says that the dead in Christ will rise
[2441.9s] first and we will be taken up to heaven
[2444.8s] to be with him forever and ever husband
[2449.8s] will be United with her with wife
[2452.4s] children with parents brother with
[2454.2s] sister no more crying no more pain no
[2458.7s] more
[2461.8s] dying will'll be in one
[2465.8s] family our
[2467.8s] hope will become a reality on that day
[2473.2s] if you don't experience that best
[2476.5s] now Jesus said I am coming to take you
[2482.1s] home take that hope for the best
[2487.8s] Is Yet To Come The Best Is Yet To Come

[2508.0s] heaven we thank you for your
