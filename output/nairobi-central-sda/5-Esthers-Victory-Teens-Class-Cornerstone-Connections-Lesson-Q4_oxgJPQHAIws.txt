deep and wide on the street in their Village of Sanga in Alaska look mother will say we're passing deep and wide Faith would get so excited and begin to sing deep and wide deep and wide as she sang she lowered her hands to show how deep was deep then stretched out her arms to show how wide was wide she laughed deep and wide on Friday nights Faith wouldn't wait to go to bed so they so she could

morning he would say maybe I'll make some pancakes faith will smile with delight grandfather's pancak cakes were her favorite breakfast she would smuggle snuggle in bed at 10:00 at night it was a little difficult to fall asleep because her older sister was still up and wouldn't go to bed until midnight many people go to bed quite late in savong and they also get up quite late in the in the morning usually Faith woke up 9:00 on Sabbath mornings and she would run to the kitchen to see if grandfather was making pancakes he always was faith will put plates on the table for her breakfast grandfather would say get the maple syrup and butter ready too then she would sit down with him and grandmother to pray first they all would pray out loud together saying good God is good God is great

love and they tasted magical Faith needed to be at deep and wide by 2:00 in the afternoon that was when it started it started in the afternoon because many kids and parents went to bed late at night and got up late in the morning as 2: p.m. junor Faith would climb onto mother's four-wheeler everyone walked or drove on four-wheelers in the village on Sabbath faith and mother drove to deep and wide when they arrived Faith was welcomed by friendly woman who was no not an Alaska native like her and her family faith and faith and everyone else called The Woman by her first name Eloise she had moved to the Village from a far away North Carolina to teach at deep and wide and every Sabbath deep and wide began with singing Eloise would lead faith and other children in singing songs about Jesus but Faith was always waited for one song in particular then it would happen ELO will say next we're going to sing deep and wide Faith would clap her hands with joy then she would sing with all her heart she would she would lower her hands to show how deep was deep she would stretch out her arms to show how wide was wide she loved deep and wide after Eloise would pray and tell the children a Bible story after this story the children would do fun crafts and will do fun crafts and always will bring out a snack of apples or oranges Eloise loved apples and oranges they were special treat because the fruit didn't grow anywhere nearby and had to be flown into the Village from far away after about an hour deep and wide will finish and it would would be time for Faith to go home did you like saath school mother asked she took Faith by the hand Faith was nodded her head happily I love deep and wide she said today faith is 16 years old and she was never lost she was was never lost her love

Deeds you did at first his love is abundant there is no sin he can forgive just ask in the Name of Christ his love is abundant there is no sin he can forgive just ask in the Name of Christ good morning good afternoon and good evening my fellow Brethren my young people and friends from all over thank you for being for being able to join us today so as we continue on with this quarter's lesson today's story is very interesting in the lifetimes of Queen Esther and you know we get to realize that Esther and the Jews of paria faced lots of challenges an enemy that always wanted to finish them and and as you start and as we do just a brief intro of this lesson you get to understand that as ASA was trying to do the things that would please God there was rejection and there was lots of objection on the other hand and however something that we will learn more today Esther pursued in faith she she offered she understood her Mission so she went on did prayers prayed together with modai and together with the entire nation for three days and the fasting and then at the risk of her life she approached the king and as we pause a bit that is where the story starts I would want my fellow panelists to introduce themselves starting from my farthest left hello everyone my name is Baraka hi um my name is Amy hello everyone my name is Zea yeah so let me request um my sister to pray with us to start okay let's believe and pray our heavenly father we come before you this day we thank you for allowing us to be here as we begin our discussion on Esther I pray that you may be with us allow us to understand I pray this prayer believing and trusting in jesus' name amen amen amen yes so today's lesson equally also comes from prophet and kings that is chapter 49 in the times of Queen Esther and it was actually a very interesting story because you realize that today's story focuses more on that which happened at a time that almost all the Jews were finished at a time that there was a decree that was passed on and that kind of a decree should it not have been reversed or should not have Queen Esther um pleaded with the King then it was actually meant to finish and a number of the Jews were killed and these were people who believed in God however after Queen Esther came into place and and after the prayers and the fasting and and you know people rejoiced all over the nation and so as we try to focus and think about that where we be focusing on Esther you know Esther um chapter 5 I would want to to request um my sister to just guide us to to the whole doing section just we get to understand one or two questions from there okay so what do you think when I get something I prayed for I one am in awe that God has answered my request two I am grateful to God and anyone who helped me three I'm prun to forget that God is The Giver of every blessing and for so happy that I have to tell everybody about God's goodness so personally me um I'd go with the first one I am in awe that God has answered my request and this is because um a lot of times things seem very impossible and so whenever I see something that I've been praying for happen I'm just like oh you know it's it's it's good it's surprising in a way um yeah so Bara what what do you think what would you pick um for me I'd probably pick the third option that is I'm prone to forget that God is The Giver of every blessing and I think this has a lot to do with the fact that in life a lot of bad things happen and they tend to pull us further away from God right and so when you're really like down byed and going through it that's when you tend to forget all the things that God has done for you in the past yeah z uh personally I'd go with the first option I mean all that God answered my prayer request cuz most of the times I feel that as I pray it goes nowhere I just feel empty as I pray and when it's answered I feel special like he actually remembered me this time yeah yeah personally I think I'll take up the option of I'll grateful um to God and anyone who helped me I think this one is something that we don't actually face or see in our generation today whereby if someone's prayer request has been answered wow they will brag around the world and and they'll make sure all the enemies have known my friends even if you've been persecuted me my God has answered me and they'll tap on their shoulders and no one will not know about that so I think personally I'll be grateful and not only to God but even to those who help me pray you know there's a time if you guys can recall when Christ needed prayers and he called three of the disciples and they went alone on a hill somewhere to pray however even though the three Apostles slept Christ still continued on so I think for me gratitude is great gratitude is important and gratitude is where for me I I I would wish to take it up there because you know you remember the story of the lepers the 10 of them but only one came to say Thank you so I think we live in that generation whereby guys forget so quickly that something good has happened and yeah so I think I'll take that yeah thank you thank you for having led us to so I think as we continue on with the lesson it's very interesting that someone's prayer was answered so I would want to request my brother to take us through into the story just in brief tell us what prayer was answered you know today's focus is about something that was answered and how was it so maybe you can guide us through okay um so jumping right into the story we we pick off from the point where Esther has had several Banquets before and she mastered up the courage to go before the king and ask him that he should come and have a bank with her and so at this point in the story um Esther finally reveals the question or whatever's been bothering her this entire time to the king and it's the fact that Hammon was plotting to you know annihilate all of her people and so she she wanted something to be done about it and as you know previously in the story she had gotten not just herself but all the Jews who were in The Kingdom of Persia at the time to pray and even fast they put on sackcloth and so as far as what prayer was answered I'd say it's this prayer that God should spare all the Jews that were in the Kingdom of paja and so Esther goes before the king boldly and tells her that it's hymon that who's been plotting to you know annihilate all the Jews the king is shocked by this Revelation he feels somewhat betrayed cuz he trusted hmon to some extent and so he tells he orders for the death of hmon and Aon is put to death on The Gallows that he had prepared for morai yeah yeah thank you very much maybe as we try to think about that and as you prepare a question all to for us my brother you know when you read um prophet and Kings chapter 49 in the days of Queen Esa you get to learn so much and I think one thing that stood out for me even as you'll give us a summary is the fact that we are in a battle and it's the Battle of good against evil and we will be involved and we also realize that in our Quest towards winning and getting to the right direction we may face many challenges however maybe that could be a test of faith okay let me pause at that well in prophets and Kings chapter 49 gives a story of how Esther or the Israelites were in captivity and then King Cyrus came along and made a decree that they're free to leave and go back to their homes some Israelites went and some stayed in the captive land but I don't think staying in the captive land was part of God's plan cuz God fora the troubles to coming in the future then King darus came again and off the same decree of the Israelites can go back to their home some went another stay then came King King zis how how do you say that name zis King zaakis came along and or just maybe King X yeah yeah King X came along and he was influenced by hmon to kill the Jews and we if we look closer this is because modai a Jew refused to bow down to hmon which really pissed him off and he wanted to end the Jewish line like that and we see before all that happened God really wanted his people out of the captive land he even sent Zariah to come and tell them to leave the land before King s King X came along and when Cayman convinced the king X to kill the Jews we see Esther coming along and delivering them helping them in surviving the massacre of King X and according to Ellen Ellen J she states that the devil through hmon misled King X and was induced to make a decree providing the massacre of all Jews and she goes on and says that later did the king realized what was actually at play was Satan the hidden instigator of the scheme was trying to get rid of Earth those who preserved the knowledge of the true God so we see that this is a battle between God's people and the devil trying to get to us to God through us and she concludes by saying today as in the days of Esther and morai the Lord will vindicate his truth and his people just as in Esther she came through for her people using her help Raising Help from the King and from God too so yes that was the article from Kings and Prophets thank you maybe you can also take us through the flashlight and the Tuesday part which has a very interesting part and actually both of them are related yes the flashlight says give me a second um I bet as you prepare for that there is a verse in the punch lands that is in from 1 Corinthians 15:57 that says thanks be to God he gives us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ so we realize that we get the victory through Christ and also Psalms chapter 16:2 which he about it further says that when God With God we will gain the Victory and he will trample down our enemies all right I got the flashlight and it says the trying experiences that came to God's people in the days of Esther were not peculiar to that age alone The Same Spirit that in ages past led men to persecute the true church WIll in the future lead the pursuance of a similar course towards those who maintain their loyalty to God even now preparations are being made for this last great conflict and we are not left in doubt as to the issue today as in the days of Esther in modai the Lord will vindicate his truth and his people people prophets and Kings page 605 and on Tuesday the Tuesday part comes from the book of Psalms chapter 60 verse2 we I'll get into that later so the Tuesday part says that the flashlight quotes from the prophets and Kings tells us that the Bible believing Christians in the last days May face the same kinds of challenges that the Jews in Esther and modi's times faced God also promises that just as he did then he'll deliver his people God has many ways to bring Victory but he usually use uses faithful people like Esther who have the courage to turn up for right L three things you have learned from the story of Queen Esther that could help you in a situation in which you had to stand up for what you believe is right and and we are not left in doubt as to the issue is that it that's punch line I mean the punch line Psalms 6012 here yes Psalms 6012 it says with God we will gain the Victory and he will trample down our enemies good so what lessons do you learn from the victory of queing Esther in as you handle your daily lives maybe we can start with you and then yeah just as in the days of Esther the Jews were facing persecution and they didn't know what to do so in my life too there are sometimes I can feel that I'm at my absolute lowest and don't know where to go just as Esther turns to God and God give her the knowledge of how to handle a situation I can pick that from her and pray to God whenever I'm in doubt wherever in Conflict whatever I feel low I just pray to God ask for guidance and guide me through it yeah Emy let me twist the question a bit um like they're speaking about what you believe is right has it come to a point point that you stand for something this is what you believe is right but there is an objection and how do you move about that yeah objection okay so I stand let me see if I've gotten your question right so I stand for something I believe in this particular thing but then there's an objection yes from people they are like the majority don't support it you know this is right this is how things are supposed to be but the majority objecting and and similar case to what happened to Queen EXA no one seems to support that how do you go about it okay no it's not necessarily like objection but it's just like a very strange concept to them so a lot of people like I don't go to like a Christian school I go to like yeah so whenever I tell people that on Saturdays I spend my time in church it's a very very foreign concept to them and I know that the Sabbath is Saturday and all that then again to them they don't they don't fully grasp it they're just like why how who what you know it's just like a bunch of questions um are not understanding um yeah okay thank you so that means I think what I got from her response is that she'll still stand with her with her um stand and she will Mo she'll move on with that and have the faith You know despite the fact that no one seems to understand she will stand on her ground and allow ourselves not to be distracted by all about and then lastly to my brother how how will you handle that in the same situation you are trying to ex explain a concept that guys I think this is how things should be this is what has been written and you still seem to have no one support you how will you proceed on with the same um I think one important thing i' do is find ways in which I can ground myself more firmly into what I believe in so that even I don't find myself doubting cuz it's easy sometimes when everyone is against you to you know fold under all that pressure and so let's say for example if it's church that I'm very strong and I'm into church I would spend a lot of time reading the Bible and doing things that are that strengthen my spiritual walk and in that sense I could ground myself more firmly into to what I believe in yeah very true I think that's a very interesting point that at some point with too much objection with too much no support and you see the concept in this world we almost are living in a democracy even in church so it's by if the majority approve it then that is the way but you guys know for sure that looking backwards there is at no point that God may have worked with the majority mostly the major maity at some point they waving off so you realize that looking back even to the story of Gideon to the story of the 300 men you know there were so many they had to be minimized to 300 looking to the so many you realize that beyond all that God usually works with a minority those who realize they'll stand the truth because look at the stories that are moving around look at what the teenagers are facing look at what the young people are going through you come to a point realize that the stories that you share in your classes you know we have to do this it's about parties it's about all these things if you get to a point you may realize maybe I'm the one who is wrong maybe my stand is not pure it's not true and in the in the last of everything the last of the flesh the last of pride of life and the three things that have been mentioned in the Bible you find that maybe that is what is true so I get your point and I believe we need to be firm otherwise that which you believe in we may wait if you wait a little bit they will convince you and you guys know that the devil has been alive for so many years more than any of us so he understands and he knows that ah this one if I give him a certain kind of a thing he will just go down yeah so I think that's true so I want as we almost are winding up I want to request my sister to take us through a certain small illustration in her own words a small certain illustration that we get in the teachers's guide even as we are almost winding up okay so um Once Upon a Time so this like a while back people would watch um would watch like games or like matches or certain things um in person or live without knowing or expecting or without knowing what outcome would um would would come or like without knowing what to expect and I mean obviously in today's time we can still do that and we can um watch things live and be in person or watch them live when they're being streamed but you can you sort of um you can watch a pre-recorded version of the same thing once you have known a partic the the outcome or whatever like say like you've watched a football match no wait see like um there's a match that's going on Manchester United versus Liverpool or something like that and you know that um Manchester United has lost okay but you will still go back and watch the match and you'll be all excited and giddy about it but you know the outcome so yeah you I mean you're still thrilled with the outcome and whatnot so yeah yeah thank you for that thank you for taking us through that I think I'll I'll still want to to come back to today's lesson and the key text today was from Esther 5:3 so allow me to read it then the king asked what is it Queen Esther what is your question even up to half the kingdom it will be given to you let me come to my brother moaka what do you think about that key text alone let let me read it again then the king asked what is it Queen Esther what is your request even up to half the kingdom it will be given unto you what comes to mind when such kind of a feedback comes from a person in Authority a person who is a King someone who can say Let It Be and it be it becomes I think the first thing I think about is the fact that at this point it's very clear that Esther has managed to build some kind of trust some kind of favor with the King and so to the point where he's willing to offer even half the kingdom I believe it's very um brilliant that she despite the situation she was going through she had the she had it in her to be able to first off stay calm and like think it through and formulate a plan that would eventually lead to this outcome that is having the king's favor and if I believe if she didn't do that it would have been very difficult for the king to you know Grant her request and so yeah I think it's quite amazing that she was able to to build that trust to the king yeah thank you very much I think that's a well done point that we with faith when you have a certain focus and when you trust in God and by prayers then God will be able to guide you through and come through for you because I think it's in Proverbs 22:29 that says um you know that encourages us to succeed that said do you see a man who Exel in his work they will he will stand before Kings and not mean men so we have been challenged to Exel every other day and and if I was to go by Queen Esther's Excellence then I'll come to First Corinthians um first Thessalonians 5 verse 17 pray without season you know and the verse 18 that follows be anxious for nothing but in everything with prayer and supplication make known your request to God so both of them comes out nicely so I think as we wind up I would want to request my brother to take us through the wedes day part just read the first Corinthians 15:57 and just one or two things from that even as we do our Parting Shot First Corinthians 1557 and it says thanks be to God he gives us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ yes you can take us to a point maybe uh Wednesday it says read the Bible verse in the punch line which is 1 Corinthians 1557 uh h each of them is a promise of Victory choose your favorite promise from this list or another Bible verse you like about God giving us Victory and create a poster of it that you can display in your room near your computer or any place you look at often is it as a reminder that God is powerful enough to give you victory over any kind of enemy you face so which one will you put on your poster if you are to put one and as you do that maybe Emy you can read Romans 8:28 yeah okay Romans 8 verse 28 okay and we know that in all things God works for the good of those who love him who have been called according to his purpose thank you yeah so which one do you think you'll put up in the poster of the four or five vers is I'd go with Psalms 60:12 good thank you for that so what is do you have any Parting Shot maybe um in in a few seconds something you've learned today or something you'd like to leave with our viewer yes just like Esa Esther the way she looked up to God in a times of trouble we should also run to God in our times of trouble and if there's a possibility of overcoming that challenge by ourselves uh actually there's no possibility of overcoming a challenge by ourselves we always have to run to God and that's it thank you uh my brother par in short yeah I think I just like to leave us with um one of the verses in the punch lines that's Romans chapter 8: 37-39 which says in all these things we're more than conquerors through him who loved us for I am convinced that neither death nor life neither angels nor demon neither the present nor the future nor any powers neither height nor depth nor anything else in all of creation will be able to separate us from the love of God that is in Jesus Christ Our Lord in this lesson we've been talking about overcoming and conquering our adversities that we face in life and I think it's very important what this verse is reminding us that we will always overcome this absolutely nothing that we can go through in life that we'll be unable to overcome and this is simply because Jesus loves us it's just as simple as that because he loves us we're going to be conquerors regardless of whatever we go through yeah thank you my sister you have any few par in shot yes so I'd say prayer is a powerful tool prayer is very very powerful just the same way Esther was fasting and praying prayers powerful yeah yeah and mine will be from what she had read Romans 8:28 that when you are going through crisis and when it seems so difficult the only victory that can come is by trusting God praying and and above all remaining remaining someone who is focused you know focused in God focused on his word and even when it seems like there are no answers just be steadfast and God will surely come for you in Victory so I think to close I request my brother to close with a word of prayer let's pray dear God thank you for the lesson we've heard today please help us and analyze what we've learned thank you for all and may your will be done in just name we pray amen amen

[394.6s] good morning good afternoon and good
[396.8s] evening my fellow Brethren my young
[400.9s] people and friends from all over thank
[403.7s] you for being for being able to join us
[405.9s] today so as we continue on with this
[408.5s] quarter's lesson today's story is very
[411.0s] interesting in the lifetimes of Queen
[413.6s] Esther and you know we get to realize
[416.7s] that Esther and the Jews of paria faced
[421.0s] lots of challenges an enemy that always
[424.3s] wanted to finish them and and as you
[426.9s] start and as we do just a brief intro of
[430.2s] this lesson you get to understand that
[432.6s] as ASA was trying to do the things that
[436.2s] would please God there was rejection and
[439.3s] there was lots of objection on the other
[441.6s] hand and however something that we will
[445.2s] learn more today Esther pursued in faith
[449.2s] she she offered she understood her
[451.1s] Mission so she went on did prayers
[455.2s] prayed together with modai and together
[458.2s] with the entire nation for three days
[461.1s] and the fasting and then at the risk of
[465.6s] her life she approached the king and as
[469.4s] we pause a bit that is where the story
[472.0s] starts I would want my fellow panelists
[474.6s] to introduce themselves starting from my
[476.7s] farthest left
[480.0s] hello everyone my name is
[482.4s] Baraka hi um my name is
[485.4s] Amy hello everyone my name is Zea yeah
[489.2s] so let me request um my sister to pray
[491.8s] with us to start okay let's believe and
[494.6s] pray our heavenly father we come before
[497.2s] you this day we thank you for allowing
[498.7s] us to be here as we begin our discussion
[500.9s] on Esther I pray that you may be with us
[503.0s] allow us to understand I pray this
[505.0s] prayer believing and trusting in jesus'
[506.6s] name amen amen amen yes so today's
[510.0s] lesson equally also comes from prophet
[511.9s] and kings that is chapter 49 in the
[514.7s] times of Queen Esther and it was
[518.2s] actually a very interesting story
[519.6s] because you realize that today's story
[522.8s] focuses more on that which happened at a
[526.3s] time that almost all the Jews were
[529.4s] finished at a time that there was a
[531.5s] decree that was passed on and that kind
[534.0s] of a
[535.0s] decree should it not have been reversed
[537.6s] or should not have Queen Esther
[540.2s] um pleaded with the King then it was
[543.5s] actually meant to finish and a number of
[545.3s] the Jews were killed and these were
[546.8s] people who believed in God however after
[549.3s] Queen Esther came into place and and
[551.8s] after the prayers and the fasting and
[554.4s] and you know people rejoiced all over
[556.3s] the nation and so as we try to focus and
[559.2s] think about that where we be focusing on
[561.2s] Esther you know Esther um chapter 5 I
[564.7s] would want to to request um my sister to
[568.6s] just guide us to to the whole doing
[570.9s] section just we get to understand one or
[572.7s] two questions from there okay so what do
[575.7s] you think when I get something I prayed
[578.7s] for I one am in awe that God has
[582.0s] answered my request two I am grateful to
[585.8s] God and anyone who helped me three I'm
[589.6s] prun to forget that God is The Giver of
[593.1s] every blessing and for so happy that I
[597.0s] have to tell everybody about God's
[599.8s] goodness so personally me um I'd go with
[603.1s] the first one I am in awe that God has
[605.8s] answered my request and this is because
[609.0s] um a lot of times things seem very
[612.0s] impossible and so whenever I see
[615.5s] something that I've been praying for
[618.0s] happen I'm just like oh you know
[621.2s] it's it's it's good it's surprising in a
[625.4s] way um yeah so Bara what what do you
[630.0s] think what would you pick um for me I'd
[633.2s] probably pick the third option that is
[635.2s] I'm prone to forget that God is The
[637.0s] Giver of every blessing and I think this
[639.6s] has a lot to do with the fact that in
[642.1s] life a lot of bad things happen and they
[644.4s] tend to pull us further away from God
[648.3s] right and so when you're really like
[651.3s] down byed and going through it that's
[653.0s] when you tend to forget all the things
[654.9s] that God has done for you in the past
[658.4s] yeah
[661.2s] z uh personally I'd go with the first
[664.7s] option I mean all that God answered my
[668.3s] prayer request cuz most of the times I
[671.5s] feel that as I pray it goes nowhere I
[675.7s] just feel empty as I pray and when it's
[678.8s] answered I feel special like he actually
[682.0s] remembered me this time
[685.0s] yeah yeah personally I think I'll take
[687.6s] up the option of I'll
[690.1s] grateful um to God and anyone who helped
[694.3s] me I think this one is something that we
[696.6s] don't actually face or see in our
[699.2s] generation today whereby if someone's
[702.3s] prayer request has been answered wow
[705.4s] they will brag around the world and and
[708.3s] they'll make sure all the enemies have
[710.5s] known my friends even if you've been
[712.8s] persecuted me my God has answered me and
[715.1s] they'll tap on their shoulders and no
[717.2s] one will not know about that so I think
[719.3s] personally I'll be grateful and not only
[722.0s] to God but even to those who help me
[724.1s] pray you know there's a time if you guys
[726.3s] can recall when Christ needed prayers
[728.2s] and he called three of the disciples and
[730.3s] they went alone on a hill somewhere to
[733.1s] pray however even though the three
[735.5s] Apostles slept Christ still continued on
[738.6s] so I think for me gratitude is great
[742.0s] gratitude is important and gratitude is
[744.7s] where for me I I I would wish to take it
[747.6s] up there because you know you remember
[751.0s] the story of the lepers the 10 of them
[754.2s] but only one came to say Thank you so I
[756.6s] think we live in that generation whereby
[759.2s] guys forget so quickly that something
[761.7s] good has happened and yeah so I think
[764.2s] I'll take
[766.2s] that yeah thank you thank you for having
[768.6s] led us to so I think as we continue on
[770.6s] with the lesson it's very interesting
[773.1s] that someone's prayer was answered so I
[775.5s] would want to request my brother to take
[778.6s] us through
[780.1s] into the story just in brief tell us
[784.3s] what prayer was answered you know
[786.8s] today's focus is about something that
[789.4s] was answered and how was it so maybe you
[791.4s] can guide us
[792.7s] through okay um so jumping right into
[796.1s] the story we we pick off from the point
[798.6s] where Esther has had several Banquets
[802.2s] before and
[803.4s] she mastered up the courage to go before
[806.1s] the king and ask him that he should come
[808.1s] and have a bank with her and so at this
[810.8s] point in the story um Esther finally
[814.5s] reveals the question or whatever's been
[816.8s] bothering her this entire time to the
[819.1s] king and it's the fact that Hammon was
[822.9s] plotting to you know annihilate all of
[825.5s] her people and so she she wanted
[828.7s] something to be done about it and as you
[832.0s] know previously in the story she had
[833.9s] gotten not just herself but all the Jews
[836.9s] who were in The Kingdom of Persia at the
[838.6s] time to pray and even fast they put on
[841.5s] sackcloth and so as far as what prayer
[844.3s] was answered I'd say it's this prayer
[846.3s] that God should spare all the Jews that
[848.6s] were in the Kingdom of
[850.1s] paja and
[852.2s] so Esther goes before the king boldly
[856.0s] and tells her that it's hymon that who's
[857.7s] been plotting to you know annihilate all
[860.3s] the Jews the king is shocked by this
[863.5s] Revelation he feels somewhat betrayed
[865.7s] cuz he trusted hmon to some extent and
[868.2s] so he tells he orders for the death of
[871.5s] hmon and Aon is put to death on The
[874.0s] Gallows that he had prepared for
[876.6s] morai
[878.5s] yeah yeah thank you very much maybe as
[882.3s] we try to think about that and as you
[884.2s] prepare a question all to for us my
[886.9s] brother you know when you read
[890.6s] um prophet and Kings chapter 49 in the
[893.7s] days of Queen Esa you get to learn so
[896.1s] much and I think one thing that stood
[898.0s] out for me even as you'll give us a
[899.7s] summary is the fact that we are in a
[902.8s] battle and it's the Battle of good
[905.7s] against evil and we will be involved and
[908.8s] we also realize that in our Quest
[911.7s] towards winning and getting to the right
[914.4s] direction we may face many challenges
[917.3s] however maybe that could be a test of
[919.4s] faith okay let me pause at that well in
[923.0s] prophets and Kings chapter 49 gives a
[926.0s] story of how Esther or the Israelites
[929.0s] were in captivity and then King Cyrus
[931.8s] came along and made a decree that
[933.9s] they're free to leave and go back to
[936.2s] their homes some Israelites went and
[938.4s] some stayed in the captive land but I
[941.5s] don't think staying in the captive land
[943.0s] was part of God's plan cuz God fora the
[946.2s] troubles to coming in the future then
[948.8s] King darus came again and off the same
[951.6s] decree of the Israelites can go back to
[954.2s] their home some went another stay then
[957.4s] came King King zis how how do you say
[962.2s] that name zis King zaakis came along and
[967.7s] or just maybe King X yeah yeah King X
[970.0s] came along
[971.6s] and he was influenced by hmon to kill
[976.0s] the Jews and we if we look closer this
[979.8s] is because modai a Jew refused to bow
[983.5s] down to hmon which really pissed him off
[987.2s] and he wanted to end the Jewish line
[989.2s] like that and we see before all that
[992.7s] happened God really wanted his people
[995.2s] out of the captive land he even sent
[997.4s] Zariah to come and tell them to leave
[999.8s] the land before King s King X came along
[1003.7s] and when Cayman convinced the king X to
[1008.5s] kill the Jews we see Esther coming along
[1012.1s] and delivering them helping them in
[1016.2s] surviving the massacre of King X and
[1020.9s] according to Ellen Ellen J she states
[1025.2s] that the devil through hmon misled King
[1029.1s] X and was induced to make a decree
[1031.2s] providing the massacre of all Jews and
[1033.7s] she goes on and says that later did the
[1035.8s] king realized what was actually at play
[1038.5s] was Satan the hidden instigator of the
[1040.9s] scheme was trying to get rid of Earth
[1044.6s] those who preserved the knowledge of the
[1046.1s] true
[1046.9s] God so we see that this is a battle
[1050.5s] between God's people and the devil
[1053.4s] trying to get to us to God through us
[1057.5s] and she concludes by
[1060.5s] saying today as in the days of Esther
[1063.0s] and morai the Lord will vindicate his
[1065.3s] truth and his people just as in Esther
[1068.7s] she came through for her people using
[1072.1s] her help Raising Help from the King and
[1075.6s] from God too so yes that was the
[1080.6s] article from Kings and Prophets thank
[1083.1s] you maybe you can also take us through
[1084.7s] the flashlight and the Tuesday part
[1086.4s] which has a very interesting part and
[1088.2s] actually both of them are
[1090.3s] related yes the
[1093.8s] flashlight
[1097.3s] says give me a
[1106.2s] second um I bet as you prepare for that
[1109.7s] there is a verse in the punch lands that
[1112.4s] is in from 1 Corinthians
[1114.6s] 15:57 that says thanks be to God he
[1117.4s] gives us the victory through our Lord
[1119.6s] Jesus Christ so we realize that we get
[1122.2s] the victory through Christ and also
[1124.3s] Psalms chapter 16:2 which he about it
[1127.2s] further says that when God With God we
[1130.3s] will gain the Victory and he will
[1132.2s] trample down our
[1134.6s] enemies all right I got the flashlight
[1137.6s] and it says the trying experiences that
[1140.4s] came to God's people in the days of
[1141.9s] Esther were not peculiar to that age
[1144.0s] alone The Same Spirit that in ages past
[1147.6s] led men to persecute the true church
[1150.3s] WIll in the future lead the pursuance of
[1152.3s] a similar course towards those who
[1154.3s] maintain their loyalty to God even now
[1157.1s] preparations are being made for this
[1159.1s] last great conflict and we are not left
[1161.8s] in doubt as to the issue today as in the
[1165.2s] days of Esther in modai the Lord will
[1167.3s] vindicate his truth and his people
[1168.7s] people prophets and Kings page
[1172.8s] 605 and on
[1175.2s] Tuesday the Tuesday part comes from the
[1178.6s] book of Psalms chapter 60
[1182.5s] verse2 we I'll get into that later so
[1185.9s] the Tuesday part says that the
[1187.8s] flashlight quotes from the prophets and
[1190.0s] Kings tells us that the Bible believing
[1192.7s] Christians in the last days May face the
[1195.0s] same kinds of challenges that the Jews
[1196.6s] in Esther and modi's times faced
[1199.3s] God also promises that just as he did
[1201.4s] then he'll deliver his people God has
[1204.3s] many ways to bring Victory but he
[1206.3s] usually use uses faithful people like
[1208.3s] Esther who have the courage to turn up
[1209.9s] for right L three things you have
[1212.5s] learned from the story of Queen Esther
[1214.1s] that could help you in a situation in
[1215.6s] which you had to stand up for what you
[1217.4s] believe is
[1218.4s] right
[1220.8s] and and we are not left in doubt as to
[1223.5s] the
[1224.6s] issue is that it that's punch line I
[1227.5s] mean the punch line Psalms 6012
[1231.0s] here yes Psalms 6012 it says with God we
[1235.9s] will gain the Victory and he will
[1237.5s] trample down our
[1239.2s] enemies good so what lessons do you
[1242.1s] learn from the victory of queing Esther
[1245.6s] in as you handle your daily lives maybe
[1248.0s] we can start with you and then yeah just
[1251.5s] as in the days of Esther the Jews were
[1253.5s] facing persecution and they didn't know
[1256.1s] what to do so in my life too there are
[1259.6s] sometimes I can feel that I'm at my
[1262.3s] absolute lowest and don't know where to
[1264.6s] go just as Esther turns to God and God
[1267.8s] give her the knowledge of how to handle
[1269.1s] a situation I can pick that from her and
[1273.4s] pray to God whenever I'm in doubt
[1275.0s] wherever in Conflict whatever I feel low
[1277.2s] I just pray to God ask for guidance and
[1279.2s] guide me through it yeah Emy let me
[1281.9s] twist the question a bit um like they're
[1285.2s] speaking about what you believe is right
[1287.6s] has it come to a point point that you
[1289.8s] stand for something this is what you
[1291.7s] believe is right but there is an
[1294.1s] objection and how do you move about that
[1298.7s] yeah
[1300.3s] objection okay so I stand let me see if
[1302.5s] I've gotten your question right so I
[1304.6s] stand for something I believe in this
[1307.5s] particular thing but then there's an
[1310.4s] objection yes from people they are like
[1313.2s] the majority don't support it you know
[1315.5s] this is right this is how things are
[1317.0s] supposed to be but the majority
[1318.8s] objecting and and similar case to what
[1321.1s] happened to Queen EXA no one seems to
[1323.4s] support that how do you go about it okay
[1326.3s] no it's not necessarily like objection
[1329.2s] but it's just like a very strange
[1331.5s] concept to them so a lot of people like
[1334.5s] I don't go to like a Christian school I
[1337.2s] go to like yeah so whenever I tell
[1340.8s] people that on Saturdays I spend my time
[1343.5s] in church it's a very very foreign
[1345.5s] concept to them and I know that the
[1348.6s] Sabbath is Saturday and all that then
[1352.2s] again to them they don't they don't
[1355.4s] fully grasp it they're just like why how
[1358.9s] who what you know it's just like a bunch
[1361.4s] of questions um are not
[1364.6s] understanding um yeah okay thank you so
[1368.9s] that means I think what I got from her
[1370.9s] response is that she'll still stand with
[1372.6s] her with her um stand and she will Mo
[1375.6s] she'll move on with that and have the
[1377.3s] faith You know despite the fact that no
[1379.2s] one seems to understand she will stand
[1381.4s] on her ground and allow ourselves not to
[1384.0s] be distracted by all about and then
[1386.6s] lastly to my brother how how will you
[1390.1s] handle that in the same situation you
[1391.9s] are trying to ex explain a concept that
[1394.4s] guys I think this is how things should
[1396.5s] be this is what has been written and you
[1399.3s] still seem to have no one support you
[1401.6s] how will you proceed on with the
[1404.0s] same um I think one important thing i'
[1407.3s] do is find ways in which I can ground
[1410.6s] myself more firmly into what I believe
[1413.0s] in so that even I don't find myself
[1416.6s] doubting cuz it's easy sometimes when
[1418.6s] everyone is against you to you know fold
[1421.6s] under all that pressure and so let's say
[1423.9s] for example if it's church that I'm very
[1427.0s] strong and I'm into church I would spend
[1429.1s] a lot of time reading the Bible and
[1431.0s] doing things that are that strengthen my
[1434.5s] spiritual walk and in that sense I could
[1436.7s] ground myself more firmly into to what I
[1439.2s] believe in yeah very true I think that's
[1442.2s] a very interesting point that at some
[1444.6s] point with too much objection with too
[1447.8s] much no support and you see the concept
[1449.8s] in this world we almost are living in a
[1452.0s] democracy even in church so it's by if
[1454.8s] the majority approve it then that is the
[1457.4s] way but you guys know for sure that
[1460.8s] looking backwards there is at no point
[1464.4s] that God may have worked with the
[1466.8s] majority mostly the major maity at some
[1469.3s] point they waving off so you realize
[1472.2s] that looking back even to the story of
[1474.1s] Gideon to the story of the 300 men you
[1476.5s] know there were so many they had to be
[1477.9s] minimized to 300 looking to the so many
[1481.1s] you realize that beyond all that God
[1483.2s] usually works with a minority those who
[1485.6s] realize they'll stand the truth because
[1487.6s] look at the stories that are moving
[1488.9s] around look at what the teenagers are
[1491.1s] facing look at what the young people are
[1492.9s] going through you come to a point
[1495.0s] realize that the stories that you share
[1496.5s] in your classes you know we have to do
[1498.6s] this it's about parties it's about all
[1500.3s] these things if you get to a point you
[1503.3s] may realize maybe I'm the one who is
[1506.2s] wrong maybe my stand is not pure it's
[1509.7s] not true and in the in the last of
[1513.4s] everything the last of the flesh the
[1515.3s] last of pride of life and the three
[1517.4s] things that have been mentioned in the
[1519.3s] Bible you find that maybe that is what
[1522.5s] is true so I get your point and I
[1525.1s] believe we need to be firm otherwise
[1528.4s] that which you believe in we may wait if
[1531.1s] you wait a little bit they will convince
[1533.3s] you and you guys know that the devil has
[1535.5s] been alive for so many years more than
[1538.7s] any of us so he understands and he knows
[1541.2s] that ah this one if I give him a certain
[1544.3s] kind of a thing he will just go down
[1547.3s] yeah so I think that's true so I want as
[1549.4s] we almost are winding up I want to
[1552.2s] request my sister to take us through a
[1554.1s] certain small illustration in her own
[1556.6s] words a small certain illustration that
[1559.2s] we get in the teachers's guide even as
[1561.3s] we are almost winding
[1563.5s] up okay
[1566.0s] so um Once Upon a Time so this like a
[1570.1s] while back people would watch
[1573.8s] um would watch like games or like
[1576.9s] matches or certain things um in person
[1581.2s] or live without knowing or expecting or
[1585.4s] without knowing what outcome would um
[1589.2s] would would come or like without knowing
[1591.5s] what to
[1593.0s] expect and I mean obviously in today's
[1596.2s] time we can still do that and we can
[1600.4s] um watch things live and be in person or
[1604.5s] watch them live when they're being
[1606.1s] streamed but you can you sort of
[1612.6s] um you can watch a pre-recorded version
[1616.5s] of the same thing once you have known a
[1621.1s] partic the the outcome or whatever like
[1624.0s] say like you've watched a football
[1626.5s] match no wait see like um there's a
[1629.9s] match that's going on Manchester United
[1631.8s] versus Liverpool or something like that
[1634.0s] and you know that um Manchester United
[1636.7s] has
[1638.3s] lost okay but you will still go back and
[1641.0s] watch the match and you'll be all
[1643.7s] excited and giddy about it but you know
[1647.2s] the outcome
[1649.8s] so yeah you I mean you're still thrilled
[1653.9s] with the outcome and whatnot so
[1658.2s] yeah yeah thank you for that thank you
[1660.4s] for taking us through that I think I'll
[1663.2s] I'll still want to to come back to
[1666.0s] today's lesson and the key text today
[1669.1s] was from Esther
[1671.2s] 5:3 so allow me to read it then the king
[1674.2s] asked what is it Queen Esther what is
[1677.7s] your question
[1679.0s] even up to half the kingdom it will be
[1683.6s] given to you let me come to my brother
[1688.4s] moaka what do you think about that key
[1690.6s] text alone let let me read it again then
[1693.4s] the king asked what is it Queen Esther
[1696.2s] what is your request even up to half the
[1698.8s] kingdom it will be given unto you what
[1702.0s] comes to mind when such kind of a
[1703.8s] feedback comes from a person in
[1706.0s] Authority a person who is a King someone
[1709.0s] who can say Let It Be and it be it
[1712.9s] becomes I think the first thing I think
[1715.4s] about is the fact that at this point
[1718.5s] it's very clear that Esther has managed
[1721.0s] to build some kind of trust some kind of
[1723.8s] favor with the King and so to the point
[1726.5s] where he's willing to offer even half
[1728.2s] the kingdom I believe it's very um
[1731.8s] brilliant that she despite the situation
[1735.5s] she was going through she had the she
[1737.5s] had it in her to be able to first off
[1739.8s] stay calm and like think it through and
[1742.0s] formulate a plan that would eventually
[1744.1s] lead to this outcome that is having the
[1747.7s] king's favor and if I believe if she
[1749.8s] didn't do that it would have been very
[1752.1s] difficult for the king to you know Grant
[1754.1s] her request and so yeah I think it's
[1757.0s] quite amazing that she was able to to
[1759.4s] build that trust to the king yeah thank
[1762.5s] you very much I think that's a well done
[1765.4s] point that we with faith when you have a
[1771.8s] certain focus and when you trust in God
[1775.4s] and by prayers then God will be able to
[1778.0s] guide you through and come through for
[1779.7s] you because I think it's in Proverbs
[1782.3s] 22:29 that says um you know that
[1785.3s] encourages us to succeed that said do
[1787.4s] you see a man who Exel in his work they
[1791.0s] will he will stand before Kings and not
[1793.8s] mean men so we have been challenged to
[1796.0s] Exel every other day and and if I was to
[1798.6s] go by Queen Esther's Excellence then
[1801.1s] I'll come to First Corinthians um first
[1804.7s] Thessalonians 5 verse 17 pray without
[1808.0s] season you know and the verse 18 that
[1810.6s] follows be anxious for nothing but in
[1813.8s] everything with prayer and
[1815.8s] supplication make known your request to
[1818.3s] God so both of them comes out nicely so
[1821.4s] I think as we wind up I would want to
[1823.2s] request my brother to take us through
[1825.6s] the wedes day part just read the first
[1828.0s] Corinthians
[1829.2s] 15:57 and just one or two things from
[1831.7s] that even as we do our Parting Shot
[1835.2s] First Corinthians 1557 and it says
[1838.7s] thanks be to God he gives us the victory
[1841.2s] through our Lord Jesus
[1845.6s] Christ yes you can take us to a point
[1848.7s] maybe uh Wednesday it says read the
[1852.3s] Bible verse in the punch line which is 1
[1854.4s] Corinthians
[1855.8s] 1557 uh h each of them is a promise of
[1859.7s] Victory choose your favorite promise
[1862.8s] from this list or another Bible verse
[1865.3s] you like about God giving us Victory and
[1867.8s] create a poster of it that you can
[1869.4s] display in your room near your computer
[1871.7s] or any place you look at often is it as
[1874.0s] a reminder that God is powerful enough
[1875.7s] to give you victory over any kind of
[1877.5s] enemy you face so which one will you put
[1880.6s] on your poster if you are to put one and
[1883.3s] as you do that maybe Emy you can read
[1886.1s] Romans 8:28
[1892.3s] yeah
[1893.8s] okay Romans 8 verse
[1902.0s] 28 okay and we know that in all things
[1905.3s] God works for the good of those who love
[1907.3s] him who have been called according to
[1910.0s] his
[1911.3s] purpose thank you yeah so which one do
[1913.6s] you
[1914.4s] think you'll put up in the poster of the
[1917.0s] four or five vers is I'd go with Psalms
[1921.0s] 60:12 good thank you for that so what is
[1924.1s] do you have any Parting Shot maybe um in
[1927.4s] in a few seconds something you've
[1928.9s] learned today or something you'd like to
[1931.3s] leave with our viewer
[1934.2s] yes just like Esa
[1937.7s] Esther the way she looked up to God in a
[1940.8s] times of trouble we should also run to
[1943.9s] God in our times of
[1945.6s] trouble and if there's
[1948.9s] a
[1949.9s] possibility of overcoming that challenge
[1953.3s] by
[1955.9s] ourselves uh actually there's no
[1957.7s] possibility of overcoming a challenge by
[1959.2s] ourselves we always have to run to God
[1961.4s] and that's it thank you uh my brother
[1964.2s] par in short yeah I think I just like to
[1966.6s] leave us with um one of the verses in
[1968.9s] the punch lines that's Romans chapter 8:
[1972.7s] 37-39 which says in all these things
[1975.8s] we're more than conquerors through him
[1977.3s] who loved us for I am convinced that
[1979.7s] neither death nor life neither angels
[1982.0s] nor demon neither the present nor the
[1984.3s] future nor any powers neither height nor
[1987.6s] depth nor anything else in all of
[1990.3s] creation will be able to separate us
[1992.1s] from the love of God that is in Jesus
[1994.1s] Christ Our Lord in this lesson we've
[1996.0s] been talking about overcoming and
[1998.0s] conquering our adversities that we face
[2000.6s] in life and I think it's very important
[2003.5s] what this verse is reminding us that we
[2006.4s] will always overcome this absolutely
[2008.5s] nothing that we can go through in life
[2010.4s] that we'll be unable to overcome and
[2012.5s] this is simply because Jesus loves us
[2016.2s] it's just as simple as that because he
[2018.3s] loves us we're going to be conquerors
[2020.2s] regardless of whatever we go through
[2022.6s] yeah thank you my sister you have any
[2025.8s] few par in shot yes so I'd say prayer is
[2029.9s] a powerful tool prayer is very very
[2032.8s] powerful just the same way Esther was
[2036.3s] fasting and praying prayers powerful
[2039.1s] yeah yeah and mine will be from what she
[2042.1s] had read Romans 8:28 that when you are
[2044.7s] going through crisis and when it seems
[2047.0s] so difficult the only victory that can
[2049.4s] come is by trusting God praying and and
[2052.7s] above all remaining remaining someone
[2055.7s] who is focused you know focused in God
[2057.9s] focused on his word and even when it
[2060.5s] seems like there are no answers just be
[2063.4s] steadfast and God will surely come for
[2065.3s] you in Victory so I think to close I
[2068.0s] request my brother to close with a word
[2071.4s] of
[2072.1s] prayer let's
[2074.1s] pray dear God thank you for the lesson
[2076.6s] we've heard today please help us and
[2078.9s] analyze what we've learned thank you for
[2081.2s] all and may your will be done in just
[2082.9s] name we pray amen amen
