we have final appeal I hope you enjoy and please be attentive thank you hello today's Mission Reading comes from all the way from Alaska and it's titled homesick but not alone with her main character Olivia Olivia first went to an Alaskan Summer Camp when she was 11 years old she lived far away from Camp Polaris and she felt so homesick on her first day at Camp she missed her dog cie I want to go home she told her father as he dropped her off you're fine he replied with a kind smile then he left and Olivia faced a whole week without her dog the afternoon was rainy trains often in Alaskan Summers Olivia tried to stay dry that evening the children ate supper and had Worship in the main Lodge after that Olivia followed seven girls and their camp counselor whose name was Miss Joel to the cabin for the night it was then that things got interesting Miss Joel opened her Bible and read a story about patience the girls listened from their bunk beds or on the floor then the counselor asked if the girls had any prayer requests Olivia's hand shot up please pray for me not to be homesick and for my dog to be okay at home she said other girls wanted to pray for their parents and families some wanted to pray for themselves they had friends back at home who took drugs and they didn't want to get mixed up in that then Miss Joel asked if anyone wanted to volunteer to pray two girls raised their hands today was such a good day one girl prayed help us to sleep well amen the second girl's prayer also was short she hadn't liked the Rainy afternoon please make it sunny she prayed Miss Joel also offered a short prayer thank thank you for the good day she said help us to have a good day tomorrow please make the weather good the girls crawled into bed and Miss Joel came back came around to tuck them in when she came to Olivia she said Hey Olivia can I pray with you yes please please Olivia said Miss Joel prayed saying dear Lord thank you for Olivia that she's in that she's my camper that we came to camp and that we had a good day today help her to sleep well and to have a good day tomorrow amen then she moved to the next girl Olivia felt so loved she had felt sad and lonely so far from her dog and her home but she couldn't but she could see God's love shining through the counselor's caring words and kind Deeds finally all the girls fell asleep except Olivia in the dark cabin she reflected back on her first day at Camp it hadn't been so bad she wondered what would happen the next day would it be rainy or would it be sunny what would she eat for breast breakfast she loved breakfast especially if it included eggs but she also liked break breakfast burritos and pancakes what games would she and other children play after breakfast or would she make new friends and talk to them with those thoughts Olivia drifted off to sleep it turned out to be a great week at Camp pois before she knew it the week was over and she was back at home with her father and her dog cie Olivia loved the camp so much that she went back the next year and the next today she's 17 years old and works as a counselor at comp pois she goes to the girls Bank beds at night and prays for them and loves them just like her counselor did when she was 11 she wants all the children to know just how much God loves them part of a previous 13th Sabbath offering went to Camp Polaris to help improve it and new cabins and add new cabins and real toilets and showers Olivia and the children at campis are grateful to all the children and adults who give to that 13th Sabbath offering you can help

day oh good morning good afternoon and good evening to whichever part of the world you're joining us from Welcome to the sixth lesson of the fourth quarter of the teens Cornerstone lesson but before we begin I'd like our panelist to introduce themselves starting from my left hello everyone my name is Mikel Flex hi everyone my name is Cynthia Aon hi everyone my name is Timothy Kuka and my name is jonan magana but before we get in again I'd like to ask to get a word of prayer okay let's pray for the we thank you for this time that you want to spend learning more from your word dear Lord we pray that these words may have an impact on our lives and that we may not be the same that they may draw us closer unto you dear Lord this is my humble request believing and trusting in Jesus holy name amen amen thank you Timothy um a story is told of Alexander the Great he was the greatest king of Greece and one time during his many conquests he was traversing with his army through the desert so they were marching for 2 weeks no water and at one point they were very thirsty then his Couts went ahead and found water in an noasis but it was very little water could barely fit a ball and they brought it to him and he did a very strange thing he poured all the water on the ground all right so everyone in the Army wondered why is he doing that and he said something very interesting there is no need for one person to drink water while everyone else is thirstday now that portrays leadership which is what we're going to be studying in our lesson today and we're going to be studying in contrast not Alexander but someone called Ezra now Alexander the Great his leadership style was all about himself glory for him glory for Greece but Ezra as we'll see in our lesson Ezra was all about God right and Ezra is known because he's the one who tried to convince the Israelites to go back home from captivity now you can just go to our what do you think section okay like to ask us a question do you like coming home you guys like going home of course you do of course yeah definitely right definitely no place like home right yeah and there's nothing like coming home right after a long time away so you can imagine how the Israelites felt coming back to their place 70 years later probably some people had never seen this place called Israel and now here they are right um we have a question right uh just read from Ezra 7:10 before I get the question Ezra 7:10 says for Ezra had prepared his heart to seek the law of the Lord and to do it and to teach statutes and ordinances in Israel God gives us various gifts right to all members of the church there's preaching there's te teaching they's singing There's working miracles and all those other gifts right and God wants us to use them for his own glory and to build his church and his people all right so we're going to be seeing more and more of this in our lesson today so a question to a panel in what ways has God placed you in a position to influence those around you we're talking about leadership how in your life looking back how do you see yourself being at a point of influence um personally I feel like everyone has a point of influence in their life because when people think about leadership it's it sounds abstract it sounds like I have to nominate you to be uh the ruler or or the CEO or something like that but technically even your friends you have an influence there right so I have been an influence through my friends through school um leadership positions and through even in my family you're a leader in every way in every aspect everyone is a leader you don't have to be nominated or appointed to be one true thank you for that Flex any insights um I think for me is when I was in high school yeah I got to that point when I wasn't chosen but then the majority pointed out Cynthia should be the leader yeah and I think at that point you really need to portray uh God's leadership style yeah cuz at that point you need to be honest you need to be straightforward and you also need to have that mercy and companion when you're actually serving other people yeah cuz leadership is not about um me it's about them I'm supposed to be serving them and when you're leading people you're supposed to lead them in a way that reaches to them you see true thank you for that Timothy maybe I just add as she has correctly mentioned leadership is all about service we know the story of Christ and Christ actually is the greatest leader that ever lived but according to the view of the world some might think he was like a slave or a servant but really even when the time when he was washing the disciples feet he was trying to point out that me being sort of your leader or your father or your brother doesn't mean I'm sort of like greater than you it means that I'm in this position to serve you so I think a lesson for us is leadership is all about service it's not about exerting your Authority on a group of people but it's about service and importantly it's about influence if you can influence a group of people to think in a particular way that will draw them closer to God I think that is leadership in its greatest form true thanks for that and uh Christ was the best you know example of leadership and uh we told in the book Christ subjects lesson says that um Christ method alone will achieve true success in reaching out to the people the Savior mingled with men as one who desire their good minister to their needs War their confidence and then now B them follow me it's by me ministering to people serving them is the only way between their confidence and influence them towards God thank you for your insights amen so we'll move straight to our story for today which uh comes from the book of Ezra chapter 7 so for those who don't have the lessons you can just open the book of Ezra chapter 7 in your Bibles we'll have Sy the iron just give us a summary of what the story talks about okay so the story is really interesting and then it starts with a genealogy of E son of sah son of it's a very long genealogy and then one thing I really want to point out is the way Ezra's character comes out and I'll just read it it says Ezra came up from Babylon he was a teacher well versed in the law of Moses which the Lord the god of Israel had given and then one thing about Ezra is in this story we realize that Ezra gained favor in the sight of the king you see and then because of that favor the king had granted him so many of his requests and in this uh story we see Ezra uh taking the people and leading them back to Jerusalem but then before that just to take you back so that you can have some Concepts uh Ezra had to request some of them cuz when initially he called them the number was so few he was H this can't be right so he really had to go pointing out to people especially the Levites the Levites were not here and we I think by now we know that the Levites were the ones who were running the the service so he had to go and call them and now when they reached Jerusalem there was a very huge problem these people didn't know the statutes of God and the reason was they had been they had intermarried true so basically that's the story and I think with this panel we'll be able to learn more about it all right thank you yeah all right so we can just proceed as well to just answer some of the questions from the out of the story section can just lead us to that as well oh yeah so I just ask some questions uh so why do you think the genealogy um of Ezra all through why do you think it was really brought out in this story maybe to show to show that he was the under the geneology of iron right is to bring out that he was the descendant of the um the high priest the yeah so it's like kind of showing us that he was the the high priest for that time okay maybe just to add on that I think also the reason why it was important for us to to understand that as came from the genealogy of Aon is because you read the spirit of Prophecy it explains that after Aon really the high priests that were Ser in service really did not follow God fully so there's a lot of immorality there's a lot of blasphemy in the church and the high priests they asked for money from people in order to advance their own things but you see now Ezra comes in and Ezra is this character that is very excellent and diligent is this person that is really serving God truthfully so I think the reason why this geny was mentioned is so that we get to understand that despite the wrongdoings of the ancestors before Ezra he decided in his heart that he was going to change and make a difference true true I agree with that yeah I think with what Timothy has said uh the genealogy was important to show us that you can change your story yeah doesn't mean that now because in the past history your ancestors have done um some terrible stuff it's up to you to take that gift cuz each one of us has a gift so it's up to to you to take that gift and use it for God's will so yeah amen all right I think that uh it can apply to the teens you know people um tend to stick to wrong behaviors because they say this is how I was born this is who I am but you always have a chance to change that that's what we read with Ezra's genealogy thank you for that you can proceed well the scripture story tells us that Ezra was a teacher well vered with the law of Moses so what does that tell us about about the attributes of a spiritual leader um I can tie that to the verse Paul talks about you know study to show thyself a Workman who is approved of God rightly dividing the word of Truth which basically means if you work for God it means you need to understand what God wants who God is and that can only be learned through the Bible yeah so he needed to understand really who God is before he teaches other people you can't teach something you don't know something you don't understand yeah just to add sorry I think as a spiritual leader you as Ezra was he was well versed meaning he took the time to study and to really understand what the scriptures meant because just an example let's say you're a lecturer in a class and you have no idea of what you're teaching really there's no way you'll teach your students and expect them to understand so just to apply that to the spiritual aspect as well as Christians or as Adventists in the last days we are to go into to Mission and to preach un to others about the second coming of Christ but this can only happen if we have fully understood what it means to be an Adventist what it means about Christ coming so it calls us to actually spend time dig deep into the word of God understand the word of God so that we are thoroughly equipped for every good work and so that even as we go forth preaching we can preach things that we know things that we have read and understood and internalized true thank you for that and I think the last question I really want to ask is now with this passage yeah it tells us about God and about us so and about our relationship with God so how how can we apply this story of Ezra in our lives today yeah like you have insights um maybe one way we can apply it is that you need to realize that in every aspect you're a leader so you cannot influence anyone if you do not have the material like we've just we've just seen that Ezra took time to study the scriptures to go through the word of God and the laws of Moses so in our personal lives we have to take time for ourselves and he accepted this this is something that he chose willingly so in our lives we have to accept it for ourselves and actually go study the scriptures so that as we are going out there in uh in school at work at at home we are we're portraying Christ we're portraying his his word in in real in real form in in a sense thank you for that uh thanks so much Cynthia so I think we can read Proverbs Chapter 9:1 I'll read the verse as uh as Flex will take us through the Monday section so Proverbs 9:10 very common verse it says the fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom and the knowledge of the Holy one is understanding now based on this um Flex what can you tell us from the Monday section as well TI to this verse so the M section is basically say that Ezra is the key to the story in that by devoting himself he first accepted and and and chose to go and do the will of God he had the he had reverence for the Lord he had the fear of of the Lord which brought him um wisdom right and the knowledge of he of the Holy One if I'm not wrong brings understanding right and that only came through by actually searching the scripture he was being abaran he was going through the books and he brought so much wisdom and understanding cuz he combined the two that he was able to lead the Israelites in such a magnificent way that everyone could see that there's something different about this guy everyone wanted to follow him it was like it was like Christ his way and his life was so attuned to God it was so attuned to the to the holy spirit that even by just a glance at him you can already tell there's something different about this man so that's what is basically uh talking us telling us uh what's about um not only I can read something not only did Ezra care but he moved as soon as he was asked to move he became what God needed him to be a leader and helped change the course of history true thank you for that Ezra saw an opportunity where his skills were needed his gift from God was needed and he rose up to the challenge and actually just took it remember this guy at this point he he was just one of the normal Israelites right he wasn't chosen by the Israelites to be their leader but he saw leadership is needed here and I have the skills to do it and rose up to the challenge thank you for that Flex uh I'll ask Timothy to read for us the flashlight as he gives us some insights on U the Tuesday part we can just scroll to the flashlight okay so the flashlight reads born of the sons of Aaron Ezra had been given a priy training and in addition to this he had acquired a a familiarity with the writings of The Magicians the astrologers and the wise men of the moparian realm but he was not satisfied with the spiritual condition he longed to be in full harmony with God he longed for wisdom to carry out the Divine will and so he prepared his heart to seek the love of the Lord and to do it this led him to apply himself diligently to a study of the history of God's people as recorded in the writings of the prophets and Kings he searched the historical and poetical books of the Bible to learn why the Lord had permitted Jerusalem to be destroyed and his people carried captive into a heathan land mhm thank you for that um basically just what he was saying you know um Ezra was op pried by ancestry right and he had all the training and everything and uh he applied himself he in SW in our current generation you say Ali Juma right the guy went and studied about what really is required of his people and what really happened to them just understand the RO cause of the problem right timoy go ahead so I think when I you know I've heard about the story of Ezra before but I really didn't know it was this deep when I got the chance to actually go deep and learn about the character of Ezra and the mind that is had I was so amazed most of the time when we talk about diligent men we mostly point out the three Hebrew boys and Daniel but very few people will talk about Ezra but I think Ezra's story is as powerful as Daniel's story so I think one like one pH that really caught my attention is the spiritual prophecy tells us that Ezra had learned about the law of the Lord he had immersed himself into the study of the law of the Lord he also acquired the education of the moparian so he was he was a scholar I should say but in all this he realized that he is spiritually deficient he realized that there is something that he still lacks because in the current day and age most people place their basis and their value on their education or their fame or their status forgetting that there is one who is greater than all of us who is the Lord so I think the humility of Ezra is is a really powerful lesson for us in that despite the fact that you can acquire all the education of the world despite the fact that he was well versed in the law of the Lord he still realized that he was spiritually deficient and that led him into studying more about the word of the Lord trying to understand more about God so I think a lesson for us is we need to have that humility to realize that on our own as men and women in this world really we have nothing but if we are able to realize that we are spiritually poor and that we need the Lord in our lives that would go along actually helping us to grow spiritually true thank you thank you for that and actually with all the reading and uh asra realizing he was also deficient he realized that his people as well are deficient right and you see Ezra praying for the Israelites interceding on their behalf asking for forgiveness so that the Lord can hear their cries and restore them back to their land now that is good leadership you know putting other people's needs ahead of yourselves exactly all right thank you for that Timothy um so we'll move a bit to the Wednesday section Flex so there's a verse that is given Proverbs 3 verse 23 and it says then you will walk safely in your way and your foot will not stumble now the Wednesday section is basically referring us back to the punch lines and the punch lines I won't read each and every one of them because of time but it's basically all to do with why do we do what we do and the importance of preparing our hearts and you see in Ezra's story he prepared his heart so well that the rest followed along everything else came plain and simple right the the king approved his request the temple was rebuilt or not rebuilt but the people went back to to their Homeland and you can see that all came by first by first acknowledging and and accepting Christ for yourself and there's a quote here that is really that really spoke to me as you receive the spirit of Christ the spirit of un unselfish love and labor for others you will grow and you will grow and and bring forth fruit more and more you will reflect the likeness of Christ in all that is pure Noble and lovely the real the reality is that once our hearts are prepared we become more and more in tune with what God wants and how we can fulfill his will in our lives thanks for that Flex um yeah we really need to understand you know what God's will is for our Lives Many motivational speakers usually say that the two greatest days in any person's life is one the day you were born and two the day you found out why all right I think it's a question that every human being at one point in your life you'll always ask yourself why am I here what is my purpose on Earth if I was to leave this earth what will I be remembered for you know I remember when we were finishing High School no I was think I was in form three then the guys who were finishing now they told us if your absence is not felt then your presence was in vain if people cannot notice that you're not there and feel a gap like there's an emptiness that only you can feel then you being there doesn't even make sense but that can really be felt when you have an impact in people's lives and in each of the Spheres that God has put us in we are influenced to someone there someone who's looking up to you C the Aron someone looking up to you Timo and flex you know you might think you you're too young you do not know much but there is someone who's watching be like when I grow up I want to be like him or her so just think back to your life you know what exactly is your calling in life and we canot really answer that question surface or I mean the surface level it's only God who's going to answer that for us and only through prayer and discernment and reading through his word okay wait I just wanted to say uh you see throughout when I was reading it I saw Ezra diligently read the word and there's one thing that really resonates with me is that the will of God is in his word true cuz you you can't say you want to lead in God's way but then you don't take time to read his laws his statutes you don't take time to go through his Commandments and I think that is what Ezra did Ezra prepared his heart by making a decision to love God and I think the Bible says if you love God you keep his commandments so the step one is keeping his Commandments that is the TR truest way of saying you truly love God and just to echo echo echo the law of God let me it is Psalm 19:7 the law of the Lord is perfect converting the soul it is only through the law of God that your soul can be truly converted thank you for that Timothy any insights you want to share with us maybe from the story of Ezra okay we've read that the time when they were returning back to to the to Jerusalem if you read the spirit of Prophecy it paints a picture that most of the Israelites became so comfortable in Babylon like uh the initial stages of their Journey Back Ezra the people who showed up on the journey back to Jerusalem were very few people and so it got me thinking how how is this applicable to our lives especially our spiritual lives I thought about the problem of sin we know sin our first parents fell sin has been a constant problem throughout the generations up to this time and I think the lesson for us is is at some point we might get so comfortable in sin to the point that now the word of the Lord doesn't really touch us and actually move us to make decisions for him some theologists will say that we get to the point of no return a point where the word of the Lord the word of the Lord is spoken and it has no effect in your lives so I feel we need to guard against such circumstances that's why it's important as Ezra did to be well versed in the law of the Lord to consistently it's not about doing it once in a week or once in a month but every day strive to learn more and more about God and in this way your heart will be softened to his word if an example if every day I am I come and try to convince you about a certain belief that I have and I make sure that I do it consistently consistently consist the chances are you will actually believe what I'm saying so it's the same thing if you spend time day in day out learning more about the word of God and about his will your heart will be softened towards the word of God and you don't to get to this point where now the word of the Lord is spoken and it has no effect on your lives because I feel like that is it's it's it's Doom if you get to that point if you get to a point where the word of the Lord doesn't elicit any change in your life then basically you've lost you you should be worried yeah you should be worried you just PR you never get to that point Flex so I just wanted to say something like um that really spoke to me in the spirit of prophet y we told that the Israelites already comfortable in Babylon but we're also told that the Israelites the ones who are in the temple had already gone so away from from the word of God and this were not your average normal Jews these were the the people leading in the service the temple leaders priests the priests right but we can see how Ezra handled the situations was what a true leader is so a leader is servitude to the the people a true leader is willingly surrendering your heart to Christ amen because that was the only way he could tackle these two issues right first you have to move people who are unwilling to your Homeland and once you reach your Homeland the people there aren't even striving or following what you wanted them what you are bringing them back to Christ right um so and what what we're told that Ezra did is the moment he heard that the the leaders of of the temple were were interm Maring with with um with Outsiders right he tore up his garments he pulled his hair and he let out a cry so he was in in in distress and when they were doing the evening he was in distress until the evening evening um evening sacrifice and we are told that once the sacrifice was offered he knelt down and let her cry and just said Lord forgive us Lord you've given us punishment not worthy of our sin like our sin is so great but your punishment was so little and yet we continue to sin he prayed for the people and he prayed he it was told that he had a righteous indignation we can see the the likeness to Christ in that that he's no longer thinking of I'm so angry no he's thinking of we have led away from from God we we have it's like Christ flipping the tables in the temple right from from when they were selling it was righteous indignation he was so attuned to Christ and God that that's how that was his natural response all right thank you for that and the Bible you know John 1 verse1 says in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God the word we know is Christ and so every single story in the Bible just even just see it it leads back to Christ even the way Ezra just reacted he just ties back to even Christ reacted when he was on Earth as well so uh just to finish up I'll read Romans CH 10:1 17 it says so then faith comes by hearing and by hearing the word of God and this is a big question to us here and to you who's listening our lesson title is leading them home these are the Israelites being led home by by asra now come back to our time where are we leading people home to our home is heaven right so just looking back in your life in our lives how are we leading other people home to God how do you think we should lead people home to God can you just get a few sentiments from you guys as we close up I think first of all before you lead people home you need to know where home is very true like that's the basic principles before I'm leading people you have to know where are we going so just points back again to Ezra the only way we can know where this home is is by actually indulging in the study of the scriptures so I feel like the first step even before we talk about the actual like the leading home is for us to First and understand where is this home first of all yeah I'd say that so study the scriptures and know where your home is know where our home is thank you to well just to pick up from what Timothy has said which was very interesting as your leading people remember this Grace so literally everyone here is a sinner and we are actually not even the the amount of Grace you have been given is so much we can't faom it so you're supposed to lead with tenderness and compassion cuz that's the only true way you can bring people to Christ amen Christ meod alone thank you for that cythia Flex so and I'll pick up from as Cynthia left off once you've reached home do not forget what brought you home or why you're even coming home right it's still tied to Christ when Ezra came back he still kept God in the utmost reverence uh of of returning so do not be um um comforted even though Jesus is Comfort but always remember why you are home why what made you come home do not forget once you've reached you know home thank for that Flex now just to tie back to the story that we heard you know know the type of leader you are comparing the first story I told about Alexander the Great and Ezra the other leader we've seen which type of leader are you because you are a leader wherever you are are you a leader who seeks after your own interests or a leader who seeks after God's Own Heart I really pray that we will endeavor to be leaders like Ezra who seek God's heart God's statutes and leading other people to him in the right way we close word of prayer from Cynthia okay let's bow down and pray our loving father we come before you this day we thank you for the amazing lesson that you have heard we thank you for the story of Ezra father we thank you that we are able to learn back through the prophets and we are able to see whatever things they have done father we want to pray that we' be able to lead people to your home father we want to pray that you'll be with us and may you protect each one of us in Jesus name I pray amen amen amen till next time Keep Safe Keep blessed may God lead us all bye-bye

[473.6s] oh good morning good afternoon and good
[477.0s] evening to whichever part of the world
[479.7s] you're joining us from Welcome to the
[481.9s] sixth lesson of the fourth quarter of
[484.0s] the teens Cornerstone lesson but before
[487.2s] we begin I'd like our panelist to
[488.8s] introduce themselves starting from my
[491.0s] left hello everyone my name is Mikel
[494.6s] Flex hi everyone my name is Cynthia Aon
[498.7s] hi everyone my name is Timothy Kuka and
[501.9s] my name is jonan magana but before we
[504.8s] get in again I'd like to ask to get a
[506.6s] word of prayer okay let's pray for the
[509.6s] we thank you for this time that you want
[511.0s] to spend learning more from your word
[513.1s] dear Lord we pray that these words may
[515.3s] have an impact on our lives and that we
[517.1s] may not be the same that they may draw
[519.2s] us closer unto you dear Lord this is my
[521.2s] humble request believing and trusting in
[523.6s] Jesus holy name amen amen thank you
[526.7s] Timothy um a story is told of Alexander
[531.2s] the Great he was the greatest king of
[534.2s] Greece and one time during his many
[536.9s] conquests he was traversing with his
[539.1s] army
[540.1s] through the desert so they were marching
[542.0s] for 2 weeks no water and at one point
[544.7s] they were very
[545.9s] thirsty then his Couts went ahead and
[548.8s] found water in an noasis but it was very
[550.6s] little water could barely fit a ball and
[552.6s] they brought it to him and he did a very
[555.4s] strange thing he poured all the water on
[557.4s] the ground all right so everyone in the
[559.9s] Army wondered why is he doing that and
[562.4s] he said something very interesting there
[565.5s] is no need for one person to drink water
[568.6s] while everyone else is
[570.0s] thirstday now that portrays leadership
[573.8s] which is what we're going to be studying
[575.4s] in our lesson today and we're going to
[577.3s] be studying in contrast not Alexander
[580.4s] but someone called
[582.6s] Ezra now Alexander the Great his
[586.2s] leadership style was all about himself
[588.4s] glory for him glory for Greece but Ezra
[591.5s] as we'll see in our lesson Ezra was all
[593.6s] about God right and Ezra is known
[596.6s] because he's the one who tried to
[598.2s] convince the Israelites to go back home
[600.2s] from
[601.2s] captivity now you can just go to our
[603.4s] what do you think section
[605.4s] okay like to ask us a
[608.0s] question do you like coming
[611.2s] home you guys like going home of course
[614.0s] you do of course yeah definitely right
[616.2s] definitely no place like home right yeah
[618.7s] and there's nothing like coming home
[620.4s] right after a long time away so you can
[623.0s] imagine how the Israelites felt coming
[625.9s] back to their place 70 years later
[629.4s] probably some people had never seen this
[630.8s] place called Israel and now here they
[632.8s] are right
[636.0s] um we have a question right uh just read
[639.4s] from Ezra 7:10 before I get the question
[642.2s] Ezra 7:10 says for Ezra had prepared his
[645.4s] heart to seek the law of the Lord and to
[648.2s] do it and to teach statutes and
[650.6s] ordinances in
[652.8s] Israel God gives us various gifts right
[656.2s] to all members of the church there's
[658.3s] preaching there's te teaching they's
[660.0s] singing There's working miracles and all
[662.7s] those other gifts right and God wants us
[665.2s] to use them for his own glory and to
[667.8s] build his church and his people all
[670.3s] right so we're going to be seeing more
[672.0s] and more of this in our lesson today so
[674.0s] a question to a panel in what ways has
[677.0s] God placed you in a position to
[679.0s] influence those around you we're talking
[682.0s] about
[682.8s] leadership how in your life looking back
[686.5s] how do you see yourself being at a point
[688.3s] of influence
[690.2s] um personally I feel like everyone has a
[693.0s] point of influence in their life because
[695.2s] when people think about leadership it's
[696.8s] it sounds abstract it sounds like I have
[698.7s] to nominate you to be uh the ruler or or
[702.0s] the CEO or something like that but
[704.4s] technically even your friends you have
[706.3s] an influence there right so I have been
[709.4s] an influence through my friends through
[711.7s] school um leadership positions and
[715.3s] through even in my family you're a
[716.7s] leader in every way in every aspect
[719.3s] everyone is a leader you don't have to
[721.2s] be nominated or appointed to be one true
[724.3s] thank you for that Flex any insights um
[728.0s] I think for me is when I was in high
[729.8s] school yeah I got to that point when I
[732.9s] wasn't chosen but then the
[735.4s] majority pointed out Cynthia should be
[738.0s] the leader yeah and I think at that
[740.4s] point you really need to
[743.0s] portray uh God's leadership style yeah
[747.0s] cuz at that point you need to be honest
[748.9s] you need to be straightforward and you
[751.6s] also need to have that mercy and
[754.0s] companion when you're actually serving
[756.6s] other people yeah cuz leadership is not
[759.4s] about um me it's about them I'm supposed
[762.8s] to be serving them and when you're
[765.2s] leading people you're supposed to lead
[766.9s] them in a way that reaches to them you
[769.4s] see true thank you for that Timothy
[772.0s] maybe I just add as she has correctly
[774.4s] mentioned leadership is all about
[776.2s] service we know the story of Christ and
[778.3s] Christ actually is the greatest leader
[780.6s] that ever lived but according to the
[782.8s] view of the world some might think he
[784.6s] was like a slave or a servant but really
[787.4s] even when the time when he was washing
[789.2s] the disciples feet he was trying to
[791.0s] point out that me being sort of your
[793.0s] leader or your father or your brother
[795.7s] doesn't mean I'm sort of like greater
[797.6s] than you it means that I'm in this
[798.9s] position to serve you so I think a
[800.8s] lesson for us is leadership is all about
[803.6s] service it's not about exerting your
[805.5s] Authority on a group of people but it's
[806.9s] about service and importantly it's about
[809.1s] influence if you can influence a group
[811.6s] of people to think in a particular way
[813.2s] that will draw them closer to God I
[815.2s] think that is leadership in its greatest
[816.8s] form true thanks for that and uh Christ
[819.1s] was the best you know example of
[821.0s] leadership and uh we told in the book
[823.5s] Christ subjects lesson says that um
[826.9s] Christ method alone will achieve true
[828.6s] success in reaching out to the people
[830.5s] the Savior mingled with men as one who
[832.1s] desire their good minister to their
[834.3s] needs War their confidence and then now
[836.9s] B them follow me it's by me ministering
[839.5s] to people serving them is the only way
[841.4s] between their confidence and influence
[842.8s] them towards God thank you for your
[844.6s] insights amen so we'll move straight to
[846.6s] our story for today which uh comes from
[849.5s] the book of Ezra chapter 7 so for those
[852.6s] who don't have the lessons you can just
[853.9s] open the book of Ezra chapter 7 in your
[855.8s] Bibles we'll have Sy the iron just give
[857.8s] us a summary of what the story talks
[859.9s] about okay so the story is really
[863.4s] interesting and then it starts with a
[866.7s] genealogy of E son of sah son of it's a
[871.2s] very long genealogy and then one thing I
[875.6s] really want to point out is the way
[877.9s] Ezra's character comes out and I'll just
[881.4s] read it it says Ezra came up from
[883.6s] Babylon he was a teacher well versed in
[886.5s] the law of Moses which the Lord the god
[889.1s] of Israel had given and then one thing
[891.5s] about Ezra is in this story we realize
[894.2s] that Ezra gained favor in the sight of
[897.0s] the king you see and then because of
[901.0s] that favor the king had granted him so
[904.5s] many of his requests and in this uh
[908.8s] story we see Ezra uh taking the people
[912.7s] and leading them back to
[915.0s] Jerusalem but then before that just to
[917.9s] take you back so that you can have some
[921.2s] Concepts uh Ezra had to request some of
[925.1s] them cuz when initially he called them
[927.6s] the number was so few he was H this
[931.4s] can't be right so he really had to go
[934.0s] pointing out to people especially the
[936.3s] Levites the Levites were not here and we
[939.5s] I think by now we know that the Levites
[941.1s] were the ones who were running the the
[943.8s] service so he had to go and call them
[946.8s] and now when they reached Jerusalem
[949.2s] there was a very huge problem these
[951.5s] people didn't know the statutes of
[954.1s] God and the reason was they had been
[957.0s] they had intermarried true so basically
[960.5s] that's the story and I think with this
[963.0s] panel we'll be able to learn more about
[965.6s] it all right thank you yeah all right so
[968.3s] we can just proceed as well to just
[969.8s] answer some of the questions from the
[971.2s] out of the story section can just lead
[972.9s] us to that as well oh yeah so I just ask
[977.3s] some questions uh so why do you think
[981.4s] the genealogy um of Ezra all through why
[985.7s] do you think it was really brought out
[987.4s] in this story
[992.9s] maybe to show to show that he was the
[996.9s] under the geneology of iron right is to
[999.7s] bring out that he was the descendant of
[1003.2s] the um the high priest the yeah so it's
[1007.4s] like kind of showing us that he was the
[1010.4s] the high priest for that
[1012.4s] time okay maybe just to add on that I
[1015.0s] think also the reason why it was
[1016.4s] important for us to to understand that
[1018.6s] as came from the genealogy of Aon is
[1020.7s] because you read the spirit of Prophecy
[1022.6s] it explains that after Aon really the
[1025.6s] high priests that were Ser in service
[1027.9s] really did not follow God fully so
[1030.3s] there's a lot of immorality there's a
[1031.7s] lot of blasphemy in the church and the
[1033.7s] high priests they asked for money from
[1035.8s] people in order to advance their own
[1037.6s] things but you see now Ezra comes in and
[1039.6s] Ezra is this character that is very
[1041.2s] excellent and diligent is this person
[1043.3s] that is really serving God truthfully so
[1044.8s] I think the reason why this geny was
[1047.0s] mentioned is so that we get to
[1049.3s] understand that despite the wrongdoings
[1051.5s] of the ancestors before Ezra he decided
[1054.6s] in his heart that he was going to change
[1056.3s] and make a difference true true I agree
[1058.8s] with that yeah I think with what Timothy
[1060.6s] has said uh the genealogy was important
[1063.7s] to show us that you can change your
[1065.8s] story yeah doesn't mean that now because
[1069.0s] in the past history your ancestors have
[1071.2s] done um some terrible stuff it's up to
[1074.8s] you to take that gift cuz each one of us
[1077.4s] has a gift so it's up to to you to take
[1079.8s] that gift and use it for God's will so
[1083.3s] yeah amen all right I think that uh it
[1085.7s] can apply to the teens you know people
[1088.2s] um tend to stick to wrong behaviors
[1090.4s] because they say this is how I was born
[1092.2s] this is who I am but you always have a
[1094.2s] chance to change that that's what we
[1095.7s] read with Ezra's genealogy thank you for
[1097.4s] that you can proceed well the scripture
[1100.2s] story tells us that Ezra was a teacher
[1103.0s] well vered with the law of Moses so what
[1107.9s] does that tell us about about the
[1109.4s] attributes of a spiritual
[1112.6s] leader um I can tie that to the verse
[1116.4s] Paul talks about you know study to show
[1118.3s] thyself a Workman who is approved of God
[1121.6s] rightly dividing the word of Truth which
[1124.1s] basically means if you work for God it
[1126.6s] means you need to understand what God
[1129.0s] wants who God is and that can only be
[1131.2s] learned through the Bible yeah so he
[1133.4s] needed to understand really who God is
[1135.8s] before he teaches other people you can't
[1137.4s] teach something you don't know something
[1139.0s] you don't understand yeah just to add
[1142.0s] sorry I think as a spiritual leader you
[1144.9s] as Ezra was he was well versed meaning
[1147.4s] he took the time to study and to really
[1149.5s] understand what the scriptures meant
[1151.2s] because just an example let's say you're
[1154.0s] a lecturer in a class and you have no
[1156.8s] idea of what you're teaching really
[1158.8s] there's no way you'll teach your
[1159.8s] students and expect them to understand
[1161.6s] so just to apply that to the spiritual
[1163.2s] aspect as well as Christians or as
[1165.4s] Adventists in the last days we are to go
[1168.5s] into to Mission and to preach un to
[1170.2s] others about the second coming of Christ
[1172.2s] but this can only happen if we have
[1174.1s] fully understood what it means to be an
[1176.1s] Adventist what it means about Christ
[1178.5s] coming so it calls us to actually spend
[1181.6s] time dig deep into the word of God
[1183.9s] understand the word of God so that we
[1185.0s] are thoroughly equipped for every good
[1186.5s] work and so that even as we go forth
[1188.6s] preaching we can preach things that we
[1190.3s] know things that we have read and
[1191.6s] understood and internalized true thank
[1194.2s] you for that and I think the last
[1196.2s] question I really want to ask is now
[1198.9s] with this passage yeah it tells us about
[1201.4s] God and about us so and about our
[1204.8s] relationship with God so how how can we
[1208.9s] apply this story of Ezra in our lives
[1212.1s] today
[1214.1s] yeah like you have insights um maybe one
[1217.8s] way we can apply it is that you need to
[1220.3s] realize that in every aspect you're a
[1222.1s] leader so you cannot influence anyone if
[1225.2s] you do not have the material like we've
[1227.6s] just we've just seen that Ezra took time
[1229.6s] to study the scriptures to go through
[1232.0s] the word of God and the laws of Moses so
[1235.0s] in our personal lives we have to take
[1237.0s] time for ourselves and he accepted this
[1239.2s] this is something that he chose
[1240.2s] willingly so in our lives we have to
[1242.3s] accept it for ourselves and actually go
[1243.9s] study the scriptures so that as we are
[1246.0s] going out there in uh in school at work
[1249.6s] at at home we are we're portraying
[1251.8s] Christ we're portraying his his word in
[1255.0s] in real in real form in in a sense thank
[1258.8s] you for that uh thanks so much Cynthia
[1261.2s] so I think we can read Proverbs Chapter
[1263.5s] 9:1 I'll read the verse as uh as Flex
[1266.8s] will take us through the Monday section
[1268.6s] so Proverbs 9:10 very common verse it
[1270.7s] says the fear of the Lord is the
[1272.4s] beginning of wisdom and the knowledge of
[1274.2s] the Holy one is understanding now based
[1277.8s] on this um Flex what can you tell us
[1280.7s] from the Monday section as well TI to
[1282.3s] this verse so the M section is basically
[1284.8s] say that Ezra is the key to the story in
[1287.2s] that by devoting himself he first
[1291.1s] accepted and and and chose to go and do
[1294.4s] the will of God he had the he had
[1296.7s] reverence for the Lord he had the fear
[1299.4s] of of the Lord which brought him um
[1301.8s] wisdom right and the knowledge of he of
[1305.1s] the Holy One if I'm not wrong brings
[1308.1s] understanding right and that only came
[1310.1s] through by actually searching the
[1311.6s] scripture he was being abaran he was
[1313.6s] going through the books and he brought
[1315.2s] so much wisdom and understanding cuz he
[1317.2s] combined the two that he was able to
[1319.1s] lead the Israelites in such a
[1320.6s] magnificent way that everyone could see
[1323.1s] that there's something different about
[1324.4s] this guy everyone wanted to follow him
[1326.4s] it was like it was like Christ his way
[1329.0s] and his life was so attuned to God it
[1331.4s] was so attuned to the to the holy spirit
[1334.1s] that even by just a glance at him you
[1336.0s] can already tell there's something
[1337.6s] different about this man so that's what
[1339.9s] is basically uh talking us telling us uh
[1343.0s] what's about um not only I can read
[1346.4s] something not only did Ezra care but he
[1349.0s] moved as soon as he was asked to move he
[1351.2s] became what God needed him to be a
[1353.4s] leader and helped change the course of
[1355.6s] history true thank you for that Ezra saw
[1358.9s] an opportunity where his skills were
[1360.4s] needed his gift from God was needed and
[1363.0s] he rose up to the challenge and actually
[1365.1s] just took it remember this guy at this
[1368.3s] point he he was just one of the normal
[1370.8s] Israelites right he wasn't chosen by the
[1373.3s] Israelites to be their leader but he saw
[1375.6s] leadership is needed here and I have the
[1377.4s] skills to do it and rose up to the
[1379.1s] challenge thank you for that Flex uh
[1381.0s] I'll ask Timothy to read for us the
[1382.5s] flashlight as he gives us some insights
[1384.6s] on U the Tuesday part we can just scroll
[1388.8s] to the
[1389.9s] flashlight okay so the flashlight reads
[1393.1s] born of the sons of Aaron Ezra had been
[1395.6s] given a priy training and in addition to
[1398.2s] this he had acquired a a familiarity
[1400.8s] with the writings of The Magicians the
[1402.8s] astrologers and the wise men of the
[1404.4s] moparian realm but he was not satisfied
[1407.2s] with the spiritual condition
[1409.0s] he longed to be in full harmony with God
[1411.3s] he longed for wisdom to carry out the
[1413.3s] Divine will and so he prepared his heart
[1415.7s] to seek the love of the Lord and to do
[1417.9s] it this led him to apply himself
[1420.2s] diligently to a study of the history of
[1422.8s] God's people as recorded in the writings
[1425.0s] of the prophets and Kings he searched
[1427.6s] the historical and poetical books of the
[1429.9s] Bible to learn why the Lord had
[1431.9s] permitted Jerusalem to be destroyed and
[1434.3s] his people carried captive into a
[1436.0s] heathan land mhm thank you for that um
[1440.6s] basically just what he was saying you
[1442.0s] know um Ezra was op pried by ancestry
[1446.7s] right and he had all the training and
[1449.6s] everything and uh he applied himself he
[1453.8s] in SW in our current generation you say
[1455.7s] Ali Juma right the guy went and studied
[1460.0s] about what really is required of his
[1462.6s] people and what really happened to them
[1464.0s] just understand the RO cause of the
[1465.2s] problem right timoy go ahead so I think
[1468.9s] when I you know I've heard about the
[1470.0s] story of Ezra before but I really didn't
[1472.3s] know it was this deep when I got the
[1474.4s] chance to actually go deep and learn
[1476.4s] about the character of Ezra and the mind
[1478.6s] that is had I was so amazed most of the
[1480.8s] time when we talk about diligent men we
[1482.5s] mostly point out the three Hebrew boys
[1484.4s] and Daniel but very few people will talk
[1486.8s] about Ezra but I think Ezra's story is
[1488.6s] as powerful as Daniel's story so I think
[1491.4s] one like one pH that really caught my
[1493.4s] attention is the spiritual prophecy
[1495.7s] tells us that Ezra had learned about the
[1498.6s] law of the Lord he had immersed himself
[1501.1s] into the study of the law of the Lord he
[1502.8s] also acquired the education of the
[1504.1s] moparian so he was he was a scholar I
[1506.4s] should say but in all this he realized
[1509.0s] that he is spiritually deficient he
[1510.9s] realized that there is something that he
[1512.8s] still lacks because in the current day
[1514.1s] and age most people place their basis
[1516.8s] and their value on their education or
[1519.2s] their fame or their status forgetting
[1521.6s] that there is one who is greater than
[1523.0s] all of us who is the Lord so I think the
[1525.1s] humility of Ezra is is a really powerful
[1527.1s] lesson for us in that despite the fact
[1529.4s] that you can acquire all the education
[1531.1s] of the world despite the fact that he
[1533.2s] was well versed in the law of the Lord
[1535.3s] he still realized that he was
[1536.6s] spiritually deficient and that led him
[1538.6s] into studying more about the word of the
[1540.3s] Lord trying to understand more about God
[1543.1s] so I think a lesson for us is we need to
[1545.2s] have that humility to realize that on
[1547.8s] our own as men and women in this world
[1550.4s] really we have nothing but if we are
[1553.3s] able to realize that we are spiritually
[1555.5s] poor and that we need the Lord in our
[1557.2s] lives that would go along actually
[1558.8s] helping us to grow spiritually true
[1561.3s] thank you thank you for that and
[1563.2s] actually with all the reading and uh
[1564.9s] asra realizing he was also deficient he
[1567.0s] realized that his people as well are
[1568.7s] deficient right and you see Ezra praying
[1571.6s] for the Israelites interceding on their
[1573.8s] behalf asking for forgiveness so that
[1575.6s] the Lord can hear their cries and
[1577.2s] restore them back to their land now that
[1579.1s] is good leadership you know putting
[1581.0s] other people's needs ahead of yourselves
[1583.5s] exactly all right thank you for that
[1584.5s] Timothy um so we'll move a bit to the
[1586.7s] Wednesday section Flex
[1589.0s] so there's a verse that is given
[1591.4s] Proverbs 3 verse 23 and it says then you
[1595.0s] will walk safely in your way and your
[1597.0s] foot will not stumble now the Wednesday
[1599.7s] section is basically referring us back
[1602.0s] to the punch lines and the punch lines I
[1604.6s] won't read each and every one of them
[1606.2s] because of time but it's basically all
[1608.7s] to do with why do we do what we do and
[1611.9s] the importance of preparing our hearts
[1614.8s] and you see in Ezra's story he prepared
[1617.3s] his heart so well that the rest followed
[1619.2s] along everything else came plain and
[1622.0s] simple right the the king approved his
[1624.6s] request the temple was rebuilt or not
[1627.1s] rebuilt but the people went back to to
[1629.1s] their Homeland and you can see that all
[1631.4s] came by first by first acknowledging and
[1634.0s] and accepting Christ for yourself and
[1636.9s] there's a quote here that is really that
[1639.5s] really spoke to me as you receive the
[1641.6s] spirit of Christ the spirit of un
[1643.9s] unselfish love and labor for others you
[1646.7s] will grow and you will grow and and
[1649.4s] bring forth fruit more and more you will
[1651.8s] reflect the likeness of Christ in all
[1654.1s] that is pure Noble and lovely the real
[1657.6s] the reality is that once our hearts are
[1659.9s] prepared we become more and more in tune
[1662.6s] with what God wants and how we can
[1664.4s] fulfill his will in our lives thanks for
[1667.5s] that Flex um yeah we really need to
[1671.0s] understand you know what God's will is
[1672.7s] for our Lives Many motivational speakers
[1675.4s] usually say that the two greatest days
[1677.8s] in any person's life is one the day you
[1679.6s] were born and two the day you found out
[1681.6s] why all right I think it's a question
[1684.7s] that every human being at one point in
[1686.4s] your life you'll always ask yourself why
[1688.7s] am I here what is my purpose on Earth if
[1692.2s] I was to leave this earth what will I be
[1694.5s] remembered for you know I remember when
[1697.1s] we were finishing High
[1699.0s] School no I was think I was in form
[1701.2s] three then the guys who were finishing
[1702.6s] now they told us if your absence is not
[1706.8s] felt then your presence was in
[1709.1s] vain if people cannot notice that you're
[1711.5s] not there and feel a gap like there's an
[1714.0s] emptiness that only you can feel then
[1715.6s] you being there doesn't even make sense
[1717.8s] but that can really be felt when you
[1719.6s] have an impact in people's lives and in
[1722.7s] each of the Spheres that God has put us
[1724.7s] in we are influenced to someone there
[1726.9s] someone who's looking up to you C the
[1728.1s] Aron someone looking up to you Timo and
[1730.4s] flex you know you might think you you're
[1732.8s] too young you do not know much but there
[1734.6s] is someone who's watching be like when I
[1736.0s] grow up I want to be like him or her so
[1738.7s] just think back to your life you know
[1741.4s] what exactly is your calling in life and
[1745.6s] we canot really answer that question
[1747.8s] surface or I mean the surface level it's
[1749.8s] only God who's going to answer that for
[1751.3s] us and only through prayer and
[1753.5s] discernment and reading through his word
[1756.2s] okay wait I just wanted to say uh you
[1759.5s] see throughout when I was reading it I
[1761.7s] saw Ezra diligently read the word and
[1766.8s] there's one thing that really resonates
[1768.7s] with me is that the will of God is in
[1771.6s] his word true cuz you you can't say you
[1776.1s] want to lead in God's way but then you
[1778.7s] don't take time to read his laws his
[1781.3s] statutes you don't take time to go
[1783.4s] through his Commandments and I think
[1785.9s] that is what Ezra did Ezra prepared his
[1788.4s] heart by making a decision to love God
[1791.6s] and I think the Bible says if you love
[1793.6s] God you keep his commandments so the
[1796.1s] step one is keeping his Commandments
[1798.8s] that is the TR truest way of saying you
[1801.4s] truly love God and just to echo echo
[1804.6s] echo the law of God let me it is Psalm
[1809.0s] 19:7 the law of the Lord is perfect
[1812.6s] converting the soul it is only through
[1814.6s] the law of God that your soul can be
[1816.6s] truly converted thank you for that
[1819.2s] Timothy any insights you want to share
[1820.7s] with us maybe from the story of Ezra
[1824.4s] okay we've read that the time when they
[1826.1s] were returning back to to the to
[1828.2s] Jerusalem if you read the spirit of
[1830.0s] Prophecy it paints a picture that most
[1832.6s] of the Israelites became so comfortable
[1834.4s] in Babylon like uh the initial stages of
[1837.5s] their Journey Back Ezra the people who
[1839.4s] showed up on the journey back to
[1841.4s] Jerusalem were very few people and so it
[1843.6s] got me thinking how how is this
[1845.6s] applicable to our lives especially our
[1847.3s] spiritual lives I thought about the
[1849.4s] problem of sin we know sin our first
[1851.6s] parents fell sin has been a constant
[1853.8s] problem throughout the generations up to
[1855.5s] this time and I think the lesson for us
[1857.7s] is
[1859.0s] is at some point we might get so
[1862.0s] comfortable in sin to the point that now
[1864.7s] the word of the Lord doesn't really
[1866.5s] touch us and actually move us to make
[1868.8s] decisions for him some theologists will
[1871.2s] say that we get to the point of no
[1873.0s] return a point where the word of the
[1875.6s] Lord the word of the Lord is spoken and
[1877.8s] it has no effect in your lives so I feel
[1880.8s] we need to guard against such
[1882.2s] circumstances that's why it's important
[1884.2s] as Ezra did to be well versed in the law
[1886.8s] of the Lord to consistently it's not
[1888.8s] about doing it once in a week or once in
[1890.8s] a month but every day strive to learn
[1893.5s] more and more about God and in this way
[1896.1s] your heart will be softened to his word
[1898.0s] if an example if every day I am I come
[1901.7s] and try to convince you about a certain
[1903.6s] belief that I have and I make sure that
[1905.6s] I do it consistently consistently
[1907.4s] consist the chances are you will
[1909.3s] actually believe what I'm saying so it's
[1911.6s] the same thing if you spend time day in
[1915.2s] day out learning more about the word of
[1917.1s] God and about his will your heart will
[1919.2s] be softened towards the word of God and
[1921.4s] you don't to get to this point where now
[1923.3s] the word of the Lord is spoken and it
[1925.1s] has no effect on your lives because I
[1926.4s] feel like that is it's it's it's Doom if
[1930.1s] you get to that point if you get to a
[1931.5s] point where the word of the Lord doesn't
[1934.0s] elicit any change in your life then
[1936.1s] basically you've lost you you should be
[1938.0s] worried yeah you should be worried you
[1940.0s] just PR you never get to that point Flex
[1942.8s] so I just wanted to say something like
[1945.5s] um that really spoke to me in the spirit
[1947.5s] of prophet y we told that the Israelites
[1950.7s] already comfortable in Babylon but we're
[1953.4s] also told that the Israelites the ones
[1956.0s] who are in the temple had already gone
[1958.3s] so away from from the word of God and
[1961.1s] this were not your average normal Jews
[1963.9s] these were the the people leading in the
[1966.0s] service the temple leaders priests the
[1968.4s] priests right but we can see how Ezra
[1971.4s] handled the situations was what a true
[1974.6s] leader is so a leader is servitude to
[1977.7s] the the people a true leader is
[1980.0s] willingly surrendering your heart to
[1981.9s] Christ amen because that was the only
[1983.7s] way he could tackle these two issues
[1985.6s] right first you have to move people who
[1988.2s] are unwilling to your Homeland and once
[1991.0s] you reach your Homeland the people there
[1992.9s] aren't even striving or following what
[1995.7s] you wanted them what you are bringing
[1997.4s] them back to Christ right um so and what
[2002.5s] what we're told that Ezra did is the
[2004.7s] moment he heard that the the leaders of
[2007.8s] of the temple were were interm Maring
[2010.2s] with with um with Outsiders right he
[2013.7s] tore up his garments he pulled his hair
[2016.1s] and he let out a cry so he was in in in
[2019.6s] distress and when they were doing the
[2021.6s] evening he was in distress until the
[2023.5s] evening evening um evening sacrifice and
[2027.6s] we are told that once the sacrifice was
[2029.3s] offered he knelt down and let her cry
[2031.5s] and just said Lord forgive us Lord
[2034.2s] you've given us punishment not worthy of
[2037.2s] our sin like our sin is so great but
[2039.4s] your punishment was so little and yet we
[2042.7s] continue to sin he prayed for the people
[2046.6s] and he prayed he it was told that he had
[2048.7s] a righteous indignation we can see the
[2051.8s] the likeness to Christ in that that he's
[2054.2s] no longer thinking of I'm so angry no
[2056.6s] he's thinking of we have led away from
[2059.1s] from God we we have it's like Christ
[2061.4s] flipping the tables in the temple right
[2063.3s] from from when they were selling it was
[2065.2s] righteous indignation he was so attuned
[2067.0s] to Christ and God that that's how that
[2069.5s] was his natural response all right thank
[2071.8s] you for that and the Bible you know John
[2075.0s] 1 verse1 says in the beginning was the
[2076.6s] word and the Word was with God and the
[2078.0s] Word was God the word we know is Christ
[2080.7s] and so every single story in the Bible
[2082.8s] just even just see it it leads back to
[2085.7s] Christ even the way Ezra just reacted he
[2088.3s] just ties back to even Christ reacted
[2090.4s] when he was on Earth as well so uh just
[2093.0s] to finish up I'll read Romans CH 10:1
[2096.6s] 17 it says so then faith comes by
[2099.4s] hearing and by hearing the word of God
[2102.5s] and this is a big question to us here
[2105.1s] and to you who's listening our lesson
[2107.7s] title is leading them home these are the
[2112.0s] Israelites being led home by by asra now
[2114.6s] come back to our time where are we
[2117.2s] leading people home to our home is
[2120.0s] heaven right so just looking back in
[2123.1s] your life in our lives how are we
[2126.0s] leading other people home to God how do
[2128.7s] you think we should lead people home to
[2130.4s] God can you just get a few sentiments
[2131.8s] from you guys as we close up I think
[2134.5s] first of all before you lead people home
[2136.5s] you need to know where home is very true
[2139.1s] like that's the basic principles before
[2141.3s] I'm leading people you have to know
[2143.1s] where are we going so just points back
[2145.7s] again to Ezra the only way we can know
[2147.6s] where this home is is by actually
[2149.8s] indulging in the study of the scriptures
[2152.0s] so I feel like the first step even
[2153.6s] before we talk about the actual like the
[2155.4s] leading home is for us to First and
[2157.9s] understand where is this home first of
[2159.9s] all yeah I'd say that so study the
[2162.7s] scriptures and know where your home is
[2164.1s] know where our home is thank you to well
[2166.6s] just to pick up from what Timothy has
[2168.2s] said which was very interesting as your
[2171.0s] leading people remember this Grace so
[2174.9s] literally everyone here is a sinner and
[2177.9s] we are actually not
[2180.5s] even the the amount of Grace you have
[2182.7s] been given is so much we can't faom it
[2186.5s] so you're supposed to lead with
[2188.0s] tenderness and compassion cuz that's the
[2190.8s] only true way you can bring people to
[2193.2s] Christ amen Christ meod alone thank you
[2196.5s] for that cythia Flex so and I'll pick up
[2200.3s] from as Cynthia left off once you've
[2202.2s] reached home do not forget what brought
[2204.1s] you home or why you're even coming home
[2207.0s] right it's still tied to Christ when
[2209.5s] Ezra came back he still kept God in the
[2213.4s] utmost reverence uh of of returning so
[2216.9s] do not be
[2218.3s] um um comforted even though Jesus is
[2221.0s] Comfort but always remember why you are
[2224.1s] home why what made you come home do not
[2225.8s] forget once you've
[2227.0s] reached you know home thank for that
[2230.1s] Flex now just to tie back to the story
[2232.2s] that we heard you know know the type of
[2234.8s] leader you are comparing the first story
[2238.0s] I told about Alexander the Great and
[2239.7s] Ezra the other leader we've seen which
[2242.1s] type of leader are you because you are a
[2243.9s] leader wherever you are are you a leader
[2245.7s] who seeks after your own interests or a
[2248.0s] leader who seeks after God's Own Heart I
[2249.7s] really pray that we will endeavor to be
[2252.6s] leaders like Ezra who seek God's heart
[2255.8s] God's statutes and leading other people
[2257.5s] to him in the right way we close word of
[2260.2s] prayer from Cynthia okay let's bow down
[2262.8s] and pray our loving father we come
[2265.4s] before you this day we thank you for the
[2267.1s] amazing lesson that you have heard we
[2268.8s] thank you for the story of Ezra father
[2271.1s] we thank you that we are able to learn
[2273.2s] back through the prophets and we are
[2274.9s] able to see whatever things they have
[2277.3s] done
[2278.2s] father we want to pray that we' be able
[2279.7s] to lead people to your home father we
[2282.2s] want to pray that you'll be with us and
[2284.9s] may you protect each one of us in Jesus
[2287.3s] name I pray amen amen amen till next
[2290.4s] time Keep Safe Keep blessed may God lead
[2293.3s] us all bye-bye
