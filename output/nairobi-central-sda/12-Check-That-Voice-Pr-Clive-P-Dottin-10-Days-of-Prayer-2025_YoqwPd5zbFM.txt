FULL TRANSCRIPT:
it has been a wonderful experience this has been my first visit to Kenya and a little birdie told me it will not be my last so I am delighted those who followed online during the week may God continue to bless you and those who are here today I see individuals dressed for baptism let me hear you say a loud Amen to them amen and we say hallelujah praise the Lord by the way happy Sabbath happy day God has been good to us P Naga I want to thank you for inviting me he told me his leadership team is about 500 in this church well I tell you he's doing better than by Biden Obama and Trump put together that is amazing and I this is awesome when I look upstairs I almost see a whole conference when I look upstairs so may God be continue to bless you and I'm sure you know that God is a good god you know when I was a child not too long ago two things I never wanted was to be baldheaded and gray-headed and I end up with both but that doesn't face me whatsoever because I know what matters is our characters it's our relationship with Jesus Christ so I anticipate returning One Elder told me he said pastor oh all the speakers who come here to Kenya always wish to return and I am no exception I wish to return I I am doing my own marketing campaign I wish to return those who have ears to hear Let Them hear what the spirit is saying praise the Lord if you love the Lord say amen amen if you love the Lord say hallelujah Hallelujah God is a good God loving father may your Holy Ghost bless each of us each of the thousands of people in this congregation bless us fill us with your love give us a huge appetite for your righteousness this be our prayer in Jesus name I understand I have to welcome all those online and I think you're all on National Television this morning so we have tens of thousands of people watching us and I know that God is a mighty God and God can be trusted let me begin with a text Cu I have to have one eye on the laptop in front of me they watch there and one eye on the word brring do you love God I ask a question every night I want to ask all of you and I should get the strongest answer has God been good to you no no no no no let's go again has God been good to you yes as San see I learn two words the matron upstairs taught me God is an awesome God let's go to John chapter 3 John chapter 3 says there was a man of the Pharisees named Nicodemus a ruler of the Jews this man came to Jesus by night and said to him Rabbi we know that you are a teacher come from God for no one can do these signs that you do unless God is with him Hallelujah Jesus answered and said to him most assuredly I say to you unless one is born again he cannot see the kingdom of God Nicodemus said to him how can a man be born when he's old can he enter it a second time into his mother's womb and be born Jesus answered and said most assuredly I say to you unless one is born of water and the spirit he cannot enter the kingdom of God that which is born of flesh is the Flesh and that which is born of the spirit is Spirit do not Marvel that I said to you you must be born again the wind blows where it wishes and you hear the sound of it but cannot tell where it comes from and where it goes so is everyone that is born of the spirit today a number of individuals will say a public Yes to Jesus Christ they will affirm their love for Jesus Christ they will affirm that they understand John 3:16 for God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son that whosoever believeth in him should not perish but have everlasting life life may I suggest to you this morning there is power in the name of Jesus there is hope in the name of Jesus there is justification in the name of Jesus I heard a famous preacher Cleveland say justification means just as if I never sinned there is sanctification in the name of Jesus the text says in Romans 8:14 for as many as are led by the spirit of God they are called the sons of God God is a forgiving God God is a merciful god god is a precious God God is a loving God he protects us in the morning he protects Us in the evening he protects us at night time let's say amen for God this morning uh God is a mighty God and God can be trusted you know why God is not just a prayer hearing God God is a prayer answering God God is not just a promis making God God is a promise keeping God he keeps his word Isaiah 40 says the grass wither it the flower fadeth but the word of Our Lord shall stand forever this morning I present to you the subject check that voice let's go to the screen check that voice the voice of Julia Caesar thundered throughout the Roman Empire what did he say let's look at what he said in the Latin VI Vicki I came I saw and I conquered but Julia Caesar is dead he came he saw and he conquered and then he died and de conquered him we move on ladies and gentlemen my subject is have mercy check this voice the most famous statement of President Obama he said yes we can and he magnetized not just Americans but the entire world he magneti I with that statement and some people feel some political pundits it catapulted him right into the presidency three words yes we can let's look at some other people my sermon today is check this voice the statement of President George Bush after 911 when there was a terrorist attack led by the Taliban and the leader of the Taliban Osama Bin Laden what did George Bush say standing on the Rubble of the Twin Towers what did he say let us see what he said we heard from them and now they will hear from us he was directing this statement to Osama Bin Laden and the Taliban C cabinet this is what he said George Bush we heard from them and now they will hear from us we move on ladies and gentlemen remember the voice of God booming in the burning bush only God could turn Bush into a microphone have mercy that is God himself he could do what he wants when he wants wherever he wants and however he wants that is the awesome God He Said So Moses is seeing this bush that is burning but not being consumed God has all power God has all knowledge and God is everywhere at the same time moreover he said I am the god of thy father the god of Abraham the god of Isaac and the god of Jacob and Moses hid his face for he was afraid to look upon God check that voice the voice of God and the Lord said I have surely seen the Affliction of my people which are in Egypt and have heard their Cry by reason of their task Masters for I know their sorrows before I read the next verse God knows our sorrows God knows our pain let me tell you something and God is still in the miracle working business before I continue with this a team one of my teams volunteer teams we work in an area we asmed when this young man was shot and killed he died on his mother's lap he bled to death there that was a very serious situation but God came through for us in two ways one day two of my volunteers two ladies were in that street in a hot spot called lavant it's one of the hottest spots for murders in Trinidad and we have team and we work inside there and God has been good to us because let me tell you something when you serve God no weapon let me hear you say no weapon no weapon pumped against you shall prosper God is Awesome Shon Wilson and a friend were coming down and and and there was a criminal he's dead now his name is blood was blood that was his name he specialized in assassination he lived to kill others that is is that was his lifestyle and you had to get permission one day I went in there and he was right outside there and he looked at me and I looked at him and I told him God bless you I dare to tell him that but one day when I could not make it Sharon and her friend Jane was walking through sugm Trace in lavant till there's a self-imposed curfew in that territory all like 8:00 everybody's inside and blood heard the voices my S is check that voice he heard the voices of sharod and Jane and you know he was preparing to kill them and he drew his gone but shockingly and amazingly hello God has all power God knows the past God knows the present and God knows the future as he was preparing to kill them they disappeared in front of him he could not see them he just could not see them they told me that he trembled with fear he trembled because he did not know what happened God turned them invisible let me tell you something God Alone can do certain things there are some things a man could do for you but there are other things that only God can do for you if you have been blessed and received the protecting power of God let me hear you say hallelujah hallelujah yes God is still in a miracle working business in case you don't know God could still cause the blind to see the deaf to hear the  to

because he lives we can face tomorrow Jesus Jesus oh how sweet the name Jesus Jesus every day the same the best friend to have is Jesus he will hear you Hallelujah when you call he will lift you when you fall the best friend to have is Jesus if Jesus is your best friend shake up Satan with a loud amen Jesus is our best friend nobody could love us more than Jesus and God told him man come down to deliver them out of the hand of the Egyptians and to bring them out of that land onto a good land and large unto a land flowing with milk and honey unto the place of the Canaanites and the Hittites and the amorites and the parites and the hites and the jebusites and the otheres Have Mercy let's move on God is an awesome God this is one of my key texts today Isaiah 30:21 and D I see people dressed in white today they are going to get baptized let me tell you something the happiest moment in the life of a church is when people are surrendering to Jesus Christ and you inite I compliment you I congratulate you may God continue to shower his love upon you and the others who not in white who will get baptized today come on could you say Amen the spirit of God will touch you as I proclaimed the message check that voice Isaiah 13:21 and thine ear shall hear a word behind the saying this is the way walk in it when he turned to the right hand and when he turned to the left you know something folks I was in a Hindu community and while I was in that Community a Hindu man came I remember two Hindus in that program more than everybody else one was the lady next door she gave us electricity for free praise the Lord and you know one day she said something you know my name is dotin in case you forgot she says to the Watchman of the tent she says I don't believe a thing dotin is saying but by I believe dotin believes it that is what she said she said there is a power of conviction coming upon her heart she worshiped several gods Vishnu and Shiva but she didn't worship the true god Jehovah gy let me tell you something he's the Lord that provides but he's also the lion of the tribe of Judah he's a lion and he's a lamb he's a lion of the tribe of Judah and he's the Lamb of God that taketh away the sins of the world he's an awesome God he's a mighty God and I want to tell you something and when I say it don't get me back I want you to say Al loud amen so let me say it and hear your loud amen God knows when to show up he knows when to show up in fact he knows our cries uh he hears our groans uh he knows the pains that we are feeling uh he empathizes with us uh God is an awesome God you know we prayed for an elder in Trinidad who had gone completely blind completely blind we prayed uh one night we had a half night of prayer and fasting we prayed that the Elder would receive his sight don't underestimate prayer underestimate your boyfriend your girlfriend your mother your father your boss your teacher but never ever underestimate prayer at the end of 6 hours of prayer that Elder got back his sight amen Breen God is still in the miracle working business we move on this is David coresh 1993 in Waco Texas remember he and the ATF the special agents of the American State Police had a standoff and he had people inside with him what did David cores say David cores says there is a lot of God in Me check that voice he says there's a lot of God in Me When you look at me don't look at me because you are seeing God what blasphemy like Bel like ad do Hitler who said I never interfered with God and God must interfere with me all of them blasphemed against the name of God but I want to remind everybody and those online and those on National Television I want to remind you what Hebrews 9:27 says it is appointed unto us once the death die but after this the Judgment once the die we must all stand before the Judgment bar of God he says when you look at me and see God so there was a 51 day standoff that was the year 1993 a 51 day standoff when Mount carel was burned to the ground on the end he was killed and over 90 people perish that day the Blasphemous David Kesh in Waco Texas in 199 93 after proclaiming himself God was shot by the ATF Security Agency shot and killed he's no more and he will face the Judgment also it is appointed unto us once the die but after this the Judgment we move on clash between New Age movement and Christianity now I know many of us love Oprah Winfrey she's a very famous television host T but I don't have much respect for her at all you know if you call the name of Jesus in Oprah Winfrey's presence she gets angry I have met people I prayed in a particular interfa service and I prayed in the name of Jesus and there was a Muslim lady there she got angry there are some people hello don't want to hear the name of Jesus at all but let me tell you something he is all powerful he is the Mighty God he is the Prince of Peace he is the lily of the valley he's the bright and Morning Star he's the Rock of Ages he's the Desire of Ages uh he's the Prince of Peace he's Our Redeemer he's our savior he's our lamb he's our mediator he's our intercessor oh praise the name of Jesus Hallelujah what does the New Age movement say an Oprah win pry believes that we were Gods before we are Gods now and we shall continue to be gods they don't want to hear a word about Resurrection they don't want to hear about judgment they believe we are Gods we will live forever in spite of the number of cemeteries that are flowing all over the world H I saw you a cemetery too that's now you have to get a new one but ladies and gentlemen they don't believe in God they would like to have nothing to do with Jesus but listen there is a fountain filled with blood drawn from Emmanuel's veins and sinners plung beneath that blood lose all their guilty stains power in that name the name Elohim power in that name Yeshua power in that name hope in that name Grace in that name rescue in that name that's the name of Jesus Hallelujah Muhammad Ali I want to debating competition using a statement from Muhammad Ali he used to say I am the greatest I am the greatest that's before he got knocked down I am the greatest he says you could float like a butterfly sting like a bee the hand can't hit what the eye can't see that's what he said about himself he was so confident about his pugilistic press he was confident

With Thine Eyes shall th behold the and the reward of the wicked so this lady kept coming five years he flogged her and he told her the day you get baptized I will kill you one morning she was home it

to serve is the creator my dear friends of Heaven and Earth can you fear God and give glory to him for the hour for the time for the moment of his judgment is come and worship him him alone that made the Heaven and the earth and the Sea and the f Fountains of waters so she prayed for him when she got up the second prayer he is blind and he's crippled this Hindu man is blind and crippled as she got

to patas to suffer the missan he wanted John to worship Him the missan built a statue of himself that was 20t tall and John refused to Bow he wouldn't bow wouldn't bend he wouldn't burn when they placed him on the Isis of platas a place for Mad people and lepers he wouldn't bow he wouldn't bur he wouldn't burn because he believed in the power of God you know have to be careful how hitting these Pulpit Sir with this material the last time in Trinidad I hit a Pulpit it split in two have mercy my karate skills I believe God have mercy how to identify a cult Cults of a single powerful leader David Kesh Jim Jones H in Guyana yes in Theo River B Banks C have a single powerful leader who becomes the cult Messiah let me Rush on ladies and gentlemen call substitute human teachings for the word of God they believe in what is called humanism that man equals God and God equals man Mary David Christ claimed you was pregnant with a child the Christ child Mark pinley you saw his picture just now was preaching the Everlasting gospel and a woman told him I don't have to be baptized I am pregnant I will give birth to Jesus Christ the Christ child the voice of error ladies and gentlemen this took place in Moscow cult work miracles manipulate the Mind Revelation 13 13 and 14 and he do it great wonders so that he make it f come down from heaven on the earth in the sight of men look at verse 14 and deceiveth them that dwell on the Earth by the means of those Miracles which he had power to do in the sight of the Beast saying to them that dwell on the earth that they should make an image to the Beast which had the wound by a sword and did live we move on quickly God is an awesome God Revelation 181 to4 my final text and after these things I saw another Angel come down from heaven having great power and the Earth was lightened with his glory verse two and he cried mightily with a strong voice saying Babylon the great is Fallen is fallen and has become the habitation of devils and the hold of every foul spirit and a cage of every unclean and hateful birth Babylon says oh that the priest is the mediator that is what Babylon says that the priest is the mediator that Mary sits on the right hand of God I don't know really sitting there cuz the Islamic folks are now saying that Muhammad is in heaven and he's the Holy Spirit Lord have mercy H and Rome says that Mary and they talk about the Immaculate Conception and now they are saying that she is our mediatrix sitting at the right hand of God the Father both of them have it wrong have mercy you shall know the truth and the truth shall what set you free H All Nations have drunk of the wine of the rth of a fornication and the kings of the Earth have committed fornication against her and the merchants of the Earth are actx rich through the abundance of her Delicacies my last verse today and I heard another voice my subject today is check that voice and I heard another voice from Heaven saying come out upon my people that you be not part partakers of our sins and I received not of our plagues we hold it there my final illustration in that same area in Trinidad where I had a 4-we Evangelistic campaign for four weeks preaching every night except Thursday night ladies and gentlemen a Hindu guy a great-grandfather 855 years old came every night Pastor elders he came none of his family came not one of his sons came not one of his daughters came but he came through baptism passed we had baptized 38 people after 3 weeks we'll go on to baptize 13 more 51 in that Hindu area God can work anywhere and everywhere the God we serve did I hear you say praise the Lord bring the God we serve he will tear down all the walls but pay attention in the four minutes I have left pay attention that Friday night was the last night of the Evangelistic effort in a place called new Grant he came many Hindus gave their hearts to Jesus and are still serving God but ladies and gentlemen he signed a card that night for the first time he signed a card for the first time he came to the altar 85 years old that night or the next morning at 2 a.m. he got a massive heart attack and died at 2: a.m. you see God God knew I believe brother Joshua dist stress distress that he have gone through with his family who were against Christianity who were against the blood of Christ who did not feel H but without the shedding of blood Hebrew says there is no remission of sins that guy got a heart attack and died it was the first time I would go to a cremation of a Hindu on the seashore in South Trinidad it was an awesome experience when they lit the fire I saw that body consumed consumed because they believed the soul uh with Wonder for eternity that is their belief you know petring that had a tremendous impact upon that Evangelistic series because a lot of people then accepted the Gospel of Jesus Christ including many Hindus it is no secret what my God can do what he has done for others he will do for you let me say this to you we are the the brink of the Lin when our sons and daughters will have vision and US older folks will have dreams H young people don't leave the church the greatest moment is about to come on this church young people when the Holy Ghost comes upon you in lat in power you will pray for the Blind and they will see you will go down the streets of Nairobi and see  people and you will touch them and they will walk come on you will go to the hospitals in Kenya and people will be dying and the doctors can't do a thing for them cancer patients and you will touch them and the cancer will go the greatest moments are yet ahead for the Church of the Living God Steve Miller 911 2001 worked in the South Tower he walked on the 85th floor ladies and gentlemen then he looked through the window heard a BMB and saw a plane crashed through the North Tower he shouted my God save me he left his desk on the 85th floor of the South Tower and when he left his desk and he came down have mercy he reached the 50 fth floor and he heard a voice my subject today check that voice saying go back to your desk the North Tower has been destroyed but the South Tower is

[232.6s] 3 says there was a man of the Pharisees
[235.1s] named Nicodemus a ruler of the Jews this
[238.8s] man came to Jesus by night and said to
[241.2s] him Rabbi we know that you are a teacher
[244.0s] come from God for no one can do these
[246.5s] signs that you do unless God is with him
[251.8s] Hallelujah Jesus answered and said to
[254.1s] him most assuredly I say to you unless
[257.1s] one is born again he cannot see the
[259.8s] kingdom of God Nicodemus said to him how
[263.3s] can a man be born when he's old can he
[266.5s] enter it a second time into his mother's
[268.9s] womb and be born
[270.6s] Jesus answered and said most assuredly I
[274.5s] say to you unless one is born of water
[278.2s] and the spirit he cannot enter the
[280.4s] kingdom of God that which is born of
[283.6s] flesh is the Flesh and that which is

[2412.7s] believed the soul uh with Wonder for
[2416.0s] eternity that is their belief you know
[2419.4s] petring that had a tremendous impact
[2422.7s] upon that Evangelistic series because a
