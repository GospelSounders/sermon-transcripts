FULL TRANSCRIPT:
good evening good morning good afternoon from wherever you are we welcome you to the Bible study we are having on the book Daughters of God for those who have been able to join in we started last week and so far we've done one chapter and this week we're dwelling into our second chapter that speaks on specific women of specific Daughters of God rather who are in the Bible on this panel we have different ladies from various Ministries in the Nairobi Central 7th Day Adventist Church and I'd like them to introduce themselves greetings ad de from Deon Department aen from the pal Department hello Elizabeth the women Ministries leader Nairobi Central hi I'm Grace and I'm in the youth choir hello everyone my name is Nora and I'm in the publishing Ministries Department Maranatha my name is Joan from the interest coordination Department as we have seen we have various women from different Ministries in the church and that is just showing that the church is embracing women and even out there you can serve in any position that you have in the church and it's not only um you can also do it even in the workplace and wherever you are today we are speaking on Eve and we all know that we came from Eve that we are descendants of of Eve and I'd like one of us to just tell us what they think of Eve what they know of Eve uh one thing about Eve uh I love her individuality and authenticity when you start reading the book one thing that comes out so clearly that she's created out of the image of God and this is very important when when when it comes to our development and even in our growth that knowing where you come from gives you a bearing even when you're lost and this is very key to us here I'm very glad that you have mentioned the term we are lost at the moment we know that our first mother and father sinned and before they sinned they had the they bore the image of God both in outward resemblance and in character God was holy and happy in bearing the image of Adam was holy and happy in bearing the image of God and in perfect obedience to his will and we see that when they sinned we did not have that covering that we that they did not have that covering that they had before and I just want um Elizabeth to just speak on what happened after the fall when Eve ate the fruit what happened even before she realized that she had already separated from God thank you um so um Eve was the first woman the first mother the first to be tempted and uh with the Temptation that came to Eve she had separated from Adam she had wandered away that's what um the pen of inspiration tells us she had gone away from the site where Adam was and uh it teaches us that when we are separated with our spouses there's a greater Temptation that is actually what Helen White says there and again even in know um to-day life we know that Temptations come when we are apart and then um Eve uh um entertained conversation with the The Serpent and that is where she became vulnerable um another thing about the Temptation is Eve was tempted Adam was not tempted but he chose he chose to eat the fruit after being convinced uh by uh Eve that they could eat it and it is sweet and when she had actually eaten it she became brighter she became more beautiful and she was able to convince thank you and I just like to add on to what she's saying is the book actually says Adam understood that His companion had transgressed he knew that my goodness and I think he just went into a he was worried actually the book says that um ah ah you know he said this woman has actually disregarded what God had said he had prohibited us to eat the fruit but he's like now because I love her because of the Fidelity you know that their Fidelity and love MH there was a terrible struggle in Adam's mind he mourned that he had permitted Eve to wonderer I like the way he takes responsibility and says I should not have allowed her to wonderer because we were're in different places okay now um by now the deed was done he figured it's done okay he now is asking himself should he be separated from Eve after this fall so he resolved to share her faith just like Elizabeth has said him he didn't make a mistake but he decided consciously to say let me just do what she's done okay and if she must die then he was just going to die with her and I like the way previously um we are told that Eve was a helper corresponding to Adam one who was fitted to be His companion and who could be one in love and sympathy so here is Adam sympathizing empathizing and sing with Eve Eve o I don't know I think we we we better give men more credit because honestly he he didn't have to do that nonsense he would have just said my friend God this lady has sinned you deal with her get me another one but he decided to sympathize and empathize that's crazy yes and just for our first jger Minds we we we could think about what would have happened if Adam told Eve that no I cannot sin um one thing that we've gotten from this is that all this began with Eve disbelieving the words of God if she had believed that what God had mentioned was the truth she would not have taken heed to what Satan mentioned to her and in that she persuaded Adam to even take part in eating of the fruit and from that we also see that we can not even only our partners but we can bring our friends our partners we can either choose if they go to if they will follow the word or if we lead them to sat and I see that has something to say yeah I just wanted to emphasize something that Elizabeth had said earlier you know she'd mentioned that the fact that Eve was away from her husband was something that also led to her demise but I think that can also be applied to very many situations like as you can see Ruby the three of us here we are not married we are still young ladies MH but this basically means that in our Christian walk if we separate ourselves from fellow Believers we are more susceptible to fall like if you get a piece of firewood out of the fire the fire goes out so as Christians we should make sure that we stick together I mean the enemy is out here and his only purpose in this world is to steal kill and destroy he is after each and every single one of us and if we are separated from others it makes it easier for him to make us fall so it is important for us Believers to stick together always amen that is true um and one thing we can add on that is that we should not be IGN ignorant to Temptation Eve knew that she had been forbidden to eat from that fruit yet when she wandered away from Adam she was led to that path so one thing we could mention and really emphasize is don't be ignorant to Temptation the fact that yes you are with the Lord you have served him doesn't mean that the that Satan is not doing his job he will find a way to just come in in some small way and that is how you either will end up following Jesus or you'll end up believing Saturn and even just don't linger you know the fact that she's she was lingering and having a conversation with the Enemy why are you having a conversation in the as a young person with a man in a room I mean the what the conversation is in the wrong place so Eve was in the wrong place at the wrong time so the fact that you're even lingering in the wrong setup yes is is is trouble and the good book says James 4:7 submit to God resist the devil and he will flee from you the devil is one who should be running amen because you have God clothed around you in the armor of God tied around you so the setup run away from the wrong setup that is true um and even from the the fall we know that if SATA if Adam and Eve had not sinned they already had control over all the Earth everything that God had created Adam is the one who named them all these fruits all these animals and now because of that sin they no longer had the control that they had the benefits the being close with God because if they had continued uh if they had not sinned and just continued following God they would have known and understood God so even as now that we are on earth here and we know that is that no one that everyone has sinned we should also still find a way to just not indulge in all this and just continue being with the Lord so that even if we are not able to have all those benefits that they had before we still have that connection and he still is able to speak to you I would like to add in chapter one actually um Ellen White says about Redemption the greatest call to service is women who can redeem mhm and you see Adam here I don't think really the word is redemption but the second Adam redeemed us that is Christ but as women how then are we redeeming instead of causing more trouble like Eve did we I mean no doubt we started the trouble yeah but then now we are called as women to re to redeem redeem yes so I believe that we have each learned one or two points from the life of Eve even if they sinned we still have learned something from them and I'd like us to end with a word of prayer from aen let's believe and pray Heavenly Father we thank you we bless your holy name oh God we thank you for the lesson that we've learned from The Story of Evil God I pray that as women Almighty king of glory may you give us the wisdom may you give us the uh the understanding Almighty king of glory that father we should not um play around with sin king of glory that we should not entertain Almighty father but Lord we should lead others to you Almighty king of glory father Lord I pray that you may give us the the Holy Spirit Almighty Lord so that we may be able to draw others closer to you oh Lord in Jesus name we pray amen amen

TIMESTAMPED TRANSCRIPT:
[0.6s] good evening good morning good afternoon
[3.3s] from wherever you are we welcome you to
[5.9s] the Bible study we are having on the
[8.0s] book Daughters of God for those who have
[10.9s] been able to join in we started last
[13.0s] week and so far we've done one chapter
[15.7s] and this week we're dwelling into our
[18.2s] second chapter that speaks on specific
[20.5s] women of specific Daughters of God
[23.8s] rather who are in the Bible on this
[26.2s] panel we have different ladies from
[29.4s] various Ministries in the Nairobi
[31.0s] Central 7th Day Adventist Church and I'd
[33.7s] like them to introduce
[36.2s] themselves greetings ad de from Deon
[39.8s] Department aen from the pal
[42.6s] Department hello Elizabeth the women
[45.6s] Ministries leader Nairobi
[47.5s] Central hi I'm Grace and I'm in the
[50.1s] youth
[50.9s] choir hello everyone my name is Nora and
[54.3s] I'm in the publishing Ministries
[56.4s] Department Maranatha my name is Joan
[59.5s] from the interest coordination
[61.6s] Department as we have seen we have
[63.8s] various women from different Ministries
[65.8s] in the church and that is just showing
[68.3s] that the church is embracing women and
[70.6s] even out there you can serve in any
[73.6s] position that you have in the church and
[75.2s] it's not only um you can also do it even
[79.2s] in the workplace and wherever you are
[81.8s] today we are speaking on Eve and we all
[85.5s] know that we came from Eve that we are
[88.8s] descendants of of Eve and I'd like one
[91.3s] of us to just tell us what they think of
[93.9s] Eve what they know of Eve uh one thing
[96.1s] about Eve
[98.4s] uh I love her individuality and
[101.4s] authenticity when you start reading the
[103.0s] book one thing that comes out so clearly
[105.2s] that she's created out of the image of
[108.0s] God and this is very important when when
[110.8s] when it comes to our development and
[112.8s] even in our growth that knowing where
[115.4s] you come from gives you a bearing even
[117.8s] when you're lost and this is very key to
[120.1s] us here I'm very glad that you have
[122.5s] mentioned the term we are lost at the
[124.6s] moment we know that our first mother and
[128.2s] father sinned and before they sinned
[130.6s] they had the they bore the image of God
[133.3s] both in outward resemblance and in
[135.5s] character God was holy and happy in
[138.0s] bearing the image of Adam was holy and
[141.3s] happy in bearing the image of God and in
[143.0s] perfect obedience to his will and we see
[145.2s] that when they sinned we did not have
[148.5s] that covering that we that they did not
[151.3s] have that covering that they had before
[153.5s] and I just want um Elizabeth to just
[157.6s] speak on what happened after the fall
[161.5s] when Eve ate the fruit what happened
[164.7s] even before she realized that she had
[167.0s] already separated from God thank you um
[171.2s] so um Eve was the first woman the first
[175.1s] mother the first to be
[177.1s] tempted and uh with the Temptation that
[181.0s] came to Eve she had separated from Adam
[186.4s] she had wandered away that's what um the
[189.9s] pen of inspiration tells us she had gone
[193.0s] away from the site where Adam was and uh
[197.2s] it teaches us that when we are separated
[200.3s] with our spouses there's a greater
[202.9s] Temptation that is actually what Helen
[205.3s] White says there and again even in know
[209.2s] um to-day life we know that Temptations
[212.2s] come when we are apart and then um Eve
[218.6s] uh um entertained conversation with the
[223.0s] The Serpent and that is where she became
[226.7s] vulnerable um another thing about the
[229.0s] Temptation is Eve was
[231.8s] tempted Adam was not tempted but he
[235.0s] chose he chose to eat the fruit after
[238.6s] being convinced
[240.6s] uh by uh Eve that they could eat it and
[244.5s] it is sweet and when she had actually
[246.6s] eaten it she became brighter she became
[249.0s] more beautiful and she was able to
[251.5s] convince thank you and I just like to
[253.7s] add on to what she's saying is the book
[256.0s] actually says Adam understood that His
[258.1s] companion had
[259.8s] transgressed he knew that my goodness
[263.1s] and I think he just went into a he was
[265.4s] worried actually the book says that
[268.6s] um ah ah you know he said this woman has
[271.4s] actually disregarded what God had said
[274.0s] he had prohibited us to eat the fruit
[276.9s] but he's like now because I love her
[279.6s] because of the Fidelity you know that
[282.3s] their Fidelity and love MH there was a
[285.2s] terrible struggle in Adam's mind he
[288.6s] mourned that he had permitted Eve to
[291.8s] wonderer I like the way he takes
[294.0s] responsibility and says I should not
[296.9s] have allowed her to wonderer because we
[299.0s] were're in different places okay now um
[302.7s] by now the deed was done he figured it's
[305.2s] done okay he now is asking himself
[308.0s] should he be separated from Eve after
[310.9s] this fall so he resolved to share her
[313.4s] faith just like Elizabeth has said him
[317.0s] he didn't make a mistake but he decided
[319.8s] consciously to say let me just do what
[322.4s] she's done okay and if she must die then
[326.6s] he was just going to die with her and I
[329.4s] like the way previously um we are told
[332.2s] that Eve was a helper corresponding to
[336.0s] Adam one who was fitted to be His
[339.2s] companion and who could be one in love
[342.6s] and
[344.1s] sympathy so here is Adam sympathizing
[348.0s] empathizing and
[349.7s] sing with Eve Eve o I don't know I think
[355.5s] we we we better give men more credit
[357.2s] because
[358.5s] honestly he he didn't have to do that
[360.8s] nonsense he would have just said my
[362.6s] friend God this lady has sinned you deal
[365.8s] with her get me another one but he
[368.3s] decided to sympathize and empathize
[371.8s] that's crazy yes and just for our first
[376.5s] jger Minds we we we could think about
[378.8s] what would have happened if Adam told
[382.3s] Eve that no I cannot sin um one thing
[386.1s] that we've gotten from this is that all
[388.1s] this began with Eve disbelieving the
[391.0s] words of God if she had believed that
[394.0s] what God had mentioned was the truth she
[396.3s] would not have taken heed to what Satan
[399.8s] mentioned to her and in that she
[403.4s] persuaded Adam to even take part in
[406.9s] eating of the fruit and from that we
[408.5s] also see that we
[411.0s] can not even only our partners but we
[413.8s] can bring our friends our partners we
[416.3s] can either choose if they go to if they
[418.7s] will follow the word
[420.1s] or if we lead them to sat and I see that
[423.4s] has something to say yeah I just wanted
[425.7s] to emphasize something that Elizabeth
[428.0s] had said earlier you know she'd
[429.9s] mentioned that the fact that Eve was
[433.7s] away from her husband was something that
[435.6s] also led to her demise but I think that
[438.2s] can also be applied to very many
[439.8s] situations like as you can see Ruby the
[442.3s] three of us here we are not married we
[444.2s] are still young ladies MH but this
[446.9s] basically means that in our Christian
[449.2s] walk
[450.3s] if we separate ourselves from fellow
[452.3s] Believers we are more susceptible to
[455.4s] fall like if you get a piece of firewood
[456.9s] out of the fire the fire goes out so as
[459.6s] Christians we should make sure that we
[461.2s] stick together I mean the enemy is out
[463.0s] here and his only purpose in this world
[465.8s] is to steal kill and destroy he is after
[468.2s] each and every single one of us and if
[470.0s] we are separated from others it makes it
[472.3s] easier for him to make us fall so it is
[474.8s] important for us Believers to stick
[477.2s] together always amen that is true um and
[480.5s] one thing we can add on that is that we
[482.3s] should not be IGN ignorant to Temptation
[485.8s] Eve knew that she had been forbidden to
[488.8s] eat from that fruit yet when she
[490.6s] wandered away from Adam she was led to
[493.4s] that path so one thing we could mention
[496.7s] and really emphasize is don't be
[499.4s] ignorant to Temptation the fact that yes
[501.5s] you are with the Lord you have served
[503.0s] him doesn't mean that the that Satan is
[506.1s] not doing his job he will find a way to
[508.8s] just come in in some small way and that
[512.4s] is how you either will end up following
[515.2s] Jesus or you'll end up believing Saturn
[518.2s] and even just don't linger you know the
[520.6s] fact that she's she was lingering and
[522.7s] having a conversation with the Enemy why
[525.2s] are you having a conversation in the as
[527.1s] a young person with a man in a room I
[530.7s] mean the what the conversation is in the
[532.8s] wrong place so Eve was in the wrong
[534.9s] place at the wrong time so the fact that
[538.0s] you're even lingering in the wrong setup
[541.0s] yes is is is trouble and the good book
[544.6s] says James 4:7 submit to God resist the
[546.8s] devil and he will flee from you the
[548.1s] devil is one who should be running amen
[550.1s] because you have God clothed around you
[552.9s] in the armor of God tied around you so
[555.6s] the setup run away from the wrong setup
[559.2s] that is true um and even from the the
[563.4s] fall we know that if SATA if Adam and
[566.7s] Eve had not sinned they already had
[569.4s] control over all the Earth everything
[572.0s] that God had created Adam is the one who
[574.8s] named them all these fruits all these
[576.9s] animals and now because of that sin they
[581.6s] no longer had the control that they had
[584.0s] the benefits the being close with God
[587.6s] because if they had continued uh if they
[590.0s] had not sinned and just continued
[591.6s] following God they would have known and
[594.0s] understood God so even as now that we
[597.6s] are on earth here and we know that is
[599.8s] that no one that everyone has sinned we
[602.2s] should also still find a way to
[605.9s] just not indulge in all this and just
[610.4s] continue being with the Lord so that
[612.8s] even if we are not able to have all
[614.3s] those benefits that they had before we
[616.4s] still have that connection and he still
[618.1s] is able to speak to you I would like to
[620.8s] add in chapter one actually um Ellen
[623.4s] White says about Redemption the greatest
[626.0s] call to service is women who can redeem
[628.8s] mhm and you see Adam here I don't think
[632.1s] really the word is redemption but the
[634.6s] second Adam redeemed us that is Christ
[638.1s] but as women how then are we redeeming
[640.7s] instead of causing more trouble like Eve
[644.1s] did we I mean no doubt we started the
[646.2s] trouble yeah but then now we are called
[648.5s] as women to re to redeem
[651.1s] redeem yes so I believe that we have
[654.8s] each learned one or two points from the
[658.1s] life of Eve even if they sinned we still
[662.0s] have learned something from them and I'd
[664.5s] like us to end with a word of prayer
[667.0s] from aen let's believe and pray Heavenly
[670.4s] Father we thank you we bless your holy
[672.1s] name oh God we thank you for the lesson
[674.2s] that we've learned from The Story of
[675.8s] Evil God I pray that as women Almighty
[678.2s] king of glory may you give us the wisdom
[680.3s] may you give us the uh the understanding
[682.6s] Almighty king of glory that father we
[684.7s] should not um play around with sin king
[687.8s] of glory that we should not entertain
[689.5s] Almighty father but Lord we should lead
[691.5s] others to you Almighty king of glory
[694.0s] father Lord I pray that you may give us
[695.7s] the the Holy Spirit Almighty Lord so
[697.7s] that we may be able to draw others
[699.8s] closer to you oh Lord in Jesus name we
[702.1s] pray amen amen
