FULL TRANSCRIPT:
amen amen it's a blessing to see you again and I praise God for the privilege of being alive today on this last Sabbath of 2024 he's been a good God to me and I praise him and I'm very thankful to have such a loving father beyond all the privilege of being able to stand up here and share his word this morning the last Sabbath of 2024 and greetings from Fountain of Hope saath school at Roa we are doing fine and we praise God we praise God we are okay and you're very much welcome to be able to visit uh with us Fountain of Hope sa school is part of narabi Central and therefore as you come you just come home it's home Hallelujah yes please pay us a visit it's beautiful it's awesome to be there and we thank god um this year the focus of God's church here at N Central Church has been growing in Grace the whole of 2024 and this is where the spirit of God LED this church to reflect upon throughout all those 50 uh plus sabbaths and today we want to Crown the end of this reflection um through the Holy Spirit from The Book of Psalms 103 from verse veres 1- 6 Psalms 103 from veres 1 to 6 I've entitled the reflection for this morning bless the Lord oh my soul bless the Lord oh my soul Psalms 103 uh from vers 1 to6 as was read to us by our mom and our sister this morning let us pray father we'd want to invite your holy presence yet again this morning we desire to hear from no one and nothing but from you and your word and so in humility we pray that you now speak to our very Hearts may we hear your voice today I pray Lord that your spirit will fill this space above all I pray that you hide me behind the cross of Jesus Jesus as I speak your word it shall be nothing but Christ and himself uplifted thank you we ask it in Jesus name amen bless the Lord oh my soul and all that is within me bless His holy name bless the Lord oh my soul and forget none of his benefits who pardons all your iniquities who heals all your diseases who redeems your life from the pit who crowns you with loving kindness and compassion vers five who satisfies your years with good things so that your youth is renewed like the eagle this is a sum of David's Scholars do agree and believe that which some do say it was written after a recovery from an illness since he speaking of diseases being healed and his youth being renewed this is the Reason by which some Scholars do suggest it was written as well in his old Agee for he makes the subject of the psalm to be concerning coldness with which prevailed upon him in old age but rather we found that he speaks from a warm heart and with a sense of love of God and a hint of spiritual blessings of Grace that seems to be flowing from his heart others do say say that we should attribute this to his later years or later years when he had a deeper or higher sense of the preciousness of Pardon a Keener sense of sin than which than in his younger days his clear sense of Frailty of Life indicat his weaker years as Al as also does the very rich praiseful gratitude a kener sense of sin and a higher sense of the preciousness of pron but it begins by saying bless the Lord bless the Lord oh my soul and all that is within me bless His holy name we find this word bless in Hebrew as baraki and baraki because we speak Swahili is very close from where we get our word Baraka from the word blessings and therefore it is not to be confused with praise although in some translations it comes out as praised because of the meaning which simply means to praise God completely with whole heart Yahweh in Hebrew for David to say bless the Lord oh my soul and all that is within me bless His holy name he meant to completely and with whole hurt not only as emotive expression outwardly nor this is merely an emotionally charged experience but this includes praising God inwardly in other words praising God with your entire being praise God bless the Lord oh my soul a good preacher by the name of Charles panon comment on this as he was doing an exposition on the same and he says a praise is the rehearsal of Eternal song by Grace we learn to sing and in glory we continue to sing and he asked what will some of you do when you get to heaven if you go on grumbling all the way and then he says do not hope to get to heaven in that style but now now begin to bless the name of the Lord it seems here in this passage we have a God who come to all and has what we call an all comprehensive claim of our homage and on the same we have a David a servant of the Lord who responds then and continues and should even respond today through us it is through the inspiration of the holy spirit of God that this servant of the Lord is almost suggesting that there are layers of our soul an outer layer of the soul and maybe the mid layer probably then the inner layer and then to what is addressing as the innermost of the Soul and although I appreciate that this is figurative language the servant of the Lord is using allow me to indulge you for a moment please to go with this assumption for the sake of better appreciation of this passage and so if there were to be layers David in desperation calls not the alar nor the mid layers or the inner layer but calls the innermost layer of his souls and says bless His holy name this is what the other versions would say all that is within me praise His holy name the psalmist strikes the best keyote when he begins with tearing up his inmost self to magnify the Lord he calls himself to attention and summons himself that though he F he felt that Darkness would ought to soon steal over his faculties as always it does to us and he says our God is worthy to be praised by us in the highest style of adulation which is intended by the term bless the book of Psalms 145 and: 10 it says all thy works praise thee Oh God by thy Saints shall bless thee our very life and Essence should be engrossed with this delightful service and each one of us should awaken his own Hur to the engagement and say possibly let others forbear if they can but bless the Lord oh my soul let others murmur but do thy bless the Lord let others bless themselves and their Idol but bless the Lord oh my soul let others use only their tongues but as for me I will cry bless the Lord oh my soul and all that is within me bless His holy name many other faculties the emotions and capacities but God has given them all of them to us and they ought all to join in the chorus to praise Him somebody offers a half-hearted praise emotionally disengaged others offers what we call the in illc conceived Praises not in the right Spirit others and intelligent Praises not engaging their intellect these are not such as we should render to our loving Lord if the law of Justice demanded all our heart and all our soul and mind for the Creator much more the law of gratitude put in a comprehensive claim for the homage of our whole being to the god of Grace the god of Grace the Summits dwell upon the holy name of God as if his Holiness were dous to him or perhaps because the Holiness or Holiness of God was to his mind the grandest motive for rendering to him the homage of his nature in its wholeness children may praise the Divine goodness but fathers in Grace magnify his Holiness by the name we understand the revealed character of God and assuredly those songs which are suggested not by our fallible reasoning and imperfect observation but by anhing inspiration should more than any others call from within ourselves all our consecrated Powers so Psalm 103: 2 as we look at the outline he says bless the Lord and forget not all his benefits now he begins to enumerate one by one he begin with number one a he says forgiveness number B he says healing number three he says Redemption number four or D he says crowning us with love and compassion e satisfies us and f David says bless the Lord and not forget his benefits which is renews our youth like the eagles it was Johnson otman in 1897 who Reed the words of David aim which we know very well and we all have to sing he said when upon lives bows you are temp Tempest and TOS when you are discouraged thinking All Is Lost count your many blessings name them one by one and it will surprise you what the Lord hath done count your blessings name them one by one count your blessings see what God had done count your blessings name them one by one and it will surprise you what the good Lord has done hallelujah as we come to the end of 2024 As We Worship the Lord in the last Sabbath of 2024 I suggest maybe that we sit down and write a list to God and in it go ahead thankfully like David ulating his goodness reflecting on of his own sufficient Grace for you the whole of 2024 and write down what you thankful for counting your blessings one by one and speak to your soul like David and command it like David and tell it not to forget none of his benefits Hallelujah ah bless the Lord oh my soul and forget not all his benefits Psalm 77: 11 it says I will remember the Deeds of the Lord yes yes I will remember your wonders of old I will ponder all your work and meditate on your holy days there is a voice calling a bell ringing symbols are crushing a trumpet producing a counter Melody to telling you to remember the Deeds of the Lord in your life to ponder upon all the works of God in your family to meditate upon the goodness of God God in the lives of your loved ones the question is why then Spa why is the man of God calling his heart of hearts his innermost being why is he sparing it not to forget his benefits memory is very treacherous especially about the things the Matters by a strange perversity and you know beginning from the fall when you fell into Sin from the from from Genesis there the memory has a way of treasuring up what possibly others would call The Refuge of the past things that are not so much important and in the process permits the Priceless Treasures to lie neglected it is tenous of grievances and many times holds all to Loosely which is very precious and important and that is why the heart needs to be spurred the heart needs to be called to its duty but though it's supposed to do it with the light it has to be spurred I think of it as uh those old factory Machinery or possibly Old Farm Machinery like tractors of yester year you know they were not so out automated nowadays we have the ones who just click a button or click on the remote and the Machinery or the engine is alive but the old Machinery needed manual ignition not just of the key but sometimes turning the engine uh with a lever I've seen some of the videos where someone put a lever and rotate the engine with his hands and I'll liken our heart to these old machineries there must be an intentional deliberate stirring and sparring because if I don't do so I will be forgetful I will forget the benefit and therefore miss the blessings of being grateful in worship to the god of my salvation there are enough reasons in this life to make us feel hopeless of the things that happened yester year of things that happened 10 years ago of things that were supposed to happen and didn't happen at all this year and that is why I have to be intentional I have to be deliberate about stirring my soul sparring my soul and calling it not to forget the Lord's benefit and this God's people we must choose to do in the name of Jesus H Allelujah we must choose to do so today and he Begin by inating number one he says and forget not all his benefits number one he says number one is forgiveness here David begins his list of blessings received by rehearsing themes and Arguments for praise he select a few choices that are the most precious to him from a basket of divine love and he begins one by talking about the pardoned sin in know experience one of the choicest bounds of God's grace have we been speaking about this whole year one of the earliest gift of Mercy in fact the needful preparations for enjoying all that follows from our father it is pardon of sin till iniquity Is Forgiven till sins are forgiven first in the order of a spiritual experience and some regard fast and value then the rest becomes impossible for us to enjoy the pardon granted is a present one the word or the tense used there is it's a present continuous forgives he doesn't say he who forgave you your sins he says he who for forgives you all your sins it is continual for his still forgives it is divine for God gives it it is far reaching for it removes all our sins it takes in omissions it takes in commissions and we have been forgiven and it is present continuous and this is Grace Hallelujah Church before I leave this space the spirit of God speaks through David and addresses the provision of forgiveness of sin not as an excuse for sin but a present continuous Grace he who forgive us yester year he was faithful to forgive us this year he's still so loving and faithful yet to forgive us for the coming year hallelujah it's a blessing to S kind of God think of how dark our prospects will be this morning and how our prospects will be for the new year and the future if you all came here heavily burdened with our sins and left this place the same way aren't you thankful for the gift of forgiveness from our Lord then somebody ought to say Thank You Lord has anybody been forgiven in this house of worship today then say thank you Lord I don't hear anybody anybody been forgiven this side say thank you Lord and this anybody been forgiven say thank you Lord on the balcony anybody has been forgiven say thank you Lord it is a gift from our Lord that has been given to us freely the psalmist Begin by saying and bless the Lord of my soul he who forgives you all your sins number two says he heal he who heals you from all the disease of your body the psalmist strikes the best keynote when he begins by stirring up his inmost self to magnify by God and the next benefit is calling his innermost is to not forget his healing Jesus the great physic not only heals the soul but restores the sick emotions and physical maladies a healing bah he has been to us in his church and I thank God today for his healing on this body the body of of Christ here Arab Central that is very visible and healing in our individual lives and God's people he who for gives us as a jurge then eradicates our diseases he cures us as a great physician and this year has been a year of healing emotional healing psychological healing spiritual healing I'm so glad and I'm so grateful to know this great physician for if it has not been for Dr Jesus in our lives we wouldn't be singing this morning and the healing continues until they make it the city of God the new J Jerusalem and to the earth made new John says and he says I Heard a Voice saying and God shall wipe away their tears Hallelujah to God because his healing has been on going in the people of God it will continue even when Christ comes again the healing of God thankful for healing even today he then quotes another he enlist another benefit of which he's praising God for and he says also he who redeems your life from destruction by patches and by power the Lord redeemed David the Lord redeemed the David in you and the David in me and he has redeemed us from the spiritual death into which we had fallen and from that Eternal death which would have been its consequence had not the death penalty of sin be removed our forgiveness and healing would have been in complete portions of Salvation fragment only but of small value but the removal of the guilt and power of sin is fitly attended by the reversal of the sentence of death which has been passed upon us who delivered us from going down into the pit by giving himself to our Ransom Redemption will ever constitute one of the sweetest notes in the believer's Grateful song We Sing redeemed how I love to Proclaim it Redeemed by the blood of the Lamb Redeemed by his infinite Mercy his child I'm forever Hallelujah Church of God it is a gift from the Lord David remembers and he says forget not his benefit forget not his Redemption oh my soul just as before he finish he says don't forget also the benefit that he crowneth your life with loving kindness and Tender Mercies he who crowneth you with loving kindness and Tender Mercies you know our Lord does not do anything by halves he goes to the atmost with his people cleansing healing redeeming seems not to be enough for this loving gracious father he makes them kings and queens and crowns them and the kind of crown God is putting on your head and my head on your brow and my brow it is far more precious than the gems which are crowned in the kings crowns down here these are not corrupt corrupt with things like gold and silver but yet it is it is started with things like Grace lined with velvet of loving kindness and David is saying that God has crowned me the whole of is here he has crowned my life since I began to walk with him with loving kindness and Tender Mercies and he continues even today to Crown his children with the edit edifices on the on the Brows which are which have gems on them gems of Love gems of kindness gems of Tender Mercies our sin deprived us of all our Hors but he Who removed the sentence of death by redeeming us from destruction restores to us more than all our former owners by crowning us and new a God who crowns us with loving kindness and Tender Mercies maybe we Poe to ask ourselves this morning has God crowned you this year with his loving kindness has God crowned around me this year with Tender Mercies are those coronets are those gems being seen on my crown today but David the son of Son of God he writes and says he has been faithful to Crown my life with loving kindness and also Tender Mercies he has been faithful redem my life he's been good to heal me to forgive me but above it all he says that vers five that it is God who satisfi my mouth with good things or rather filling with good thy soul I love what translation Thomson version it says who satisfies your years with good things so that your youth is renewed like the ego a God who satisfies us no man is ever F satisfaction but a Believer and Only God himself can satisfy even him no human being elsewhere can experience satisfaction apart from those who have come to know and love the Lord Jesus Christ but even them those who love the Lord those who are believers only God himself himself does satisfy them many a worldling or people of the world are associated with many things to try and satisfy them but none of them satisfy God satisfies the soul of every man his noblest part his hament and glory and of consequence he satisfies his mouth however hungry and craving it might be God satisfies none of the things of this life can satisfy we've heard dreams that we worked hard for over the years and we achieved them we were happy we were Joyful We felt possibly grateful but never satisfied we've had plans we had things that we thought that when we achieve them and when we receive them in our lives be all good we shall be so fulfilled I'm not saying it is bad to have dreams or to have such kind of aspirations Noble aspirations but we all can satisfy today that none of them satisfies like Jehovah does only God who is able to satisfy a human heart so satisfaction can only come from Jehovah and that is why David calls for so praise because his mouth was filled with good and when his our mouth are filled with good a good writer says we are bound to speak good of him who filled it our good Lord bestes really good things good things that which none of we can find in this material world not vain toys not Idol pleasures and this is giving always every day if we were feeling empty yesterday and we went to him and told him Lord feel us feel me again he did it the previous year if went to Christ and told him Lord I feel empty I feel that I need to be fulfilled I feel a need for you to satisfy me he did satisfy us and he did fulfill us and yet yet today if we still go to him and call upon him and tell him Lord you only can satisfy yet he's he's going to continue to do so he satisfies us every day and that is why I I am admiring I like the language which the servant of God is using because it Contin to be a present continuous where he says he Satisfy My Soul it is present it is continuous Hallelujah God's people he forgives me it is not he forgave me and then it is over no he forgives it it is present it is continuous he Crown me hey he is crowning me he has been crowning me and he continues to do so and here he says he satisfi me it is a present continuous it is a miracle happening daily shall we not then praise him shall we not then honor him for if we never cease to bless him till he ceases to bless us then our employment will be Eternal and then he says so that your youth is is renewed like the eagles I I was trying to check on this because we know of the Eagles molting how they they normally do molting and then they have themselves renewed their strength is renewed but I couldn't trace this in this particular text he was talking about possibly an ego that has been tired an ego that has been sick an ego that could not gaze upon the direct sunlight any longer an ego that can't fly through the storm anymore but then finds itself in a place of renewal and this is what the psalmist is using as he tries in a metaphorical language to explain what God had done for him that he's he he renewed his life he renewed his youth like the eagles a renewal of strength amounting to a grant of a new list of life people of God to be honest we are tired over the years possibly through all this year we've experienced a lot come through a lot and I can understand many of you possibly are ending this year with oh thank you Jesus it's it's it's over the year is finally over our economy is not doing very well in our country right now and people I I was recently to social media and news and and people complaining we do not have money in our pockets and therefore even though we would have loved to have possibly a better festive season and celebrate but it is hard because our pockets are dry things are tough for everybody and there are numerous reasons and things at which we can see today they've made us feel so tired our Zeal is down our passion is down but David possibly had come to a place and a space in his life where he felt like many of us are feeling today at the end of the year when we feel our energy is gone our passion is down our Zeal even to serve God and to live for God is down but but he speaks and says bless the Lord oh my inmost soul bar Yahweh sparing his soul to praise God to bless the Lord and he reminds himself of that God when the his passion is down when the energy is over when he has borne the burdens of the day and his back is aching and his mind is tired and he feels he has more no more strength he says yet my soul rise up a fresh rise up a new oh bless the Lord for remember remember life and life comes from him John 10: 10 it says that comes to kill and steal and destroy but I've come that they may have life and have it in abundance in abundance simply meaning that it is only God who can put life into our lives I can live life into the end that is empty but until God comes and put meaningfulness and substance into that life is always empty and David is saying yes celebrate that God bless his name call upon him talk to him because it is him who is going to bring meaningfulness yet again he's a God who is going to bring that Essence yet again into your life and you can trust him for the days to come even though even though you can be like an eag that possibly is so tired and bited and with all reasons Desiring to give up and possibly letting go it says bless the Lord because he is able to renew your life he's able to satisfy you renew your youth like the ego and feel your life your years with good things we are coming to the end of this year and if Christ doesn't come next year we're going to praise His name if it does come it will be a blessing for God's children finally to see Christ coming Glory Hallelujah but if he chooses or he doesn't come next coming year we have work to do for God we have families to raise for Jesus we have God to honor we have Ministry to do we have a life to live for the glory and honor of our God hallelujah yes and we have to continue moving forward we have to continue living we have to continue serving we have to continue laboring for God we have to continue doing the mission that which God has given to us as church but all we are tired we have to go back to him and tell him Lord renew us again renew our lives again renew renew our Zeal to serve you again renew the passion that which possibly seem to have gone aresh oh like you've done to David renew me again Lord my desire to pray my desire to serve you my heart for you my life for you renew me Lord and like David we can look forward to the years to come with a smile trusting him who is able to fill our years with good things and as I finish this message this morning morning we can look back the whole of 2024 list down and you it down like David the blessings from God the grace that which we have received from him and we can say with confidence that if he has been with us the whole of that year and The Elements of Life did not consume Us by his grace and his mercies The Elements of Life did not overtake us we can be very sure that we can face the coming year the days to come with confidence the same Grace is going to be sufficient for us and until Christ comes again in glory in Jesus name amen

[93.0s] 6 Psalms
[95.2s] 103 from veres 1 to 6 I've entitled the
[99.7s] reflection for this morning bless the
[102.4s] Lord oh my soul bless the Lord oh my
[106.5s] soul Psalms
[108.6s] 103 uh from vers 1 to6 as was read to us

[182.9s] iniquities who heals all your
[186.3s] diseases who redeems your life from the
[190.5s] pit who crowns you with loving kindness
[195.2s] and compassion vers five who satisfies
[200.2s] your years with good
[202.8s] things so that your youth is renewed
[207.4s] like the eagle
[211.3s] this is a sum of David's Scholars do
[215.4s] agree and
[217.4s] believe that
[219.7s] which some do say it was written after a
[224.5s] recovery from an
[226.6s] illness since he speaking of diseases
[229.1s] being healed and his youth being
[235.6s] renewed this is the Reason by which some
[238.0s] Scholars do suggest it was written
[240.7s] as well in his old
[242.4s] Agee for he makes the subject of the
[244.8s] psalm to be concerning coldness with
[247.5s] which prevailed upon him in old age but
[251.9s] rather we found that he speaks from a
[255.0s] warm heart and with a sense of love of
[259.8s] God and a hint of spiritual blessings of
[264.0s] Grace that seems to be flowing from his
[268.0s] heart others do say say that we should
[270.9s] attribute this to his later years or
[273.2s] later years when he had a deeper or
[276.6s] higher sense of the preciousness of
[280.4s] Pardon a Keener sense of
[283.3s] sin than which than in his younger
[287.6s] days his clear sense of Frailty of Life
[291.9s] indicat his weaker
[294.2s] years as Al as also does the very rich
[297.8s] praiseful
[301.4s] gratitude a kener sense of
[304.4s] sin and a higher sense of the
[307.4s] preciousness of
[310.1s] pron but it begins by saying bless the
[315.7s] Lord bless the Lord oh my
[319.7s] soul and all that is within me bless His
[324.0s] holy
[325.0s] name we find this word bless in Hebrew
[329.9s] as
[330.8s] baraki and baraki because we speak
[333.2s] Swahili is very close from where we get
[335.1s] our word Baraka from the word
[337.9s] blessings and therefore it is not to be
[341.0s] confused with praise although in some
[343.7s] translations it comes out as praised
[346.6s] because of the meaning which simply
[348.8s] means to praise God completely with
[352.9s] whole
[354.7s] heart Yahweh in
[357.4s] Hebrew for David to say bless the Lord
[360.7s] oh my soul and all that is within me
[362.4s] bless His holy
[364.0s] name he meant to completely and with
[367.2s] whole
[368.5s] hurt not only as emotive expression
[372.8s] outwardly nor this is merely an
[376.2s] emotionally charged experience but this
[379.3s] includes praising God
[382.7s] inwardly in other words praising God
[386.5s] with your entire being praise God bless
[390.3s] the Lord oh my
[391.7s] soul a good preacher by the name of
[394.1s] Charles panon comment on this as he was
[397.1s] doing an exposition on the same and he
[398.8s] says a praise is the rehearsal of
[401.2s] Eternal song by Grace we learn to sing
[405.1s] and in glory we continue to
[407.9s] sing and he asked what will some of you
[410.8s] do when you get to heaven if you go on
[413.6s] grumbling all the way and then he says
[416.4s] do not hope to get to heaven in that
[418.2s] style but now now begin to bless the
[422.6s] name of the
[424.7s] Lord it seems here in this passage we
[429.6s] have a God who come to
[432.3s] all and has what we call an all
[435.8s] comprehensive claim of our
[439.0s] homage and on the same we have a David a
[443.0s] servant of the Lord who responds then
[446.0s] and continues and should even respond
[448.9s] today through
[450.6s] us it is through the inspiration of the
[453.5s] holy spirit of
[454.9s] God that this servant of the Lord is
[457.8s] almost suggesting that there are layers
[461.5s] of our soul an outer layer of the soul
[465.8s] and maybe the mid
[468.3s] layer probably then the inner
[471.4s] layer and then to what is addressing as
[474.2s] the innermost of the
[478.4s] Soul and although I appreciate that this
[481.0s] is figurative language the servant of
[484.0s] the Lord is using allow me to indulge
[486.8s] you for a moment please to go with this
[489.6s] assumption for the sake of better
[491.4s] appreciation of this
[493.8s] passage and so if there were to be
[497.5s] layers David in
[500.1s] desperation calls not the
[503.2s] alar nor the mid layers or the inner
[507.5s] layer but calls the innermost layer of
[511.8s] his souls and says bless His holy name
[515.8s] this is what the other versions would
[517.5s] say all that is within me praise His
[522.6s] holy
[524.6s] name the psalmist strikes the best
[527.6s] keyote when he begins with tearing up
[529.8s] his inmost self to magnify the Lord he
[534.0s] calls himself to attention and summons
[536.0s] himself that though he F he felt that
[538.0s] Darkness would ought to
[540.2s] soon steal over his faculties as always
[543.1s] it does to
[546.0s] us and he says our God is worthy to be
[549.0s] praised by us in the highest style of
[552.8s] adulation which is intended by the term
[557.0s] bless the book of Psalms 145 and:
[560.8s] 10 it says all thy works praise thee Oh
[565.1s] God by thy Saints shall bless thee
[570.1s] our very life and Essence should be
[573.8s] engrossed with this delightful service
[577.4s] and each one of us should awaken his own
[579.7s] Hur to the
[581.5s] engagement and say possibly let others
[585.0s] forbear if they can but bless the Lord
[588.5s] oh my
[589.6s] soul let others
[592.0s] murmur but do thy bless the
[594.9s] Lord let others bless themselves and
[598.8s] their Idol
[601.1s] but bless the Lord oh my soul let others
[605.2s] use only their tongues but as for me I
[609.4s] will cry bless the Lord oh my soul and
[614.0s] all that is within me bless His holy
[617.0s] name many other
[619.2s] faculties the emotions and
[621.8s] capacities but God has given them all of
[626.0s] them to us and they ought all to join in
[630.9s] the chorus to praise
[633.7s] Him somebody offers a half-hearted
[636.6s] praise emotionally
[638.7s] disengaged others offers what we call
[641.1s] the in illc conceived Praises not in the
[644.6s] right
[645.6s] Spirit others and intelligent Praises
[649.6s] not engaging their intellect these are
[652.7s] not such as we should render to our
[654.4s] loving Lord if the law of Justice
[657.5s] demanded all our heart and all our soul
[660.6s] and mind for the Creator much more the
[664.5s] law of gratitude put in a comprehensive
[668.7s] claim for the homage of our whole being
[671.4s] to the god of Grace the god of
[674.2s] Grace the Summits dwell upon the holy
[676.7s] name of God as if his Holiness were dous
[680.8s] to him or perhaps because the Holiness
[684.3s] or Holiness of God was to his mind the
[688.7s] grandest motive for rendering to him the
[692.4s] homage of his nature in its wholeness
[695.4s] children may praise the Divine goodness
[699.0s] but fathers in Grace magnify his
[702.4s] Holiness by the name we understand the
[705.8s] revealed character of
[707.8s] God and assuredly those songs which are
[711.2s] suggested not by our fallible reasoning
[713.7s] and imperfect
[714.8s] observation but by anhing inspiration
[718.6s] should more than any
[722.2s] others call from within ourselves all
[725.5s] our consecrated
[727.6s] Powers so Psalm 103: 2 as we look at the
[731.6s] outline he says bless the Lord and
[735.9s] forget not all his benefits now he
[740.2s] begins to enumerate one by one he begin
[742.6s] with number one a he says forgiveness
[744.9s] number B he says healing number three he
[747.8s] says Redemption number four or D he says
[751.2s] crowning us with love and compassion e
[754.4s] satisfies us and f David says bless the
[759.1s] Lord and not forget his benefits which
[761.3s] is renews our youth like the
[765.5s] eagles it was Johnson otman in
[769.5s] 1897 who Reed the words of David aim
[772.3s] which we know very well and we all have
[775.0s] to sing he said when upon lives bows you
[779.4s] are temp Tempest and TOS when you are
[782.4s] discouraged thinking All Is Lost count
[785.4s] your many blessings name them one by one
[788.6s] and it will surprise you what the Lord
[792.4s] hath done count your blessings name them
[795.3s] one by one count your blessings see what
[798.9s] God had done count your blessings name
[801.9s] them one by
[804.2s] one and it will surprise you what the
[807.7s] good Lord has done hallelujah
[810.7s] as we come to the end of
[812.5s] 2024 As We Worship the Lord in the last
[815.1s] Sabbath of
[817.1s] 2024 I suggest maybe that we sit down
[820.0s] and write a list to God and in it go
[823.5s] ahead thankfully like David ulating his
[828.4s] goodness reflecting on of his own
[831.2s] sufficient Grace for you the whole of
[835.7s] 2024 and write down what you thankful
[839.8s] for counting your blessings one by one
[844.6s] and speak to your soul like David and
[847.8s] command it like David and tell it not to
[852.3s] forget none of his benefits
[855.1s] Hallelujah ah bless the Lord oh my soul
[859.0s] and forget not all his benefits Psalm
[862.8s] 77: 11 it says I will remember the Deeds
[867.1s] of the Lord yes yes I will remember your
[870.8s] wonders of old I will ponder all your
[874.6s] work and meditate on your holy days
[879.0s] there is a voice calling a bell ringing
[882.2s] symbols are crushing a trumpet producing
[884.7s] a counter Melody to telling you to
[887.7s] remember the Deeds of the Lord in your
[890.5s] life to ponder upon all the works of God
[895.0s] in your family to meditate upon the
[898.1s] goodness of God
[900.3s] God in the lives of your loved
[903.8s] ones the question is why then Spa why is
[907.7s] the man of God calling his heart of
[910.3s] hearts his innermost being why is he
[913.2s] sparing it not to forget his benefits
[916.4s] memory is very
[917.7s] treacherous especially about the
[922.5s] things the
[924.6s] Matters by a strange perversity
[929.3s] and you know beginning from the fall
[932.2s] when you fell into Sin from the from
[933.8s] from Genesis
[936.0s] there the memory has a way of treasuring
[939.6s] up what possibly others would call The
[942.2s] Refuge of the past things that are not
[945.3s] so much important and in the process
[949.5s] permits the Priceless Treasures to lie
[954.8s] neglected it is tenous of grievances
[959.5s] and many times holds all to Loosely
[963.7s] which is very precious and important and
[966.0s] that is why the heart needs to be
[969.0s] spurred the heart needs to be called to
[971.4s] its duty but though it's supposed to do
[974.3s] it with the light it has to be spurred I
[976.3s] think of it as uh those old factory
[981.0s] Machinery or possibly Old Farm Machinery
[984.9s] like tractors of yester year you know
[988.1s] they were not so out
[989.7s] automated nowadays we have the ones who
[991.9s] just click a button or click on the
[995.4s] remote and the Machinery or the engine
[997.6s] is alive but the old Machinery needed
[1001.9s] manual ignition not just of the key but
[1006.1s] sometimes turning the engine uh with a
[1009.0s] lever I've seen some of the videos where
[1011.1s] someone put a lever and rotate the
[1014.3s] engine with his hands and I'll liken our
[1018.5s] heart
[1019.6s] to these old
[1022.2s] machineries there must be an
[1025.6s] intentional deliberate
[1028.4s] stirring and
[1030.8s] sparring because if I don't do so I will
[1035.2s] be
[1036.1s] forgetful I will forget the benefit and
[1040.4s] therefore miss the blessings of being
[1042.2s] grateful in worship to the god of my
[1044.8s] salvation there are enough reasons in
[1046.9s] this life to make us feel hopeless
[1050.9s] of the things that happened yester year
[1054.2s] of things that happened 10 years ago of
[1058.1s] things that were supposed to happen and
[1061.1s] didn't happen at all this
[1064.0s] year and that is why I have to be
[1069.4s] intentional I have to be deliberate
[1072.7s] about stirring my soul sparring my soul
[1077.7s] and calling it not to forget the Lord's
[1081.7s] benefit and this God's people we must
[1084.8s] choose to do in the name of Jesus H
[1086.6s] Allelujah we must choose to do so today
[1090.1s] and he Begin by inating number one he
[1091.6s] says and forget not all his benefits
[1093.8s] number one he says number one is
[1096.7s] forgiveness here David begins his list
[1100.0s] of blessings
[1101.8s] received by rehearsing themes and
[1104.4s] Arguments for praise he select a few
[1107.8s] choices that are the most precious to
[1110.2s] him from a basket of divine love and he
[1112.8s] begins one by talking about the pardoned
[1116.2s] sin in know
[1118.2s] experience one of the choicest bounds of
[1120.7s] God's grace have we been speaking about
[1123.0s] this whole year one of the earliest gift
[1125.9s] of
[1126.6s] Mercy in fact the needful preparations
[1130.0s] for enjoying all that follows from our
[1134.3s] father it is pardon of sin till iniquity
[1139.2s] Is
[1140.0s] Forgiven till sins are forgiven first in
[1144.4s] the order of a spiritual experience and
[1147.0s] some regard fast and value then the rest
[1151.1s] becomes impossible for us to
[1153.4s] enjoy the pardon granted is a present
[1157.7s] one the word or the tense used there is
[1160.4s] it's a present continuous forgives he
[1163.6s] doesn't say he who forgave you your sins
[1167.0s] he says he who for forgives you all your
[1170.5s] sins it is continual for his still
[1173.4s] forgives it is divine for God gives it
[1177.3s] it is far reaching for it removes all
[1180.2s] our sins it takes in omissions it takes
[1183.6s] in commissions and we have been forgiven
[1187.1s] and it is present continuous and this is
[1191.5s] Grace Hallelujah
[1193.5s] Church before I leave this
[1196.9s] space the spirit of God speaks through
[1199.2s] David and addresses the provision of
[1202.4s] forgiveness of sin not as an excuse for
[1206.0s] sin but a present continuous Grace he
[1210.6s] who forgive us yester year he was
[1213.8s] faithful to forgive us this year he's
[1216.7s] still so loving and faithful yet to
[1219.2s] forgive us for the coming year
[1221.0s] hallelujah it's a blessing to S kind of
[1223.7s] God think of how dark our prospects will
[1227.0s] be this morning and how our prospects
[1230.2s] will be for the new year and the future
[1233.0s] if you all came here heavily burdened
[1237.4s] with our sins and left this place the
[1239.5s] same way aren't you thankful for the
[1242.9s] gift of forgiveness from our
[1245.3s] Lord then somebody ought to say Thank
[1247.4s] You Lord has anybody been forgiven in
[1250.8s] this house of worship today then say
[1253.3s] thank you Lord I don't hear anybody
[1255.6s] anybody been forgiven this side say
[1257.0s] thank you Lord and this anybody been
[1259.4s] forgiven say thank you Lord on the
[1261.6s] balcony anybody has been forgiven say
[1263.7s] thank you Lord it is a gift from our
[1267.7s] Lord that has been given to us freely
[1270.5s] the psalmist Begin by saying and bless
[1273.4s] the Lord of my soul he who forgives you
[1276.5s] all your sins number two says he heal he
[1279.1s] who heals
[1280.2s] you from all the disease of your body
[1283.6s] the psalmist strikes the best keynote
[1285.8s] when he begins by stirring up his inmost
[1287.7s] self to magnify by God and the next
[1290.6s] benefit is calling his innermost is to
[1293.0s] not forget his healing Jesus the great
[1296.6s] physic not only heals the soul but
[1299.7s] restores the sick emotions and physical
[1302.4s] maladies a healing bah he has been to us
[1305.9s] in his church and I thank God today for
[1308.8s] his healing on this body the body of of
[1311.4s] Christ here Arab Central that is very
[1313.4s] visible and healing in our individual
[1316.2s] lives and God's people he who for gives
[1319.1s] us as a jurge then eradicates our
[1322.8s] diseases he cures us as a great
[1325.7s] physician and this year has been a year
[1327.7s] of healing emotional healing
[1330.2s] psychological healing spiritual healing
[1333.6s] I'm so glad and I'm so grateful to know
[1336.0s] this great physician for if it has not
[1338.9s] been for Dr Jesus in our lives we
[1342.6s] wouldn't be singing this morning and the
[1345.4s] healing continues until they make it the
[1347.6s] city of God the new J Jerusalem and to
[1350.3s] the earth made new John says and he says
[1353.5s] I Heard a Voice saying and God shall
[1356.4s] wipe away their tears Hallelujah to God
[1359.4s] because his healing has been on going in
[1362.4s] the people of God it will continue even
[1365.5s] when Christ comes again the healing of
[1368.3s] God thankful for healing even
[1373.2s] today he then quotes another
[1378.7s] he enlist another benefit of which he's
[1381.3s] praising God
[1382.4s] for and he says also he who redeems your
[1386.3s] life from destruction by patches and by
[1390.0s] power the Lord redeemed David the Lord
[1393.8s] redeemed the David in you and the David
[1395.8s] in me and he has redeemed us from the
[1398.4s] spiritual death into which we had fallen
[1401.9s] and from that Eternal death which would
[1405.2s] have been its consequence had not the
[1407.7s] death penalty of sin be removed our
[1410.5s] forgiveness and healing would have been
[1412.9s] in complete portions of Salvation
[1414.8s] fragment only but of small value but the
[1418.1s] removal of the guilt and power of sin is
[1421.7s] fitly attended by the reversal of the
[1424.9s] sentence of death which has been passed
[1427.3s] upon us who delivered us from going down
[1431.2s] into the pit by giving himself to our
[1434.4s] Ransom Redemption will ever constitute
[1438.8s] one of the sweetest notes in the
[1441.4s] believer's Grateful song We Sing
[1443.5s] redeemed how I love to Proclaim it
[1446.8s] Redeemed by the blood of the Lamb
[1449.6s] Redeemed by his infinite Mercy his child
[1453.9s] I'm forever Hallelujah Church of God it
[1457.2s] is a gift from the Lord David remembers
[1460.5s] and he says forget not his benefit
[1463.1s] forget not his
[1465.3s] Redemption oh my soul
[1468.8s] just as before he finish he says don't
[1471.3s] forget also the benefit that he crowneth
[1473.5s] your life with loving
[1476.2s] kindness and Tender
[1478.6s] Mercies he who crowneth you with loving
[1484.3s] kindness and Tender
[1487.1s] Mercies you know our Lord does not do
[1489.3s] anything by halves he goes to the atmost
[1493.4s] with his people cleansing healing
[1498.5s] redeeming seems not to be enough for
[1500.7s] this loving gracious
[1503.3s] father he makes them kings and queens
[1507.0s] and crowns them and the kind of crown
[1510.2s] God is putting on your head and my
[1513.5s] head on your brow and my
[1516.2s] brow it is far more
[1518.8s] precious than the gems which are crowned
[1522.5s] in the kings crowns down
[1527.0s] here these are
[1530.6s] not corrupt corrupt with things like
[1532.2s] gold and
[1534.2s] silver but yet it is it is
[1536.9s] started with things like
[1540.1s] Grace lined with velvet of loving
[1544.2s] kindness and David is saying that God
[1547.6s] has crowned me the whole of is here he
[1551.5s] has crowned my life since I began to
[1555.4s] walk with him with loving kindness
[1559.2s] and Tender
[1561.6s] Mercies and he continues even today to
[1565.4s] Crown his
[1567.4s] children with the edit edifices on the
[1570.8s] on the Brows which are which have gems
[1575.0s] on them gems of Love gems of kindness
[1580.6s] gems of Tender Mercies our sin deprived
[1585.7s] us of all our Hors but he Who removed
[1589.2s] the sentence of death by redeeming us
[1590.9s] from destruction restores to us more
[1594.8s] than all our former owners by crowning
[1598.9s] us and new a God who crowns us with
[1603.4s] loving kindness and Tender Mercies maybe
[1606.6s] we Poe to ask ourselves this
[1610.0s] morning has God crowned
[1613.5s] you this year with his loving kindness
[1617.5s] has God crowned around me this year with
[1620.8s] Tender Mercies are those coronets are
[1624.0s] those gems being seen on my crown today
[1629.2s] but David the son of Son of God he
[1632.3s] writes and says he has been faithful to
[1634.4s] Crown my life with loving
[1638.1s] kindness and also Tender Mercies he has
[1641.6s] been faithful redem my life he's been
[1644.3s] good to heal me to forgive me but above
[1648.4s] it all he says that vers
[1651.2s] five that it is God who
[1654.6s] satisfi my mouth with good things or
[1658.9s] rather filling with good thy soul I love
[1663.9s] what translation Thomson version it says
[1666.8s] who satisfies your
[1669.1s] years with good things so that your
[1674.0s] youth is renewed like the ego a God who
[1681.4s] satisfies us no
[1685.5s] man is ever F
[1688.4s] satisfaction but a Believer and Only God
[1692.8s] himself can satisfy even him no human
[1697.8s] being elsewhere can experience
[1702.0s] satisfaction apart from those who have
[1704.7s] come to know and love the Lord Jesus
[1707.1s] Christ but even
[1709.4s] them those who love the Lord those who
[1712.4s] are
[1713.1s] believers only God himself himself does
[1717.9s] satisfy
[1719.8s] them many a worldling or people of the
[1722.4s] world are associated with many things to
[1724.8s] try and satisfy
[1726.4s] them but none of them
[1729.1s] satisfy God
[1731.1s] satisfies the soul of every man his
[1735.8s] noblest part his hament and glory and of
[1740.2s] consequence he satisfies his mouth
[1743.8s] however hungry and craving it might be
[1748.0s] God
[1749.5s] satisfies none of the things of this
[1751.6s] life can
[1752.6s] satisfy we've heard dreams that we
[1755.8s] worked hard for over the years and we
[1759.3s] achieved
[1760.5s] them we were happy we were Joyful We
[1764.6s] felt possibly
[1766.0s] grateful but never satisfied
[1769.4s] we've had plans we had things that we
[1772.1s] thought that when we achieve them and
[1774.6s] when we receive them in our
[1776.3s] lives be all good we shall be so
[1779.4s] fulfilled I'm not saying it is bad to
[1781.5s] have dreams or to have such kind of
[1784.5s] aspirations Noble
[1786.6s] aspirations but we all can satisfy today
[1790.1s] that none of them satisfies like Jehovah
[1793.3s] does only God who is able to satisfy a
[1798.3s] human heart so
[1802.4s] satisfaction can only come from Jehovah
[1805.0s] and that is why David calls for so
[1807.3s] praise because his mouth was filled with
[1811.3s] good and when his our mouth are filled
[1814.0s] with good a good writer says we are
[1816.1s] bound to speak good of him who filled
[1820.0s] it our good Lord bestes really good
[1823.9s] things good things that which none of we
[1827.7s] can find in this material world not vain
[1830.7s] toys not Idol
[1833.4s] pleasures and this is giving always
[1837.0s] every day if we were feeling empty
[1840.6s] yesterday and we went to him and told
[1842.6s] him Lord feel us feel me again he did it
[1846.8s] the previous year if went to Christ and
[1849.2s] told him Lord I feel empty I feel that I
[1851.0s] need to be fulfilled I feel a need for
[1853.2s] you to satisfy me he did satisfy us and
[1856.4s] he did fulfill us and yet yet today if
[1859.2s] we still go to him and call upon him and
[1861.1s] tell him Lord you only can
[1864.3s] satisfy yet he's he's going to continue
[1867.0s] to do so he satisfies
[1870.2s] us every day and that is why I I am
[1873.6s] admiring I like the language which the
[1875.0s] servant of God is
[1876.4s] using because it Contin to be a present
[1879.2s] continuous where he says he Satisfy My
[1883.7s] Soul it is present it is continuous
[1887.5s] Hallelujah God's people he forgives me
[1890.6s] it is not he forgave me and then it is
[1893.3s] over no he forgives it it is present it
[1897.7s] is continuous he Crown me hey he is
[1902.1s] crowning me he has been crowning me and
[1905.4s] he continues to do so and here he says
[1908.0s] he satisfi me it is a present continuous
[1912.8s] it is a miracle happening daily shall we
[1916.2s] not then praise him shall we not then
[1918.9s] honor him for if we never cease to bless
[1921.7s] him till he ceases to bless us then our
[1924.1s] employment will be
[1925.4s] Eternal and then he says so that your
[1927.6s] youth is is
[1929.3s] renewed like the eagles I I was trying
[1931.9s] to check on this because we know of the
[1933.6s] Eagles molting how they they normally do
[1936.9s] molting and then they have themselves
[1939.4s] renewed their strength is renewed but I
[1942.6s] couldn't trace this in this particular
[1946.0s] text he was talking about
[1948.8s] possibly an ego that has been tired an
[1953.5s] ego that has been sick an ego that could
[1956.9s] not gaze upon the direct sunlight any
[1959.5s] longer an ego that can't fly through the
[1962.9s] storm
[1964.3s] anymore but then finds itself in a place
[1967.8s] of renewal and this is what the psalmist
[1970.8s] is using as he tries in a metaphorical
[1973.5s] language to explain what God had done
[1976.0s] for him that he's he he renewed his life
[1980.5s] he renewed his youth like the eagles a
[1984.5s] renewal of strength amounting to a grant
[1988.3s] of a new list of life people of God to
[1993.0s] be
[1993.8s] honest we are
[1996.5s] tired over the years possibly through
[2000.1s] all this year we've experienced a lot
[2002.5s] come through a lot and I can understand
[2005.2s] many of you possibly are ending this
[2007.0s] year with oh thank you Jesus it's it's
[2008.7s] it's over the year is finally
[2011.4s] over our economy is not doing very well
[2013.8s] in our country right now and people I I
[2017.4s] was recently to social media and news
[2019.4s] and and people complaining we do not
[2021.0s] have money in our pockets and therefore
[2023.9s] even though we would have loved to have
[2025.2s] possibly a better festive season and
[2027.4s] celebrate but it is hard because our
[2029.4s] pockets are dry things are
[2031.8s] tough for everybody and there are
[2035.5s] numerous reasons
[2038.0s] and things at which we can see today
[2041.0s] they've made us feel so tired our Zeal
[2043.5s] is down our passion is down but David
[2048.0s] possibly had come to a place and a space
[2050.5s] in his life where he felt like many of
[2053.0s] us are feeling today at the end of the
[2055.2s] year when we feel our energy is gone our
[2058.6s] passion is down our Zeal even to serve
[2062.0s] God and to live for God is down but but
[2065.3s] he speaks and says bless the Lord oh my
[2068.4s] inmost soul bar Yahweh sparing his
[2074.2s] soul to praise God to bless the Lord and
[2077.9s] he reminds himself of that God when the
[2081.6s] his passion is down when the energy is
[2084.4s] over when he has borne the burdens of
[2087.2s] the day and his back is aching and his
[2090.8s] mind is tired and he feels he has more
[2093.9s] no more strength he says yet my soul
[2097.8s] rise up a fresh rise up a new oh bless
[2102.7s] the Lord for
[2104.6s] remember remember life and life comes
[2108.0s] from him John 10: 10 it says that comes
[2111.8s] to kill and steal and destroy but I've
[2114.3s] come that they may have life and have it
[2116.4s] in abundance in abundance simply meaning
[2119.8s] that it is only God who can put life
[2122.1s] into our lives I can live life into the
[2125.8s] end that is empty but until God comes
[2129.4s] and put meaningfulness and substance
[2131.3s] into that life is always empty and David
[2133.9s] is saying yes celebrate that God bless
[2137.9s] his name call upon him talk to him
[2141.4s] because it is him who is going to bring
[2145.6s] meaningfulness yet again he's a God who
[2148.3s] is going to bring that Essence yet again
[2150.9s] into your life and you can trust him for
[2154.5s] the days to come even though even though
[2156.8s] you can be like an eag that possibly is
[2160.4s] so tired and bited and with all reasons
[2164.0s] Desiring to give up and possibly letting
[2166.1s] go it says bless the Lord because he is
[2170.9s] able to renew your life he's able to
[2174.4s] satisfy you renew your youth like the
[2177.7s] ego and feel your life your years with
[2182.4s] good things we are coming to the
[2184.9s] end of this year and if Christ doesn't
[2189.1s] come next
[2191.3s] year we're going to praise His name if
[2193.4s] it does come it will be a blessing for
[2195.0s] God's children finally to see Christ
[2196.6s] coming Glory Hallelujah but if he
[2198.8s] chooses or he doesn't come next coming
[2201.6s] year we have work to do for God we have
[2205.0s] families to raise for Jesus we have God
[2207.6s] to honor we have Ministry to do we have
[2211.1s] a life to live for the glory and honor
[2214.4s] of our God hallelujah yes and we have to
[2218.4s] continue moving forward we have to
[2221.2s] continue living we have to continue
[2223.9s] serving we have to continue laboring for
[2226.7s] God we have to continue doing the
[2228.4s] mission that which God has given to us
[2230.2s] as church but all we are tired we have
[2232.8s] to go back to him and tell him Lord
[2235.6s] renew us again renew our lives again
[2240.6s] renew renew our Zeal to serve you again
[2244.5s] renew the passion that which possibly
[2247.5s] seem to have gone aresh oh like you've
[2250.8s] done to David renew me again Lord my
[2254.3s] desire to pray my desire to serve you my
[2258.2s] heart for you my life for you renew me
[2262.6s] Lord and like
[2264.2s] David we can look forward to the years
[2266.5s] to come with a smile trusting him who is
[2270.7s] able to fill our years with good things
[2275.6s] and as I finish this message this
[2277.2s] morning
[2279.1s] morning we can look back the whole of
[2283.8s] 2024 list down and you it down like
[2288.4s] David the blessings from God the grace
[2291.7s] that which we have
[2293.8s] received from
[2296.1s] him and we can say with
[2298.7s] confidence that if he has been with us
[2301.6s] the whole of that year and The Elements
[2304.4s] of Life did not consume Us by his grace
[2306.4s] and his mercies
[2308.4s] The Elements of Life did not overtake
[2310.7s] us we can be very sure that we can face
[2315.0s] the coming year the days to come with
[2319.3s] confidence the same
[2321.4s] Grace is going to be sufficient for us
[2324.3s] and until Christ comes again in glory in
[2326.8s] Jesus name amen
