in public Ministry this is chapter 10 of the book true Revival which we know is the church Church's greatest un and the previous chapter we talked about s guing the new experience so I'd like us to see some of the appeals that were done in the past especially in public Ministry and how we can apply them to our individual cases so I'd like to invite brother Steve to pray and share with us some of these appeals that were done to help convict people to make a decision for God to be truly revived thank you brother niik welcome let us pray father we thank you once again for allowing us all of this blessing of sharing together the three of us and also sharing largely with the audience whom you've made it possible for them to hear Lord it is our prayer that your holy spirit will abide with us even as we talk about this book true Revival may you Empower us oh Lord and may your will be done from the beginning until the end in Jesus name we pray amen amen thank you very much we are wrapping up the book true Revival the book um comprises of 10 chapters we have been running from chapter 1 to 9 every week and today we sum it up and chapter 10 talks about um testimonies ideally or appeals and I would quickly like us to delve into why testimonies are important because after the revivals after LG white revivals and Reformation in different cities there were appeals there were deep appeals and people would testify and perhaps why why were these testimonies important or why would the the the book writer bring us to this uh last bit that talks about um the Revival meetings the testimonies in the Revival meetings testimonies demonstrate God's power testimonies helps us to build our faith they help us to provide strength and hope to those who listen those who hear because these are personal experiences and across different locations Battle Creek um as my brother uh Nico had mentioned um in the previous uh topic there were hundreds of people who gathered to listen to these revivals and the the the Revival meetings constantly inspired people okay we had spiritual Transformations we had people who are truly revived who are truly convicted and who are truly transformed and this actually is a summary of what we've been learning throughout um this book that as Christians who are walking in faith our greatest need is true Revival but how do we achieve this true Revival first we confess our sins we are saved through baptism and the Holy Spirit we are revived we are reformed and after Reformation we walk in faith step by step um through the power of God of course we have to call upon the power of the Holy Spirit to help us in this walk of faith and then we are supposed to move and testify of the Lord's goodness so that we impact on other people we impact on other lives and bring people to Christ now the true revivals brought about emotional depths and Hest Appeals there were appeals as far as San Francisco um we are told that this um there were Prof the appeals were of profound emotional weight at a Revival for example in San Francisco um sister white describes the love and sacrifice of Christ so vividly that many attendees were moved to tears one young man known for his rebellious Spirit stood up during the call for commitment and confessed I canot longer resist the voice of God this powerful moment inspired others to step forward and publicly Embrace their faith and this went across different cities and different towns people were confessing people were testifying and people were being converted there were several Community engagements which had sure outcomes and these sure outcomes were indeed um uh triumphs and victories over challenges uh that people had had had previously um goes further to mention um you know about global rich and how consistent it was and maybe up to this point so that maybe for brother Nik and uh and uh brother opata so that it's not it's not a monologue it seem it beginning to seem like a monologue what what would maybe we pick it from testimony what do you think um you know we usually we see the preacher after every sermon they make an appeal and people come for conversion but how would you tie these appeals um and especially after true conversion and and transformation reformation and transformation how would you tie this to testimonies going forward because after you've received this how would you tie this to testimonies maybe touching on how um sister white and and and our previous uh founders of of this faith um testified and appeals and appealed um to our brothers previously yeah I'd say many appeals are made but sometimes you don't get the testimonies because the spirit of God that moves you to go forward moves you because there's something of an experience which you have had many times I've seen that people have an experience with God and the circumstances that lead to them coming to church at that specific moment are so amazing sometimes they even say they didn't know they' to be here and sometimes I've had people say that someone was for me you know people are saying that because that day the preacher spoke to something that was going on in their life and you might even find that the preacher changed their seron not because they knew why but because of the people who had been there in fact Ellen White mentions it in this chapter that she had to change her title of her word one time then she was speaking because God was telling telling her this is what we need to uh she wanted to speak on a certain subject but it's like it was everything she was planning for was taken away from her mind so now she had to preach what God wanted and after that people came and said we testify that God fully has spoken to us amen so I believe testimonies should be tied to the appeals that we get cuz many times people might come forward and you might not even know why they came forward and them testifying will show the work of God and encourage the Fai amen you want to chime in yeah yes just just just a little uh I think testimonies are very powerful very powerful because this is firstand experience narration of the person who has experienced an encounter with Jesus Christ a good example is the the woman at the well mhm you're seeing that uh because Christ just told her how the truth about her life it was so moving that that message only she carried it you know this lady has not had the about maybe the Ten Commandments she has not been taken through the church manual doctrines and teachings but just that experience that encounter with Christ was enough for her to go and preach to the whole city and clowds were drawn to Jesus Christ so we are seeing that uh there are some things that Christ has done personally to your life that you don't need to keep quiet with them you don't need you need to share with them to with your brethren and a good example is when I come and tell you that uh I have heard I have heard I have heard it's not as powerful as when I sit down with you and tell you my brother this is what the Lord Has Done experienced to me so testimonies are very powerful and we encourage all our listeners and our viewers that if there's anything that God has done to youly share with your brethren because it's a fuel given to increase their faith and their trust to Jesus Christ amen amen amen thank you very much opata thank you very much brother niik I would like to quickly read something before I hand it back to brother Niko in these closing moments of art sinful history surely God's spirit is ready to give us the power to finish our work for others and the work necessary for ourselves can it be that you and I will be the one through whom God will do something special who knows may this book help you to experience the Revival and Reformation that will prepare you for the latter rain and the soon return of our Lord Jesus Christ brother n thank you very much over the past 10 weeks we've shown you how the call for Revival comes how you get converted as a Christian and to show whether your conversion is genuine or fake and you've also shown through the book how you can be born again but we also learn that God has rules too and as we follow these rules we need to have a balance between right and wrong and faith and works to actually understand what is it that God is expecting of us sorry I said balance between right and wrong there's no balance you should only have right yeah the balance is between faith and what then we should be saved only in Christ but even as you saved be aware there are some saving graes that are not real they're fake so it's something that you need to be cognizant of and while we are at it remember you're in a battle with the devil so you have to do your best to save God this new experience and as God has done this for you you can testify to other people and tell them this has been my experience and as you testify you can call others to have a similar experience to you by making heart stirring appeals that bring people to the faith we pray that you've enjoyed the series on the book true Revival and it's our prayer that when we do another book

[56.1s] so I'd like us to see some of the
[57.8s] appeals that were done in the past

[127.9s] chapter 1 to 9 every week and today we
[131.4s] sum it up and chapter 10 talks
[136.0s] about um testimonies ideally or
[140.8s] appeals and I would quickly like us to
[145.2s] delve into why testimonies are important
[148.6s] because after the revivals after LG
[152.0s] white revivals and Reformation in
[154.2s] different cities there were appeals
[157.2s] there were deep appeals and people would
[159.5s] testify and perhaps why why were these
[162.1s] testimonies important or why would the
[164.6s] the the book writer bring us to this uh
[167.6s] last bit that talks about um the Revival
[171.1s] meetings the testimonies in the Revival
[172.8s] meetings testimonies demonstrate God's
[176.3s] power testimonies helps us to build our
[179.3s] faith they help us to provide
[182.2s] strength and hope to those who listen
[185.5s] those who hear because these are
[186.9s] personal experiences and across
[189.9s] different locations Battle Creek um as
[192.6s] my brother uh Nico had mentioned um in
[195.7s] the previous uh topic there were
[198.8s] hundreds of people who gathered to
[201.0s] listen to these revivals and the the the
[204.6s] Revival meetings constantly inspired
[207.6s] people okay we had spiritual
[210.2s] Transformations we had people who are
[212.4s] truly revived who are truly convicted
[215.8s] and who are truly transformed and this
[218.6s] actually is a summary of what we've been
[221.2s] learning throughout um this book that as
[225.6s] Christians who are walking in faith our
[229.0s] greatest need is true Revival but how do
[231.2s] we achieve this true Revival first we
[233.9s] confess our sins we are saved through
[237.1s] baptism and the Holy Spirit we are
[239.4s] revived
[240.8s] we are reformed and after Reformation we
[243.6s] walk in faith step by step um through
[247.3s] the power of God of course we have to
[248.8s] call upon the power of the Holy Spirit
[250.8s] to help us in this walk of faith and
[253.3s] then we are supposed to move and testify
[256.4s] of the Lord's goodness so that we impact
[259.7s] on other people we impact on other lives
[262.7s] and bring people to Christ now the true
[265.0s] revivals brought about emotional depths
[268.5s] and Hest Appeals
[270.8s] there were appeals as far as San
[272.8s] Francisco um we are told that this um
[275.9s] there were Prof the appeals were of
[277.7s] profound emotional weight at a Revival
[280.3s] for example in San
[283.0s] Francisco um sister white describes the
[286.1s] love and sacrifice of Christ so vividly
[289.1s] that many attendees were moved to
[292.4s] tears one young man known for his
[294.8s] rebellious Spirit stood up during the
[296.6s] call for commitment and confessed I
[299.2s] canot longer resist the voice of God
[302.2s] this powerful moment inspired others to
[304.7s] step forward and publicly Embrace their
[307.4s] faith and this went across different
[310.7s] cities and different towns people were
[312.4s] confessing people were testifying and
[314.7s] people were being converted there were
[316.9s] several Community engagements which had
[320.1s] sure outcomes and these sure outcomes
[322.3s] were indeed um uh triumphs and victories
[326.4s] over challenges uh that people had had
[329.3s] had
[330.4s] previously
[332.7s] um goes further to mention um you know
[336.6s] about global rich and how consistent it
[339.2s] was and maybe up to this point so that
[342.6s] maybe for brother Nik and uh and uh
[345.4s] brother opata so that it's not it's not
[347.6s] a monologue it seem it beginning to seem
[350.7s] like a monologue what what would maybe
[353.1s] we pick it from testimony what do you
[355.4s] think um you know we usually we see the
[359.0s] preacher after every sermon they make an
[361.6s] appeal and people come for conversion
[364.4s] but how would you tie these appeals um
[367.7s] and especially after true conversion and
[370.0s] and transformation reformation and
[372.0s] transformation how would you tie this to
[376.0s] testimonies going forward because after
[378.3s] you've received this how would you tie
[380.0s] this to testimonies maybe touching on
[382.6s] how um sister white and and and our
[386.3s] previous uh founders of of this faith
[390.1s] um testified and appeals and appealed um
[393.2s] to our brothers
[395.0s] previously yeah I'd say many appeals are
[398.7s] made but sometimes you don't get the
[400.8s] testimonies because the spirit of God
[403.6s] that moves you to go
[405.4s] forward moves you because there's
[407.6s] something of an experience which you
[409.4s] have had many times I've seen that
[412.2s] people have an experience with God and
[415.0s] the circumstances that lead to them
[417.1s] coming to church at that specific moment
[420.0s] are so amazing sometimes they even say
[422.3s] they didn't know they' to be here and
[424.4s] sometimes I've had people say that
[426.0s] someone was for me you know people are
[428.2s] saying that because that day the
[430.7s] preacher spoke to something that was
[432.5s] going on in their life and you might
[434.6s] even find that the preacher changed
[436.0s] their seron not because they knew why
[439.0s] but because of the people who had been
[440.5s] there in fact Ellen White mentions it in
[442.5s] this chapter that she had to change her
[445.4s] title of her word one time then she was
[447.8s] speaking because God was telling telling
[449.8s] her this is what we need to uh she
[453.0s] wanted to speak on a certain subject but
[455.0s] it's like it was everything she was
[456.5s] planning for was taken away from her
[458.7s] mind so now she had to preach what God
[461.4s] wanted and after that people came and
[463.4s] said we testify that God fully has
[466.5s] spoken to us amen so I believe
[468.8s] testimonies should be tied to the
[471.2s] appeals that we get cuz many times
[474.0s] people might come forward and you might
[475.8s] not even know why they came forward and
[478.2s] them testifying will show the work of
[480.2s] God and encourage the Fai amen you want
[483.4s] to chime in yeah yes just just just a
[486.4s] little uh I think testimonies are very
[489.8s] powerful very powerful because this is
[492.5s] firstand
[493.8s] experience narration of the person who
[497.0s] has
[498.8s] experienced an encounter with Jesus
[501.1s] Christ a good example is the the woman
[504.6s] at the well
[506.0s] mhm you're seeing that uh because Christ
[509.2s] just told
[510.8s] her how the truth about her life it was
[515.2s] so moving that that message only she
[518.4s] carried it you know this lady has not
[520.2s] had the about maybe the Ten Commandments
[523.2s] she has not been taken through the
[525.6s] church manual doctrines and teachings
[529.9s] but just that experience that encounter
[532.2s] with Christ was enough for her to go and
[535.2s] preach to the whole city and clowds were
[538.9s] drawn to Jesus Christ so we are seeing
[541.6s] that uh there are some things that
[544.2s] Christ has done personally to your life
[546.8s] that you don't need to keep quiet with
[548.8s] them you don't need you need to share
[550.6s] with them to with your brethren and a
[553.6s] good example is when I come and tell you
[556.0s] that uh I have heard I have heard I have
[558.8s] heard it's not as powerful as when I sit
[562.0s] down with you and tell you my brother
[564.6s] this is what the Lord Has Done
[566.2s] experienced to me so testimonies are
[568.8s] very powerful and we encourage all our
[571.0s] listeners and our viewers that if
[573.3s] there's anything that God has done to
[575.6s] youly share with your brethren because
[578.7s] it's a fuel given to increase their
[582.0s] faith and their trust to Jesus Christ
[584.7s] amen amen amen thank you very much opata
[587.7s] thank you very much brother niik I would
[589.7s] like to quickly read something before I
[592.3s] hand it back to brother Niko in these
[594.4s] closing moments of art sinful history
[597.8s] surely God's spirit is ready to give us
[600.2s] the power to finish our work for others
[603.3s] and the work necessary for ourselves can
[606.3s] it be that you and I will be the one
[609.8s] through whom God will do something
[611.6s] special who knows may this book help you
[616.9s] to experience the Revival and
[619.0s] Reformation that will prepare you for
[620.7s] the latter rain and the soon return of
[623.7s] our Lord Jesus Christ brother n thank
[627.6s] you very much
[629.8s] over the past 10 weeks we've shown you
[632.9s] how the call for Revival comes how you
[635.9s] get converted as a Christian and to show
[639.0s] whether your conversion is genuine or
[641.6s] fake and you've also shown through the
[644.0s] book how you can be born again but we
[647.0s] also learn that God has rules too and as
[649.7s] we follow these rules we need to have a
[651.5s] balance between right and wrong and
[654.1s] faith and works to actually understand
[657.1s] what is it that God is expecting of us
[659.9s] sorry I said balance between right and
[661.7s] wrong there's no balance you should only
[663.9s] have right yeah the balance is between
[666.2s] faith and what then we should be saved
[669.0s] only in Christ but even as you saved be
[672.5s] aware there are some saving graes that
[675.8s] are not real they're fake so it's
[678.6s] something that you need to be cognizant
[680.2s] of and while we are at it remember
[683.1s] you're in a battle with the devil so you
[686.2s] have to do your best to save God this
[688.9s] new experience and as God has done this
[692.0s] for you you can testify to other people
[694.8s] and tell them this has been my
[697.1s] experience and as you testify you can
[700.0s] call others to have a similar experience
[702.7s] to you by making heart stirring appeals
[705.7s] that bring people to the faith we pray
[709.2s] that you've enjoyed the series on the
[711.2s] book true Revival and it's our prayer
