we'll be doing chapter 4 which is titled God has rules too I know you probably have rules in your workplace you have rules for your children in school and even there school rules for those who are students but did you know that God has rules too so last week week we covered how to be a born again Christian and this week we look at God's rules if you're joining us for the first time I'm the moderator and my name is Niko opio and on my right we have op hayanga uhuh on my left Steven M thank you and we'll be taking you through a review of chapter 4 of the book true Revival as a reminder you can use the link on the screen to get a copy of the book and if you have an ABC book place close to where you are you can also get a book like this remember we said as we began this series the church's greatest need and most urgent need is true Revival and this is only obtained through prayer and an infilling of the holy spirit so even as we cover the chapter on God's rules like to invite us to have a word of prayer and I'd like to invite op to go ahead and pray and please just give us a summary of what this actually talks about which are this rules that God has thank you thank you let's pray Our Father what in heaven we thank you as we delve into this review of the book true Revival we just want to bring our minds further together and find out uh What uh what are this unique thing about the rules of God we invite your holy presence to teach us and to guide us in Jesus mighty name we pray and believe amen uh when we talk about God has rules too uh just the way my brother ni has put it we have rules in our homes at our places of work in school everywhere we have rules even in churches even this those same churches that profess that they claim that the the law of God was done away with they have laws in those churches and these laws now we we're just wondering that which which one is supreme this is it the laws of the church or God's law and there's something they talking about here that is called our unique responsibility about uh uh God's rules and we have been asked here as a supreme ruler god of the universe God has ordained laws for the governments not only for the for all living beings but for of all the operations of Nature and here we are seeing that uh while everything has rules there's something unique about man there's some moral laws that man is bound with and because the reason why is because to man alone the crowning work of his creation God has given a conscious to realize the sacred claims of the Divine Law not animals not items that exist out there but only man that's makes that makes the that makes it very unique uh uh for for us as human beings and it says that uh a heart capable of loving it as holy just and good and of man prompt and perfect obedience is required yet God does not compel him to obey he is left a free moral agent that's very unique God is giving us laws to follow but does not compel you to obey those same laws as parent I don't even remember a single day where I've told my my daughter that uh these are the rules but you are at Liberty whether to obey or not to obey it's very unique this is very unique but here you saying that God has given us that obligation to choose and it's uh it's uh it's very fundamental in our in our in our in our Christian Journey so there are some question that uh you have been asked year that I want to involve my my brothers and one of them is uh obedience there obedience bring you happiness yeah I'd say it depends on what you want to do um I'd give an example of some of the laws we may have even in our government for example there are things that you're required to do but sometimes it does not bring you happiness and this is because it goes against what you want to do for example it is a law for us to pay taxes I can imagine how hard we've been working in our country our tax burden was recently increased to a very high level and as an obligation of obedience to the laws of the land I'm very happy to obey the law of the land but when you're increasing the taxes it becomes really painful on the pocket so that obedience is it's done out of obligation and not happiness in fact if it were possible you I'd do away with it to be honest but because we know this is how the country runs it's the law of the land some of the leaders elected have the ones who have chosen this you obeyed yeah but on the other hand I think obedience to God brings happiness I'm trying to imagine if any of us were told to come up with some laws to govern the land I don't know how many you make maybe 100 200 that be very biased yeah 400 yeah and you'd put laws that favor you and I just think about God that he had all the time he had all the opportunity and instead of writing to us a document in Constitution with thousands and thousands of pages he wrote laws simple enough for us to memorize and recite and laws simple enough for us to follow without feeling the burden of it if you're looking to find laws on says he didn't even tithe is not put as a law imagine that so I'm just trying to think that God's laws make obedience a happy thing it's not as hard as it some people purport it to be and it's also simple that can be understood by anyone for example if I just say thou shalt not kill not complex just a couple of words five or six words and you're done and it's one law covering very many things so I believe God's law brings happiness to me simple enough amen amen to the point it says here a man may be a transgressor and yet conceal his misdeeds from human eyes he may be a criminal a thief a murderer but so long as he is not discovered the law cannot condemn him as guilty even as as we sit here we cannot say we are rashers yeah there are some C things that we have done Even in our private lives that have not been discovered by our neighbors but here we are seeing that the Lord does not condemn us but we seeing the Rous law of God goes further because God says that uh I'm not like man who judges the outside I see what you do even in your even in your thought because here we are seeing that now what brother Nick has even bring about that it goes further even your thoughts are subjected to God's laws makes it very unique here we are not you not come here and say oh no I didn't do that prove that I do that but here we are seeing that God who judges even our most hidden agenda in our hearts God is able to to to to cover that so beyond thou shal not and are being told that we are living in an age of great wickedness multitudes slave what what is the power of the law that is so unique to us as human beings brother Steve I know you I've seen you have something you want to add on but um I I I agree I mean God did not just give us the laws for us to be slothful about them we we are not to be lazy we need to look at the laws beyond the 10 beyond the what sister white calls um th shall Nots and and um both my brothers brother Niko has outlined you know that you know if we were given a chance to write the laws we would write as many and also we would be biased um and brother opata has also mentioned uh you know the the a bit of some of the down uh down shal notes you know we the Commandments are clearly outlined and clearly stipulated but is that it what we perhaps need to question ourselves is if I've obeyed the law I've observed the Sabbath the seventh day I've not killed I've not stolen is that enough is that what I'm being called to as a Christian or as a God-fearing Christian so to speak does it mean that we omit other aspects of doing good to the community does it mean that we meet um or or or what we do you know it brings me to an example for example um at our workplaces you know at our workplaces There Are Rules too we have rules um and it's brother op who mentioned rules at at at home at our workplaces we have rules too and and these rules are subjected to review after every quarter or every you know half yearly or or annual review and this review you they're based on performance and the question is that yes you um you had Integrity yes you maintained Good Conduct but if you are only doing bare minimum you know you you have your set targets but you're doing bare minimum you know at the end of the review you're not going to say but you know um you're not going to tell your supervisor but I did not steal I did not abuse anyone I came to work every morning U 8 and left at at at 5 your review will be subjected to more than that MH so it is with the Commandments we are called upon sister white tells us that God has given us powers to exercise uh powers to be exercised in Good Works remember brother niik mentioned good works okay that if these powers and we are also cautioned that if these powers are not put in use which means if we do not exercise good works we shall certainly be laid down we shall certainly be set down as wicked and lazy or slothful if you may and then that what does that mean simply mean we will not attain Perfection at the end of the world so it does not necessarily mean that once you observe the Ten Commandments that that's it there's nothing after that it goes beyond that so we may not have committed Grievous sins mhm uh such offenses may not stand registered against us in the book of God but the fact remains that our Deeds if our Deeds are not recorded as pure good elevated and Noble showing that we have improved on our entrusted talents then will not be counted among the counted that's that's what I wanted to add amen thank you thank you very much uh the Bible says from The Book of Psalms chapter 19 ver7 mhm the law of the Lord is perfect and then I'm trying to imagine uh when did God change his mind to an extent now he wants to do away with the law if it's perfect and remember these laws it's very clear that these laws were there even before the creation because God knows the beginning from the end the end from the beginning and he made the laws perfect so at no single point should anyone claim that the laws of God have been done away with and we are saying that it's human nature that uh you always want to HTE the law but because of the sanctity of Christ and the power of the Holy Spirit it makes us obey in happiness because you see when you are in obedience with the law even when you're driving and you have not broken any traffic rules you see you see a traffic police as a friend not as an enemy so this is something that uh it's called for us that uh even as the wickedness increases on Earth the same same people who say the laws were done away with they come and stand on the pulpit and say again the wickedness in this earth is overwhelming so they speaking from both ends of their mouth so here we are being told that the laws not even a single J will pass yes so I just want to bring it back to our brother Nick to bring it to a summary thank you yes thank you very much brother opata for that wonderfully elaborated and explained summary of this God has rules too and it's important for us to obey these rules that he has Psalm 119:165 say 165 says that great peace have they which love thy law and nothing shall offend them amen which actually means following God's law brings peace to us which means we should follow the law if we want to be happy amen and when we go beyond the Thou shalt not we actually understand that God is saying I am looking at your works because this law is the same one you'll be governed within Heaven the law that was given on Earth was just adopted for human beings but it's the same one that Angels Fall which means when we go to heaven we'll still have the same law so God has rules too and they're just not for Earthly beings it's for Heavenly beings as amen amen like us to Bow our heads for a word of prayers we close gracious God thank you for leading Us in discussion thank you for showing us your roots and thank you for showing us that we'll be happy when we follow them please guide us even as we continue reading this book and bless us even as you will for we ask in Jesus name amen so next week we'll be covering the chapter chapter 5 the balance in faith and works and we'd like you to join us for this to actually understand how do I become Saved By Faith but also what does it mean when I have to have Works accompanying this and we'll understand the balance between these two see you next week and please get a copy of this book if you haven't gotten one yet see you bye next time bye-bye

TIMESTAMPED TRANSCRIPT:
[0.7s] greetings to you from wherever you're
[2.3s] watching from it may be afternoon
[4.0s] morning noon or evening and we're glad
[8.1s] that you've joined us again for another
[10.0s] episode in the review of the book true
[12.8s] Revival we'll be doing chapter 4 which
[15.2s] is titled God has rules too I know you
[19.5s] probably have rules in your workplace
[21.2s] you have rules for your children in
[22.7s] school and even there school rules for
[24.7s] those who are students but did you know
[26.8s] that God has rules too so last week week
[30.2s] we covered how to be a born again
[31.8s] Christian and this week we look at God's
[34.7s] rules if you're joining us for the first
[37.0s] time I'm the moderator and my name is
[39.5s] Niko opio and on my right we have op
[43.2s] hayanga uhuh on my left Steven M thank
[46.8s] you and we'll be taking you through a
[48.4s] review of chapter 4 of the book true
[50.4s] Revival as a reminder you can use the
[52.5s] link on the screen to get a copy of the
[54.8s] book and if you have an ABC book place
[57.2s] close to where you are you can also get
[59.5s] a book like this remember we said as we
[62.3s] began this series the church's greatest
[65.2s] need and most urgent need is true
[68.0s] Revival and this is only obtained
[70.2s] through prayer and an infilling of the
[72.8s] holy spirit so even as we cover the
[75.4s] chapter on God's rules like to invite us
[79.2s] to have a word of prayer and I'd like to
[81.5s] invite op to go ahead and pray and
[84.3s] please just give us a summary of what
[86.6s] this actually talks about which are this
[88.9s] rules that God has thank you thank you
[91.5s] let's pray Our Father what in heaven we
[94.1s] thank you as we delve into this review
[98.8s] of the book true Revival we just want to
[102.2s] bring our minds further together and
[104.0s] find out uh What uh what are this unique
[106.6s] thing about the rules of God we invite
[109.9s] your holy presence to teach us and to
[112.3s] guide us in Jesus mighty name we pray
[114.4s] and believe
[118.1s] amen uh when we talk about God has rules
[120.9s] too uh just the way my brother ni has
[123.4s] put it we have rules in our homes at our
[127.7s] places of work in school everywhere we
[131.1s] have rules even in churches even this
[133.9s] those same churches that profess that
[135.9s] they claim that the the law of God was
[138.7s] done away with they have laws in those
[142.1s] churches and these laws now we we're
[144.6s] just wondering that which which one is
[146.1s] supreme this is it the laws of the
[148.6s] church or God's law
[150.7s] and there's something they talking about
[153.0s] here that is called our unique
[154.7s] responsibility about uh uh God's rules
[160.2s] and we have been asked here as a supreme
[162.4s] ruler god of the universe God has
[164.5s] ordained laws for the governments not
[166.4s] only for the for all living beings but
[169.8s] for of all the operations of
[172.2s] Nature and here we are seeing that
[176.8s] uh while everything has rules there's
[179.3s] something unique about man there's some
[182.4s] moral laws that man is bound with and
[185.8s] because the reason why is because to man
[188.4s] alone the crowning work of his creation
[190.6s] God has given a conscious to realize the
[193.5s] sacred claims of the Divine Law not
[196.1s] animals not items that exist out there
[200.0s] but only man that's makes that makes the
[203.9s] that makes it very unique uh uh for for
[207.1s] us as human beings and it says that uh
[210.8s] a heart capable of
[213.1s] loving it as holy just and good and of
[218.0s] man prompt and perfect obedience is
[221.7s] required yet God does not compel him to
[225.0s] obey he is left a free moral agent
[228.5s] that's very unique God is giving us
[232.0s] laws to follow but does not compel you
[236.4s] to obey those same
[238.5s] laws as
[240.3s] parent I don't even remember a single
[242.6s] day where I've told my my daughter that
[244.9s] uh these are the rules but you are at
[249.0s] Liberty whether to obey or not to obey
[251.9s] it's very unique this is very unique but
[254.6s] here you saying that God has given us
[256.4s] that obligation to
[259.2s] choose and it's uh it's uh it's very
[262.1s] fundamental in our in our in our in our
[265.1s] Christian
[266.0s] Journey so there are some question that
[268.9s] uh you have been asked year that I want
[271.6s] to involve my my brothers and one of
[275.0s] them is uh
[277.3s] obedience there obedience bring you
[282.3s] happiness yeah I'd say it depends on
[285.8s] what you want to do
[289.0s] um I'd give an example of some of the
[292.9s] laws we may have even in our government
[295.9s] for example there are things that you're
[298.2s] required to do but sometimes it does not
[301.6s] bring you happiness and this is because
[304.0s] it goes against what you want to do for
[306.6s] example it is a law for us to pay taxes
[309.5s] I can imagine how hard we've been
[311.2s] working in our country our tax burden
[313.4s] was recently increased to a very high
[315.9s] level and as an obligation of obedience
[318.8s] to the laws of the land I'm very happy
[322.1s] to obey the law of the land but when
[324.5s] you're increasing the taxes it becomes
[326.6s] really painful on the pocket so that
[329.1s] obedience
[330.4s] is it's done out of obligation and not
[333.3s] happiness in fact if it were possible
[335.6s] you I'd do away with it to be honest but
[338.4s] because we know this is how the country
[340.1s] runs it's the law of the land some of
[342.6s] the leaders elected have the ones who
[344.2s] have chosen this you obeyed yeah but on
[347.6s] the other hand I think obedience to God
[350.3s] brings happiness I'm trying to imagine
[352.7s] if any of us were told to come up with
[355.6s] some laws to govern the land I don't
[358.9s] know how many you make maybe 100 200
[361.9s] that be very biased yeah 400 yeah and
[364.4s] you'd put laws that favor you and I just
[367.4s] think about God that he had all the time
[370.1s] he had all the opportunity and instead
[372.6s] of writing to us a document in
[374.6s] Constitution with thousands and
[376.3s] thousands of pages he wrote laws simple
[380.0s] enough for us to memorize and recite and
[383.4s] laws simple enough for us to follow
[386.0s] without feeling the burden of it if
[388.1s] you're looking to find laws on says he
[390.1s] didn't even tithe is not put as a law
[393.3s] imagine that so I'm just trying to think
[396.0s] that God's laws make obedience a happy
[400.0s] thing it's not as hard as it some people
[404.3s] purport it to be and it's also simple
[406.8s] that can be understood by anyone for
[409.2s] example if I just say thou shalt not
[412.4s] kill not complex just a couple of words
[416.0s] five or six words and you're done and
[418.4s] it's one law covering very many things
[421.3s] so I believe God's law brings happiness
[423.8s] to me simple enough amen amen to the
[426.8s] point it says here a man may be a
[430.2s] transgressor and yet conceal his
[432.3s] misdeeds from human eyes he may be a
[435.2s] criminal a thief a
[437.2s] murderer but so long as he is not
[440.2s] discovered the law cannot condemn him as
[443.5s] guilty even as as we sit here we cannot
[447.1s] say we are rashers yeah there are some C
[449.7s] things that we have done Even in our
[451.5s] private lives that have not been
[453.1s] discovered by our
[455.2s] neighbors but here we are seeing that
[457.4s] the Lord does not condemn us but we
[459.4s] seeing the Rous law of God goes further
[463.1s] because God says that uh I'm not like
[465.3s] man who judges the
[468.0s] outside I see what you do even in your
[471.3s] even in your thought because here we are
[472.7s] seeing that now what brother Nick has
[474.8s] even bring about that it goes further
[478.4s] even your thoughts are subjected to
[480.6s] God's laws makes it very unique here we
[484.1s] are not you not come here and say oh no
[486.9s] I didn't do that prove that I do that
[489.8s] but here we are seeing that God who
[491.3s] judges even our
[493.8s] most hidden agenda in our hearts God is
[497.7s] able to to to to cover that so beyond
[502.2s] thou shal not and are being told that we
[505.2s] are living in an age of great wickedness
[507.6s] multitudes slave what what is the power
[510.2s] of the law that is so unique to us as
[514.2s] human beings brother Steve I know you
[517.6s] I've seen you have something you want to
[519.1s] add on but
[521.5s] um I I I agree I mean God did not just
[526.0s] give us the laws for us to be slothful
[529.4s] about them we we are not to be lazy we
[531.9s] need to look at the laws
[533.7s] beyond the 10 beyond the what sister
[537.7s] white calls um th shall Nots and and um
[542.2s] both my brothers brother Niko has
[543.9s] outlined you know that you know if we
[547.0s] were given a chance to write the laws we
[550.6s] would write as many and also we would be
[554.0s] biased um and brother opata has also
[556.6s] mentioned uh you know the the a bit of
[559.3s] some of the down uh down shal notes you
[562.1s] know we the Commandments are clearly
[565.0s] outlined and clearly
[566.7s] stipulated but is that it
[570.3s] what we perhaps need to question
[572.0s] ourselves is if I've obeyed the law I've
[576.1s] observed the Sabbath the seventh day
[578.8s] I've not killed I've not stolen is that
[582.9s] enough is that what I'm being called to
[586.3s] as a Christian or as a
[588.7s] God-fearing Christian so to speak does
[592.2s] it mean that we omit other aspects of
[595.0s] doing good to the
[597.3s] community does it mean that we meet um
[600.8s] or or or what we do you know it brings
[603.5s] me to an example for example um at our
[607.6s] workplaces you know at our workplaces
[609.8s] There Are Rules too we have rules um and
[612.3s] it's brother op who mentioned rules at
[614.6s] at at home at our workplaces we have
[617.1s] rules too and and these rules are
[620.7s] subjected to review after every quarter
[624.4s] or every you know half yearly or or
[627.0s] annual review and this review you
[629.7s] they're based on
[630.9s] performance and the question is that yes
[635.5s] you um you had Integrity yes you
[639.0s] maintained Good Conduct but if you are
[642.4s] only doing bare minimum you know you you
[645.8s] have your set targets but you're doing
[648.3s] bare minimum you know at the end of the
[650.3s] review you're not going to say but you
[652.2s] know um you're not going to tell your
[653.9s] supervisor but I did not steal I did not
[656.5s] abuse anyone I came to work every
[658.2s] morning U 8 and left at at at
[661.8s] 5 your review will be subjected to more
[664.6s] than that MH so it is with the
[667.8s] Commandments we are called upon sister
[670.0s] white tells us that God has given us
[672.2s] powers to exercise uh powers to be
[675.5s] exercised in Good Works remember brother
[678.5s] niik mentioned good works okay that if
[681.5s] these powers and we are also cautioned
[683.5s] that if these powers are not put in use
[685.7s] which means if we do not exercise good
[687.9s] works we shall certainly be laid down we
[691.0s] shall certainly be set down as wicked
[693.6s] and lazy or slothful if you may and then
[697.4s] that what does that mean simply mean we
[699.4s] will not attain Perfection at the end of
[701.9s] the world so it does not necessarily
[703.9s] mean that once you observe the Ten
[706.3s] Commandments that that's it there's
[708.3s] nothing after that it goes beyond that
[711.4s] so we may not have committed Grievous
[713.0s] sins mhm uh such offenses may not stand
[716.6s] registered against us in the book of God
[719.0s] but the fact remains that our Deeds if
[722.4s] our Deeds are not recorded as pure good
[724.5s] elevated and Noble showing that we have
[728.0s] improved on our entrusted talents then
[731.4s] will not be counted among the counted
[735.0s] that's that's what I wanted to add amen
[737.2s] thank you thank you very much uh the
[740.3s] Bible says from The Book of Psalms
[742.4s] chapter 19 ver7 mhm the law of the Lord
[746.2s] is
[747.7s] perfect and then I'm trying to imagine
[750.2s] uh when did God change his
[753.0s] mind to an extent now he wants to do
[755.7s] away with the
[757.2s] law if it's perfect and remember these
[760.4s] laws it's very clear that these laws
[763.6s] were there even before the
[767.0s] creation because God knows the beginning
[770.2s] from the end the end from the beginning
[773.3s] and he made the laws perfect so at no
[775.9s] single point should anyone claim that
[778.6s] the laws of God have been done away with
[783.0s] and we are saying that it's human nature
[785.8s] that uh you always want to HTE the law
[789.4s] but because of the sanctity of Christ
[792.6s] and the power of the Holy Spirit it
[794.3s] makes us obey in happiness because you
[797.4s] see when you are in obedience with the
[799.3s] law even when you're driving and you
[800.6s] have not broken any traffic rules you
[803.6s] see you see a traffic police as a friend
[806.2s] not as an enemy so this is something
[808.8s] that uh it's called for us that uh even
[811.4s] as the wickedness increases on Earth the
[814.0s] same same people who say the laws were
[815.9s] done away with they come and stand on
[818.4s] the pulpit and say again the wickedness
[821.4s] in this earth is overwhelming so they
[824.4s] speaking from both ends of their mouth
[826.7s] so here we are being told that the laws
[829.7s] not even a single J will pass yes so I
[832.9s] just want to bring it back to our
[836.1s] brother Nick to bring it to a summary
[838.8s] thank you
[840.0s] yes thank you very much brother opata
[841.9s] for that wonderfully elaborated and
[845.1s] explained summary of this God has rules
[848.9s] too and it's important for us to obey
[851.8s] these rules that he has Psalm
[854.9s] 119:165 say 165 says that great peace
[858.9s] have they which love thy law and nothing
[862.1s] shall offend them amen which actually
[865.5s] means following God's law brings peace
[869.2s] to us which means we should follow the
[871.8s] law if we want to be happy amen and when
[875.0s] we go beyond the Thou shalt not we
[877.2s] actually understand that God is saying I
[881.1s] am looking at your works because this
[884.7s] law is the same one you'll be governed
[886.4s] within Heaven the law that was given on
[889.1s] Earth was just adopted for human beings
[891.9s] but it's the same one that Angels Fall
[894.4s] which means when we go to heaven we'll
[895.9s] still have the same law so God has rules
[899.2s] too and they're just not for Earthly
[901.1s] beings it's for Heavenly beings as amen
[903.8s] amen like us to Bow our heads for a word
[905.6s] of prayers we
