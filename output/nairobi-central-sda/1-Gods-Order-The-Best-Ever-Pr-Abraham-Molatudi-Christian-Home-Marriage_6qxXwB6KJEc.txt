FULL TRANSCRIPT:
let me take this time and greet you all in the wonderful name of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ amen it is a it is a pleasure for me and my wife to be here and we really take this uh opportunity uh as a privilege that we don't take for granted we cherish it very deeply that we can come all all the way from South Africa to come and minister to you it is indeed a a blessing and I need to express my word of gratitude to the pastors of this church the the elders and particularly the Elder for for for for for family life uh for inviting us and uh I see our friend from Uganda is here Ruth kisito who actually made it possible for for for for that's that's Ruth over there made it possible for us to be here H I'm told that when the Elder contacted her to find out who he can invite for this week of prayer she then recommended us now she knows us from Uganda I've been to ug Uganda several times to go and preach there and I think she knows me from there thank you for for for for for the opportunity we are talking family life this week family life is my passion it's what I do in South Africa it's what I'm known for in South Africa I've been involved in family life for more than two decades and I really enjoy it it's a subject that is deep in my heart and the reason why I cherish it so much it is because family is important and I usually tell the congregations and the audiences that I preach to uh about family life I say if you fail in family you fail where it matters the most you can succeed in your career you can succeed in your profession you can succeed in your business you can succeed everywhere but if you fail in family we have failed where it matters the most and so it is important that we build successful families I want to draw your attention to two passages of scripture scripture and the first passage will be Genesis chapter 2 Genesis chapter 2 and I will read two verses there Genesis chapter 2 and I will read two verses there 24 and 25 this is how it reads therefore a man shall leave his wife and his mother and hold fast to his wife other versions will say and cleave to his wife and they shall become one flesh the man and his wife were both naked and were not ashamed and second passage I want to draw your attention to is Genesis chap 1 and I read veres 27- 28 the word of God there says so God created man in his own image the image of God he created him male and female he created them and God blessed them and God said to them be fruitful and multiply and fill the Earth and subdue it and have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the birds of the heavens and over every living thing that moves on the earth may the good Lord add a blessing to the reading of his word in Jesus name let everybody say Amen your heads are bowed and your eyes are closed our God and our father into your hands I commit myself this morning in Jesus name amen there's a there's a quotation in education page 8 the quotation says higher than the highest human thought can reach is God's ideal for his children godliness and godlikeness is the goal to be reached written by Ellen White higher than the highest human thought can reach it's God God's ideal for his children when we talk about family we talk about ideal when we preach about family we preach about an ideal family when we teach about family we teach about an ideal family I say to people usually I know that we living in less than ideal situation we live in a world that is pled by sin a world that has been decimated by evil and because of that we don't have ideal situation in everything we don't have ideal Health we don't have ideal education we don't have ideal anything we don't even have ideal family but when we preach when we teach we must teach God's ideal we need to call God's people to God's ideal I often say when we preach we know my pastor that we are weak we are sinful but we don't stand up to say well we understand that we are sinful and we live in a sinful world so when you drink drink wisely when you Sin Sin wisely We Don't Preach that when we preach we say stop sinning do not drink don't commit adulter we preach an ideal and when we preach about family we need to talk about God's ideal family now God's ideal family it's God's order and God's order is the best order we may have our own things that we want to do as far as family is concerned but I'm here to share with you that God's order is always the best order so God's order is like this when it comes to family and it's very simple I've realized that most important things in life are very simple things and sometimes we complicate simple things simple things are powerful things and God has made this thing so easy so an ideal family God's order for family is constituted by a father a mother and children that's God's ideal family a man a woman brought together in holy matrimony and then having children that's God's order simple no astrophysics required for that so there are four things that I want us to look at when we talk about God's order we want to talk about father and mother in marriage want to talk about God bringing two similar people together and then we want to talk about God's design for intimacy in marriage and then children born in wedlock so so so God's ideal family God's order is that marriage must OCC between man and woman I know probably here in Kenya you might take it for granted but in South Africa we need to emphasize that because you can't take that marriage is between man and husband and a woman for granted so it needs to be emphasized that marriage is between a man and a woman marriage is not between a man and a man marriage is not between a woman and a woman and a marriage is not between a human being and an animal marriage is not between an adult and a minor now this are fundamental principles for marriage now some people say well what about if we love one another we are a man and a man and a woman and a woman and we love one another what should stop us from getting married now I'm here to tell you that let me tell you something we don't just get married because we love one another we get married because we obeying God marriage is God's institution It's Not a Human Institution it's a Divine institution and if we are going to get into that institution we need to get into that institution according to God's terms not our own terms and God's terms a marriage is between a man and a woman not a man and a man or a woman and a woman now now now no now the reason this is the case it is because you have read we have read here that God says speaking to himself the godhead he said let us create man in our image let's create man in our image now when you go to Genesis chapter 5 and you read verse two you realize that God's image in man is man and woman for the Bible says God created male and female and he constituted them His Image he called them men so so so when God says let's create man in our image God had in mind a male and a female who will come together and when they come together in holy matrimony they constitute God's image so so so so getting married now for those of you who are not married let me encourage you getting married is enhancing God's image in you I not saying you're not God's image if you are not married all I'm saying is that if you get married you become more of God's image it's in the word I'm not creating it it's in the word so only a man and a woman constitute the image of God only man and a woman can create that inestable Union so when when the Bible says and a man and a woman cliffed together and and and they became one flesh only a man and a woman can do that a man and a man cannot do that they cannot CLE together they cannot become one flesh only a man and a woman can become one flesh and so it is important for the world to hear particularly from us as Adventists they need to hear that marriage is between a man and a woman because only in that Union can men and woman become one flesh only a man and a woman can approximate the UN that you find in the godhead man and a man cannot do that a woman and a woman cannot do that that's not how God designed it to be only a man and a woman so when God said let us create man in our image now we believe in the Trinity as Adventist so we believe in God the Father God the son and God the Holy Spirit and these are three persons but one substance they are one and so when God said we need to create man in our image God was saying we need to create creatures that will resemble our Oneness while they are different persons but they can be one that's Divine mathematics 1 + 1 + 1 is 1 1 + 1 is one and only a woman and a man can do that only a man and a woman can exemplify God's creative power of procreation only a man and woman can do that so God said to Adam and Eve after creating them and after bringing them together as husband and wife then God said be fruitful and multiply and fill the Earth only a man and a woman can do that multiply and fill the Earth and I need to say that but when I talk about this passage I usually say to South Africans out there I said when God said be fruitful and multiply and fill the Earth he wasn't talking to you he was talking to Adam and Eve the Earth was empty now then the empty the Earth is full right now so he wasn't really talking to you so don't go out here and take it on as a personal project to try and fill the earth the earth is full but but but but only a man and a woman can come together and procreate and so and so and so we need to get to the basics if we are going to have a functional family its husband its wife it children and so the Bible says God God created Adam and then created Eve I'm going to talk about that during the week today by the way I'm laying the principles I'm going to unpack these principles throughout the week so I'm I'm laying the principles today so God created Adam and created Eve and after creating Adam and Eve brought them together now the first person that Adam saw after God created him was God the first person that Eve saw after God created here was God Adam saw God first Eve saw God first before they could see each other now that principle is very important it is very important because people that got married and they want to have a functional marriage and a a marriage that is in the order of God's design and ideal these people need to see God first before they see each other when you're a man you need to see God first when you are a woman you need to see God first before you see each other because you know when you see each other before you see God you'll be a danger to one another and that is why later on Paul says because you would have seen God and she would have seen God when you come together you are equally Yol so he advises in a negative way he says do not be unequally yolked with unbelievers so don't marry a person who's not of your own faith or who's not of your own spiritual persuasion do not be equally yolked with unbelievers now now no no most marriages and most families crumble and fall on the basis of the fact that there is an an an an an an an irreconcilable difference between the spiritual formation so the Bible says when you are going to come together and build a strong marriage you need to be of the same spiritual persuasion and faith we need to emphasize that because that is very important now let me explain this the Bible says do not be unequally yolked with unbelievers the Bible doesn't say do not be unequally yolked with Adventist with non-adventist I need to emphasize that amen somebody and I'll tell you why I'm saying that because sometimes we have a tendency of thinking as Adventists that when the Bible speaks about this it speaks about non-adventist and yet we don't realize that there are so many nonbelievers and unbelievers in the Adventist Church maybe not here in Kenya but definitely in South Africa maybe not here but in South Africa I often tell them it's not every Adventist that is a Believer so when the Bible says do not be equally an equally or rather unequally Yol with unbelievers it's speaking about certain people right here it's obvious of course you you don't want to be an Adventist and go get married to somebody else of another Faith you're going to create a problem for yourself but not all Adventists are marriage material they are unbelievers there are many unbelievers so there are certain brothers and sisters that you need to pray for at a distance I love you my brother but at a distance I love you my sister but at a distance amen somebody because because because I'll tell you if you are if you are married with somebody with whom you're are unequally Yol you're are creating a disaster for your marriage I am counseling a couple I met a couple just before I came here in South Africa and I was counseling them they're both Adventists but they come from different backgrounds one is Catholic one is born Adventist so when they met one was a Catholic one was an Adventist and so they came together and they got married and the lady then ultimately became an Adventist but now they're having differences and that differences is emphas the difference is emphasized by how they want to approach their problems and challenges and so I said to them I said you see here's the problem the problem is you've got a different Outlook to what your problems are so if we can Define what your problems are then we will agree on what the solution is but because they've got different Persuasions in how they think spiritually they don't think that they have the same problems the wife defines it this way the husband defines it that way and I said that's where the problem is now that marriage is on the verge of collapsing 10 years after they got married but I can tell you right now the foundation was weak right from the beginning so that marriage was doomed to end right at the beginning and I'm saying Paul says do not be unequally yolked with unbelievers because that marriage is bound to fail one way or the other and that's a simple principle I said the first principle is husband and wife don't confuse that the second principle is do not be unequally yoked with unbelievers so if you're going to if you love the Lord marry somebody who loves the Lord now now now this how I put it somebody in South Africa they would ask me well Pastor how do you know that somebody loves the Lord I I wouldn't know I'm not a prophet you see if I were a Prophet Elijah and or Prophet El Jeremiah I would be able to say Lord please reveal if this one loves the Lord or not I don't know I have no idea who loves the Lord and who doesn't love the Lord but I can tell you the Lord knows who loves him and who doesn't love him so all you have to do is commit your plans to the Lord and the Lord will guide you in the right direction so I say to young people who are not married I say give your heart to Jesus just give your heart to Jes don't give your heart to a boyfriend or a girlfriend don't give your heart to a man or a woman give your heart to Jesus because it is safe in the hands of Jesus and so when somebody else asks for your heart tell them I don't have a heart anymore if you want my heart go to Jesus because Jesus has my heart and Jesus will always give your heart to the right person but if you're going to give your heart yourself to somebody else might give it to a wrong person and you know people who are in love don't listen isn't it they say love is blind but I've realized that it is also death so when you when you when you tell people be careful don't give your heart to this one don't give your heart to that one don't don't and oh but Pastor you don't understand you know we we love each other we we love each other don't give your heart to this person give your heart to Jesus and then two months down the line three months down the line two years down the line three then they come to you oh Pastor pray for me what happened he broke my heart please pray for me and I'm tempted to always ask when they say he broke my heart what you your heart doing there in the first place because your heart should have been with Jesus what was your heart doing there in the first place so I'm here to tell you that if you're going to get married give your heart to Jesus first when somebody ask for that heart tell them that they must go to Jesus and only Jesus will know who should have your heart do not be unequally Yol with unbelievers you'll be praying to God and somebody will be praying to something else you'll be trusting God and somebody will be trusting something else so you want to to both of you trust God to pray to God and have the same way of thinking when it comes to approaching your problems and coming up with your own Solutions oh but there something else too God's ideal family God's ideal marriage God's standards God's ideal for his people it is that intimacy must only OCC in marriage now I said the first thing marriage is between husband and wife two you must be equally Yol three intimacy must only okay within marriage now it's not fashionable anymore in South Africa you might say here so I mean that is obvious it's not so obvious and there's a reason why God says intimacy must only OCC within marriage there's a reason and I'm going to unpack those reasons as we move on because sometimes intimacy outside of marriage will destroy the marriage even before it begin that is why God says it must be only within marriage the two shall come together the two shall come together and they shall become one flesh when after they have been blessed the Bible says brought them together and he blessed them and he said be fruitful and multiply after he blessed them them intimacy must occur after somebody has been blessed after the couple has been blessed not outside of those blessings and the fruitfulness and multiplication must occur after the blessings don't begin with being fruitful and then come later on for blessings it doesn't work like that and then people say oh but pastor pastor we we we we we love each other so why can't we be intimate if we love each other and my question is so everybody that you love you'll be intimate with them I mean if the reasoning is we love each other so everybody that you love you'll be intimate with them then there's a problem and then I often ask them very simple question if you say you love a person how do you love them with what do you love them now I often hear people say oh I love him with my heart isn't it I love him with my heart with all my heart and I ask a very simple question I say so where is the heart where is that heart that you love a person with now I don't have a degree in physiology and anatomy and I'm not a doctor but I can tell you there's no heart from from here downwards so if you love somebody with your heart if you love them with your heart the heart is here there's no heart from here down here but like I said I'm just establishing principles I'm going to unpack these principles as we move on sex outside of marriage is dangerous and that's why God says it must only OCC within the context of marriage higher than the highest human thought can reach is God's ideal for his children godliness and godlikeness is the goal to be reached and and and and and and and sex within marriage brings that Oneness that we read about it brings that Oneness and that is why that is why it is important and that is why Paul advises that when you are in marriage sex is just not Recreation sex is very important it's spiritual it's emotional it's me it's mental it's everything it's important and so he says when you are in that relationship that committed relationship do not don't deprive one another of sex don't do that because you're creating a problem you are creating Temptations for one another don't do it don't do that and don't use it as a bing chip don't weaponize sex in marriage it's holy it's beautiful but it must occur for the purpose of bringing you together into one flesh and it's not just physical it's not spiritual it's mental it's bringing two Souls together now in so saying I want us to disabuse ourselves particularly as men of the idea that sex is only physical because that's the problem with us men with think that this thing is just physical you can engage with it without engaging it without emotions without attachment without this without that and and we have been socialized and culturized into thinking that and that is a recipe for disaster and the two shall become one they shall become one in that intimacy the principle another principle that I want to just lay down for today which is the fourth principle is that children must be born in marriage that's God's order husband and wife get married of the same Faith get married that's God's order sex occurs within marriage that's God's order children must be born in wedlock that's God's order now children are a blessing and I often say children are it doesn't matter how they come about whether it's out of wedlock or in wedlock whether it's an accident or Not an Accident it doesn't matter but children are just the blessing from God and when they are here we don't question how they came about they are just a blessing and they bring us joy and that is why I often Say Never call children illegitimate there's no illegitimate child amen somebody what do we have sometimes are illegitimate parents that we do have where you have parents where you have H the man and a woman having children outside of marriage and most of the time when that happens one parent runs away leaves the other parent to take the responsibility for the children now let me tell you something let me tell you something which is very important children have a right to be brought into a family of man and woman father and mother a stable family children have a right to do that and when we give birth to children in the context of a stable home we are not doing them a favor they have the right to have a father they have a right to have a mother in a committed relationship of marriage Studies have shown that children who are born in in a stable ho they grow up to be stable where's a father and the mother they grow up to be stable mentally emotionally physically socially children who are born in a stable home are likely to succeed in life and to reach the potential children who are born in a stable home are like likely to have a relationship with God and that is why God put that order husband and wife get married doesn't matter how much you love each other get married get into a committed relationship I will unpack that during the week it's important to have that relationship it's important to be of the same faith it is important and by the same faith I don't mean I don't mean of the same denomination of course you need to narrate to a denomination that's very important however I'm saying even within that same denomination you need to be of the same Faith within the same denomination same faith then you can practice safe intimacy only within the context of that committed relationship outside of that it's a recipe for disaster recipe for disaster for you as a man and for you as a woman and for the children that will be born in that environment and lastly children have a right to be born in a stable family where there is a mother where there's a father and where there's marriage as I close God's order provides an enhancement of God's image in us we are created in God's image and Jesus is now recreating Us in His image and the family is a context within which God is doing that secondly God's order provides spiritual ual growth and development God's order for family that's where we develop our spirituality our morality our way of looking at life and that's where we prepare our characters for heaven God's order for family it's where we can practice safe intimacy and God's order for family is where we can provide a stable environment for our children may God bless you

TIMESTAMPED TRANSCRIPT:
[0.9s] let me take this time and greet you all
[4.4s] in the wonderful name of our Lord and
[6.4s] Savior Jesus Christ
[8.4s] amen it is a it is a pleasure for me and
[13.3s] my wife to be here and we really take
[17.6s] this uh
[21.0s] opportunity uh as a privilege that we
[24.4s] don't take for granted we cherish it
[27.3s] very deeply that we can come all all the
[30.2s] way from South Africa to come and
[31.9s] minister to you it is indeed a a
[36.2s] blessing and I need to express my word
[39.9s] of gratitude to the pastors of this
[44.0s] church the the
[46.8s] elders and particularly the Elder for
[51.6s] for for for for family life uh for
[55.0s] inviting us and uh I see our friend from
[59.1s] Uganda is here Ruth kisito who actually
[63.8s] made it possible for for for for that's
[67.8s] that's Ruth over there made it possible
[70.6s] for us to be here H I'm told that when
[75.8s] the Elder contacted her to find out who
[80.2s] he can invite for this week of prayer
[82.9s] she then recommended us now she knows us
[86.6s] from Uganda I've been to ug Uganda
[90.9s] several times to go and preach there and
[93.2s] I think she knows me from there thank
[95.0s] you for for for for for the
[97.9s] opportunity we are talking family life
[102.1s] this week family life is my passion it's
[107.4s] what I do in South Africa it's what I'm
[109.9s] known for in South Africa I've been
[112.9s] involved in family life for more than
[115.6s] two decades and I really enjoy it it's a
[120.3s] subject that is deep in my
[123.5s] heart and the reason why I cherish it so
[128.1s] much it is
[130.4s] because family is
[134.4s] important and I usually tell the
[137.2s] congregations and the audiences that I
[139.7s] preach
[141.0s] to uh about family life I say if you
[147.0s] fail in family you fail where it matters
[151.5s] the
[152.4s] most you can
[154.4s] succeed in your career you can succeed
[157.4s] in your profession you can succeed in
[159.6s] your business you can succeed
[162.4s] everywhere but if you
[165.1s] fail in family we have failed where it
[170.1s] matters the most and so it is important
[173.5s] that we build
[175.9s] successful families I want to draw your
[178.2s] attention to two passages of scripture
[180.8s] scripture and the first passage will be
[184.4s] Genesis chapter
[186.2s] 2 Genesis chapter
[190.7s] 2 and I will
[193.4s] read two verses
[198.3s] there Genesis chapter 2 and I will read
[201.0s] two verses
[202.3s] there 24 and
[205.0s] 25 this is how it reads therefore a man
[208.7s] shall leave his wife and his mother and
[212.9s] hold
[214.1s] fast to his wife other versions will say
[217.3s] and cleave to his wife and they shall
[222.1s] become one
[224.1s] flesh the man and his wife were both
[227.2s] naked and were not
[230.2s] ashamed and second passage I want to
[232.5s] draw your attention to is Genesis chap 1
[235.4s] and I read veres 27- 28
[240.4s] the word of God there says so God
[242.7s] created man in his own image the image
[246.8s] of God he created him male and female he
[250.7s] created
[252.2s] them and God blessed them and God said
[255.4s] to them be fruitful and multiply and
[257.9s] fill the Earth and subdue it and have
[262.0s] dominion over the fish of the sea and
[265.2s] over the birds of the heavens and over
[269.0s] every
[270.7s] living thing that moves on the earth may
[276.4s] the good Lord add a blessing to the
[279.0s] reading of his word in Jesus name let
[281.0s] everybody say Amen your heads are bowed
[284.0s] and your eyes are
[285.4s] closed our God and our father into your
[288.0s] hands I commit myself this morning in
[291.3s] Jesus name
[294.6s] amen there's
[297.9s] a there's a
[300.8s] quotation in education page
[305.8s] 8 the quotation says higher than the
[308.5s] highest human thought can
[310.3s] reach is God's ideal for his
[314.2s] children godliness and
[318.4s] godlikeness is the goal to be reached
[322.9s] written by Ellen
[324.6s] White higher than the highest human
[327.0s] thought can
[328.2s] reach it's God God's
[331.6s] ideal for his
[333.7s] children when we talk about
[336.8s] family we talk about ideal when we
[340.7s] preach about family we preach about an
[344.4s] ideal family when we teach about family
[347.5s] we teach about an ideal family I say to
[351.3s] people usually I know that we living in
[354.8s] less than ideal situation we live in a
[358.6s] world that is pled by sin a world that
[361.8s] has been decimated by evil and because
[365.4s] of that we don't have ideal situation in
[370.5s] everything we don't have ideal Health we
[373.1s] don't have ideal education we don't have
[376.3s] ideal anything we don't even have ideal
[380.8s] family but when we
[383.2s] preach when we teach we must teach God's
[388.4s] ideal we need to call God's people to
[393.4s] God's
[394.8s] ideal I often
[396.9s] say when we preach we know my pastor
[400.4s] that we are weak we are sinful but we
[403.2s] don't stand up to say well we understand
[407.0s] that we are sinful and we live in a
[408.8s] sinful world so when you drink drink
[412.7s] wisely when you Sin Sin wisely We Don't
[415.7s] Preach that when we preach we say stop
[418.8s] sinning do not drink don't commit
[420.9s] adulter we preach an ideal and when we
[424.6s] preach about family we need to talk
[428.8s] about God's ideal
[432.3s] family now God's ideal family it's God's
[438.0s] order and God's order is the best order
[444.2s] we may have our own things that we want
[446.6s] to do as far as family is concerned but
[448.7s] I'm here to share with you that God's
[452.0s] order is always the best
[456.0s] order so God's order is like this when
[458.8s] it comes to family and it's very simple
[461.8s] I've realized that most important things
[463.6s] in life are very simple things and
[466.5s] sometimes we
[468.4s] complicate simple things simple things
[471.4s] are powerful things and God has made
[474.1s] this thing so easy so an ideal family
[477.7s] God's order for family
[480.2s] is
[481.3s] constituted by a
[484.4s] father a
[486.3s] mother and
[488.4s] children that's God's ideal
[493.1s] family a
[496.4s] man a
[499.6s] woman brought together in holy matrimony
[503.9s] and then having children that's God's
[508.5s] order simple no astrophysics required
[512.8s] for
[514.8s] that so there are four things that I
[516.9s] want us to look at when we talk about
[519.0s] God's
[519.8s] order we want to talk about father and
[522.3s] mother in marriage want to talk
[526.0s] about God bringing two similar people
[532.2s] together and then we want to talk about
[535.5s] God's design for intimacy in marriage
[539.9s] and then children born in
[543.8s] wedlock so so so God's ideal family
[547.2s] God's order is that marriage must OCC
[551.5s] between man and
[555.2s] woman I know probably here in Kenya you
[558.1s] might take it for granted but in South
[559.9s] Africa we need to emphasize that because
[561.8s] you can't take that marriage is between
[564.2s] man and husband and a woman for
[568.1s] granted so
[570.0s] it needs to be
[571.5s] emphasized that marriage is between a
[574.5s] man and a
[576.4s] woman marriage is not between a man and
[578.9s] a man marriage is not between a woman
[582.4s] and a woman and a marriage is not
[584.8s] between a human being and an animal
[588.8s] marriage is not between an adult and a
[592.0s] minor now this are fundamental
[596.6s] principles for marriage now some people
[600.0s] say well what about if we love one
[602.6s] another we are a man and a man and a
[604.9s] woman and a woman and we love one
[606.6s] another what should stop us from getting
[608.6s] married now I'm here to tell you that
[610.3s] let me tell you something we don't just
[612.4s] get married because we love one another
[615.4s] we get married because we obeying God
[618.6s] marriage is God's
[620.6s] institution It's Not a Human Institution
[623.2s] it's a Divine institution and if we are
[626.2s] going to get into that institution we
[629.4s] need to get into that institution
[632.2s] according to God's
[634.4s] terms not our own terms and God's terms
[639.6s] a marriage is
[642.5s] between a
[645.1s] man and a woman not a man and a man or a
[650.6s] woman and a
[652.9s] woman now now now no now the reason this
[657.1s] is the case it is because you have read
[660.2s] we have read here that God
[662.4s] says speaking to
[664.8s] himself the godhead he said let us
[668.1s] create man in our image let's create man
[672.9s] in our image now when you go to Genesis
[675.4s] chapter 5 and you read verse two you
[677.8s] realize that God's image in man is man
[682.4s] and woman for the Bible says God created
[686.5s] male and female and he constituted them
[692.0s] His Image he called them men so so so
[697.6s] when God says let's
[700.4s] create man in our image God had in mind
[704.7s] a male and a female who will come
[708.4s] together and when they come together in
[711.6s] holy matrimony they
[714.6s] constitute God's image
[720.1s] so so so so getting
[723.6s] married now for those of you who are not
[726.0s] married let me encourage you getting
[729.3s] married is
[731.4s] enhancing God's image in
[734.6s] you I not saying you're not God's image
[737.5s] if you are not married all I'm saying is
[739.3s] that if you get married you become more
[741.7s] of God's image it's in the word I'm not
[745.6s] creating it it's in the word so only a
[749.5s] man and a woman constitute the image of
[752.7s] God only man and a woman can create that
[757.9s] inestable
[759.6s] Union so when when the Bible says and a
[763.7s] man and a woman cliffed together and and
[766.8s] and they became one flesh only a man and
[770.7s] a woman can do that a man and a man
[773.6s] cannot do that they cannot CLE together
[775.6s] they cannot become one flesh
[780.2s] only a man and a woman can become one
[783.4s] flesh and so it is important for the
[785.8s] world to hear particularly from us as
[788.3s] Adventists they need to hear that
[791.1s] marriage is between a man and a woman
[793.7s] because only in that Union can men and
[797.8s] woman become one
[802.4s] flesh only a man and a woman can
[807.6s] approximate the UN
[810.1s] that you find in the
[813.2s] godhead man and a man cannot do that a
[816.8s] woman and a woman cannot do that that's
[819.0s] not how God designed it to be only a man
[824.3s] and a woman so when God said let us
[826.6s] create man in our image now we believe
[828.6s] in the Trinity as Adventist so we
[830.9s] believe in God the Father God the son
[832.4s] and God the Holy Spirit and these are
[835.4s] three persons but one substance they are
[838.0s] one
[840.1s] and so when God said we need to create
[842.7s] man in our image God was saying we need
[845.8s] to create creatures that will resemble
[849.0s] our Oneness while they are different
[852.1s] persons but they can be
[855.2s] one that's Divine mathematics 1 + 1 + 1
[859.7s] is 1 1 + 1 is one and only a woman and a
[866.6s] man can do that only a man and a woman
[871.3s] can exemplify God's creative power of
[876.7s] procreation only a man and woman can do
[879.2s] that so God said to Adam and Eve after
[883.0s] creating them and after bringing them
[885.1s] together as husband and wife then God
[887.7s] said be fruitful and multiply and fill
[890.8s] the Earth only a man and a woman can do
[894.9s] that multiply and fill the Earth and I
[897.4s] need to say that
[899.6s] but when I talk about this passage I
[902.0s] usually say to South Africans out there
[904.0s] I said when God said be fruitful and
[905.7s] multiply and fill the Earth he wasn't
[907.5s] talking to
[908.8s] you he was talking to Adam and Eve the
[911.6s] Earth was empty now then the empty the
[914.8s] Earth is full right
[917.3s] now so he wasn't really talking to you
[920.0s] so don't go out here and take it on as a
[922.0s] personal project to try and fill the
[923.6s] earth the earth is full
[929.4s] but but but but only a man and a
[933.8s] woman can come together and
[939.2s] procreate and so and so and so we need
[942.6s] to get to the basics if we are going to
[945.4s] have a functional
[947.7s] family its husband its
[951.4s] wife it
[955.4s] children and so
[959.1s] the Bible says God God created
[962.6s] Adam and then created
[966.1s] Eve I'm going to talk about that during
[968.6s] the week today by the way I'm laying the
[971.0s] principles I'm going to unpack these
[972.8s] principles throughout the week so I'm
[975.4s] I'm laying the principles today so God
[977.7s] created Adam and created Eve and after
[980.6s] creating Adam and Eve brought them
[983.3s] together now the first person that Adam
[987.3s] saw after God created him was
[991.2s] God the first person that Eve
[994.5s] saw after God created here
[998.8s] was
[1001.0s] God Adam saw God first Eve saw God first
[1006.7s] before they could see each other now
[1009.8s] that principle is very important it is
[1012.2s] very important because people that got
[1014.9s] married and they want to have a
[1017.0s] functional marriage and
[1019.4s] a a marriage that is in the order of
[1022.5s] God's design and
[1024.8s] ideal these people need to see God first
[1029.2s] before they see each
[1032.0s] other when you're a man you need to see
[1035.2s] God first when you are a woman you need
[1038.2s] to see God first before you see each
[1041.8s] other because you know when you see each
[1044.3s] other before you see God you'll be a
[1046.5s] danger to one another
[1050.6s] and that is why later on Paul says
[1054.3s] because you would have seen God and she
[1056.7s] would have seen God when you come
[1058.5s] together you are equally Yol
[1061.6s] so he advises in a negative way he says
[1065.2s] do not be unequally yolked with
[1070.3s] unbelievers so don't marry a person
[1073.2s] who's not of your own faith or who's not
[1075.3s] of your own spiritual persuasion do not
[1079.3s] be equally yolked with unbelievers now
[1082.7s] now no no most
[1085.8s] marriages and most families crumble and
[1089.2s] fall on the basis of the fact that there
[1092.4s] is an an an an an an an
[1095.6s] irreconcilable difference
[1098.4s] between the spiritual
[1101.9s] formation so the Bible
[1104.4s] says when you are going to come together
[1106.8s] and build a strong marriage you need to
[1110.4s] be of the
[1111.7s] same spiritual persuasion and faith we
[1116.1s] need to emphasize that because that is
[1118.0s] very important now let me explain this
[1120.3s] the Bible says do not be unequally
[1121.9s] yolked with unbelievers the Bible
[1123.6s] doesn't say do not be unequally yolked
[1125.6s] with Adventist with non-adventist I need
[1128.2s] to emphasize that amen
[1131.0s] somebody and I'll tell you why I'm
[1133.0s] saying that because sometimes we have a
[1135.8s] tendency of thinking as Adventists that
[1138.9s] when the Bible speaks about this it
[1140.8s] speaks about non-adventist and yet we
[1143.4s] don't realize that there are so many
[1145.7s] nonbelievers and unbelievers in the
[1148.1s] Adventist
[1149.9s] Church maybe not here in Kenya but
[1153.5s] definitely in South
[1155.9s] Africa maybe not here but in South
[1159.0s] Africa I often tell them it's not every
[1162.1s] Adventist that is a Believer so when the
[1165.4s] Bible says do not be equally an equally
[1168.7s] or rather unequally Yol with unbelievers
[1171.6s] it's speaking about certain people right
[1174.0s] here it's obvious of course you you
[1176.0s] don't want to be an Adventist and go get
[1177.6s] married to somebody else of another
[1179.0s] Faith you're going to create a problem
[1180.3s] for yourself but not all Adventists are
[1184.1s] marriage
[1186.6s] material they are
[1188.5s] unbelievers there are many unbelievers
[1190.7s] so there are certain brothers and
[1192.1s] sisters that you need to pray for at a
[1196.3s] distance I love you my brother but at a
[1200.0s] distance I love you my sister but at a
[1203.9s] distance amen
[1207.9s] somebody because because because I'll
[1210.3s] tell
[1211.8s] you if you are if you are married with
[1217.4s] somebody with whom you're are unequally
[1221.5s] Yol you're are creating a
[1224.8s] disaster for your
[1227.6s] marriage I am counseling a couple I met
[1231.5s] a couple just before I came here in
[1234.4s] South Africa and I was counseling them
[1237.5s] they're both
[1239.0s] Adventists but they come from different
[1242.0s] backgrounds one is Catholic one is born
[1244.6s] Adventist so when they
[1246.8s] met one was a Catholic one was an
[1250.8s] Adventist and so they came together and
[1253.2s] they got married and the lady then
[1254.6s] ultimately became an Adventist but now
[1256.6s] they're having differences
[1259.6s] and that
[1262.1s] differences is emphas the difference is
[1265.4s] emphasized by how they want to approach
[1269.3s] their problems and
[1272.5s] challenges and so I said to them I said
[1276.0s] you see here's the problem the problem
[1278.2s] is you've got a different
[1281.9s] Outlook to what your problems are so if
[1284.7s] we can Define what your problems are
[1286.6s] then we will agree on what the solution
[1288.4s] is but because they've got different
[1290.9s] Persuasions in how they think
[1293.0s] spiritually they don't think that they
[1295.6s] have the same problems the wife defines
[1297.8s] it this way the husband defines it that
[1299.6s] way and I said that's where the problem
[1301.0s] is now that marriage is on the verge of
[1303.8s] collapsing 10 years after they got
[1305.9s] married but I can tell you right now the
[1307.8s] foundation was weak right from the
[1309.6s] beginning so that marriage was doomed to
[1311.8s] end right at the beginning and I'm
[1314.1s] saying Paul says do not be unequally
[1317.2s] yolked with unbelievers because that
[1319.2s] marriage is
[1320.8s] bound to fail one way or the
[1325.8s] other and that's a simple
[1329.1s] principle I said the first principle is
[1331.4s] husband and wife don't confuse that the
[1335.2s] second principle is do not be unequally
[1338.7s] yoked with
[1342.6s] unbelievers so if you're going to if you
[1344.7s] love the Lord marry somebody who loves
[1347.6s] the Lord now now now this how I put it
[1350.6s] somebody in South Africa they would ask
[1352.2s] me well Pastor how do you know that
[1353.7s] somebody loves the Lord I I wouldn't
[1355.4s] know I'm not a prophet you see if I were
[1357.4s] a Prophet Elijah and or Prophet El
[1360.7s] Jeremiah I would be able to say Lord
[1362.9s] please reveal if this one loves the Lord
[1364.5s] or not I don't know I have no idea who
[1367.9s] loves the Lord and who doesn't love the
[1369.5s] Lord but I can tell you the Lord knows
[1372.2s] who loves him and who doesn't love him
[1374.7s] so all you have to do is commit your
[1377.1s] plans to the Lord and the Lord will
[1380.1s] guide you in the right
[1383.7s] direction so I say to young people who
[1386.8s] are not married I say give your heart to
[1391.8s] Jesus just give your heart to Jes don't
[1394.5s] give your heart to a boyfriend or a
[1396.6s] girlfriend don't give your heart to a
[1398.3s] man or a woman give your heart to Jesus
[1401.1s] because it is safe in the hands of Jesus
[1403.4s] and so when somebody else asks for your
[1405.3s] heart tell them I don't have a heart
[1407.6s] anymore if you want my heart go to Jesus
[1410.5s] because Jesus has my heart and Jesus
[1412.6s] will always give your heart to the right
[1415.8s] person but if you're going to give your
[1418.3s] heart yourself to somebody else might
[1421.4s] give it to a wrong person and you know
[1423.1s] people who are in love don't
[1427.6s] listen isn't it they say love is blind
[1432.2s] but I've realized that it is also
[1435.6s] death so when you when you when you tell
[1439.7s] people be careful don't give your heart
[1442.3s] to this one don't give your heart to
[1443.6s] that one don't don't and oh but Pastor
[1446.1s] you don't understand you know we we love
[1448.6s] each other we we love each
[1450.9s] other don't give your heart to this
[1453.0s] person give your heart to Jesus and then
[1454.8s] two months down the line three months
[1456.6s] down the line two years down the line
[1458.0s] three then they come to you oh Pastor
[1459.7s] pray for me what happened he broke my
[1461.8s] heart please pray for me and I'm tempted
[1464.6s] to always ask when they say he broke my
[1467.0s] heart what you your heart doing there in
[1468.6s] the first place because your heart
[1471.0s] should have been with Jesus what was
[1473.4s] your heart doing there in the first
[1474.5s] place so I'm here to tell you that if
[1476.5s] you're going to get married give your
[1478.6s] heart to Jesus
[1481.9s] first when somebody ask for that heart
[1485.1s] tell them that they must go to Jesus and
[1487.1s] only Jesus will know who should have
[1490.9s] your
[1493.1s] heart do not be unequally Yol with
[1496.3s] unbelievers
[1498.4s] you'll be praying to God and somebody
[1500.0s] will be praying to something else you'll
[1502.6s] be trusting God and somebody will be
[1504.3s] trusting something else so you want to
[1507.4s] to both of you trust God to pray to God
[1510.4s] and have the same way of thinking when
[1514.0s] it comes to approaching your problems
[1515.9s] and coming up with your own
[1522.3s] Solutions oh but there something else
[1524.3s] too
[1528.9s] God's ideal
[1530.7s] family God's ideal marriage God's
[1535.4s] standards God's ideal for his people it
[1539.2s] is that intimacy must only
[1543.0s] OCC in
[1546.1s] marriage now I said the first thing
[1550.0s] marriage is between husband and wife two
[1553.2s] you must be equally Yol three intimacy
[1557.9s] must only
[1559.4s] okay within
[1562.5s] marriage now it's not fashionable
[1565.0s] anymore in South Africa you might say
[1567.8s] here so I mean that is obvious it's not
[1570.4s] so
[1572.4s] obvious and there's a reason why God
[1575.1s] says intimacy must only OCC within
[1577.6s] marriage there's a reason and I'm going
[1579.1s] to unpack those reasons as we move on
[1581.3s] because sometimes intimacy outside of
[1584.5s] marriage will destroy the marriage even
[1587.6s] before it begin
[1591.1s] that is why God
[1592.8s] says it must be only within marriage the
[1598.7s] two shall come
[1600.2s] together the two shall come together and
[1603.2s] they shall become one flesh when after
[1607.0s] they have been
[1610.3s] blessed the Bible says brought them
[1612.6s] together and he blessed them and he said
[1614.3s] be fruitful and multiply after he
[1617.6s] blessed them them intimacy must occur
[1620.6s] after somebody has been blessed after
[1622.7s] the couple has been blessed not outside
[1625.4s] of those blessings and the fruitfulness
[1628.2s] and
[1629.0s] multiplication must occur after the
[1632.7s] blessings don't begin with being
[1634.9s] fruitful and then come later on for
[1637.1s] blessings it doesn't work like
[1641.0s] that and then people say oh but pastor
[1644.3s] pastor we we we we we love each other so
[1647.9s] why can't we be intimate if we love each
[1650.7s] other and my question is so everybody
[1655.2s] that you love you'll be intimate with
[1658.0s] them I mean if the reasoning is we love
[1661.4s] each other so everybody that you love
[1663.7s] you'll be intimate with
[1666.7s] them then there's a
[1670.1s] problem and then I often ask them very
[1672.7s] simple question if you say you love a
[1676.2s] person how do you love them
[1679.3s] with what do you love them now I often
[1682.4s] hear people say oh I love him with my
[1686.1s] heart isn't it I love him with my heart
[1690.8s] with all my
[1692.7s] heart and I ask a very simple question I
[1695.3s] say so where is the
[1698.8s] heart where is that heart that you love
[1701.5s] a person with now I don't have a degree
[1703.9s] in physiology and anatomy and I'm not a
[1706.0s] doctor but I can tell you there's no
[1707.6s] heart from from here
[1714.8s] downwards so if you love somebody with
[1717.3s] your heart if you love them with your
[1719.9s] heart the heart is
[1722.2s] here there's no heart from here down
[1729.3s] here but like I said I'm just
[1732.3s] establishing principles I'm going to
[1734.6s] unpack these principles as we move on
[1737.5s] sex outside of marriage is
[1743.4s] dangerous and that's why God says it
[1746.2s] must only
[1749.6s] OCC within the context of
[1753.7s] marriage higher than the highest human
[1755.8s] thought can reach is God's
[1757.9s] ideal for his
[1761.8s] children godliness and godlikeness is
[1765.1s] the goal to be reached and and and and
[1767.2s] and and and
[1768.7s] sex within marriage brings that Oneness
[1772.1s] that we read about it brings that
[1774.8s] Oneness and that is why that is why it
[1778.0s] is important and that is why Paul
[1779.8s] advises that when you are in marriage
[1783.3s] sex is just not Recreation sex is very
[1785.8s] important it's spiritual it's emotional
[1787.8s] it's me it's mental it's everything it's
[1790.2s] important and so he says when you are in
[1794.3s] that relationship that committed
[1796.8s] relationship do not don't deprive one
[1798.8s] another of sex don't do that because
[1801.4s] you're creating a problem you are
[1803.0s] creating Temptations for one another
[1805.2s] don't do it don't do that and don't use
[1808.1s] it as a bing chip don't weaponize sex in
[1813.9s] marriage it's holy it's
[1817.6s] beautiful but it must occur for the
[1821.4s] purpose of
[1824.1s] bringing you together into one flesh and
[1828.3s] it's not just
[1829.8s] physical it's not spiritual it's mental
[1834.0s] it's bringing two
[1836.3s] Souls
[1838.0s] together now in so saying I want us to
[1843.3s] disabuse
[1845.1s] ourselves particularly as
[1849.6s] men of the idea that sex is only
[1854.6s] physical because that's the problem with
[1856.5s] us men with think that this thing is
[1859.3s] just physical you can engage with it
[1861.0s] without engaging it without emotions
[1863.7s] without attachment without this without
[1865.7s] that and and we have been socialized and
[1868.6s] culturized into thinking that and that
[1873.2s] is a recipe for
[1880.6s] disaster and the two shall become
[1883.3s] one they shall become
[1886.5s] one in that
[1890.0s] intimacy the principle another principle
[1893.5s] that I want to just lay down for today
[1897.5s] which is the fourth principle is that
[1900.3s] children must be born in marriage that's
[1903.9s] God's
[1904.8s] order husband and wife get
[1908.4s] married of the same Faith get married
[1911.7s] that's God's
[1913.2s] order sex occurs within marriage that's
[1916.6s] God's order
[1918.8s] children must be born in wedlock that's
[1924.2s] God's
[1931.7s] order now children are a
[1934.8s] blessing and I often say children are it
[1938.0s] doesn't matter how they come about
[1939.9s] whether it's out of wedlock or in
[1942.1s] wedlock whether it's an accident or Not
[1944.6s] an Accident it doesn't matter but
[1947.0s] children are just the blessing from God
[1949.2s] and when they are here we don't question
[1950.9s] how they came about they are just a
[1953.8s] blessing and they bring us joy and that
[1956.4s] is why I often Say Never call children
[1959.4s] illegitimate there's no illegitimate
[1962.8s] child amen
[1965.1s] somebody what do we have sometimes are
[1968.2s] illegitimate
[1972.4s] parents that we do have where you have
[1976.4s] parents where you have H the man and a
[1979.1s] woman having children outside of
[1981.0s] marriage and most of the time when that
[1982.9s] happens one parent runs away leaves the
[1986.0s] other parent to take the responsibility
[1987.7s] for the children now let me tell you
[1989.0s] something let me tell you something
[1990.6s] which is very important children have a
[1993.4s] right to be brought into a family of man
[1998.2s] and woman father and mother a stable
[2002.7s] family children have a right to do that
[2005.2s] and when we give birth to children in
[2008.0s] the context of a stable home we are not
[2011.3s] doing them a
[2014.0s] favor they have the right to have a
[2017.3s] father they have a right to have a
[2020.1s] mother in a committed relationship of
[2025.2s] marriage Studies have
[2028.2s] shown that children who are
[2033.2s] born
[2035.9s] in in a stable ho
[2038.8s] they grow up to be
[2040.6s] stable where's a father and the mother
[2043.7s] they grow up to be stable mentally
[2047.0s] emotionally physically socially children
[2050.9s] who are born in a stable
[2054.8s] home are likely to succeed in life and
[2059.7s] to reach the potential children who are
[2063.7s] born in a stable home are like
[2068.3s] likely to have a
[2070.9s] relationship with
[2074.1s] God and that is why God put that order
[2079.8s] husband and
[2082.0s] wife get
[2084.7s] married doesn't matter how much you love
[2086.8s] each other get married get into a
[2089.8s] committed relationship I will unpack
[2093.1s] that during the week it's important to
[2096.2s] have that relationship
[2098.2s] it's important to be of the same faith
[2103.0s] it is
[2104.0s] important and by the same faith I don't
[2107.1s] mean I don't mean of the same
[2111.0s] denomination of course you need to
[2113.4s] narrate to a denomination that's very
[2115.4s] important however I'm saying even within
[2118.6s] that same denomination you need to be of
[2121.0s] the same
[2123.4s] Faith within the same denomination same
[2127.2s] faith
[2129.2s] then you can practice safe intimacy only
[2133.8s] within the context of that committed
[2137.3s] relationship outside of that it's a
[2141.5s] recipe for
[2143.5s] disaster recipe for disaster for you as
[2147.1s] a man and for you as a woman and for the
[2150.5s] children that will be born in that
[2153.6s] environment and lastly children have a
[2157.8s] right to be
[2160.1s] born in a
[2162.7s] stable
[2164.4s] family where there is a mother where
[2167.9s] there's a
[2169.0s] father and where there's
[2172.9s] marriage as I
[2181.1s] close God's
[2184.0s] order provides an enhancement
[2188.2s] of God's
[2189.6s] image in
[2191.4s] us we are created in God's
[2194.4s] image and Jesus is now recreating Us in
[2199.6s] His image and the family is a context
[2204.6s] within which God is doing
[2209.1s] that
[2214.0s] secondly God's order provides spiritual
[2217.6s] ual
[2218.9s] growth and development God's order for
[2221.8s] family that's where we develop our
[2225.5s] spirituality our
[2227.6s] morality our way of looking at life and
[2231.7s] that's where we
[2233.0s] prepare our
[2235.1s] characters for
[2238.1s] heaven God's order for
[2241.7s] family it's where we can
[2245.2s] practice safe intimacy
[2248.7s] and God's order for family is where we
[2252.4s] can provide a
[2255.6s] stable
[2257.7s] environment for our children may God
[2260.8s] bless you
