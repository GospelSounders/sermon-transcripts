FULL TRANSCRIPT:
Happy Sabbath, church. Happy day. Happy. I have another privilege from the Lord to stand before you so that I may speak the words of heaven. The Lord has been so good to us and he has been a blessing to each one of us. I remind you that uh this Sabbath is a first Sabbath of the second quarter of the year. And so it is a Sabbath of prayer and fasting worldwide. each member of the church, the Lord is willing to meet you in prayer that you may be able to humble yourself before the Lord and in prayer. So we will be having sessions of prayer this day and also I want to tell you that for the first time in our history we have one of our youth departments called ambassadors that is having a worldwide Today for ambassadors and ambassadors as we have been separating our youth departments the we started with uh senior youth we had pathfinders and then we had the adventurers came adventurers came and also because we see the needs of various age groups in the youth ministry they are always being divided so that they can be served according to the needs of the departments. So um in the four the major four I know there are others the last one that came up is the ambassador's club. Ambassador's club is age 15 through 21. So today is World Ambassadors Day and it is the first day of its kind in the world and the worldwide theme for the day is living. You can see it living for impact. I am living to impact someone. I am living that someone may be able to see a Christian. I am living that people may see that there is a difference. And we may read the book of Matthew chapter 5. We are reading verse 13 through 16. Matthew chapter 5 verse 13- 16. The Bible says you are the salt of the earth. But if the salt loses its flavor, how shall it be seasoned? It is then good for nothing, but be but to be thrown out and be trembled underfoot by man. You are the light of the world. A city that is set on a hill cannot be hidden. Nor do they light a lamp and put it under a basket, but on a lampstand. And it gives light to the whole to all who are in the house. Verse 16. Let your light so shine before men that they may see your good works and glorify your father in heaven. Let us pray. Mighty God in heaven, your name is exalted. We are humbling ourselves before you that you may be able to speak to us the words of heaven. Dust of the ground, I am standing before your children. Help me run and hide away that you may speak the beautiful words of heaven from the throne room of heaven. Let your name be exalted in Jesus name we pray. Amen. Verse one of Matthew 5. Verse one of Matthew 5. And seeing the multitudes, he went up to the mountain. And when he seated his disciples, when he seated, he was seated, his disciples came to him, then he opened his mouth and taught them, saying, [Music] Jesus went and sat down. He wanted to preach a great sermon to his disciples. And in this sermon, Christ knew the best that is needed from those who have accepted Christ. And therefore, he sat down to speak to them. The one who spoke like no one had ever ever spoken, opened his mouth to speak the biatitudes. And on the sermon on the mountain when he was preaching the sermon, he was telling them how the one that regards Jesus as his king would translate that relationship with Jesus to mean moral change, ethical difference. Anyone who regards Jesus Christ as Lord must have ethical changes in his life. Must have different morals in his whole life. This thing must be translated as you live your daily life. You must be seen to be a Christian. And therefore, Christ sat them down to teach them that your life is important because you are a Christian. And he tells them that you are the salt of the earth. By the way, when verse 13 is saying that you are the salt of the earth, that one is not saying that you should be the salt of the earth, but is saying you are the salt of the earth. I want you to come to your life today and hear me tell you that you are the salt of the earth. Christ is expecting you to be the salt. My ambassadors, Christ is expecting you to be the salt of the earth. You would say that why would Christ talk of a Christian being the salt of the earth? Salt has a unique taste. Taste that is different from any other taste. In the world where people are ungodly, characters are bad, are evil, people do evil openly. And I tell you for free that the evil that you see today will be much more as time advances. As time goes, evil that we see will much more advance. We will find the earth being a place we don't want to live in. When you are seeing the abominations being done openly, serious sins being done openly, the test that we see is unpalatable. Sometimes a Christian you don't know how you can live with your fellow human beings around you. It is unpalatable. that the world is looking at some taste that they can be able to see, something that can be able to taste nice amidst many things that are bad. And therefore, God is telling them that you are the salt of the earth. By the way, when you are told that you are so the salt of the earth, you may feel that the earth is too big. I may not be able to salt it. It might not be enough. But in this Christ is aware that there's there is something that Christians may do not by a sword, not by any arm of war, but they can do it by a quiet consistent life of a Christian. Quite consistent life of a Christian. And that is why he's saying you are the salt of the earth. But it is asking you a question. If the salt loses its flavor, it is profitable for nothing. It becomes worthless. It needs to be thrown away. Do you know that one is telling us that if you can't have a life of a Christian, if you can't live a Christian life today, you are worthless. You are not profitable. By the way, you may be coming to church every day and there is no salt. The church is having no profit from your presence in here. Christ feels that you are not profiting the work of God. And then he says that it is thrown underfoot for people to step on it to stumble on it because there is no value in that salt and therefore the purer and good life is palatable. God expects you to have a Christian life that is able to impact the people who are around you in college that they can see that this is a Christian. We need to give the world the taste that they need the world needs and therefore if you lose your flavor you are good for nothing. This may be painful for a Christian. You have been wasting all your time. You have been here for all the years as a Christian. But you have no Christian life. So it is summarizing by saying you are good for what? For nothing. By the way, it is saying you are useless. That verse is saying it is there was no need of creating you. There was no need of getting birth to you because you have no Christian character. Therefore, it goes ahead in verse four 14 5:14 and it says, "You are the light of the world. A city that is set on a hill cannot be hidden. Christ is saying that there is a lot of darkness in the world. There are a lot of things that happened bad, many bad things, many evil things that are happening. a lot of darkness in the world and God is saying that you are the light of the world. You know that one you are set at a place where you are being focused on people around you are focusing you as their light. Then there God is saying Christ is saying you are the light of the world. Something he adds that a city that is set on a hill cannot be hidden. The reason for the city being on the hill is that the city may be so beautiful to attract our eyes that we may be able to to love to see it. We love to see that beautiful city. So the city is built somewhere that is rest. Have you ever gone for a safari and seen someone who has built a very nice house and the house is raised somewhere on a hill and by the way almost very close to the road and you know sometimes you you wonder how people how God may be able to bless someone with with with with money to build a good house. Then after building a good house, God blessed this person. Uh even before building the good house, God blessed this person to have to have the best scene, the best scene to build where people can see that beautiful house. You know, sometimes we build very nice houses at home, but some inside some thicket that no one can be able to see them unless they are officially invited to come to your home. But some homes we just see them without being invited because they are set on a hill. And by the way, God blesses with that be that that capability to do the beautiful thing that we can see. A city that is rest on a hill cannot be hidden. What am I saying? A Christian cannot be hidden. A Christian cannot hide. Why is it that there are several Christians but there is nothing that is [Music] happening? There is no difference that we can make. And this is why Christ is saying, "You are the light of the world." I want you to open your eyes and see what Christ is telling you. That God expects you to have a difference in character. And therefore, he says, A city that is set on a hill cannot be hidden. Nor do they light a lamp a lamp and put it under a basket but on a lampstand and it gives light to all who are in the house. You know that one is telling us that you know nowadays nowadays we use a lot of electricity and solar so we don't get this message that is here. I remember when we used to use uh how do I call it? Even lantern lamps, the the one that we use just a week to to put some oil in inside so that you you you can you can have some light in the house. And it's a very little light by the way. and you light that lamp that you may be able to see things that are in the house because there is a lot of darkness. When there is a lot of darkness, there is a need for alarm. And God is telling you that as I see the behavior of young boys and young girls today in in colleges, in high schools, as I see the young men and young women who are outside there, young professionals, as I see their light, there is a lot of darkness in the world and there is need for a lamp around them. There is need for one who is faithful that they can be able to see and say that surely there is some difference. As we see women today, we need some women that can be raised up, that can be a light to the women. As we see the behavior of men today, we see men, we want to see men amidst the deep darkness. Men are needed who have some light and that light needs to be seen. By the way, when there is light, the least spark in the dark room can be seen at once. Let me repeat that one. When there is a lot of darkness inside the house, a lot of darkness that that one that is blinding a little spark in a corner at a corner somewhere there is a little spark of light in the darkness. That light must be seen. This one tells me that you cannot live a life and your friends cannot be able to recognize that you are the light of the world. They can never fail to see that you are a Christian. If they have failed to see then you are not a Christian. You are worth being tumbled on, useless because if people cannot see that there is something different in you then there is a problem. Every spark of light can be seen. That is why In this text when God Christ is telling us that you are the light of the world, a city that is set on a hill cannot be hidden. Then Christ is telling us that a Christian can't hide. If you are a Christian, people will openly see. They will see your post on Tik Tok. They will realize that this post is different from the post of the youth of the world. They will see all your posts on Facebook. They will realize that you are different. They will see that there is an impact. Living for impact. When they see your dressing, they will see that this dressing, we can't confuse it with any other street in town. This dressing is a dressing of a man of a woman who has seen Christ. This dressing is one of a youth who has met Jesus living for impact. A city that is set on a hill cannot be hidden. And that is why Christ told us he invited us and told us please go through the narrow gate. Do not go through the wide gate. This narrow gate is straight but do not go through the broadway because many people find it. Many people will find the Broadway. Why are they finding it? Because you are in you can be coming to church but you are not of God. But in the end you will be worthless. But he says go through the narrow gate. It is straight. It is tough and few people find it. Few people find this road to be a nice road. C. When a servant of God is writing in the book of ministry of healing, the book ministry of healing chapter uh page 4 and page 470, ministry of healing, page 470, the servant of God is saying there is an eloquence far more powerful than the eloquence of words in the quiet consistent life of a pure true Christian there is a change you can do which is very powerful more powerful than words. What is that? It is an eloquence of quiet consistent life of a pure and a true Christian. Before we finish it, God is looking for a youth who loves to live a pure life, who wants to be a true Christian, seeking forever to follow Christ. You see it proceeds by saying the officers who went to Jesus, this is a a comment from from the book of John 7:46 and 47. It says the officers who went who were sent to Jesus came back with a report that never man spoke as he spoke. But the reason for this was that never man lived as he lived. Underline that statement. The Bible is saying never man spoke like Jesus spoke. There were some officers who were sent to go and arrest Jesus. Then as they were there, Christ preached and taught. Then they were afraid of him. How can we arrest this holy man? Then when he came back to the Pharisees, they asked him, "Why have you not brought him?" Their answer was, "Never a man spoke like this man spoke. We could not arrest him." But why were his speeches very powerful? Because never a man lived as he lived. His life was powerful, making much power in what he was doing. Had his life been other than it was, he could not have spoken as he did. His words bore with them a convincing power because they came from a heart pure and holy. A heart which is what? Pure and holy, full of love and sympathy, benevolence and truth. Thank you so much. When we look at verse 16, verse 16 of Matthew 5, our text, Matthew 5:16, remember Christ had just told us that you are the light of the world. Now verse 16 it is saying let your light so shine before men that they may see your good works and glorify your father who is in heaven. I want you to get I know you always love this text but what is Christ saying here? Christ is saying your light cannot be hidden. Raise your Christian character up there. Let your Christian beliefs be shining up there. Let your Christian behavior be up there because you are a light that has been lighted by him. So Christ is saying I have put you on a lampstand that evil men may be able to see you. Christ is saying I have rest my servant that is holy. I want to place him somewhere. I want to place her somewhere that the world may be able to see what Christ can do in a person's character. How Christ can change a youth's character. That there can be youths who can be faithful today with this age in this age of technology. I can still raise a youth who is faithful. God is asking that and he's saying and when you become faithful do not try to hide your faithfulness so that people cannot see your your Christian character. Your Christian character is what I need. Raise it up so that they may see a Christian character and they will glorify your father who is in heaven. What is this text saying? By the way, I feel it is saying that if you are a Christian and you are not stealing, let people see that you're not stealing. Let people see that you are a Christian and that is why you are not stealing. so that they can glorify God that even today there are people who are faithful. If you are a youth who have been blessed and is not committing adultery, raise it up. Let your character be known, be seen, so that they may see your good character. And your fellow peers will see you and they will marvel and they will say, "Even in the world today, there are youth who dress well." Even in the world today, there are youth who take care of their body. Even in the world today there are men who are not having any multiple spouses in the darkness. Rest it that they may see your good works. They may say that even today there are women who are like Sahara who took care of their families. Rest that character that it can be seen. What is that verse saying? So that they may see what your good works. so that they may be able to glorify your father who is in heaven. You know today it is not that men must have a extraarital affairs they do call it. Young people today cannot be faithful and we some of us we we are very confident you will be faithful when you become old. The Bible says when you are faithful in little things you will be faithful in big things. When you become faithful to God today, you will become faithful to God when you are old. Be faithful to God today. The Lord is looking for Christians who are standing firm, who are exhibiting the character of Christ that we may be able to express to the world what it means to be saved. By the way, I think I came to church before I was saved. And it took me some time to be saved until I saw a fellow some fellow youths, my friends, who were saved. And I confirmed that the Bible is true because youths can be saved. I confirmed the Bible is true because I have seen someone who is saved. Let your light soul shine that people around you may see and they will glorify your father who is in heaven. You may be very beautiful by the way, but you are worth nothing if not in Christ. You may be very handsome but is worthless can be trampled underfoot. Why? Because you have no light at all. By the way, you can be a very blessed man, blessed with things, but if you don't raise that character high, it is useless to the church of God. Finally, the our savior is looking for some light in us. What is the use of light? Light is to give us direction when there is darkness. When there are many people who are lost in sin, many people who are entangled in the world, they are looking to see a light that is leading to the right path. Be a light that is directing people home. There are many who needs their to see their direction home. But they can't see because there is darkness. They need a light that can lead them home. Be a light that is leading friends home. Many people want to reach home but they don't know the way that can be able to lead them home. Your consistent pure life will be able to lead many to see where home is. Home is good. Home will take care of us. Home will comfort us. Your consistent life will take people home. I pray that may ambassadors come forward. We want to pray for ambassadors. We want to commit them to God. I want also to commit even teens please come forward ambassadors I mean not the people who sang here if you inside the church coristers are coming if you are inside the church and you know at least you are between the age of 15 and 21 or you are teen please come forward just come forward we want to pray for you come forward here we want to commit you in the hands of the Lord that you may live for an impact. Coristas please let us be singing as they

TIMESTAMPED TRANSCRIPT:
[0.2s] Happy Sabbath, church.
[2.9s] Happy day. Happy.
[6.6s] I have another privilege from the
[10.4s] Lord to stand before
[13.6s] you so that I may speak the words of
[18.0s] heaven. The Lord has been so good to
[21.5s] us and he has been a blessing to each
[24.5s] one of us.
[26.8s] I remind you that
[29.5s] uh this Sabbath is a first Sabbath of
[34.2s] the second quarter of the
[36.2s] year. And
[38.0s] so it is a Sabbath of prayer and fasting
[43.0s] worldwide.
[45.5s] each member of the
[47.9s] church, the Lord is willing to meet you
[50.7s] in
[52.0s] prayer that you may be able to humble
[55.4s] yourself before the Lord and in prayer.
[59.2s] So we will be having sessions of prayer
[62.2s] this
[64.0s] day and also I want to tell you
[70.0s] that for the first time in our
[75.2s] history we have one of
[78.7s] our youth
[81.2s] departments called
[83.2s] ambassadors that is having a
[86.7s] worldwide
[88.6s] Today for
[91.8s] ambassadors and ambassadors as we have
[95.8s] been separating our youth departments
[99.4s] the we started with uh senior youth we
[103.3s] had
[104.3s] pathfinders and then we had the
[108.0s] adventurers came adventurers came and
[111.7s] also because we see the needs of various
[115.3s] age groups in the youth ministry they
[118.7s] are always being divided so that they
[120.9s] can be served according to the needs of
[124.5s] the departments. So um in the four the
[129.0s] major four I know there are others the
[131.3s] last one that came up is the
[133.1s] ambassador's club. Ambassador's club
[136.4s] is age 15 through
[141.7s] 21. So today is World
[148.0s] Ambassadors Day and it is the first day
[152.3s] of its kind in the world and the
[156.1s] worldwide theme for the day is living.
[161.4s] You can see it
[164.2s] living for
[166.4s] impact. I am living to impact someone.
[171.7s] I am living that someone may be able to
[175.1s] see a
[176.8s] Christian. I am living that people may
[180.2s] see that there is a
[183.1s] difference.
[185.6s] And
[188.1s] we may read the book of Matthew chapter
[193.1s] 5. We are reading verse
[196.3s] 13 through 16.
[200.1s] Matthew chapter 5
[202.7s] verse
[204.4s] 13-
[209.9s] 16. The Bible
[212.3s] says you are the salt of the
[216.9s] earth. But if the salt loses its
[221.2s] flavor, how shall it be
[226.4s] seasoned? It is then good for
[230.9s] nothing, but be but to be thrown out and
[237.0s] be trembled underfoot by
[240.1s] man. You are the light of the world. A
[245.4s] city that is set on a hill cannot be
[249.5s] hidden. Nor do they light a lamp and put
[253.6s] it under a basket, but on a
[260.1s] lampstand. And it gives light to the
[264.4s] whole to all who are in the house. Verse
[271.2s] 16. Let your light so shine before men
[278.0s] that they may see your good
[282.9s] works and
[284.9s] glorify your
[287.0s] father in heaven. Let us pray. Mighty
[291.8s] God in
[293.0s] heaven, your name is
[297.7s] exalted. We are humbling ourselves
[300.9s] before you that you may be able to speak
[304.0s] to us the words of
[308.4s] heaven. Dust of the ground, I am
[312.1s] standing before your children. Help me
[315.6s] run and hide away that you may speak the
[319.8s] beautiful words of heaven from the
[322.6s] throne room of heaven. Let your name be
[326.1s] exalted in Jesus name we pray.
[330.0s] Amen. Verse one of Matthew
[333.6s] 5. Verse one of Matthew
[337.6s] 5. And seeing the
[340.0s] multitudes, he went up to the mountain.
[343.4s] And when he seated his disciples, when
[346.5s] he seated, he was seated, his disciples
[349.8s] came to him, then he opened his mouth
[354.1s] and taught them,
[357.2s] saying,
[358.8s] [Music]
[361.9s] Jesus went and sat
[365.2s] down. He wanted to preach a great sermon
[369.0s] to his disciples.
[372.2s] And in this
[373.9s] sermon, Christ knew the best that is
[379.1s] needed from those who have accepted
[382.9s] Christ. And therefore, he sat down to
[386.2s] speak to them. The one who spoke like no
[391.8s] one had ever ever spoken, opened his
[396.2s] mouth to speak the biatitudes.
[401.2s] And on the sermon on the mountain when
[404.6s] he was preaching the
[406.9s] sermon, he was telling
[409.5s] them how the one that regards
[414.2s] Jesus as his
[417.7s] king would translate that relationship
[421.7s] with
[423.2s] Jesus to mean moral change, ethical
[428.9s] difference. Anyone who regards Jesus
[432.7s] Christ as Lord must have
[437.4s] ethical changes in his
[440.8s] life. Must have different morals in his
[445.8s] whole
[447.3s] life. This thing must be translated as
[452.1s] you live your daily life. You must be
[455.8s] seen to be a
[457.6s] Christian. And therefore, Christ sat
[461.3s] them down to teach
[463.9s] them that your life is
[468.4s] important because you are a
[470.8s] Christian. And he tells
[474.4s] them that you are the
[478.9s] salt of the earth. By the way, when
[482.7s] verse 13 is saying that you are the
[486.8s] salt of the
[490.7s] earth, that one is not saying that you
[495.2s] should be the salt of the
[498.0s] earth, but is saying you are the salt of
[503.4s] the earth.
[506.0s] I want you to come to your life today
[510.1s] and hear me tell
[512.6s] you
[514.4s] that you are the salt of the
[518.6s] earth. Christ is expecting you to be the
[524.1s] salt. My
[526.5s] ambassadors, Christ is expecting you to
[531.0s] be the salt of the earth.
[535.8s] You would say that why would Christ talk
[539.9s] of a Christian being the salt of the
[546.5s] earth? Salt has a unique
[551.8s] taste. Taste that is different from any
[555.4s] other
[558.2s] taste. In the world where people are
[564.4s] ungodly, characters are bad, are
[568.3s] evil, people do evil
[571.3s] openly. And I tell you for free that the
[575.0s] evil that you see today will be much
[578.5s] more as time advances.
[582.9s] As time
[585.6s] goes, evil that we see will much more
[591.4s] advance. We will find the earth being a
[595.4s] place we don't want to live
[597.7s] in. When you are seeing the abominations
[600.8s] being done
[603.6s] openly, serious sins being done
[608.2s] openly, the test that we see is
[614.0s] unpalatable. Sometimes a Christian you
[616.8s] don't know how you can live with your
[618.7s] fellow human beings around
[620.8s] you. It is
[623.8s] unpalatable. that the world is looking
[627.9s] at some taste that they can be able to
[631.3s] see, something that can be able to taste
[634.6s] nice
[636.2s] amidst many things that are bad. And
[642.9s] therefore, God is telling them
[647.2s] that you are the
[651.1s] salt of the earth. By the way, when you
[654.4s] are told that you are so the salt of the
[656.2s] earth, you may feel that the earth is
[659.4s] too
[660.2s] big. I may not be able to salt
[663.6s] it. It might not be enough.
[668.8s] But in this Christ is
[672.3s] aware that there's there is something
[674.9s] that Christians may do not by a sword,
[681.0s] not by any arm of
[684.2s] war, but they can do it by a quiet
[688.8s] consistent life of a
[691.3s] Christian. Quite consistent life of a
[695.7s] Christian. And that is why he's saying
[698.6s] you are the salt of the earth. But it is
[701.8s] asking you a
[704.0s] question. If the
[707.2s] salt loses its
[712.4s] flavor, it is profitable for nothing. It
[716.7s] becomes
[718.6s] worthless. It needs to be thrown away.
[722.8s] Do you know that one is telling us
[726.4s] that if you can't have a life of a
[730.0s] Christian, if you can't
[733.6s] live a Christian life
[737.0s] today, you are
[739.2s] worthless. You are not
[741.9s] profitable. By the way, you may be
[744.1s] coming to church every day and there is
[747.8s] no
[748.7s] salt. The church is
[752.2s] having no profit from your presence in
[756.3s] here.
[759.9s] Christ feels that you are not profiting
[763.0s] the work of
[764.4s] God. And then he says that it is thrown
[769.1s] underfoot for people to step on it to
[773.0s] stumble on it because there is no value
[776.5s] in that salt and
[779.9s] therefore the
[782.1s] purer and good life is palatable. God
[788.1s] expects you to have a Christian life
[791.3s] that is able to impact the people who
[794.4s] are around you in college that they can
[797.0s] see that this is a Christian. We need to
[800.1s] give the world the taste that they need
[802.7s] the world needs and
[806.3s] therefore if you lose your
[810.0s] flavor you are good for
[812.7s] nothing. This may be painful for a
[815.0s] Christian. You have been wasting all
[817.1s] your time. You have been here for all
[818.6s] the years as a Christian. But you have
[822.0s] no Christian life. So it is summarizing
[825.2s] by saying you are
[828.0s] good for what? For
[831.6s] nothing. By the way, it is saying you
[834.0s] are
[835.5s] useless. That verse is saying it
[839.6s] is there was no need of creating you.
[844.1s] There was no need of getting birth to
[847.2s] you because you have no Christian
[851.7s] character. Therefore, it goes ahead in
[854.5s] verse four 14 5:14 and it
[858.8s] says, "You are the light of the
[863.6s] world. A city that is set on a
[868.0s] hill cannot be hidden.
[874.1s] Christ is
[876.1s] saying
[877.7s] that there is a lot of
[880.6s] darkness in the
[884.0s] world. There are a lot
[888.1s] of things that happened
[892.6s] bad, many bad things, many evil things
[896.0s] that are happening.
[898.3s] a lot of darkness in the world and God
[902.6s] is saying that you are the light of the
[910.9s] world. You know that one you are
[914.7s] set at a place where you are being
[917.4s] focused on people around you are
[921.0s] focusing you as their
[923.6s] light. Then there God is saying Christ
[927.1s] is saying you are the light of the
[930.7s] world. Something he adds that a city
[935.3s] that is set on a hill cannot be hidden.
[941.6s] The reason for the city being on the
[945.7s] hill is that the city may be so
[949.5s] beautiful to attract our eyes that we
[952.9s] may be able
[954.8s] to to love to see it. We love to see
[959.3s] that beautiful
[960.8s] city. So the city is built somewhere
[964.6s] that is rest. Have you ever gone for a
[969.5s] safari and seen someone who has built a
[974.8s] very nice
[976.6s] house and the house is raised somewhere
[979.7s] on a hill and by the way almost very
[983.8s] close to the road and you know sometimes
[986.7s] you you wonder how people how God may be
[990.1s] able to bless someone with with with
[992.2s] with money to build a good house. Then
[995.2s] after building a good house, God blessed
[998.2s] this person. Uh even before building the
[1001.1s] good house, God blessed this person to
[1003.0s] have to have the best scene, the best
[1006.9s] scene to build where people can see that
[1009.8s] beautiful house. You know, sometimes we
[1011.7s] build very nice houses at home, but some
[1014.3s] inside some thicket that no one can be
[1016.4s] able to see them unless they are
[1018.6s] officially invited to come to your home.
[1021.1s] But some homes we just see them without
[1024.2s] being
[1026.4s] invited because they are set on a hill.
[1030.9s] And by the way, God blesses with that be
[1033.8s] that that capability to do the beautiful
[1037.1s] thing that we can see. A city that is
[1040.9s] rest on a hill cannot be
[1046.8s] hidden. What am I saying?
[1050.3s] A
[1051.2s] Christian cannot be
[1054.5s] hidden. A Christian cannot
[1058.9s] hide. Why is it that there are several
[1062.4s] Christians but there is nothing that is
[1066.2s] [Music]
[1067.6s] happening? There is no difference that
[1070.5s] we can make.
[1073.3s] And this is why Christ is saying, "You
[1077.3s] are the light of the
[1082.0s] world." I want you to open your eyes and
[1085.5s] see what Christ is telling
[1088.1s] you. That God expects you to have a
[1092.6s] difference in
[1098.8s] character. And therefore, he says,
[1102.7s] A city that is set on a hill cannot be
[1106.9s] hidden.
[1109.0s] Nor do they light a
[1111.5s] lamp a lamp and put it under a
[1116.9s] basket but on a
[1120.0s] lampstand and it gives light to
[1124.4s] all who are in the house.
[1131.3s] You know that one is telling
[1134.3s] us that you know nowadays nowadays we
[1138.3s] use a lot of electricity and solar so we
[1141.1s] don't get this message that is here. I
[1144.0s] remember when we used to use uh how do I
[1148.2s] call
[1150.0s] it? Even lantern
[1152.5s] lamps, the the one that we use just a
[1155.5s] week to to put some oil in inside so
[1159.5s] that you you you can you can have some
[1162.1s] light in the
[1163.6s] house. And it's a very little light by
[1166.5s] the way.
[1171.2s] and you light that
[1174.0s] lamp that you may be able to see things
[1178.0s] that are in the
[1180.0s] house because there is a lot of
[1183.2s] darkness. When there is a lot of
[1185.5s] darkness, there is a need for
[1190.0s] alarm. And God is telling you that as I
[1194.7s] see the behavior of young boys and young
[1198.0s] girls today in in
[1202.8s] colleges, in high
[1205.2s] schools, as I see the young men and
[1208.5s] young women who are outside there, young
[1212.1s] professionals, as I see their light,
[1214.4s] there is a lot of darkness in the world
[1217.4s] and there is need for a lamp around
[1219.9s] them.
[1221.0s] There is need for one who is faithful
[1225.8s] that they can be able to
[1229.7s] see and say that surely there is some
[1234.6s] difference.
[1237.3s] As we see women
[1240.6s] today, we need some
[1244.1s] women that can be raised
[1246.9s] up, that can be a light to the
[1251.5s] women. As we see the behavior of men
[1254.9s] today, we see men, we want to see
[1259.1s] men amidst the deep darkness. Men are
[1264.8s] needed who have some light and that
[1268.8s] light needs to be
[1270.6s] seen. By the
[1272.8s] way, when there is
[1277.9s] light, the least
[1281.3s] spark in the dark
[1284.0s] room can be seen at
[1288.5s] once. Let me repeat that one. When there
[1291.4s] is a lot of darkness inside the
[1294.3s] house, a lot of
[1298.3s] darkness that that one that is
[1302.1s] blinding a little spark in a
[1306.5s] corner at a corner somewhere there is a
[1309.4s] little spark of light in the
[1313.2s] darkness. That light must be seen.
[1320.4s] This one tells me that you cannot live a
[1325.5s] life and your friends cannot be able to
[1328.7s] recognize that you are the light of the
[1331.5s] world. They can never fail to see that
[1334.5s] you are a Christian. If they have failed
[1337.2s] to see then you are not a Christian. You
[1340.2s] are worth being tumbled
[1344.8s] on,
[1348.3s] useless because if people cannot see
[1352.1s] that there is something different in
[1354.9s] you then there is a problem. Every spark
[1359.5s] of light can be
[1361.8s] seen. That is why
[1371.5s] In this
[1375.1s] text when God Christ is telling us that
[1379.8s] you are the light of the
[1382.0s] world, a city that is set on a hill
[1385.8s] cannot be
[1387.1s] hidden. Then Christ is telling
[1390.0s] us that a Christian can't hide.
[1394.6s] If you are a
[1396.0s] Christian, people will openly
[1399.0s] see. They will see your post on Tik
[1402.6s] Tok. They will realize that this post is
[1406.2s] different from the post of the youth of
[1409.3s] the world. They will see all your posts
[1413.2s] on Facebook. They will realize that you
[1416.3s] are different. They will see that there
[1418.7s] is an
[1420.0s] impact. Living for impact.
[1423.4s] When they
[1425.0s] see your dressing, they will see that
[1428.2s] this dressing, we can't confuse it with
[1430.8s] any other street in
[1432.7s] town. This dressing is a dressing of a
[1436.5s] man of a woman who has seen Christ. This
[1440.6s] dressing is one of a youth who has met
[1444.9s] Jesus living for
[1447.5s] impact. A city that is set on a hill
[1451.3s] cannot be hidden.
[1455.2s] And that is
[1458.8s] why
[1462.4s] Christ told
[1464.5s] us he invited us and told
[1469.1s] us
[1471.0s] please go
[1473.3s] through the narrow
[1478.0s] gate. Do not go through the wide gate.
[1484.7s] This narrow gate is
[1487.5s] straight but do not go
[1490.2s] through the
[1492.1s] broadway because many people find
[1495.1s] it. Many people will find the Broadway.
[1498.1s] Why are they finding it? Because you are
[1500.4s] in you can be coming to
[1502.8s] church but you are not of
[1506.9s] God. But in the end you will be
[1509.6s] worthless. But he says go through the
[1512.7s] narrow
[1514.0s] gate. It is straight. It is tough and
[1519.0s] few people find
[1520.4s] it. Few people find this road to be a
[1523.8s] nice
[1525.3s] road. C. When a servant of God is
[1529.0s] writing in the book of ministry of
[1530.8s] healing, the book ministry of healing
[1533.6s] chapter
[1535.6s] uh page 4
[1538.6s] and page
[1542.1s] 470, ministry of healing, page 470, the
[1545.8s] servant of God is saying there is an
[1548.8s] eloquence far more powerful than the
[1553.3s] eloquence of
[1556.0s] words in the
[1558.0s] quiet
[1559.9s] consistent life of a
[1563.5s] pure true
[1565.7s] Christian there is a
[1568.4s] change you can
[1570.9s] do which is very powerful more powerful
[1574.1s] than
[1575.3s] words. What is that? It is an eloquence
[1581.2s] of
[1583.2s] quiet consistent life of a pure and a
[1589.8s] true
[1591.2s] Christian. Before we finish
[1594.0s] it, God is looking for a youth who loves
[1599.4s] to live a pure
[1601.6s] life, who wants to be a true
[1605.1s] Christian, seeking forever to follow
[1608.4s] Christ. You see it proceeds by saying
[1612.0s] the officers who went to Jesus, this is
[1615.6s] a a comment from from the book of John
[1620.4s] 7:46 and 47. It says the officers who
[1626.1s] went who were sent to Jesus came back
[1630.2s] with a report that
[1634.8s] never man spoke as he spoke.
[1640.3s] But the reason for this was that never
[1647.6s] man lived as he
[1652.8s] lived. Underline that
[1655.9s] statement. The Bible is saying never man
[1659.0s] spoke like Jesus spoke. There were some
[1661.4s] officers who were sent to go and arrest
[1663.8s] Jesus. Then as they were there, Christ
[1668.6s] preached and taught. Then they were
[1672.1s] afraid of him. How can we arrest this
[1674.2s] holy man? Then when he came back to the
[1677.4s] Pharisees, they asked him, "Why have you
[1679.5s] not brought him?" Their answer was,
[1682.8s] "Never a man spoke like this man spoke.
[1686.9s] We could not arrest him." But why were
[1689.6s] his speeches very powerful?
[1693.7s] Because never a man lived as he
[1699.0s] lived. His life was
[1702.0s] powerful, making much power in what he
[1705.5s] was doing. Had his life been other than
[1709.9s] it was, he could not have spoken as he
[1713.6s] did. His words bore with them a
[1717.5s] convincing
[1719.1s] power because they came from a heart
[1722.6s] pure and holy. A heart which is
[1727.5s] what? Pure and holy, full of love and
[1733.2s] sympathy,
[1734.8s] benevolence and truth. Thank you so
[1738.6s] much. When we look at verse
[1742.2s] 16, verse 16 of Matthew 5, our text,
[1747.8s] Matthew
[1751.3s] 5:16, remember Christ had just told us
[1755.7s] that you are the light of the world. Now
[1760.2s] verse 16 it is saying let your light so
[1765.9s] shine before men that they may see your
[1769.8s] good works and glorify your father who
[1773.5s] is in heaven. I want you to get I know
[1779.4s] you always love this
[1781.2s] text
[1782.9s] but what is Christ saying here? Christ
[1787.0s] is
[1788.8s] saying your light cannot be hidden.
[1792.4s] Raise your Christian character up
[1795.9s] there. Let your Christian
[1799.7s] beliefs be shining up
[1803.0s] there. Let your Christian behavior be up
[1809.3s] there because you are a light that has
[1812.6s] been lighted by him. So Christ is saying
[1816.9s] I have put you on a
[1820.2s] lampstand that evil men may be able to
[1823.2s] see
[1825.0s] you. Christ is
[1827.9s] saying I have rest my servant that is
[1834.4s] holy. I want to place him somewhere. I
[1838.8s] want to place her somewhere that the
[1841.7s] world may be able to see what Christ can
[1844.9s] do in a person's character. How Christ
[1848.1s] can change a youth's character. That
[1850.8s] there can be youths who can be faithful
[1854.4s] today with this age in this age of
[1858.7s] technology. I can still raise a youth
[1862.1s] who is faithful.
[1865.0s] God is asking that and he's
[1868.5s] saying and when you become
[1871.6s] faithful do not try to hide your
[1874.6s] faithfulness so that people cannot see
[1877.1s] your your Christian character. Your
[1880.1s] Christian character is what I need.
[1883.0s] Raise it up so that they may see a
[1886.5s] Christian character and they will
[1889.1s] glorify your father who is in heaven.
[1895.2s] What is this text saying? By the way, I
[1898.4s] feel it is
[1900.8s] saying that if you are a
[1904.6s] Christian and you are not
[1909.3s] stealing, let people see that you're not
[1912.8s] stealing. Let people see that you are a
[1915.9s] Christian and that is why you are not
[1918.2s] stealing. so that they can glorify God
[1921.0s] that even today there are people who are
[1924.6s] faithful. If you are a youth who have
[1927.2s] been blessed and is not committing
[1930.0s] adultery, raise it up. Let your
[1932.6s] character be known, be seen, so that
[1935.8s] they may see your good
[1939.9s] character. And your fellow peers will
[1943.7s] see you and they will marvel and they
[1948.0s] will say, "Even in the world today,
[1951.6s] there are youth who dress well." Even in
[1955.4s] the world today, there are youth who
[1958.3s] take care of their body. Even in the
[1961.3s] world today there are men who are not
[1964.7s] having any multiple
[1967.2s] spouses in the
[1969.4s] darkness. Rest it that they may see your
[1973.0s] good
[1975.8s] works. They may say that even today
[1978.5s] there are women who are like
[1980.9s] Sahara who took care of their
[1984.2s] families. Rest that character that it
[1987.0s] can be
[1989.8s] seen. What is that verse saying? So that
[1993.4s] they may see
[1995.4s] what your good
[1998.0s] works. so that they may be able to
[2001.8s] glorify your
[2004.7s] father who is in
[2009.2s] heaven. You know today it is not
[2014.9s] that men must have
[2019.3s] a extraarital affairs they do call it.
[2024.2s] Young people today cannot be
[2026.4s] faithful and we some of us we we are
[2029.8s] very confident you will be faithful when
[2032.0s] you become
[2034.8s] old. The Bible
[2038.1s] says when you are faithful in little
[2042.0s] things you will be faithful in big
[2046.2s] things. When you become faithful to God
[2050.0s] today, you will become faithful to God
[2053.6s] when you are old. Be faithful to God
[2057.4s] today. The Lord is looking for
[2060.4s] Christians who are standing
[2064.6s] firm, who are exhibiting the character
[2067.9s] of Christ that we may be able to express
[2071.3s] to the world what it
[2074.0s] means to be saved.
[2077.5s] By the way, I think I came to
[2080.8s] church before I was
[2084.8s] saved. And it took me some time to be
[2088.5s] saved until I saw a fellow some fellow
[2092.0s] youths, my friends, who were
[2094.9s] saved. And I confirmed that the Bible is
[2099.4s] true because youths can be saved.
[2104.0s] I confirmed the Bible is true because I
[2107.9s] have seen someone who is
[2110.1s] saved. Let your light soul shine that
[2114.6s] people around you may see and they will
[2118.1s] glorify your father who is in
[2120.2s] heaven. You may be very beautiful by the
[2123.6s] way,
[2125.4s] but you are worth
[2128.8s] nothing if not in Christ.
[2132.8s] You may be very
[2134.8s] handsome but is
[2141.2s] worthless can be trampled
[2144.4s] underfoot.
[2146.0s] Why? Because you have no light at
[2150.3s] all. By the way, you can be a very
[2152.9s] blessed
[2154.2s] man, blessed with
[2156.9s] things, but if you don't raise that
[2159.8s] character
[2161.2s] high, it is useless to the church of
[2165.2s] God.
[2169.6s] Finally,
[2172.4s] the our
[2175.4s] savior is looking for some light in us.
[2178.6s] What is the use of light?
[2181.1s] Light is to give us direction when there
[2184.9s] is
[2185.8s] darkness. When there are many people who
[2188.4s] are lost in sin, many people who are
[2192.4s] entangled in the world, they are looking
[2195.8s] to see a light that is leading to the
[2198.6s] right
[2199.4s] path. Be a light that is directing
[2202.6s] people home.
[2204.5s] There are many who needs their to see
[2206.7s] their direction home. But they can't see
[2210.2s] because there is darkness. They need a
[2213.8s] light that can lead them
[2215.9s] home. Be a light that is leading friends
[2220.2s] home. Many people want to reach home but
[2223.4s] they don't know the way that can be able
[2226.2s] to lead them home.
[2228.2s] Your
[2229.3s] consistent pure life will be able to
[2232.8s] lead many to see where home is. Home is
[2237.0s] good. Home will take care of us. Home
[2240.2s] will comfort us. Your consistent life
[2244.5s] will take people home. I pray that may
[2250.0s] ambassadors come forward. We want to
[2252.7s] pray for ambassadors. We want to commit
[2255.8s] them to God. I want also to commit even
[2259.8s] teens please come forward ambassadors I
[2263.2s] mean not the people who sang here if you
[2265.7s] inside the church coristers are coming
[2268.1s] if you are inside the church and you
[2270.8s] know at least you are between the age of
[2274.3s] 15 and
[2276.1s] 21 or you are teen please come
[2280.7s] forward just come forward we want to
[2283.3s] pray for you come forward here we want
[2286.6s] to commit you in the hands of the Lord
[2290.0s] that you may
[2291.5s] live for an impact.
[2294.8s] Coristas please let us be singing as
[2296.7s] they
