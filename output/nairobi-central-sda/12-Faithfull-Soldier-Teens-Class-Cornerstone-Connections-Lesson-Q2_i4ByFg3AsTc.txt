FULL TRANSCRIPT:
Hi everyone. Welcome to Cornerstone Connections. This is lesson 12. My name is Shani and I'm going to be doing the mission reading. Um, our story comes from the Philippines and the title is Scratch, Scratch, Scratch. It's about a little boy. Little boy felt so sad. His hands itched, his feet itched, and he did not know what to do to make the itching go away. Little boy and his family lived far away from any hospital. They lived far away from any doctors and nurses. They lived in a village high up the mountains of the Philippines. And the other boys and girls in this village also had itchy hands and itchy feet. No one knew what to do about it. Then one day, two young women came into the village. Little boy heard them say that they were missionaries from far away. He heard them say that they would live for a year in his village. And then one of them looked directly at him and invited him to hear stories about God. Um, come to the mountain river that flows beside the village and be sure to invite your friends, she said with a bright smile. Before long, little boy and a dozen other children were sitting on the rocky bank of the river with the two missionaries. The little boy listened with interest as one missionary opened a book with colorful pictures and began to read a story about God. But then his hand began to itch. He scratched it. His foot began to itch and he scratched it too. Then his other hand and other foot itched and he scratched them. The other children also felt itchy and they all scratched and scratched and scratched. It was really hard to listen to the story about God while they were scratching. The missionaries noticed the children were distracted by their itches and they looked closely at their hands and feet. I have an idea, said one of the missionaries. I saw a similar rush when I was a small girl in my village. We boiled guava leaves in water and then bathed our hands and feet in the water. Let's try it here. So the two missionaries asked the children if they had guava leaves in the village. So the little boy eagerly pointed out a guava tree. The missionaries picked leaves and told the children to fetch basins or buckets or bowls at home. The little boy scampered off. When he returned, he found the missionaries boiling guava leaves in a large pot of water. Then the missionaries removed the pot from the fire and waited for the water to cool down. While they waited, the missionaries taught the kids happy songs about God. Then the missionaries poured water into the children's basins and buckets and bowls. Let's pray to God for help. One said the other showed the children how to close their eyes and fold their hands. She prayed, "Dear God, please heal these children in Jesus name. Amen." The little boy and the other children put their hands into the containers and waited 20 minutes. Then they changed the water and put their feet in the containers and waited another 20 minutes. The time flew by as they sang merrily about God. Every day after that, the missionaries boiled leaves, prayed, and bathed the children's hands and feet. They showed all the mommies how to do the same. After two weeks, the white bumps left the children's hands and feet, and everyone was so happy. Then the missionaries invited the children to come back to the riverbank to hear stories about God. And the little boy went. Now he could listen attentively because there was he was no longer distracted by the itchy hands and feet. He wanted to know more about God who had heard the missionaries prayers and healed him. The two young women who helped the little boy were trained to become missionaries at a center built with help of a 13th Sabbath offering in 1986. Thank you for planning a generous 13th Sabbath offering on June 28th that will help more children know about Jesus in Asia. Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat. Good afternoon, good morning and good evening my fellow friends and my fellow young people and from whichever part of this uh world you're tuning in from. Um my name is Kevin and I'll be the one who will be taking you through today's lesson. But even as before we start, I would want to request my fellow panelists to also introduce themselves starting from my farthest right. Hello everyone, my name is Silas. Hi everyone, my name is Natasha. Yeah. So today's lesson is entitled Faithful Soldier. And just before we dulge into the same I would want to request Natasha to pray with us so that we can start. Let's pray. Our de heavenly father, we come before you this day thanking you for your goodness and your mercies. They endure forever once again. And as we're about to start the lesson, may you be with us, guide us, and help us understand your word. In Jesus name I pray, trusting and believing. Amen. Amen. Yeah. So, um, this quarter has been a very interesting quarter because it it had actually has had lots of good lessons. We've learned so many stories from the Bible that has have actually been able to build us and today we once again come back to faith the aspect of faith and possibly the question is what is faith and and you know maybe most of us just know faith from what it is written in the Bible like I think maybe Natasha you could read for us Hebrews 11:1 or you could just tell us I think or any of us who has Hebrews 11:1 opened can read it because maybe that's the best version of faith that we know so that we can get to understand from today's lesson what really is faith. Yeah. So anyone who is able to open can do so. Yeah. As they open we will also be having Matthew 8:10. I think someone will open that one after Hebrews 11. Yeah. So say you can read it for us and uh you can open Matthew chapter 8 and 10. So anyone who has opened uh Hebrew I have Matthew 8:10. Okay you can start with Matthew then we go to fa Hebrews. Uh Matthew 8:10 says, "When Jesus heard this, he was amazed and said to those uh following him, truly I tell you, I have not found anyone in Israel with such great faith." Amen. Yes. Hebrews 11:1 says, "Now faith is the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen." Yes. And truly this definition of faith is reflected in today's lesson. Today's lesson we speaking about the centurion and as the story turns out Christ said and affirmed that he has not seen such faith in Israel. And as we get to learn about today's lesson about the faithful soldier that is a centurion who said say it and it shall be done. We get to learn one of the points that has been written in our guide today in our lesson today that Jesus never missed a teachable moment. He was always clued in the needs of those who came to him and he never missed a chance to help them grow. So in today's lesson we are trying to find out of how he was able to reach out to the people in need and in the process teaching his followers of how to go about and how to live and and we also learned that from the centurion servant. you know, it's just more of an introduction to the lesson from the centurion servant and and the aspect of a person in authority who had so much faith that he trusted that by God's or by Christ's word, his servant will be healed. We get to learn that this is the faith that we need to exhibit as Christians. So the question I'm asking to you my fellow friend my fellow learner and my fellow viewer do you have the faith that a centurion had and maybe maybe ask one of us what is faith really according to you before we get into the lesson maybe I can come to seed what what what is faith what do you understand faith I mean I'm sure you've interacted with a number of things in your class as you study or maybe as you go about your engagements even when you at home. What What is faith? What do you understand faith to be? Um I'd say faith is um being able to believe in something even without having seen it. Um like the way we we we have faith in God even though we haven't seen him. Uh I feel like that's what I would define faith as. Yeah, thank you. What about you, Natasha? Well, I agree with Sid. For me also, faith is believing in something without necessarily seeing it. And that's what happened with this case. And if you get back to two lessons back, there was a lesson that was entitled seeing is believing of still this um servant who went and whose son was unwell who went to see Christ and and just by him you know he you know when Christ was trying to echo saying that some of these things we can't believe unless you see them but that story actually two weeks past this lesson he when when he was told by Christ that your servant shall be well or your son shall be well and he went back you know I think in his mind he wasn't certain whether he was he was well but when he was going back he met with a servant who was working for the son and he was told my friend what the son has gotten well your son has gotten when he asked what time did he get well at 1 p.m. and and when when when when actually was trying to look back that is a time Christ told him that your son shall be well. So I think today's story also trying to affirms that having faith in God really is important in our lives. So I think I would want to request one of us to take us through what do you think session so that we can get to find out about a few things and maybe maybe one or two of them at least ask us a few question so that even as you continue with today's lesson. So welcome Uh the what do you think section is about think of a moment about the power entrusted to the president of the United States by the constitution below is is a list of statements about the president's power right true or false next to each statement depending on whether you think the president has that power or not so the first one is declare war on any other nation without to reaching the approval of the US Congress or the second is designate certain parts of the country as national park reserves. Three, go anywhere in America they wish and at any time including their home. Four, veto bills and that they do not agree with and the veto that can never be overturned. Five is choose to disregard a law if they don't agree with it. Sid, what do you think? Um, I think the third one is false and the first one is false and then I think two um two and four are true. So 1, three and five are false and then two and four are true. Okay. What about you, Natasha? Um the first one that I I see is number three, which I can say is false. Then number five is false. Um, for number one, I would say I'm not so sure honestly, but I think it's false. For number two and number four, I I think they're true, but I'm not completely sure. Okay. Okay. Interesting. And thank you for that. I think for me I'll I'll possibly just speak about just pick one of the statements. You know the question is very simple. Think of a moment about the power entrusted to the president of the United States by the constitution. So below a list of statements about the president's power. So write true or false next to each statement depending on whether you think the president has the power or not. So I think I'll specifically address item number three. go anywhere in America they wish and at any time include in your home. I definitely want to think that's a false one because um I think I've watched some videos on YouTube. I think this was a certain um YouTube host who opted to host um Obama at at White House and and that was for was it for a cup of coffee and a cup of tea? And so the plan was so this guy has this you know classical cars. So the plan was for this specific um YouTube personality to take Obama around White House and maybe outside of White House. And I do remember in you know you know when you seated with the president alone you driving the president around the White House. It actually feels comfortable that you entrusted to be with the president. Of course the security may have been watching from a distance or from within but when they went to the gate for the first time and he was like hey can I take the president out of white house and show him around it was a live kind of a session and he was like no. So they went back had they were prepared somewhere. They had coffee and tea within the White House, you know, and um I bet as you having their meeting there were other secretaries and and secret service watching from afar and they came at the end of the show for the second time and and they were like Obama the president is the one who went and said to the gate manag guy allow this guy to take me around and he was like no. So I think possibly whether as a president of the United States then you don't have the private authority to just say things there must be approval. So that means he cannot just come to your house if you're in the US or he can't just come and visit they need to check the security status they need to confirm that they know you very well your record is clean and all these things so I think that's why even in white house itself they still have security and outside. So I think I would disagree and maybe as we go on I would want to invite our sister to just in a one or two or three statements tell us more about the story. You know today's story comes from uh for our viewer today's story comes from Matthew 8 from verse 5-13. Equally you can also get it from Matthew 12 22 to 28 and Luke 7 from verse 1 to verse 7. and the focus is on centurion. So maybe you can tell us more about it. Well, basically the story starts when Jesus enters Capernam and and a centurion whose servant was sick and the centurion valued highly valued the servant. So he sent some elders of the Jews to go and get Jesus to come and heal his servant. So he was not far from the house when the centurion sent friends to say to him, "Lord, don't trouble yourself for I do not deserve to have you come over under my roof." That is why I did not even consider myself worthy to come to you. But say the word and my servant will be healed. For I myself am a man under authority with soldiers under me. I tell this one, "Go," and he goes, and that one, "Come," and he comes. I say to my servant, "Do this." And he does it. Well, when Jesus heard this, he turned to the crowd following him. And he said to them that, "I tell you, I have not found such great faith even in Israel." Then the men who had been sent returned to the house and found the servant well. Then eventually later they brought a demon-possessed man was brought to Jesus and he was demonp possessed and was also blind and mute and wanted Jesus to heal him so that he could talk. He could both talk and see. When he did this, all the people were astonished and said, "Could this be the son of David?" But on the second last paragraph you see, but when the Pharisees heard this, they said, "It is only by Belel the prince of demons that he this fellow drives out demons." So Jesus knew their thoughts and say to them, "Every kingdom divided against divided against himself will be ruined and every city or household divided against itself will not stand. If Satan drives out Satan, he is divided against himself. How then can this can his kingdom stand? And if I drive out demons by Belel, by whom do your people drive them out, so then they will be your judges? But if it is by the spirit of God that I drive out demons, then the kingdom of God has come upon you. Yeah. Thank you very much. So maybe what is one lesson that you get to learn from the centurion? What is something that as a young person that you get to learn? Because you know you have you've as you speak have already experienced a few challenges and a few good things in life. So what does that teach you? Well, for me basically from the story of the centurusion, I would say what I learned is that you can have that faith that what you want, you will get it. And well, from my own personal experience, I will say that there's one time I wanted something. I wasn't sure if I'll get it. But eventually as time went by I was sure that I will get it and I continue praying honestly and eventually I got what I had wanted at that time. So I will say what I learned from this story is we should have faith in God that he will do for us what we we see we can do ourselves. Yeah. Thank you. So I think as we continue to think about the story including the one whereby um the Pharisees were accusing Christ of being a devil worshipper because in the story of the demon-possessed man still in our lesson we see the Pharisees accuse Christ of being a devil worshipper and actually Christ took it as an opportunity to answer his critics with logic of what he could not refute. And in every act of mercy performed by Christ, he looked for opportunities to make his people better followers of himself. So that is one thing we get to learn from Christ that when they accused him, he didn't go arguing with them, but he took it as an opportunity to get to make them more understand more about him. So I think as I come to my brother Sid maybe you can tell us something about what the spirit of prophecy speaks about you know cuz I think today's lesson comes from uh the dissolve of ages chapters 32 and 33. Possibly you can give us a highlight of what it gives us about today's story. um the desire of ages. Um chapter 32 and 33 is talking about the the encounter the encounter with the centurion. The encounter Christ had with the centurion. I'll read paragraph 316. It says the Jewish leaders who recommended the centurion to Christ had shown how far they were from possessing the spirit of the gospel. They do not recognize that our need that our great need is our only claim on God's mercy. In their selfrighteousness, they commended the centurion because of the favor he had shown to our nation. But the centurion said of himself, "I am not worthy." His heart had been touched by the grace of Christ. Um this paragraph uh I think ties very well with with the title of today's story. It shows how how much faith the the commander centurion is by Oxford definition uh centurion is a commander of an army. Let me find the definition. A centurion is an officer uh in the ancient Roman army who commanded a group of soldiers typically 100 men. So this this centurion shows with how much power he had. Mhm. He still uh acknowledged the power of God, the power of Jesus Christ, which shows how much faith that he had. Amen. And thank you. And maybe the question that I'm to ask you, are we just to have faith for the sake of faith? And possibly with a certain illustration in our lesson, maybe my brother can can just illustrate more. Are we just to have faith for the sake of faith or are we to have faith somewhere maybe? Okay. So, uh in the lesson there's an illustration of a man in April 1988. He was a reporter and a photographer. So, he went on a skydiving trip with fellow skydivers and he was taking photos and videos and people were saying that he's going to die because he didn't carry his parachute. And he was the the the dive was fun until when the last guy was pulling his parachute and he was taking the final video, he realized that he did not carry his parachute when he was leaving the plane and he was just free falling all this while. So at that moment because he had faith in his parachute, he he panicked and he he died. And the question is who what what do we put our faith in? Is it the parachute like this reporter who jumped from the plane without his parachute or do we put our faith in Jesus Christ to carry us through all life's challenges? Amen. Amen. Natasha, what do you think? Should we just put our faith in people randomly? Should we just put our faith in maybe let's say you're mathematics teacher or possibly you get to campus maybe let's say you are economics teacher or who are we to be to put our faith to even as you wind up well basically I think we should put our faith in God but also at the same time faith without action is dead let's say with the par with the the man he had faith in his parachute But the action was actually carrying the parachute. He forgot the parachute and that's why he died. So yes, we should have faith in God in everything that we do. But just not it's not just having faith and just sitting there. You have faith and also you do something. Yeah. Yeah. Thank you. And I think from today's lesson we get to learn that Christ spent most of his time not somewhere preaching or evangelizing but he spent most of his time meeting the needs of people. We also get to learn that by by way we have actually been able to tell like from the past two lessons and the lessons ahead and the one that have been there in the past that Christ spent most of his time reaching out to the people in need like he was he was reaching out to the centurion then this he and that's how he he got a chance to go and and and heal the servant and equally even with the demon possessed man and and many other situations. So that is actually something I want to challenge each one of us that instead of just spending time maybe possibly in our you know you know it's good to be in church you know occasionally it's good to be in church maybe through this month and another month but today's challenge is that we also need to spend time out there evangelizing reaching out to the needs of people and above all even being of impact like what you did at the global youth day it was a community transformed so in our transforming our communities We were able to go to children's home. We were able to go to hospitals. We were able to donate blood. And that is the lifestyle you are being called upon to do each and every other day. Not only on Sabbaths, not only on the over the weekends, but even at our workplaces. We reach to their needs. When someone is sick, we don't have to wait for them to get to maybe Saturday so that we bring them to church to be prayed for. We can pray with them, pray for them, and take them to receive care. So, I think that's what we've called upon. So, Sid, what do you think about that? How how should we as young people spend our time, you know, beyond coming to church? How should we spend our time to reach out to those who need us most, to reach out to those who don't have food, reach out to those who above all need our help? Um I think with today's um technological advancements, I believe we could not only um raise funds online for let's say charity organizations that help people with food. We could also uh spread God's word online like we are doing now. And that's I believe will go a very long way with helping people. Very true. I think there's a song hack the voice of Jesus is calling and let him hear no one say there there's nothing they can do. So in whichever small way you can be able go and reach out go forth and spread the gospel. So I would want to request um my brother to to read one of the punchlines maybe a punch line of your choice and possibly maybe a closing remark. Maybe yeah just can read any punch line that you love and then maybe a closing remark. I will read uh Galatians 6:2. Carry each other's burdens and in this way you will fulfill the law of Christ. So we are told to help others in their challenges and that is the law of Christ we'll be following. Yeah. Amen. And thank you for that. Natasha, maybe you can take us through the further insight and and and a closing remark. Okay. The father insight we get it from the desire of ages page 321 and also steps to Christ page 54. So des says he who rejects the work of the Holy Spirit is placing himself where re repentance and faith cannot come to him. Steps of steps to Christ says look up you that are doubting and trembling for Jesus lives to make intercession for us. The spirit invites you today come with your whole heart to Jesus and may claim his blessing. Basically what I'm I'm drawing from the illustration is that Jesus is calling us back to him. No matter Okay. Okay. Take it back to the story to the parable of the mustard seed that no matter how little your faith is, Jesus still wants you to come to him and he will give you we come with your whole heart and claim his blessings. Amen. And thank you. And lastly, maybe you can take us through the did you know section. I think I've seen it's a very interesting story about the centurions and then maybe give a closing word of remark. Um the did you know section says did you know that uh outstanding Roman soldiers called centurions were given this title because they commanded a a century a legion of 100 soldiers or so. Centurions would be the equivalent of today's captains or lieutenants. They often fought alongside their soldiers leading them uh from the front into into battle. According to a study light according to a study.org Bible encyclopedia, centurions are responsible for drilling them and inspecting their arms, food, clothing, and commanding them in battle. The Romans believed that if they had strong brave centurions, their military would be almost invincible and for hundreds of years they were. Uh a closing mark I'd give I just like to to repeat what Natasha had said. Faith without action is dead. So you cannot believe that something will happen and then you don't put any effort into it and expect it to happen. It's like wanting to pass an exam. You believe that God will help you pass the exam, but you don't study. It's it doesn't it doesn't really work like that. Yeah, that's that's what I would say. Thank you very much. And my closing remark will come from Hebrews 1 16. And without faith, it is impossible to please God because anyone who comes to him must believe that he exists and that he rewards those who honestly seek him. And lastly and not the least, the other one is just to challenge us to have that faith of the centurion. That faith that you can say this is it that Christ can tell you of what you need to do and you follow it. That faith to believe that yes I can be healed and truly I can be healed. So my challenge to you my viewer is that you have a look exercise your faith. Have faith that is grounded on Christ because faith in any other thing on other substances and moreo without action will take you nowhere. So I want to thank you for having been part of us. I urge you to go through the lesson more and more. To my dear panelists, thank you very much and may God bless each one of us even as we foresee the next lesson and even as we go through the next week. So I want us to close with a word of prayer and uh let me request all of us to bon even as we pray. Our father who art in heaven, we come before this time. We want to thank you that you've led us through that you've guided us through God. We've been discussing about faith. We've been discussing about the centurion. We've also learned about the demon possessed man. All we are asking from you Jehovah is that you guide us that you may have faith and not only faith in any grounds but faith in you. Faith that you can trust that even as you pursue our studies, even as you work, even as you look for jobs and opportunities out there as young people that you can keep on trusting in you, God. But you've also challenged us that we must know that faith without action is dead. So God we are asking that as a four of us and those who will watch this many days, many months or years from now that they may have trust God that by trusting in you by exercising their faith in you and by taking action that indeed you'll continue blessing them. We want to thank you and we pray that you may lead us for the for the coming week. Until we meet again in the next lesson, we appreciate you and we thank you and in Jesus name we pray and believe in. Amen.

TIMESTAMPED TRANSCRIPT:
[0.1s] Hi everyone. Welcome to Cornerstone
[2.2s] Connections. This is lesson 12. My name
[4.4s] is Shani and I'm going to be doing the
[6.0s] mission reading. Um, our story comes
[8.4s] from the Philippines and the title is
[10.3s] Scratch, Scratch, Scratch. It's about a
[12.5s] little boy. Little boy felt so sad. His
[15.8s] hands itched, his feet itched, and he
[17.8s] did not know what to do to make the
[19.2s] itching go away. Little boy and his
[21.5s] family lived far away from any hospital.
[23.8s] They lived far away from any doctors and
[25.9s] nurses. They lived in a village high up
[28.1s] the mountains of the Philippines. And
[29.8s] the other boys and girls in this village
[31.8s] also had itchy hands and itchy feet. No
[34.2s] one knew what to do about it. Then one
[36.5s] day, two young women came into the
[38.3s] village. Little boy heard them say that
[40.3s] they were missionaries from far away. He
[42.6s] heard them say that they would live for
[44.2s] a year in his village. And then one of
[46.0s] them looked directly at him and invited
[47.8s] him to hear stories about God.
[50.5s] Um, come to the mountain river that
[52.3s] flows beside the village and be sure to
[54.2s] invite your friends, she said with a
[55.8s] bright smile. Before long, little boy
[58.2s] and a dozen other children were sitting
[59.8s] on the rocky bank of the river with the
[61.9s] two missionaries. The little boy
[63.8s] listened with interest as one missionary
[66.1s] opened a book with colorful pictures and
[68.0s] began to read a story about God. But
[70.5s] then his hand began to itch. He
[72.4s] scratched it. His foot began to itch and
[74.9s] he scratched it too. Then his other hand
[77.1s] and other foot itched and he scratched
[79.0s] them. The other children also felt itchy
[81.2s] and they all scratched and scratched and
[82.9s] scratched. It was really hard to listen
[84.8s] to the story about God while they were
[86.2s] scratching.
[87.8s] The missionaries noticed the children
[89.4s] were distracted by their itches and they
[91.4s] looked closely at their hands and feet.
[93.5s] I have an idea, said one of the
[95.0s] missionaries. I saw a similar rush when
[97.3s] I was a small girl in my village. We
[99.3s] boiled guava leaves in water and then
[101.8s] bathed our hands and feet in the water.
[103.8s] Let's try it here. So the two
[105.8s] missionaries asked the children if they
[107.4s] had guava leaves in the village. So the
[109.4s] little boy eagerly pointed out a guava
[111.8s] tree. The missionaries picked leaves and
[113.9s] told the children to fetch basins or
[115.6s] buckets or bowls at home. The little boy
[117.8s] scampered off. When he returned, he
[120.2s] found the missionaries boiling guava
[121.8s] leaves in a large pot of water. Then the
[124.2s] missionaries removed the pot from the
[125.9s] fire and waited for the water to cool
[128.0s] down. While they waited, the
[129.5s] missionaries taught the kids happy songs
[132.3s] about God. Then the missionaries poured
[134.7s] water into the children's basins and
[136.2s] buckets and bowls. Let's pray to God for
[138.6s] help. One said the other showed the
[140.7s] children how to close their eyes and
[142.2s] fold their hands. She prayed, "Dear God,
[144.7s] please heal these children in Jesus
[146.5s] name. Amen." The little boy and the
[148.8s] other children put their hands into the
[150.9s] containers and waited 20 minutes. Then
[153.1s] they changed the water and put their
[154.5s] feet in the containers and waited
[156.3s] another 20 minutes. The time flew by as
[158.8s] they sang merrily about God. Every day
[161.3s] after that, the missionaries boiled
[163.0s] leaves, prayed, and bathed the
[164.6s] children's hands and feet. They showed
[166.8s] all the mommies how to do the same.
[169.0s] After two weeks, the white bumps left
[170.6s] the children's hands and feet, and
[172.1s] everyone was so happy. Then the
[174.2s] missionaries invited the children to
[175.8s] come back to the riverbank to hear
[177.3s] stories about God. And the little boy
[179.4s] went. Now he could listen attentively
[181.5s] because there was he was no longer
[182.9s] distracted by the itchy hands and feet.
[185.1s] He wanted to know more about God who had
[187.7s] heard the missionaries prayers and
[189.3s] healed him.
[191.2s] The two young women who helped the
[192.7s] little boy were trained to become
[193.9s] missionaries at a center built with help
[196.2s] of a 13th Sabbath offering in 1986.
[199.4s] Thank you for planning a generous 13th
[201.2s] Sabbath offering on June 28th that will
[203.5s] help more children know about Jesus in
[205.4s] Asia.

[329.3s] Heat. Heat.
[350.6s] Heat. Heat.
[381.1s] Good afternoon, good morning and good
[383.3s] evening my fellow friends and my fellow
[386.3s] young people and from whichever part of
[389.3s] this uh world you're tuning in from. Um
[392.9s] my name is Kevin and I'll be the one who
[395.8s] will be taking you through today's
[397.2s] lesson. But even as before we start, I
[400.2s] would want to request my fellow
[402.2s] panelists to also introduce themselves
[404.8s] starting from my farthest right. Hello
[407.8s] everyone, my name is Silas.
[411.3s] Hi everyone, my name is Natasha. Yeah.
[414.0s] So today's lesson is entitled Faithful
[417.0s] Soldier. And just before we dulge into
[420.4s] the same I would want to request Natasha
[422.6s] to pray with us so that we can start.
[425.3s] Let's pray. Our de heavenly father, we
[428.1s] come before you this day thanking you
[430.2s] for your goodness and your mercies. They
[431.7s] endure forever once again. And as we're
[434.2s] about to start the lesson, may you be
[435.8s] with us, guide us, and help us
[437.6s] understand your word. In Jesus name I
[439.4s] pray, trusting and believing. Amen.
[441.3s] Amen. Yeah. So, um, this quarter has
[445.8s] been a very interesting quarter because
[447.8s] it it had actually has had lots of good
[452.3s] lessons. We've learned so many stories
[455.0s] from the Bible that has have actually
[457.0s] been able to build us and today we once
[459.5s] again come back to faith the aspect of
[462.0s] faith and possibly the question is what
[465.0s] is faith and and you know maybe most of
[467.8s] us just know faith from what it is
[470.6s] written in the Bible like I think maybe
[473.1s] Natasha you could read for us Hebrews
[476.2s] 11:1 or you could just tell us I think
[479.1s] or any of us who has Hebrews 11:1 opened
[482.1s] can read it because maybe that's the
[484.5s] best version of faith that we know so
[486.7s] that we can get to understand from
[488.3s] today's lesson what really is faith.
[491.3s] Yeah. So anyone who is able to open can
[493.8s] do so. Yeah. As they open
[496.9s] we will also be having Matthew 8:10. I
[499.9s] think someone will open that one after
[501.9s] Hebrews 11.
[505.0s] Yeah. So say you can read it for us
[510.7s] and uh you can open Matthew chapter 8
[514.0s] and 10.
[516.7s] So anyone who has opened
[519.6s] uh Hebrew I have Matthew 8:10. Okay you
[523.2s] can start with Matthew then we go to fa
[525.3s] Hebrews. Uh Matthew 8:10 says, "When
[528.5s] Jesus heard this, he was amazed and said
[531.8s] to those uh following him, truly I tell
[534.6s] you, I have not found anyone in Israel
[538.1s] with such great faith." Amen. Yes.
[542.2s] Hebrews 11:1 says, "Now faith is the
[545.4s] substance of things hoped for, the
[548.1s] evidence of things not seen." Yes. And
[550.8s] truly this definition of faith is
[553.4s] reflected in today's lesson. Today's
[555.8s] lesson we speaking about the centurion
[559.7s] and as the story turns out Christ said
[563.1s] and affirmed that he has not seen such
[565.8s] faith in Israel. And as we get to learn
[568.4s] about today's lesson about the faithful
[571.8s] soldier that is a centurion who said say
[574.2s] it and it shall be done. We get to learn
[576.8s] one of the points that has been written
[578.4s] in our guide today in our lesson today
[580.2s] that Jesus never missed a teachable
[583.2s] moment. He was always clued in the needs
[585.8s] of those who came to him and he never
[588.0s] missed a chance to help them grow. So in
[590.6s] today's lesson we are trying to find out
[592.8s] of how he was able to reach out to the
[595.3s] people in need and in the process
[597.4s] teaching his followers of how to go
[599.4s] about and how to live and and we also
[602.5s] learned that from the centurion servant.
[604.5s] you know, it's just more of an
[605.8s] introduction to the lesson from the
[607.4s] centurion servant and and the aspect of
[611.1s] a person in authority who had so much
[613.8s] faith that he trusted that by God's or
[617.6s] by Christ's word, his servant will be
[620.3s] healed. We get to learn that this is the
[622.3s] faith that we need to exhibit as
[624.3s] Christians. So the question I'm asking
[626.6s] to you my fellow friend my fellow
[629.4s] learner and my fellow viewer do you have
[631.8s] the faith that a centurion had and maybe
[635.6s] maybe ask one of us what is faith really
[638.7s] according to you before we get into the
[641.4s] lesson maybe I can come to seed what
[643.4s] what what is faith what do you
[644.8s] understand faith I mean I'm sure you've
[647.4s] interacted with a number of things in
[649.4s] your class as you study or maybe as you
[652.8s] go about your engagements even when you
[655.3s] at home. What What is faith? What do you
[657.4s] understand faith to be?
[660.2s] Um I'd say faith is
[664.0s] um
[666.0s] being able to believe
[668.7s] in something even without having seen
[672.2s] it. Um like the way we
[676.6s] we we have faith in God even though we
[678.9s] haven't seen him. Uh I feel like that's
[682.0s] what I would define faith as. Yeah,
[684.7s] thank you. What about you, Natasha?
[687.9s] Well, I agree with Sid. For me also,
[690.7s] faith is believing in something without
[693.8s] necessarily seeing it. And that's what
[696.6s] happened with this case. And if you get
[698.6s] back to two lessons back, there was a
[701.4s] lesson that was entitled seeing is
[703.4s] believing of still this um servant who
[709.4s] went and whose son was unwell who went
[711.9s] to see Christ and and just by him you
[715.2s] know he you know when Christ was trying
[717.1s] to echo saying that some of these things
[718.8s] we can't believe unless you see them but
[721.0s] that story actually two weeks past this
[723.3s] lesson he when when he was told by
[725.9s] Christ that your servant shall be well
[727.4s] or your son shall be well and he went
[729.8s] back you know I think in his mind he
[732.5s] wasn't certain whether he was he was
[734.2s] well but when he was going back he met
[737.0s] with a servant who was working for the
[739.4s] son and he was told my friend what the
[742.2s] son has gotten well your son has gotten
[744.2s] when he asked what time did he get well
[745.8s] at 1 p.m. and and when when when when
[748.2s] actually was trying to look back that is
[749.8s] a time Christ told him that your son
[751.7s] shall be well. So I think today's story
[754.4s] also trying to affirms that having faith
[756.4s] in God really is important in our lives.
[760.4s] So I think I would want to request one
[762.8s] of us to take us through what do you
[764.5s] think session so that we can get to find
[766.4s] out about a few things and maybe maybe
[769.7s] one or two of them at least ask us a few
[772.0s] question so that even as you continue
[773.8s] with today's lesson. So welcome
[777.0s] Uh the what do you think section is
[779.6s] about
[781.8s] think of a moment about the power
[783.9s] entrusted to the president of the United
[786.0s] States by the constitution below is is a
[789.8s] list of statements about the president's
[792.3s] power right true or false next to each
[796.2s] statement depending on whether you think
[798.2s] the president has that power or not so
[801.8s] the first one is declare war on any
[804.5s] other nation without to reaching the
[806.3s] approval of the US Congress
[809.5s] or the second is designate certain parts
[812.9s] of the country as national park
[815.4s] reserves. Three, go anywhere in America
[819.8s] they wish and at any time including
[823.1s] their home. Four, veto bills and that
[828.7s] they do not agree with and the veto that
[831.1s] can never be overturned.
[834.9s] Five is choose to disregard a law if
[838.5s] they don't agree with it. Sid, what do
[841.5s] you think?
[843.8s] Um, I think the third one is false
[850.2s] and the first one is false
[854.2s] and then I think two
[857.9s] um two and four are true. So
[864.5s] 1,
[866.4s] three and five are false and then two
[868.7s] and four are true.
[870.8s] Okay. What about you, Natasha?
[875.4s] Um the first one that I I see is number
[880.8s] three, which I can say is false. Then
[886.2s] number five is false. Um,
[892.0s] for number one,
[894.3s] I would say
[896.6s] I'm not so sure honestly, but I think
[900.2s] it's false.
[902.6s] For number two
[905.0s] and number four,
[907.8s] I I think they're true, but I'm not
[910.3s] completely sure. Okay. Okay.
[914.2s] Interesting. And thank you for that. I
[915.8s] think for me I'll I'll possibly just
[918.2s] speak about just pick one of the
[919.8s] statements. You know the question is
[921.3s] very simple. Think of a moment about the
[923.6s] power entrusted to the president of the
[925.9s] United States by the constitution. So
[927.9s] below a list of statements about the
[930.1s] president's power. So write true or
[932.3s] false next to each statement depending
[934.8s] on whether you think the president has
[936.5s] the power or not. So I think I'll
[938.7s] specifically
[940.3s] address item number three. go anywhere
[943.1s] in America they wish and at any time
[945.7s] include in your home. I definitely want
[948.4s] to think that's a false one because um I
[952.6s] think I've watched some videos on
[954.1s] YouTube. I think this was a certain um
[957.4s] YouTube host who opted to host um Obama
[962.2s] at at White House and and that was for
[964.3s] was it for a cup of coffee and a cup of
[966.3s] tea? And so the plan was so this guy has
[968.7s] this you know classical cars. So the
[971.0s] plan was for this specific um YouTube
[974.7s] personality to take Obama around White
[977.6s] House and maybe outside of White House.
[979.7s] And I do remember in you know you know
[982.0s] when you seated with the president alone
[984.0s] you driving the president around the
[985.3s] White House. It actually feels
[986.6s] comfortable that you entrusted to be
[988.6s] with the president. Of course the
[989.7s] security may have been watching from a
[991.8s] distance or from within but when they
[994.1s] went to the gate for the first time and
[995.8s] he was like hey can I take the president
[997.7s] out of white house and show him around
[999.6s] it was a live kind of a session and he
[1001.4s] was like no. So they went back had they
[1004.5s] were prepared somewhere. They had coffee
[1006.0s] and tea within the White House, you
[1007.6s] know, and um I bet as you having their
[1009.6s] meeting there were other secretaries and
[1011.0s] and secret service watching from afar
[1013.3s] and they came at the end of the show for
[1015.4s] the second time and and they were like
[1017.4s] Obama the president is the one who went
[1019.2s] and said to the gate manag guy allow
[1021.0s] this guy to take me around and he was
[1022.4s] like no. So I think possibly whether as
[1026.1s] a president of the United States then
[1027.8s] you don't have the private authority to
[1030.3s] just say things there must be approval.
[1033.0s] So that means he cannot just come to
[1035.0s] your house if you're in the US or he
[1037.1s] can't just come and visit they need to
[1038.7s] check the security status they need to
[1041.0s] confirm that they know you very well
[1043.0s] your record is clean and all these
[1044.7s] things so I think that's why even in
[1046.9s] white house itself they still have
[1049.2s] security and outside. So I think I would
[1051.7s] disagree and maybe as we go on I would
[1053.5s] want to invite our sister to just in a
[1057.5s] one or two or three statements tell us
[1059.6s] more about the story. You know today's
[1061.6s] story comes from uh for our viewer
[1064.6s] today's story comes from Matthew
[1067.8s] 8 from verse 5-13. Equally you can also
[1071.2s] get it from Matthew 12 22 to 28 and Luke
[1076.9s] 7 from verse 1 to verse 7. and the focus
[1081.4s] is on centurion. So maybe you can tell
[1084.2s] us more about it.
[1087.0s] Well, basically the story starts when
[1089.5s] Jesus enters Capernam and and a
[1093.8s] centurion whose servant was sick and the
[1097.8s] centurion
[1099.5s] valued highly valued the servant. So he
[1103.2s] sent some elders of the Jews to go and
[1107.2s] get Jesus to come and heal his servant.
[1111.4s] So he was not far from the house when
[1113.5s] the centurion sent friends to say to
[1116.0s] him, "Lord, don't trouble yourself for I
[1119.3s] do not deserve to have you come over
[1121.8s] under my roof." That is why I did not
[1124.7s] even consider myself worthy to come to
[1127.2s] you. But say the word and my servant
[1129.8s] will be healed. For I myself am a man
[1132.9s] under authority with soldiers under me.
[1135.6s] I tell this one, "Go," and he goes, and
[1138.6s] that one, "Come," and he comes. I say to
[1141.8s] my servant, "Do this." And he does it.
[1144.3s] Well, when Jesus heard this, he turned
[1146.6s] to the crowd following him. And he said
[1149.8s] to them that, "I tell you, I have not
[1153.9s] found such great faith even in Israel."
[1156.8s] Then the men who had been sent returned
[1159.2s] to the house and found the servant well.
[1162.6s] Then eventually later they brought a
[1166.4s] demon-possessed man was brought to Jesus
[1169.5s] and he was demonp possessed and was also
[1173.1s] blind and mute and wanted Jesus to heal
[1176.6s] him so that he could talk. He could both
[1179.2s] talk and see. When he did this, all the
[1181.6s] people were astonished and said, "Could
[1183.8s] this be the son of David?" But on the
[1186.6s] second last paragraph you see, but when
[1188.2s] the Pharisees heard this, they said, "It
[1191.0s] is only by Belel
[1195.6s] the prince of demons that he this fellow
[1199.0s] drives out demons." So Jesus knew their
[1201.7s] thoughts and say to them, "Every kingdom
[1204.4s] divided against divided against himself
[1207.4s] will be ruined and every city or
[1209.4s] household divided against itself will
[1212.2s] not stand. If Satan drives out Satan, he
[1215.0s] is divided against himself. How then can
[1219.4s] this can his kingdom stand? And if I
[1222.8s] drive out demons by Belel,
[1225.7s] by whom do your people drive them out,
[1229.6s] so then they will be your judges? But if
[1233.4s] it is by the spirit of God that I drive
[1235.9s] out demons, then the kingdom of God has
[1239.0s] come upon you.
[1241.8s] Yeah. Thank you very much. So maybe what
[1245.2s] is one lesson that you get to learn from
[1247.6s] the centurion? What is something that as
[1251.3s] a young person that you get to learn?
[1253.0s] Because you know you have you've as you
[1256.2s] speak have already experienced a few
[1258.0s] challenges and a few good things in
[1259.9s] life. So what does that teach you?
[1264.2s] Well, for me basically from the story of
[1266.5s] the centurusion, I would say what I
[1268.6s] learned is that
[1271.2s] you can have that faith that what you
[1276.2s] want, you will get it.
[1279.8s] And well, from my own personal
[1282.6s] experience, I will say that there's one
[1285.6s] time I wanted something. I wasn't sure
[1287.9s] if I'll get it. But eventually as time
[1291.1s] went by I was sure that I will get it
[1294.9s] and I continue praying honestly and
[1298.2s] eventually I got what I had wanted at
[1301.9s] that time. So I will say what I learned
[1303.9s] from this story is we should have faith
[1306.6s] in God that he will do for us what we we
[1312.8s] see we can do ourselves. Yeah. Thank
[1315.5s] you. So I think as we continue to think
[1318.0s] about the story including the one
[1320.4s] whereby
[1322.1s] um the Pharisees were accusing Christ of
[1325.2s] being a devil worshipper because in the
[1327.3s] story of the demon-possessed man still
[1329.1s] in our lesson we see the Pharisees
[1331.1s] accuse Christ of being a devil
[1332.5s] worshipper and actually Christ took it
[1335.8s] as an opportunity to answer his critics
[1338.9s] with logic of what he could not refute.
[1342.9s] And in every act of mercy performed by
[1345.0s] Christ, he looked for opportunities to
[1346.9s] make his people better followers of
[1348.5s] himself. So that is one thing we get to
[1350.4s] learn from Christ that when they accused
[1352.4s] him, he didn't go arguing with them, but
[1354.4s] he took it as an opportunity to get to
[1356.7s] make them more understand more about
[1358.2s] him. So I think as I come to my brother
[1360.9s] Sid maybe you can tell us something
[1362.7s] about what the spirit of prophecy speaks
[1365.2s] about you know cuz I think today's
[1367.1s] lesson comes from uh the dissolve of
[1370.2s] ages chapters 32 and 33. Possibly you
[1373.0s] can give us a highlight of what it gives
[1376.3s] us about today's story.
[1379.0s] um the desire of ages.
[1381.9s] Um chapter 32 and 33 is talking about
[1385.3s] the the encounter the encounter with the
[1389.2s] centurion. The encounter Christ had with
[1392.6s] the centurion. I'll read paragraph 316.
[1396.6s] It says the Jewish leaders who
[1398.7s] recommended the centurion to Christ had
[1400.5s] shown how far they were from possessing
[1401.9s] the spirit of the gospel. They do not
[1404.2s] recognize that our need that our great
[1407.0s] need is our only claim on God's mercy.
[1410.0s] In their selfrighteousness, they
[1412.2s] commended the centurion because of the
[1414.0s] favor he had shown to our nation. But
[1416.6s] the centurion said of himself, "I am not
[1419.0s] worthy." His heart had been touched by
[1422.2s] the grace of Christ.
[1424.5s] Um this
[1426.8s] paragraph
[1428.6s] uh I think ties very
[1431.7s] well with with the title of today's
[1434.9s] story. It shows how how much faith the
[1440.2s] the commander centurion is by Oxford
[1444.2s] definition uh centurion is a commander
[1449.0s] of an army.
[1451.6s] Let me find the definition. A centurion
[1454.2s] is an officer
[1457.0s] uh in the ancient Roman army who
[1459.6s] commanded a group of soldiers typically
[1461.9s] 100 men. So this this centurion shows
[1466.5s] with how much power he had. Mhm. He
[1469.2s] still
[1470.7s] uh acknowledged the power of God, the
[1474.3s] power of Jesus Christ, which shows how
[1477.4s] much faith that he had. Amen. And thank
[1481.9s] you. And maybe the question that I'm to
[1485.0s] ask you, are we just to have faith for
[1487.6s] the sake of faith? And possibly with a
[1489.7s] certain illustration in our lesson,
[1491.3s] maybe my brother can can just illustrate
[1494.7s] more. Are we just to have faith for the
[1497.0s] sake of faith or are we to have faith
[1499.8s] somewhere maybe? Okay. So, uh in the
[1503.2s] lesson there's an illustration of a man
[1506.2s] in April 1988.
[1510.2s] He was a reporter and a photographer.
[1513.2s] So, he
[1515.4s] went on a skydiving trip with fellow
[1519.8s] skydivers and
[1522.3s] he was taking photos and videos and
[1525.0s] people were saying that he's going to
[1526.7s] die because he didn't carry his
[1529.0s] parachute. And he was the the the dive
[1533.2s] was fun until when the last guy was
[1536.0s] pulling his parachute and he was taking
[1538.2s] the final video, he realized that he did
[1541.2s] not carry his parachute when he was
[1543.2s] leaving the plane and he was just free
[1545.8s] falling all this while. So at that
[1548.7s] moment because he had faith in his
[1552.8s] parachute,
[1554.9s] he he panicked and
[1558.1s] he he died. And the question is
[1561.9s] who what what do we put our faith in? Is
[1565.4s] it the parachute like this
[1570.1s] reporter who jumped from the plane
[1574.4s] without his parachute or do we put our
[1577.6s] faith in Jesus Christ to carry us
[1580.8s] through all life's challenges?
[1584.3s] Amen. Amen. Natasha, what do you think?
[1586.6s] Should we just put our faith in people
[1588.7s] randomly? Should we just put our faith
[1591.2s] in maybe let's say you're mathematics
[1594.6s] teacher or possibly you get to campus
[1597.3s] maybe let's say you are economics
[1599.2s] teacher or who are we to be to put our
[1601.7s] faith to even as you wind up
[1604.7s] well basically I think we should put our
[1607.8s] faith in God but also at the same time
[1610.9s] faith without action is dead let's say
[1614.2s] with the par with the the man he had
[1618.2s] faith in his parachute But the action
[1620.3s] was actually carrying the parachute. He
[1623.3s] forgot the parachute and that's why he
[1626.2s] died. So yes, we should have faith in
[1629.8s] God in everything that we do. But just
[1632.4s] not it's not just having faith and just
[1634.8s] sitting there. You have faith and also
[1638.4s] you do something.
[1640.9s] Yeah. Yeah. Thank you. And I think from
[1643.0s] today's lesson we get to learn that
[1646.3s] Christ spent most of his time not
[1649.9s] somewhere preaching or evangelizing but
[1652.5s] he spent most of his time meeting the
[1655.3s] needs of people. We also get to learn
[1657.5s] that by by way we have actually been
[1660.6s] able to tell like from the past two
[1662.7s] lessons and the lessons ahead and the
[1664.4s] one that have been there in the past
[1665.8s] that Christ spent most of his time
[1668.1s] reaching out to the people in need like
[1670.3s] he was he was reaching out to the
[1672.2s] centurion then this he and that's how he
[1674.9s] he got a chance to go and and and heal
[1678.0s] the servant and equally even with the
[1680.1s] demon possessed man and and many other
[1683.4s] situations. So that is actually
[1685.4s] something I want to challenge each one
[1687.1s] of us that instead of just spending time
[1690.4s] maybe possibly in our you know you know
[1692.9s] it's good to be in church you know
[1694.3s] occasionally it's good to be in church
[1695.9s] maybe through this month and another
[1698.1s] month but today's challenge is that we
[1700.0s] also need to spend time out there
[1702.3s] evangelizing reaching out to the needs
[1704.5s] of people and above all even being of
[1707.1s] impact like what you did at the global
[1708.9s] youth day it was a community transformed
[1711.8s] so in our transforming our communities
[1714.1s] We were able to go to children's home.
[1716.0s] We were able to go to hospitals. We were
[1717.7s] able to donate blood. And that is the
[1719.8s] lifestyle you are being called upon to
[1721.6s] do each and every other day. Not only on
[1724.0s] Sabbaths, not only on the over the
[1726.1s] weekends, but even at our workplaces. We
[1729.0s] reach to their needs. When someone is
[1730.6s] sick, we don't have to wait for them to
[1732.8s] get to maybe Saturday so that we bring
[1734.7s] them to church to be prayed for. We can
[1736.7s] pray with them, pray for them, and take
[1738.4s] them to receive care. So, I think that's
[1740.1s] what we've called upon. So, Sid, what do
[1742.5s] you think about that? How how should we
[1744.6s] as young people spend our time, you
[1747.5s] know, beyond coming to church? How
[1749.2s] should we spend our time to reach out to
[1750.7s] those who need us most, to reach out to
[1752.6s] those who don't have food, reach out to
[1753.9s] those who above all need our help?
[1758.2s] Um I think with today's um technological
[1764.5s] advancements, I believe we could not
[1768.0s] only
[1769.8s] um raise funds online for let's say
[1774.0s] charity organizations that help people
[1776.4s] with food. We could also uh spread God's
[1781.6s] word online like we are doing now. And
[1785.0s] that's I believe will go a very long way
[1787.8s] with helping people. Very true. I think
[1790.7s] there's a song hack the voice of Jesus
[1792.9s] is calling and let him hear no one say
[1795.4s] there there's nothing they can do. So in
[1797.5s] whichever small way you can be able go
[1799.9s] and reach out go forth and spread the
[1802.1s] gospel. So I would want to request um my
[1804.7s] brother to to read one of the punchlines
[1806.8s] maybe a punch line of your choice and
[1809.0s] possibly maybe a closing remark. Maybe
[1812.6s] yeah just can read any punch line that
[1814.8s] you love and then maybe a closing
[1817.0s] remark.
[1824.2s] I will read uh Galatians 6:2.
[1827.8s] Carry each other's burdens and in this
[1829.8s] way you will fulfill the law of Christ.
[1833.6s] So we are told to help others in their
[1836.5s] challenges and that is the law of Christ
[1840.3s] we'll be following. Yeah. Amen. And
[1843.9s] thank you for that. Natasha, maybe you
[1845.9s] can take us through the further insight
[1847.6s] and and and
[1850.1s] a closing remark.
[1852.8s] Okay. The father insight we get it from
[1855.1s] the desire of ages page 321
[1859.5s] and also steps to Christ page 54. So des
[1864.4s] says he who rejects the work of the Holy
[1867.1s] Spirit is placing himself where re
[1870.4s] repentance and faith cannot come to him.
[1874.0s] Steps of steps to Christ says look up
[1877.7s] you that are doubting and trembling for
[1880.8s] Jesus lives to make intercession for us.
[1884.3s] The spirit invites you today come with
[1887.0s] your whole heart to Jesus and may claim
[1890.2s] his blessing.
[1892.2s] Basically what I'm I'm drawing from the
[1897.0s] illustration is that Jesus is calling us
[1900.9s] back to him. No matter
[1904.2s] Okay. Okay. Take it back to the story to
[1907.4s] the parable of the mustard seed that no
[1909.7s] matter how little your faith is,
[1913.4s] Jesus still wants you to come to him and
[1918.3s] he will give you we come with your whole
[1921.9s] heart and claim his blessings. Amen. And
[1926.5s] thank you. And lastly, maybe you can
[1928.7s] take us through the did you know
[1930.1s] section. I think I've seen it's a very
[1931.8s] interesting story about the centurions
[1933.8s] and then maybe give a closing word of
[1936.8s] remark.
[1938.8s] Um the did you know section says did you
[1941.4s] know that
[1943.1s] uh outstanding Roman soldiers called
[1945.3s] centurions were given this title because
[1947.4s] they commanded a a century a legion of
[1951.0s] 100 soldiers or so. Centurions would be
[1954.9s] the equivalent of today's captains or
[1957.4s] lieutenants. They often fought alongside
[1960.2s] their soldiers leading them uh from the
[1963.1s] front into into battle. According to a
[1967.0s] study light according to a study.org
[1969.8s] Bible encyclopedia, centurions are
[1972.4s] responsible for drilling them and
[1975.0s] inspecting their arms, food, clothing,
[1978.1s] and commanding them in battle. The
[1980.2s] Romans believed that if they had strong
[1982.9s] brave centurions, their military would
[1985.9s] be almost invincible and for hundreds of
[1989.6s] years they were. Uh a closing mark I'd
[1993.3s] give I just like to to repeat what
[1996.6s] Natasha had said. Faith without action
[2000.2s] is dead. So you cannot
[2002.9s] believe that something will happen and
[2004.8s] then you don't put any effort into it
[2007.3s] and expect it to happen. It's like
[2009.6s] wanting to pass an exam.
[2012.5s] You believe that God will help you pass
[2014.6s] the exam, but you don't study.
[2017.0s] It's it doesn't it doesn't really work
[2018.9s] like that. Yeah, that's that's what I
[2020.9s] would say. Thank you very much. And my
[2023.7s] closing remark will come from Hebrews 1
[2027.1s] 16. And without faith, it is impossible
[2029.8s] to please God because anyone who comes
[2032.1s] to him must believe that he exists and
[2034.8s] that he rewards those who honestly seek
[2037.4s] him. And lastly and not the least, the
[2039.7s] other one is just to challenge us to
[2041.4s] have that faith of the centurion. That
[2044.2s] faith that you can say this is it that
[2047.8s] Christ can tell you of what you need to
[2049.8s] do and you follow it. That faith to
[2053.0s] believe that yes I can be healed and
[2055.2s] truly I can be healed. So my challenge
[2056.8s] to you my viewer is that you have a look
[2059.8s] exercise your faith. Have faith that is
[2062.6s] grounded on Christ because faith in any
[2065.0s] other thing on other substances and
[2067.5s] moreo without action will take you
[2069.3s] nowhere. So I want to thank you for
[2071.1s] having been part of us. I urge you to go
[2073.8s] through the lesson more and more. To my
[2075.7s] dear panelists, thank you very much and
[2077.6s] may God bless each one of us even as we
[2080.0s] foresee the next lesson and even as we
[2082.4s] go through the next week. So I want us
[2084.2s] to close with a word of prayer and uh
[2087.8s] let me request all of us to bon even as
[2089.8s] we pray. Our father who art in heaven,
[2092.2s] we come before this time. We want to
[2095.1s] thank you that you've led us through
[2096.6s] that you've guided us through God. We've
[2098.8s] been discussing about faith. We've been
[2101.8s] discussing about the centurion. We've
[2103.5s] also learned about the demon possessed
[2105.4s] man. All we are asking from you Jehovah
[2107.6s] is that you guide us that you may have
[2109.7s] faith and not only faith in any grounds
[2113.4s] but faith in you. Faith that you can
[2115.8s] trust that even as you pursue our
[2117.9s] studies, even as you work, even as you
[2120.2s] look for jobs and opportunities out
[2122.2s] there as young people that you can keep
[2124.3s] on trusting in you, God. But you've also
[2126.6s] challenged us that we must know that
[2128.5s] faith without action is dead. So God we
[2130.8s] are asking that as a four of us and
[2132.9s] those who will watch this many days,
[2135.7s] many months or years from now that they
[2138.2s] may have trust God that by trusting in
[2141.7s] you by exercising their faith in you and
[2145.2s] by taking action that indeed you'll
[2147.4s] continue blessing them. We want to thank
[2149.5s] you and we pray that you may lead us for
[2151.5s] the for the coming week. Until we meet
[2154.2s] again in the next lesson, we appreciate
[2156.5s] you and we thank you and in Jesus name
[2158.3s] we pray and believe in. Amen.
