welcome again to this series that we are running of the book true Revival I do hope you've gotten a copy of this book and you're following it together with us I'm joined here by my panelists on my left we have Steve and on my right we have brother opata and we'll be continuing to talk about the themes in the book through Revival now last week we covered the chapter HS for Revival and we learned that the a Revival is the church's greatest and most urgent need and we also saw that Revival only comes in answer to prayer and also when we are filled with the spirit now after we have been revived It's always important to discern between the real and the fake and that's what we'll be talking about today when we have someone who's converted is it fake or real so even as we begin today I'd like to invite my brother Steve to offer a word of prayer and also just give us a preface or summary of what chapter 2 is all about what does it mean to be converted and do we have fake conversion or real conversion please take it away brother Ste thank you thank you brother Niko welcome brother opata let us um have a word of prayer Our Father once again we come before your presence this week to discuss what true conversion means we seek and beseech for your spirit Lord to be with us fill us with your power reduce us as you increase so that Lord even as we discuss and review this book your name shall be lifted and glorified be with us from the beginning to the end for it is in Jesus name we ask amen amen amen thank you very much welcome once again to this series as we uh discuss the book true Revival by lgy we're in Chapter 2 and uh we invite you um as we share that uh you know just be with us and remember again uh don't for get to get this book through Revival it's it's indeed a book that we need as a church today amen uh I would want us to quickly go to uh conversions um brother niik introduced and asked a very pertinent questions conversions fake or real how do we distinguish fake or real conversions and I think we'll just give a highlight and encourage you to go to this book because you'll get an depth coverage of what fake or real Revival or conversion means I'll begin by reading um just something small from uh the book L G white from the first um subtopic part of the word the reason why I would want us to read this is because for us to distinguish between fake and real conversions we need the power of God we need the Holy Spirit there's no other way that we can distinguish between real and fake conversion without the power of the holy spirit so therefore I'd like us to just quickly read this power of God it says allow me to read for your hearing wherever the word of God has been Faithfully preached results have followed that attested its divine origin the spirit of God this is important the spirit of God accompanied the message of his servants and the Word was with power Sinners felt their conscience quickened the light which lith every every man that cometh into the world illuminated the secret chambers of their soul and the hidden things of Darkness were made manifest deep conviction conviction took hold upon their minds and hearts how did this conviction happen how were they able to adopt or accept the message of the message of of God simply by the power of the Holy Spirit it continued to say that they had a sense of righteousness of Jehovah and felt the terror of appearing in their guilt and uncleanliness so far we can truly truly feel and understand that this indeed was a true Revival there was nothing fake about the our old um brothers and sisters our old elders and even the um the Christians today there's nothing fake about having a deep conviction of who our Lord Jesus Christ is um allow me to just give a quick summary then we can open it up for um just a brief discussion with uh my fellow P panelist I wanted us to highlight um three key subtopics one is true repentance and transformation how do you distinguish between true repentance true transformation from fake repentance and fake transformation we are told that true repentance is profound okay it is a profound change in character if it's not profound that is not true and you will feel it as an individual you'll feel a profound um uh change in character and conduct we're also told that individuals who truly turn to God will exhibit fruits of repentance remember the Bible tells us that you shall know them by their by their fruits so if your fruits are not godly if you do not um exhibit um love patience godliness longsuffering then that is not true repentance and true repentance calls us to abandon our former uh sins abandon our former self our old self and adopt a new life and a new walk with Christ now this transformation calls us to be humble it gives us humility Purity and a desire to reflect Christ's character this is what we call genuine repentance it CS us to have self EX examp examination it calls us to ask ourselves pertinent questions um am I experiencing a closer walk with Christ am I growing on a daily because brother Niko had mentioned that once you're revived then there has to be steps that you make so am I growing in Christ daily because after repentance comes Revival comes transformation and then comes growth in Christ because you cannot just get stuck in transformation you cannot just get stuck in Revival amen now the key thing is the growth in Christ how do you grow in Christ the Holy Spirit Will convict you to repent to get baptized to be revived to be transformed but how do you grow in Christ it is through the power of the holy spirit amen and that's what sister white is calling us that we need to seek honestly seek the power of the Holy Spirit second Corinthians CH 15:1 17 tells us that therefore um allow us to quickly just quickly quickly read it well I have it here allow me to just quickly read it here therefore if anyone is in Christ is a new creation MH the old has passed away behold the new has come amen so if you've accepted Christ as a real conversion then you cannot get stuck in the old self we're also reminded of modern revivals and superficiality what are modern revivals modern revivals are characterized by emotional appeals okay they are characterized by sensationalism we want to we we go to church we come to church because there's a certain preacher who will make me laugh who will give me intriguing stories so we don't really look at the true transformation we look at the emotional aspect of it The Sensational aspect of it if that is what we are looking for then that is fake Revival that is not true Revival so what is the opposite true Revival will call us to real and true and authentic transformation that we look at God in a deep deeper way I'll read something quickly that genuine sanctification involves effort it involves obedience and harmony with God's principles as faith without works is dead uh you can take this verse and maybe read it um um go through it um at your own at your own time during your study Matthew 15 8 to9 talks about worshiping god um these people honor me with their lips but their hearts are far from me they worship me in their in their in vain their teachings are merely human rules I'll want to maybe throw it um um you know extended the discussion a bit to to to my fellow panelist list mhm and maybe ask a question maybe um to brother Nik um orata yes that God says in John 14:15 that if you love me keep my Commandments if you love me keep my Commandments this calls us to Holiness and obedience to God's law yes could could you just briefly break that down what does it mean if you love me keep my Commandments does it mean if we love God if we don't love God mhm if we keep the Commandments and don't love God what is the inverse what is the opposite or what does it mean just a quick breakdown uh if if you keep the Commandments and do not love God then you might be led to something called legalism where we actually are going to be following the laws but don't love the person who gave the laws and you find this the case with the Pharisees for example people they did not like Jesus but Jesus is the one who actually gave the law we told in the Bible in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God in John 1 verse1 so you can imagine the person who gave the law came to be with you on the earth then you go and crucify him and still claim that you love God but your actions and the things you're doing are showing otherwise amen so we have to love the LA Giver as much as we love the law yes and it's a balance we have to strike yeah yeah so I think that's good thank you very much you've brought out a very a very good aspect of what this this this um verse means opata can I claim to love God and God has clearly stipulated 10 Commandments in Exodus the laws that he gave um Moses can I claim to love God and I do not observe these Ten Commandments in it t uh actually the Bible talks about having the form of godliness but denying the spirit thereof and I've heard lawyers talking about the spirit of the law so here we seeing that uh we can't claim to love God and disobey him at the same time it's impossible how do you love him how do you show love to your parents by obeying your parents so even that chapter talks about uh only believe and you have heard this thing this gospel being preached to to the to the mass that just believe and that's why it ends then the same preachers go ahead and says that uh you don't really have to obey there are no rules how can we not have rules how can you how can you how can you exist in state where you can do anything and at the same time you want to believe something so I think it's it's a it's a dark mystery if I can if I can put it so clearly you cannot love God you can't say you love God and then there's nothing that you're even giving because God himself is he said he loved the word yeah and that is fake Revival yes that's a fake Revival and then again just to to finish uh there's something that I also wanted to to to to add on to when you are when you have true Revival there's no room for boasting yeah there's no room for boasting amen it's in fact it humbles you because the more you are you are drawn closer to the to to the word of God the more sinful you become because it picks out it's like a mirror it shows you here you're wrong you need to correct here so it humbles you and then through this humility is where now the spirit will be able to work Miracle through you so that through you that same effect can be transferred to the brother who is sitting next to you because of your lifestyle and this is something that uh it's really coming out very clear because we are seeing we have been given the examples of Daniel who he was a rightous man job he said he hatte evil but you're seeing when he was praying was giving his supplication to God he took it upon himself like God I'm see please I Repent on beh of even these people you see so it gives you that sense of responsibility and humility thank you and um I we are done with um chapter 2 I just wanted uh to quickly encourage us that what we've been talking about is um fake or real conversions and uh let us remember that once we've been converted once we've known what real conversion is once we've been convicted then we are called to change our life completely we cannot stay in our old self we cannot continue with our old lifestyle Amen Let Us experience the growth in Christ on a daily through prayer and supplications amen more importantly through seeking the power of the holy spirit thank you very much brother Steve even as we close I'd like to state that please join us for the next chapter which will be how to be a born again Christian and if you're coming to join us for the first time please get a copy of the book through Revival which you can get from the link which we'll be sharing on this video even as we post it and you can get a physical copy if you have any Adventist Bookshop near you so let's bar heads for a word of prayer Our Kind and loving father we are grateful that you've taught us how not to have have a counterfeit experience we ask that you may lead us to be truly converted and I pray that we may experience the real conversion and if per chance the devil is trying to take away what we have built over time I pray that you may give us the spirit to overcome because you know the holy spirit is working in our hearts we ask this in Jesus name amen amen

[16.4s] continuing to talk about the themes in
[18.2s] the book through Revival now last week
[21.2s] we covered the chapter HS for Revival
[24.3s] and we learned that the a Revival is the
[27.1s] church's greatest and most urgent need
[29.8s] and we also saw that Revival only comes
[31.8s] in answer to prayer and also when we are
[34.1s] filled with the spirit now after we have
[37.0s] been revived It's always important to
[39.1s] discern between the real and the fake
[41.7s] and that's what we'll be talking about
[43.2s] today when we have someone who's
[45.4s] converted is it fake or real so even as
[49.5s] we begin today I'd like to invite my
[52.1s] brother Steve to offer a word of prayer
[54.5s] and also just give us a preface or
[56.7s] summary of what chapter 2 is all about
[59.4s] what does it mean to be converted and do
[62.1s] we have fake conversion or real
[64.4s] conversion please take it away brother

[115.0s] share that uh you know just be with us
[117.9s] and remember again uh don't for get to
[120.4s] get this book through Revival it's it's
[122.8s] indeed a book that we need as a church
[125.6s] today amen uh I would want us to quickly
[128.8s] go
[129.6s] to uh conversions um brother niik
[133.3s] introduced and asked a very pertinent
[136.3s] questions
[138.1s] conversions fake or real how do we
[141.5s] distinguish fake or real conversions and
[145.3s] I think we'll just give a highlight and
[147.2s] encourage you to go to this book because
[148.8s] you'll get an depth coverage of what
[152.3s] fake or real Revival or conversion means
[157.0s] I'll begin by reading um just something
[159.9s] small from uh the book L G white from
[162.7s] the first um subtopic part of the word
[165.7s] the reason why I would want us to read
[167.3s] this is because for us to distinguish
[170.2s] between fake and real conversions we
[172.8s] need the power of God we need the Holy
[174.8s] Spirit there's no other way that we can
[177.1s] distinguish between real and fake
[178.8s] conversion without the power of the holy
[181.3s] spirit so therefore I'd like us to just
[183.4s] quickly read this power of God it says
[185.6s] allow me to read for your hearing
[188.1s] wherever the word of God has been
[189.8s] Faithfully preached results have
[191.9s] followed that attested its divine origin
[195.9s] the spirit of God this is important the
[198.1s] spirit of God accompanied the message of
[201.4s] his servants and the Word was with power
[205.3s] Sinners felt their conscience quickened
[208.2s] the light which lith every every man
[210.6s] that cometh into the world illuminated
[213.1s] the secret chambers of their soul and
[215.9s] the hidden things of Darkness were made
[218.2s] manifest deep conviction conviction took
[221.8s] hold upon their minds and hearts how did
[225.8s] this conviction
[227.5s] happen how were they able to adopt or
[231.6s] accept the message of the message of of
[234.6s] God simply by the power of the Holy
[237.3s] Spirit it continued to say that they had
[238.8s] a sense of righteousness
[240.4s] of Jehovah and felt the terror of
[243.2s] appearing in their guilt and
[246.3s] uncleanliness so far we can truly truly
[250.1s] feel and understand that this indeed was
[252.7s] a true Revival there was nothing fake
[255.6s] about the our old um brothers and
[258.5s] sisters our old elders and even the um
[260.6s] the Christians today there's nothing
[262.4s] fake about having a deep conviction of
[265.4s] who our Lord Jesus Christ is um allow me
[269.2s] to just give a quick summary then we can
[272.7s] open it up for um just a brief
[275.1s] discussion with uh my fellow P panelist
[278.5s] I wanted us to highlight um three key
[280.7s] subtopics one is true repentance and
[284.1s] transformation how do you distinguish
[287.2s] between true repentance true
[289.6s] transformation from fake repentance and
[291.6s] fake
[292.6s] transformation we are told that true
[294.9s] repentance is profound okay it is a
[298.9s] profound change in character if it's not
[301.5s] profound that is not true and you will
[303.6s] feel it as an individual you'll feel a
[306.7s] profound um uh change in character and
[310.3s] conduct we're also told that individuals
[312.7s] who truly turn to God will exhibit
[316.3s] fruits of repentance remember the Bible
[318.2s] tells us that you shall know them by
[320.4s] their by their fruits so if your fruits
[322.9s] are not godly if you do not um exhibit
[326.8s] um love patience godliness longsuffering
[330.9s] then that is not true
[332.5s] repentance and true repentance calls us
[335.1s] to abandon our former uh sins abandon
[338.0s] our former self our old self and adopt a
[341.1s] new life and a new walk with Christ now
[345.0s] this transformation calls us to be
[347.0s] humble it gives us humility Purity and a
[351.0s] desire to reflect Christ's
[353.8s] character this is what we call genuine
[356.8s] repentance it CS us to have self EX
[359.4s] examp
[360.3s] examination it calls us to ask ourselves
[362.9s] pertinent questions um am I experiencing
[366.9s] a closer walk with Christ am I growing
[369.5s] on a daily because brother Niko had
[371.9s] mentioned that once you're revived then
[374.9s] there has to be steps that you make so
[378.0s] am I growing in Christ daily because
[380.1s] after repentance comes Revival comes
[384.4s] transformation and then comes growth in
[386.6s] Christ because you cannot just get stuck
[388.9s] in transformation
[390.1s] you cannot just get stuck in Revival
[393.3s] amen now the key thing is the growth in
[396.6s] Christ how do you grow in Christ the
[399.6s] Holy Spirit Will convict you to repent
[402.9s] to get baptized to be revived to be
[405.6s] transformed but how do you grow in
[407.5s] Christ it is through the power of the
[410.9s] holy spirit amen and that's what sister
[413.1s] white is calling us that we need to seek
[415.8s] honestly seek the power of the Holy
[418.1s] Spirit second Corinthians CH 15:1 17
[421.8s] tells us that therefore um allow us to
[425.0s] quickly just quickly quickly read it
[427.7s] well I have it here allow me to just
[429.4s] quickly read it here therefore if anyone
[431.4s] is in Christ is a new creation MH the
[434.6s] old has passed away behold the new has
[437.7s] come amen so if you've accepted
[440.7s] Christ as a real conversion then you
[444.0s] cannot get stuck in the old self we're
[447.2s] also reminded of modern revivals and
[450.0s] superficiality what are modern revivals
[452.2s] modern revivals are characterized by
[454.7s] emotional appeals okay they are
[457.1s] characterized by
[458.6s] sensationalism we want to we we go to
[461.7s] church we come to church because there's
[463.8s] a certain preacher who will make me
[465.3s] laugh who will give me intriguing
[468.0s] stories so we don't really look at the
[471.1s] true transformation we look at the
[473.0s] emotional aspect of it The Sensational
[476.0s] aspect of it if that is what we are
[480.0s] looking for then that is fake Revival
[482.5s] that is not true Revival so what is the
[485.2s] opposite true Revival will call us to
[487.8s] real and true and authentic
[490.7s] transformation that we look at God in a
[493.8s] deep deeper way I'll read something
[496.9s] quickly that genuine sanctification
[499.2s] involves effort it involves obedience
[503.0s] and harmony with God's principles as
[505.8s] faith without works is dead
[509.7s] uh you can take this verse and maybe
[511.5s] read it um um go through it um at your
[514.8s] own at your own time during your study
[516.7s] Matthew 15 8
[519.0s] to9 talks about worshiping god um these
[523.2s] people honor me with their lips but
[525.0s] their hearts are far from me they
[526.7s] worship me in their in their in vain
[528.8s] their teachings are merely human rules
[532.3s] I'll want to maybe throw it um um you
[535.9s] know extended the discussion a bit to to
[538.5s] to my fellow panelist list mhm and maybe
[541.2s] ask a question maybe um to brother Nik
[544.4s] um
[545.4s] orata yes that God says in John 14:15
[550.7s] that if you love me keep my
[553.2s] Commandments if you love me keep my
[555.4s] Commandments this calls us to Holiness
[558.0s] and obedience to God's law yes could
[561.2s] could you just briefly break that down
[564.0s] what does it mean if you love me keep my
[566.3s] Commandments does it mean if we love God
[569.1s] if we don't love God mhm if we keep the
[571.9s] Commandments and don't love God what is
[574.9s] the inverse what is the opposite or what
[577.6s] does it mean just a quick
[580.6s] breakdown uh if if you keep the
[583.0s] Commandments and do not love God then
[585.7s] you might be led to something called
[588.2s] legalism where we actually are going to
[591.2s] be following the laws but don't love the
[594.5s] person who gave the laws and you find
[597.2s] this the case with the Pharisees for
[599.0s] example people they did not like Jesus
[603.6s] but Jesus is the one who actually gave
[606.0s] the law we told in the Bible in the
[608.2s] beginning was the word and the Word was
[610.5s] with God and the Word was God in John 1
[612.8s] verse1 so you can imagine the person who
[615.2s] gave the law came to be with you on the
[617.0s] earth then you go and crucify him and
[620.6s] still claim that you love God but your
[623.1s] actions and the things you're doing are
[624.9s] showing otherwise amen so we have to
[627.5s] love the LA Giver as much as we love the
[630.6s] law yes and it's a balance we have to
[633.2s] strike yeah yeah so I think that's good
[636.4s] thank you very much you've brought out a
[637.8s] very a very good aspect of what this
[640.9s] this this um verse means
[643.6s] opata can I claim to love God and God
[647.6s] has clearly stipulated 10 Commandments
[650.4s] in Exodus the laws that he gave um Moses
[654.7s] can I claim to love God and I do not
[656.8s] observe these Ten Commandments in it
[660.9s] t uh actually the Bible talks about
[665.2s] having the form of godliness but denying
[667.6s] the spirit thereof and I've heard
[670.1s] lawyers talking about the spirit of the
[672.2s] law so here we seeing that uh we can't
[676.2s] claim to love God and disobey him at the
[679.4s] same
[680.3s] time it's impossible how do you love him
[684.9s] how do you show love to your parents by
[687.4s] obeying your parents so
[690.0s] even that chapter talks about uh only
[693.3s] believe and you have heard this thing
[696.0s] this gospel being preached to to the to
[698.8s] the mass that just
[701.4s] believe and that's why it ends then the
[704.8s] same preachers go ahead and says that uh
[708.4s] you don't really have to obey there are
[710.1s] no rules how can we not have
[713.4s] rules how can you how can you how can
[716.0s] you exist in state where you can do
[719.0s] anything
[720.1s] and at the same time you want to believe
[722.5s] something so I think it's it's a it's a
[725.9s] dark mystery if I can if I can put it so
[729.3s] clearly you cannot love
[732.2s] God you can't say you love God and then
[735.9s] there's nothing that you're even giving
[737.7s] because God himself is he said he loved
[740.4s] the word yeah and that is fake Revival
[743.1s] yes that's a fake Revival and then again
[745.4s] just to to finish uh there's something
[748.0s] that I also wanted to to to to add on to
[752.9s] when you are when you have true Revival
[755.4s] there's no room for boasting yeah
[757.5s] there's no room for boasting amen it's
[759.8s] in fact it humbles you because the more
[762.2s] you are you are drawn closer to the to
[764.6s] to the word of God the more sinful you
[766.8s] become because it picks out it's like a
[768.8s] mirror it shows you here you're wrong
[771.1s] you need to correct here so it humbles
[773.8s] you and then through this humility is
[776.9s] where now the spirit will be able to
[779.7s] work Miracle through you so that through
[784.0s] you that same effect can be transferred
[786.4s] to the brother who is sitting next to
[788.0s] you because of your lifestyle and this
[790.4s] is something that uh it's really coming
[793.8s] out very clear because we are seeing we
[795.3s] have been given the examples of Daniel
[798.0s] who he was a rightous man job he said he
[801.6s] hatte evil but you're seeing when he was
[804.0s] praying was giving his supplication to
[806.2s] God he took it upon himself like God I'm
[808.9s] see
[809.7s] please I Repent on beh of even these
[811.7s] people you see so it gives you that
[815.0s] sense of responsibility and humility
[817.1s] thank
[818.9s] you and um I we are done with um chapter
[824.6s] 2 I just wanted uh to quickly encourage
[827.3s] us that what we've been talking about is
[832.2s] um fake or real conversions and uh let
