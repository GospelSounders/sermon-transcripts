offering helped the school expand with new classrooms and Library thank you for planning a generous offering on March 29th for this quarter's 13th Sabbath projects in Mongolia and elsewhere in the Northern Asia Pacific Division good morning good afternoon good evening from whatever it is you'll be watching us from today we are discussing the inverse lesson and this quarter we have been talking on mental health and today our lesson will be on resisting Temptations um we are told in 1 Corinthians 10:13 there haveth no temptation taken you but such as is common to man but God is faithful who will not suffer you to be tempted above what above that he are able but will with the Temptation also make a way to escape that you may be able to Bear it so today we will see how we'll be able to overcome The Temptations that we face on a daily basis and we pray that you may be blessed by this lesson amen we will sing a hym give me the Bible give me thear Tempest peaceful radi Jesus came to seek and save the Lord give me the Bible holy m is shining thy light shall guide me in the narrow way and pro and till shall in etal we will get a prayer from yes I'm bless our head for of prayer thank you God for bringing us here thank you Lord for the lesson as we study it may you open our hearts to you this I pray in Jesus name amen amen um our main scripture for this lesson is from Matthew 4 verse 1 to 11 and through this we are going to be looking at Jesus Temptations so the lesson introduces us to an array of temptations that are there in our world today and in the past lives um during Adam and Eve's time it was Temptations of appetites during David and Solomon's time it was tempations of last and in our time today unfortunately it's the Temptation Of Technology yes and for us technology has become such a big thing for us to a point sometimes we even have online names that are not our true names we are literally trying to hide our identity behind social media and this is because the devil is really doing his best to try and do away with God's Plan of Salvation and it's such as that thing but through this lesson we'll be able to get Hope on how Jesus overcame and how we too can overcome in the same way so we will move on to Matthew 4 from verse 1 to 11 and if n is willing he can give us a summary of what he thinks is happening here um yes um I am willing hi viewers the summary of uh our scripture reading today is on the temptation of Jesus now Jesus um was in the wilderness taken by the spirit of God Into the Wilderness where he had was fasting for 40 days and 40 nights after which the devil came to tempt him now um the first um Temptation um is to command the stones to turn into bread the second um Temptation he the devil takes Jesus to the Pinnacle of the temple and asks him to throw himself down and uh the third temptation is uh Christ the devil takes Christ to a high mountain and shows him all the nations and says if you will fall down and worship me I will give all this to you and you see in each and every one of those Temptations um Christ resisted how did he resist that's why we here so that's a summary that's a summary of what Matthew 4 from vers 1 11 is um and we actually see that Jesus was led to the Wilderness by the spirit right and Jesus was in the wilderness um preparing for his ministry because we see that Jesus had his ministry here for three years on Earth and it was the Lord Spirit leing him to the Wilderness so he was not there by mistake it wasn't a mistake that Christ was in the wilderness but we are still seeing that Satan comes to destroy um God's Plan of Salvation and you see that Jesus overcame as n has told us and EM here Will Tell Us of the number of ways that we are given into Temptations days so um we have being tempted um in various ways in our lives today um there are so many ways uh first of all there's appetite we the there physical craving appetite We crave for food We crave for you know things that we're not even supposed to eat according to the Bible but we eat them because we we have the craving physical appetite we also become um addicted to media and entertainment and we tend to over consume them and we we get addicted there's also uh presumption we try and test God we test God to take risks with our sinful behaviors you do a sin today and you you say h see here God will forgive me eventually I'll just do it I'll go pray about it and God will forgive me we tempt god without knowing at times and then we are also um facing Pride when we are working in our work spaces people um tend to have the self-exaltation you want to be in a certain position in your company at school and then you forget that there's God you become so self exalted you forget God is the one who brought you to that position you in yeah um yes um it's actually quite unfortunate that sometimes we get so overtaken by all the Temptations in the world but we have been given hope that um Christ himself had he fac this temptation the devil was actually there at at Christ's weakest point he was tempting Christ but Christ was able to control all his um all that he was able to control and he was able to overcome and we are told even us in our own human strength we can't overcome but through Christ and how he was able to overcome we too have the hope that we can overcome these Temptations as well and Elijah can give us some ways in which you can practically overcome the devil's Temptations in our lives today thank you very much for that before before I answer the question I think that's why in the book of Isaiah we have the verse come now let's reason together this discussion has opened my eyes to the third tempation where the devil as as as as our brother said the devil was uh Jesus was taken and shown mountains Hills and everything and said if you worship me I will give you this it is it is it is so ambiguous because you know everything was created by God but then the Devil comes and says if worship me I'll give you it is like he was saying it was his I don't know if you're shocked by that because I'm like I'm questioning myself how does the devil now come acknowledge that these things are mine yet us as Christians acknowledge that these things were created by God despite that uh I love Hebrews 4:15 which says for we have not an high priest which cannot be touched to the feeling of our infirmities but was in all points tempted like as we are yet without sin first of all we have Toge that we are sinners we are products of sin but then you have Christ who was tempted but did not commit anything how then was he able to do that now coming to your to your question I think we all need to have a sense of the scriptures sense of the word of God because when you read Matthew uh chter 4 it says how how able to overcome the of the devil was it is written it is written it is written you can't confidently say that it is written yet you yourself haven't studied the scriptures 2 Timothy 2:15 uh which I I'll paraphrase which says study to show thyself approved a Workman rightfully dividing the word of Truth M you yourself need to study you need to build your spiritual reserves and your spiritual reserves have to be always have something we all need something in our banks especially at this time time when the economy is hard you can't just go and clean your out your bank and say I'm taking out my money all of it you need some money to be in your bank in the same way you need to have scripture in your bank account you need to have the word of God such that when the Devil comes to you you you can say it is written am then and can I say I'm sorry I'm sorry for jumping in and there's a very important point that you brought about on while we acknowledge that all things are christs the devil um is saying all things things are mine right and I can give them to you and just I think to answer your question um when God created the world he put all things eventually he created man and gave man Dominion now when man sinned man yielded his Dominion to the devil yes now Christ came back and and that's when when Christ comes there a part in the Bible I may not be able to call but he says you know the prince of this world has nothing in me when man sin the devil became the prince of this world and he be he puts everything under his Dominion when man sinned but now when Christ came and eventually overcame by by giving his life as paradoxical as that sound he reclaimed that dominion and that's why I think and that's why I feel like I have to speak up that this this temptation was so critical because had Christ fell and worshiped the devil then he would have permanently seeded Dominion of this world to the devil but the fact that he resisted and eventually overcame on the cross then Christ rightly took back that Authority and Christ became God over all and that is why when he come in the second time he comes and as king and priest to Reign because he claimed that Dominion I'm sorry I had to I felt it was interesting thank you so much um for that elah before you go I I I think brings out the aspect that the lon also tries to bring these Temptations were were not just mere Temptations as the lesson writer says there were Fierce Temptations they were nothing could ever you yourself as me as Elijah would have been there and I could have been able to handle it I have not eaten for 40 days you're telling me to turn stones to bread and you have the power to turn those stones into bread thank you that's I don't want to put that across thank you um and just as you guys have said Satan was literally using he was bringing Christ down by saying if you are the son of of God do this and Christ is he's a very powerful example to us because Christ was able to resist he knows that he has all power literally all power to turn those stones into bread to fall down and the angels would catch him but he had he knows the word Christ is the word and he knows his word and he said you know what no this I will not fish this ination but I will attack these inations with what God has promised and what God has given us in his word amen and I think it is for us to know that God has given um given us his word as a lamp unto our feet and a light unto our path and there's no point in this world that God will leave you alone if you decides to use his word and hide it in your heart he will walk with you through any tempation that it is that you're facing amen we are also told in James we delit James 4 verse 7 and 8 it's it says submit yourself then to God resist the devil and he will slee from you come near to God and he will come near to you wash your hands you Sinners and purify your hearts you double-minded thank you so much Emily um we actually told that if you resist the devil he will free from you that is all you need to do you being rooted and firmly Dred in God's words even at your weakest point the devil will literally flee from you and we have so much hope because if Christ was able to overcome we too can overcome amen um we will move to Ephesians chapter 6 verse 10 to 13 before that Elijah will love before before you go there you bring out the aspect that Christ had all the power to just the word to just speak or even just think of it and things will have turn soon will have turned to bread the angels have come and and and picked him up but he choose not to I'm not sure if if if this was what the author of The him wanted but as as you saying that the him 600 came to mind I I'll just read the the line that I want to apply hold fast till I come the danger is great sleep not as do others Be watchful and wait and I think that is what we can think from this lesson if you can just hold fast and wait for Christ to come because as we have alluded earlier The Temptations are Fierce the danger is great yes hold fast till Christ comes amen thank you thank you Ephesians 6 Ephesians 6 from verse 10 to 13 okay it says finally be strong in the Lord and in the in the strength of his might put on the whole armor of God that you may be able to stand against the schemes of the devil for we do do not wrestle against flesh and blood but against the rulers against the authorities against the cosmic Powers over this present Darkness against the spiritual forces of evil in the Heavenly places therefore take up the whole armor of God that you may be able to withstand in the evil day and having done all to stand firm um we're reminded that we need to always uh have the word of God with us we need to for us to face our Temptations we also have to be prepared by having the helmet of God of salvation of God the helmet is normally used the normal helmet that we know it was used for it is used for protecting the vital organs it is used so as a Christian our helmet is the Assurance of Salvation And it is an impen impenetrable defense against the enemy attacks and the enemy to us is Satan that's why we need to always have Jesus in our hearts we need to pray every day we have to read our Bible every day so that whenever we we're being being faced by Temptations we'll be having the word of God in our hearts and we'll be able to Proclaim it and every time we facing challenges we'll be able to seek counsel to the Bible and ask what um Solutions it gives to our problems and by continuing to embrace Embrace Jesus every day we we're able to keep the helmet of salvation as a protection against the enemy amen yes amen thank you so much for that Emily um I loved what the lesson and writer told us that our minds are a constant Battlefield and if you look back to how most of us have never been to war but if you look back to how the soldiers would put on the armor they would put on everything F the breastplate literally carry The Sword and the last thing that would go on was the helmet and this is because the helmet is is protecting the most important part of our body which is your brain because once your brain is damaged there's no there's no coming out of that and this is what the devil has usually he's it's what he's using against us he's using our minds against us the devil knows that he can use you at your weakest point and these are your thoughts at your weakest point is when you're like you know what I'm not worthy I can't do this um if the devil tells me to go into a certain to fall into a certain Temptation I will fall into it and that is why we are being told that the helmet of salvation literally needs to come in it comes in last even when we read the word and the helmet of salvation means we are literally choosing Jesus every day it means you have to as as well as you need to read your word you need to be firly grounded and by choosing him every day we are able to keep on this helmet of salvation and it will be the armor of protection around us for the rest of our lives and the devil will literally not be able to to come and attack you yes if I can just step in when you when the lesson writer describes the mind being constant viral I think it's uh Professor P usually says of All Through the Ages it has always been the Battle of their minds now you can take that literally in terms of how the soldiers used to fight because they had tactics on how to attack you had the gorilla attacks hit and was it hit and run not and run but it's more of gorilla Ware basically but now they were to protect their minds to avoid them being shot or being attacked from being being hit by something in their heads which will either cause a concussion someone just getting a hemorrage which will be patal at the end of the day which can lead to death but then when you look at the Battleground as in the mind we are trying to protect our minds this whole quarter or this this this whole lesson is all about our mental health if we remove the word uh me Health in it it's all about the mind the mind yeah if I'm able to guard my mind if I'm able to ensure that my mind is protected I can be able to resist temptation if I don't protect my mind and I I I I I allow every everything to come to me and filtered filtered everything just comes to me The Way It Is My Mind will be corrupted once it is corrupted I in myself cannot resist temptation thank you thank you for that Elijah um I'd like to ask do you think we have the Assurance of God's salvation today I think we have the Assurance of God's salvation today I want to answer it a bit differently yes based on a question that I had in my mind as I was as I was reflecting upon our discussions here and the question is the background of the question is Christ was led to the Wilderness by the spirit of God and then the devil found him and tempted him so as we walk walk you know in the light that God gives us are we susceptible to Temptations based on what we studying today the answer is is yes we are yes we are yes now then what then I um and then what here is I remember a verse in the Bible that says therefore have no temptation uh have overcome you but that such as common to man but God is faithful who will not allow you to be tempted above or beyond that which you able to Bear but will with that Temptation provide a way out amen so yes to your question that we can have the Assurance of Salvation why because another verse the Bible says that he will give his angels charge over you to keep you in all your ways so yes despite the world that you live in yes despite the Temptations that we are susceptible to we can overcome overcome but um another question that I've had is um are there choices that we make that also lead us to Temptation outside God's word allow me to leave it at that maybe you'll ask that question to someone I feel like yes we Face Temptations outside yes sometimes we choose to face the Temptations I feel so cuz if you um if you you know your triggers yes you should know your triggers what triggers you into being tempted look at your environment are they is it your friend is it your phone are you always on phone is it triggering you to do the wrong thing so I feel like at times we choose you and at times yeah it's Temptations come to us and that's why we need to put on the arm of God we need to find comfort in God and tell him our stories and troubles and he'll be able to help us overcome our Temptations yes thank you so much for that Emily and a verse that I constantly go back to is John 16:33 it says these things I have spoken unto you that in me you might have peace in the world you shall have tribulation but be of good chair I have overcome the world we Christ went through tribulations we've seen through his Temptations and throughout his life here on Earth throughout his ministry there were still many times where there was so much happening the Pharisees were against him but Christ was still able to overcome until he died and he took over Dain from what Satan thinks he has power over and I think Christ has given us so much hope that no matter what it is that we are going through in this world he has overcome it and he is literally sated at the right hand side of God interceding for us there as n has told us Christ is there for us as sometimes we put ourselves in those positions but there is still hope you can still come out of it don't say I've put myself now I will stay here no it's you need to be self-aware that even if I put myself in this temptation come out of it I mean as well as you have your triggers know that this triggers you and cut it off we have talked about even social media if you know it's a trigger for you put limits to social media put limits on your phone um if you know if it's a certain group of friends do away with those friends and God will give you others it's things you pray about you pray over and it's not just going about this life blindly I'm sorry for for I have to I would like to to to to just point out that um while the examples of Temptation are different the I don't know if the word is the nature is the same for example for Christ it may have been you know turning stones into bread or I will give you all these kingdoms right but if you look at it the the call there is all about have no other gods before me yes so the god that the devil was presenting to Christ was himself because he says Fall Down and Worship me yes but for us our God is Maybe social media Our God may be our friends God may be my girlfriend my God may be but in the end the the the the the root I don't know what word to best describe the root Foundation is the foundation is right when it comes to you know last for then it may be bread now it may be fries or or or sausages which are not they doing that time but KFC but I hope they don't sue us but the root is still the same so that's what I want to point out that while the examples May differ the the root is still the same yeah yes thank you um Emily can give us a few lessons or conclusions that we have picked from this lesson of ours today okay so um we've learned a lot with this lesson and I'd like to like point it out with a few points uh the conclusions that we came up with uh first of all we should uh find God we should use the Bible as our way amen uh we find this in Matthew 4 verse 1 to 11 the whole summary it gives us uh it shows us how we can use the Bible as our weapon when we read the Bible every day and pray to God um we are able to use the Bible as a weapon because we can see from Jesus's example he used to say it is written it is written so when we have the Bible the word of God in our hearts we're able to use it as our weapon we can also know that God's word is Comfort to us it gives us hope peace and reassurance that we can find uh comfort in God yes and we also find God's word as our foundation for transformation because after facing all these Temptations and we find soless in God we'll be able to be transformed from our bad habits and become better in life thank you so much I think we can conclude and say that we cannot do any of this in our own strength but we need Christ and we need the word um I'd ask Elijah to pray for us as we con our lesson thank you very much let's believe in pray our can Heavenly Master we come before you this day thank you for the gift of life thank you for enabling us to convert to study your lesson and discuss your lesson and also learn from one another on what you have for us this uh day for whatever Mage that you given uh we have been able to discuss May someone be able to learn from it and may it be able to transform their lives to able to draw closer and closer to you may you give them the strength to resist every Temptation the Devil May throw and may you guard their mind May draw closer and closer to you thank you for we know that you have heard us we pred believing and CH in name amen am amen thank you for joining thank you

[277.9s] able but will with the Temptation also
[280.4s] make a way to escape that you may be
[282.5s] able to Bear it so today we will see how
[284.9s] we'll be able to overcome The
[286.2s] Temptations that we face on a daily
[288.5s] basis and we pray that you may be
[290.7s] blessed by this lesson
[293.8s] amen we will sing a hym give me the
[297.0s] Bible

[318.5s] radi Jesus came to seek and save the
[323.6s] Lord give me the Bible holy m is shining
[330.2s] thy light shall guide me in the narrow
[335.6s] way and
[337.8s] pro
[340.2s] and till
[343.2s] shall in
[347.0s] etal we will get a prayer from yes I'm
[350.4s] bless our head for of prayer thank you
[353.0s] God for bringing us here thank you Lord
[354.6s] for the lesson as we study it may you
[356.5s] open our hearts to you this I pray in
[358.6s] Jesus name amen
[360.2s] amen um our main scripture for this
[364.0s] lesson is from Matthew 4 verse 1 to 11
[368.1s] and through this we are going to be
[369.3s] looking at Jesus Temptations so the
[372.3s] lesson introduces us to an array of
[374.8s] temptations that are there in our world
[377.1s] today and in the past lives um during
[380.8s] Adam and Eve's time it was Temptations
[384.1s] of appetites during David and Solomon's
[386.7s] time it was tempations of last and
[390.3s] in our time today unfortunately it's the
[392.3s] Temptation Of Technology yes and for us
[396.5s] technology has become such a big thing
[398.9s] for us to a point sometimes we even have
[401.7s] online names that are not our true names
[405.2s] we are literally trying to hide our
[406.8s] identity behind social media and this is
[410.3s] because the devil is really doing his
[413.7s] best to try and do away with God's Plan
[417.1s] of Salvation and it's such as that thing
[420.5s] but through this lesson we'll be able to
[422.2s] get Hope on how Jesus overcame and how
[424.8s] we too can overcome in the same way so
[428.2s] we will move on to Matthew 4 from verse
[430.6s] 1 to 11 and if n is willing he can give
[436.1s] us a summary of what he thinks is
[437.8s] happening here um yes um I am willing hi
[441.8s] viewers the summary of uh our scripture
[446.2s] reading today is on the temptation of
[448.7s] Jesus now Jesus um was in the wilderness
[453.1s] taken by the spirit of God Into the
[454.8s] Wilderness where he had was fasting for
[457.6s] 40 days and 40 nights after which the
[460.4s] devil came to tempt
[462.4s] him now um the first um Temptation um is
[467.2s] to command the stones to turn into bread
[470.3s] the
[471.1s] second um
[473.1s] Temptation he the devil takes Jesus to
[475.8s] the Pinnacle of the temple and asks him
[478.5s] to throw himself down and uh the third
[482.1s] temptation
[483.7s] is uh Christ the devil takes Christ to a
[487.2s] high mountain and shows him all the
[489.6s] nations and says if you will fall down
[493.8s] and worship me I will give all this to
[496.1s] you and you see in each and every one of
[498.1s] those Temptations um Christ resisted how
[502.5s] did he resist that's why we here so
[505.2s] that's a summary that's a summary of
[507.6s] what Matthew 4 from vers 1 11 is um and
[511.2s] we actually see that Jesus was led to
[513.6s] the Wilderness by the spirit right and
[515.8s] Jesus was in the wilderness um preparing
[518.7s] for his ministry because we see that
[520.4s] Jesus had his ministry here for three
[522.3s] years on Earth and it was the Lord
[525.0s] Spirit leing him to the Wilderness so he
[527.1s] was not there by mistake it wasn't a
[529.0s] mistake that Christ was in the
[530.8s] wilderness but we are still seeing that
[533.0s] Satan comes to
[534.5s] destroy um God's Plan of
[537.4s] Salvation and you see that Jesus
[539.9s] overcame as n has told us and EM here
[543.7s] Will Tell Us of the number of ways that
[546.6s] we are given into Temptations
[551.6s] days
[553.2s] so um we have being tempted um in
[557.1s] various ways in our lives today um there
[561.1s] are so many ways uh first of all there's
[564.4s] appetite we the there physical craving
[568.9s] appetite We crave for food We crave for
[572.7s] you know things that we're not even
[574.4s] supposed to eat according to the Bible
[576.7s] but we eat them because we we have the
[579.2s] craving physical appetite we also become
[583.6s] um addicted to media and entertainment
[587.9s] and we tend to over consume them and we
[591.3s] we get addicted there's also uh
[594.7s] presumption we try and test God we test
[598.7s] God to take risks with our sinful
[601.5s] behaviors you do a sin today and you you
[605.5s] say h see here God will forgive me
[609.0s] eventually I'll just do it I'll go pray
[611.4s] about it and God will forgive me we
[614.0s] tempt god without knowing at times and
[618.1s] then we are also um facing Pride when we
[621.8s] are working in our work spaces people um
[625.1s] tend to have the self-exaltation you
[628.4s] want to be in a certain position in your
[631.3s] company at school and then you forget
[634.4s] that there's God you become so self
[637.4s] exalted you forget God is the one who
[639.9s] brought you to that position you in yeah
[644.0s] um yes um it's actually quite
[646.1s] unfortunate that sometimes we get so
[648.4s] overtaken by all the Temptations in the
[650.8s] world but we have been given hope that
[654.7s] um Christ himself had he fac this
[656.8s] temptation the devil was actually there
[659.7s] at at Christ's weakest point he was
[662.0s] tempting Christ but Christ was able to
[664.5s] control all his um all that he was able
[669.1s] to control and he was able to overcome
[671.3s] and we are told even us in our own human
[673.0s] strength we can't overcome but through
[675.8s] Christ and how he was able to overcome
[677.7s] we too have the hope that we can
[679.6s] overcome these Temptations as well and
[682.0s] Elijah can give us some ways in which
[684.1s] you can practically overcome the devil's
[686.0s] Temptations in our lives
[687.5s] today thank you very much for that
[690.1s] before before I answer the question I
[692.3s] think that's why in the book of Isaiah
[694.9s] we have the verse come now let's reason
[697.2s] together this discussion has opened my
[699.6s] eyes to the third tempation where the
[702.4s] devil as as as as our brother said the
[704.9s] devil was uh Jesus was taken and shown
[707.8s] mountains Hills and everything and said
[710.0s] if you worship me I will give you this
[713.4s] it is it is it is so ambiguous because
[715.3s] you know everything was created by God
[717.4s] but then the Devil comes and says if
[719.3s] worship me I'll give you it is like he
[721.7s] was saying it was his I don't know if
[724.2s] you're shocked by that because I'm like
[725.5s] I'm questioning myself how does the
[727.4s] devil now come acknowledge that these
[729.1s] things are mine yet us as Christians
[731.5s] acknowledge that these things were
[733.0s] created by
[735.2s] God despite that uh I love Hebrews
[739.7s] 4:15 which says for we have not an high
[744.0s] priest which cannot be touched to the
[746.2s] feeling of our
[747.4s] infirmities but was in all points
[749.7s] tempted like as we are yet without
[754.0s] sin first of all we have Toge that we
[757.1s] are sinners we are products of sin but
[761.0s] then you have Christ who was tempted but
[764.5s] did not commit
[766.1s] anything how then was he able to do that
[768.8s] now coming to your to your question I
[771.6s] think we all need to have a sense of the
[775.4s] scriptures sense of the word of God
[778.3s] because when you read Matthew uh chter 4
[781.8s] it says how how able to overcome the of
[785.0s] the devil was it is written it is
[788.5s] written it is
[790.5s] written you can't confidently say that
[793.6s] it is written yet you yourself haven't
[796.8s] studied the scriptures 2 Timothy
[800.4s] 2:15 uh which I I'll paraphrase which
[803.2s] says study to show thyself approved a
[806.6s] Workman rightfully dividing the word of
[808.7s] Truth M you yourself need to study you
[811.6s] need to build your spiritual reserves
[814.5s] and your spiritual reserves have to be
[817.4s] always have something we all need
[819.8s] something in our banks especially at
[821.5s] this time time when the economy is hard
[823.8s] you can't just go and clean your out
[825.5s] your bank and say I'm taking out my
[828.0s] money all of it you need some money to
[830.0s] be in your bank in the same way you need
[832.0s] to have scripture in your bank account
[835.6s] you need to have the word of God such
[837.0s] that when the Devil comes to you you you
[839.2s] can say it is
[841.3s] written am then and can I say I'm sorry
[844.2s] I'm sorry for jumping in and there's a
[845.9s] very important point that you brought
[847.0s] about on while we acknowledge that all
[851.0s] things are christs the devil um is
[854.0s] saying all things things are mine right
[856.3s] and I can give them to you and just I
[858.3s] think to answer your question
[861.0s] um when God created the world he put all
[865.5s] things eventually he created man and
[868.1s] gave man
[869.9s] Dominion now when man sinned man yielded
[874.3s] his Dominion to the devil yes now Christ
[878.3s] came back and and that's when when
[881.2s] Christ comes there a part in the Bible I
[882.5s] may not be able to call but he says you
[884.4s] know the prince of this world has
[886.1s] nothing in me when man sin the devil
[888.2s] became the prince of this world and he
[891.1s] be he puts everything under his Dominion
[893.3s] when man sinned but now when Christ came
[896.5s] and eventually overcame by by giving his
[899.6s] life as paradoxical as that sound he
[902.9s] reclaimed that dominion and that's why I
[906.1s] think and that's why I feel like I have
[907.9s] to speak up that this this temptation
[910.5s] was so critical because had Christ fell
[913.5s] and worshiped the devil then he would
[915.7s] have permanently seeded Dominion of this
[918.7s] world to the devil but the fact that he
[921.0s] resisted and eventually overcame on the
[923.4s] cross then Christ rightly took back that
[926.8s] Authority and Christ became God over all
[930.0s] and that is why when he come in the
[931.2s] second time he comes and as king and
[933.8s] priest to Reign because he claimed that
[937.2s] Dominion I'm sorry I had to I felt it
[939.8s] was interesting thank you so much um for
[942.9s] that elah before you go I I I think
[945.8s] brings out the aspect that the lon also
[948.0s] tries to bring these Temptations were
[951.5s] were not just mere Temptations as the
[953.5s] lesson writer says there were Fierce
[955.4s] Temptations they were nothing could ever
[958.4s] you yourself as me as Elijah would have
[961.2s] been there and I could have been able to
[963.2s] handle it I have not eaten for 40 days
[967.0s] you're telling me to turn stones to
[969.5s] bread and you have the power to turn
[971.9s] those stones into
[974.1s] bread thank you that's I don't want to
[976.2s] put that across thank you um and just as
[979.5s] you guys have said Satan was
[982.7s] literally using he was bringing Christ
[987.5s] down by saying if you are the son of of
[990.6s] God do this and Christ is he's a very
[994.9s] powerful example to us because Christ
[997.4s] was able to resist he knows that he has
[1000.1s] all power literally all power to turn
[1003.5s] those stones into bread to fall down and
[1005.3s] the angels would catch him but
[1007.8s] he had he knows the word Christ is the
[1010.8s] word and he knows his word and he said
[1013.1s] you know what no this I will not fish
[1015.1s] this ination but I will attack these
[1017.3s] inations with what God has promised and
[1020.1s] what God has given us in his word amen
[1022.6s] and I think it is for us to know that
[1026.4s] God has given um given us his word as a
[1028.8s] lamp unto our feet and a light unto our
[1030.2s] path and there's no point in this world
[1032.3s] that God will leave you alone if you
[1035.1s] decides to use his word and hide it in
[1037.8s] your heart he will walk with you through
[1039.9s] any tempation that it is that you're
[1042.2s] facing amen we are also told in James we
[1045.3s] delit James 4 verse 7 and 8
[1054.4s] it's it
[1056.3s] says submit yourself then to God resist
[1060.6s] the devil and he will slee from you come
[1063.3s] near to God and he will come near to you
[1066.2s] wash your hands you Sinners and purify
[1069.8s] your hearts you
[1071.5s] double-minded thank you so much Emily um
[1074.6s] we actually told that if you resist the
[1077.5s] devil he will free from you that is all
[1079.6s] you need to do you being rooted and
[1082.0s] firmly Dred in God's words even at your
[1085.3s] weakest point the devil will literally
[1088.2s] flee from you and we have so much hope
[1090.8s] because if Christ was able to overcome
[1092.5s] we too can overcome amen um we will move
[1096.2s] to
[1098.3s] Ephesians chapter 6 verse 10 to 13
[1102.4s] before that Elijah will love before
[1104.8s] before you go there you bring out the
[1106.2s] aspect that Christ had all the power to
[1108.9s] just the word to just speak or even just
[1112.5s] think of it and things will have turn
[1115.2s] soon will have turned to bread the
[1116.9s] angels have come and and and picked him
[1119.0s] up but he choose not
[1121.7s] to I'm not sure if if if this was what
[1124.8s] the author of The him wanted but as as
[1127.0s] you saying that the him 600 came to
[1130.0s] mind I I'll just read the the line that
[1133.4s] I want to apply hold fast till I come
[1136.9s] the danger is great sleep not as do
[1140.2s] others Be watchful and wait and I think
[1142.6s] that is what we can think from this
[1143.7s] lesson if you can just hold fast and
[1146.0s] wait for Christ to come because as we
[1148.0s] have alluded earlier The Temptations are
[1150.0s] Fierce the danger is great yes hold fast
[1153.2s] till Christ comes amen thank you thank
[1156.3s] you Ephesians 6 Ephesians 6 from verse
[1159.8s] 10 to 13 okay it
[1163.4s] says finally be strong in the Lord and
[1166.6s] in the in the strength of his might put
[1169.0s] on the whole armor of God that you may
[1171.4s] be able to stand against the schemes of
[1173.6s] the devil for we do do not wrestle
[1177.3s] against flesh and blood but against the
[1179.4s] rulers against the authorities against
[1182.2s] the cosmic Powers over this present
[1185.5s] Darkness against the spiritual forces of
[1188.3s] evil in the Heavenly places therefore
[1191.1s] take up the whole armor of God that you
[1193.6s] may be able to withstand in the evil day
[1196.6s] and having done all to stand
[1200.8s] firm um we're reminded
[1203.8s] that we need to
[1207.8s] always uh have the word of God with us
[1212.1s] we need to for us to face our
[1214.8s] Temptations we also have to be prepared
[1218.0s] by having the helmet of God of salvation
[1222.0s] of God the helmet is normally used the
[1225.3s] normal helmet that we know it was used
[1228.0s] for it is used for protecting the vital
[1232.4s] organs it is used so as a Christian our
[1235.8s] helmet is the Assurance of Salvation And
[1238.7s] it is an impen
[1241.0s] impenetrable defense against the enemy
[1244.3s] attacks and the enemy to us is Satan
[1247.2s] that's why we need to always have Jesus
[1251.4s] in our hearts we need to pray every day
[1254.0s] we have to read our Bible every day so
[1257.2s] that whenever we we're being being faced
[1259.1s] by Temptations we'll be having the word
[1261.2s] of God in our hearts and we'll be able
[1263.3s] to Proclaim it and every time we facing
[1266.8s] challenges we'll be able to seek counsel
[1269.4s] to the Bible and ask what um Solutions
[1274.2s] it gives to our problems and by
[1277.2s] continuing to embrace Embrace Jesus
[1279.8s] every day we we're able to keep the
[1282.8s] helmet of salvation as a protection
[1286.0s] against the enemy amen yes amen
[1289.2s] thank you so much for that Emily um I
[1292.3s] loved what the lesson and writer told us
[1295.2s] that our minds are a constant
[1298.8s] Battlefield and if you look back to how
[1303.5s] most of us have never been to war but if
[1306.4s] you look back to how the soldiers would
[1308.9s] put on the armor they would put on
[1311.3s] everything F the breastplate literally
[1312.8s] carry The Sword and the last thing that
[1314.3s] would go on was the helmet and this is
[1317.7s] because the helmet is is protecting the
[1319.2s] most important part of our body which is
[1320.8s] your brain because once your brain is
[1323.2s] damaged there's no there's no coming out
[1325.7s] of that and this is what the devil has
[1330.4s] usually he's it's what he's using
[1332.3s] against us he's using our minds against
[1334.0s] us the devil knows that he can use you
[1337.3s] at your weakest point and these are your
[1339.8s] thoughts at your weakest point is when
[1341.2s] you're like you know what I'm not worthy
[1342.9s] I can't do this um if the devil tells me
[1347.3s] to go into a
[1349.7s] certain to fall into a certain
[1351.4s] Temptation I will fall into it and that
[1354.2s] is why we are being told that the helmet
[1356.3s] of salvation literally needs to come in
[1358.5s] it comes in last even when we read the
[1360.1s] word
[1361.3s] and the helmet of salvation means we are
[1364.4s] literally choosing Jesus every day it
[1368.0s] means you have to as as well as you need
[1369.8s] to read your word you need to be firly
[1371.7s] grounded and by choosing him every day
[1375.0s] we are able to keep on this helmet of
[1377.1s] salvation and it will be the armor of
[1379.1s] protection around us for the rest of our
[1381.5s] lives and the devil will literally not
[1383.9s] be able to to come and attack you
[1390.4s] yes if I can just step in when you when
[1393.2s] the lesson writer
[1394.8s] describes the mind being constant viral
[1398.6s] I think it's uh Professor P usually says
[1402.0s] of All Through the Ages it has always
[1403.8s] been the Battle of their minds now you
[1405.8s] can take that literally in terms of how
[1407.8s] the soldiers used to fight because they
[1409.8s] had tactics on how to attack you had the
[1412.6s] gorilla attacks hit and was it hit and
[1416.0s] run not and run but it's more of gorilla
[1420.1s] Ware basically but now they were to
[1423.6s] protect their minds to avoid them being
[1426.8s] shot or being attacked from being being
[1428.9s] hit by something in their heads which
[1431.1s] will either cause a concussion someone
[1433.2s] just getting a hemorrage which will be
[1435.4s] patal at the end of the day which can
[1436.8s] lead to death but then
[1439.2s] when you look at the Battleground as in
[1442.2s] the mind we are trying to protect our
[1444.4s] minds this whole quarter or this this
[1447.2s] this whole lesson is all about our
[1449.6s] mental
[1450.6s] health if we remove the word uh me
[1454.0s] Health in it it's all about the mind the
[1456.3s] mind yeah if I'm able to guard my mind
[1458.2s] if I'm able to ensure that my mind is
[1460.6s] protected I can be able to resist
[1463.2s] temptation if I don't protect my mind
[1466.2s] and I I I I I allow every everything to
[1468.8s] come to me and filtered filtered
[1471.3s] everything just comes to me The Way It
[1472.6s] Is My Mind will be
[1474.6s] corrupted once it is
[1477.0s] corrupted I in myself cannot resist
[1480.2s] temptation thank you thank you for that
[1482.7s] Elijah um I'd like to ask do you think
[1486.5s] we have the Assurance of God's salvation
[1492.6s] today I think we have the Assurance of
[1496.4s] God's salvation today
[1500.6s] I want
[1502.0s] to answer it a bit differently yes based
[1505.2s] on a question that I had in my mind as I
[1509.0s] was as I was reflecting upon our
[1511.2s] discussions here and the question is the
[1514.6s] background of the question is Christ was
[1517.3s] led to the
[1519.6s] Wilderness by the spirit of
[1522.4s] God and then the devil found him and
[1524.4s] tempted him
[1526.8s] so as we walk walk you know in the light
[1530.1s] that God gives
[1531.6s] us are we susceptible to Temptations
[1535.0s] based on what we studying today the
[1536.6s] answer is is yes we are yes we are yes
[1542.2s] now then
[1544.2s] what then I um and then what here is I
[1547.7s] remember a verse in the Bible that says
[1549.7s] therefore have no temptation uh have
[1552.1s] overcome you but that such as common to
[1553.6s] man but God is faithful who will not
[1555.0s] allow you to be tempted above or beyond
[1557.6s] that which you able to Bear but will
[1559.9s] with that Temptation provide a way out
[1563.2s] amen so yes to your question that we can
[1569.1s] have the Assurance of Salvation why
[1571.8s] because another verse the Bible says
[1573.9s] that he will give his angels charge over
[1577.4s] you to keep you in all your ways so yes
[1580.4s] despite the world that you live in yes
[1582.1s] despite the Temptations that we are
[1584.2s] susceptible to we can overcome overcome
[1588.7s] but um another question that I've had is
[1592.5s] um are there choices that we make that
[1595.6s] also lead us to Temptation outside God's
[1598.5s] word allow me to leave it at that maybe
[1601.2s] you'll ask that question to
[1603.7s] someone I feel
[1605.9s] like yes we Face Temptations
[1609.4s] outside yes sometimes we choose to face
[1612.1s] the Temptations I feel so cuz if
[1616.3s] you um if you you know your triggers yes
[1620.0s] you should know your triggers what
[1621.9s] triggers you into being tempted look at
[1624.9s] your environment are they is it your
[1626.8s] friend is it your phone are you always
[1630.2s] on phone is it triggering you to do the
[1633.5s] wrong thing so I feel like at times we
[1636.7s] choose you and at times yeah it's
[1639.6s] Temptations come to us and that's why we
[1642.8s] need to put on the arm of God we need to
[1647.3s] find comfort in God and tell him our
[1650.1s] stories and troubles and he'll be able
[1652.3s] to help us overcome our Temptations yes
[1657.0s] thank you so much for that Emily and a
[1659.8s] verse that I constantly go back to is
[1662.3s] John 16:33 it says these things I have
[1665.7s] spoken unto you that in me you might
[1669.0s] have peace in the world you shall have
[1670.8s] tribulation but be of good chair I have
[1673.0s] overcome the
[1674.4s] world we Christ went through
[1676.8s] tribulations we've seen through his
[1679.5s] Temptations and throughout his life here
[1681.9s] on Earth throughout his ministry there
[1683.7s] were still many times where there was so
[1687.0s] much happening the Pharisees were
[1689.1s] against him but Christ was still able to
[1691.6s] overcome until he died and he took over
[1694.8s] Dain from what Satan thinks he has power
[1698.0s] over and I think Christ has given us so
[1700.6s] much hope that no matter what it is that
[1703.1s] we are going through in this world he
[1704.4s] has overcome it and he is literally
[1707.8s] sated at the right hand side of God
[1710.0s] interceding for us there as n has told
[1715.4s] us Christ is there for us as sometimes
[1718.3s] we put ourselves in those positions but
[1720.4s] there is still hope you can still come
[1722.0s] out of it don't say I've put myself now
[1724.4s] I will stay here no it's you need to be
[1727.5s] self-aware that even if I put myself in
[1730.2s] this temptation come out of it I mean as
[1732.6s] well as you have your triggers know that
[1734.3s] this triggers you and cut it off we have
[1737.2s] talked about even social media if you
[1739.2s] know it's a trigger for you put limits
[1741.1s] to social media put limits on your phone
[1744.8s] um if you know if it's a certain group
[1746.4s] of friends do away with those friends
[1749.1s] and God will give you others it's things
[1752.1s] you pray about you pray over and it's
[1754.8s] not just going about this life
[1757.5s] blindly I'm sorry for for I have to I
[1760.6s] would like to to to to just point out
[1763.1s] that
[1764.4s] um while the examples of Temptation are
[1769.1s] different the I don't know if the word
[1771.3s] is the nature is the same for example
[1774.7s] for Christ it may have been you know
[1776.8s] turning stones into bread or I will give
[1779.6s] you all these kingdoms
[1781.5s] right but if you look at it the the call
[1785.4s] there is all about have no other gods
[1788.6s] before me yes so the god that the devil
[1791.5s] was presenting to Christ was himself
[1793.5s] because he says Fall Down and Worship me
[1795.5s] yes but for us our God is Maybe social
[1798.9s] media Our God may be our friends God may
[1803.3s] be my girlfriend my God may be but in
[1806.0s] the end the the the the the root I don't
[1810.2s] know what word to best describe the root
[1812.4s] Foundation is the foundation is right
[1815.1s] when it comes to you know last for then
[1817.2s] it may be bread now it may be fries or
[1820.4s] or or sausages which are not they doing
[1822.5s] that time but KFC but I hope they don't
[1827.5s] sue us
[1828.6s] but the root is still the same so that's
[1831.7s] what I want to point out that while the
[1833.0s] examples May differ the the root is
[1836.0s] still the same yeah yes thank
[1839.2s] you um Emily can give us a few lessons
[1843.7s] or conclusions that we have picked from
[1845.5s] this lesson of ours
[1847.8s] today okay so um we've learned a lot
[1853.5s] with this lesson
[1855.2s] and I'd like to like point it out with a
[1858.6s] few points uh the conclusions that we
[1861.9s] came up with uh first of all we should
[1865.6s] uh find God we should use the Bible as
[1868.0s] our way amen uh we find this in Matthew
[1871.6s] 4 verse 1 to 11 the whole summary it
[1875.3s] gives us uh it shows us how we can use
[1877.6s] the Bible as our weapon when we read the
[1880.4s] Bible every day and pray to God um we
[1884.2s] are able to use the Bible as a weapon
[1886.0s] because we can see from Jesus's example
[1888.8s] he used to say it is written it is
[1891.0s] written so when we have the Bible the
[1892.7s] word of God in our hearts we're able to
[1895.4s] use it as our weapon we can also know
[1898.8s] that God's word is Comfort to us it
[1902.8s] gives us hope peace and reassurance that
[1905.9s] we can find uh comfort in God yes and we
[1910.6s] also find God's word as our foundation
[1913.2s] for transformation because after facing
[1915.9s] all these Temptations and we find soless
[1919.0s] in God we'll be able to be transformed
[1921.8s] from our bad habits and become better in
[1925.5s] life thank you so much I think we can
[1928.2s] conclude and say that we cannot do any
[1930.0s] of this in our own strength but we need
[1932.4s] Christ and we need the word um I'd ask
[1935.0s] Elijah to pray for us as we con our
[1937.4s] lesson thank you very much let's believe
[1939.7s] in pray our can Heavenly Master we come
[1943.4s] before you this day thank you for the

[1952.8s] uh day for whatever Mage that you given
[1956.5s] uh we have been able to discuss May
[1958.7s] someone be able to learn from it and may
