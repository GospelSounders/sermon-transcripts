FULL TRANSCRIPT:
Um, I want to thank thank the Lord for all of us and uh invite anyone who has visited us including maybe the ministers of the gospel in our mid east other than the church pastors and the families who have come. Do we have any minister of the gospel who has come to our congregation? Wherever you are, you may rise so that we recognize you. We thank them. We are happy to have ministers of the gospel either who are visiting or on transit in our community in our congregation. Are you there? If you are there, please rise. Thank you so much. We have one at the back there. You are welcome uh to fellowship with us. May God bless and keep you and bless your ministry. Friends, this week we have had the first whole week of prayer and fasting. We began on Sunday and we dealt with pray like Daniel faithful foundations. That was the theme. It was so because this is the beginning of the third quarter and having our strategic focus which is themed rooted and growing. We have dealt for the last six months with the rooting and building, clearing the rubble and how in the first term we could grow in this aspect of being rooted in this third quarter. We are looking at the family and therefore the faithful foundations that we are looking at are actually the foundations that make families strong. the foundation that will cement, bind souls, knit them together so that they live in harmony and prepare for eternity. This is the way we will walk for these three months that are ahead of us. And so it coincided with prayer and fasting because every beginning of the quarter, that Sabbath is prayer and fasting Sabbath. And so the theme has been pray like Daniel. And we got our lessons and we followed Daniel right from the time he stepped in Babylon with his uh four colleagues and the many including the king and the many who had been carried into Babylon. being exiled from the comfort that he had, being exiled from the place he got used to. Yet we see him and his companions not winning, not drifting back. Instead, even in a foreign land with this traumatizing experience, they stuck close to God and they called upon the Lord by standing also on the principles that they had learned in their early years. And so friends, we have found the secret that we can pray through uncertain troubles moments. We can pray with assurance of the kingdom. We can pray into the kingdom. We can pray with our prayer partners. We can intercede for our friends as country or people. Friends, we looked at this until when we came to Wednesday, we started looking now at the church and we looked at how the family in the church can be like Jesus Christ who says he has been exposed to the church by the ministers of the gospel so that those who are believers may be prepared and appear before the Lord without wringle or any spot. And so the church as a bride exposed to Christ, we all ought to recognize that we are a family, a family that God has come to purchase, to redeem. I invite you to now come with me to build on this faithful foundation to look at how as we saw on Wednesday that we are called to build on the love of God which is his character. And then we looked at the grace and we saw that you and I without the grace of God that builds our faith that leads us to see the love of God in its fullness. Because while we were yet sinners, Christ died for the ungodly. And the love of God constrains us so that we are new creation. In this new creation, we become partners with God. And so in this we see that you and I because of the love of God that love when we understand it then we can love fellow believers and above all we can show love to our spouses. We can express true concern because we know that we have one who has expressed true concern and has lifted us up from where we were we were to where he has brought us to be as believers. In this this love is what makes God have grace. And so as families in in in August we shall look at the grace of God and in September is where I'm concluding today by setting this launching this so that we can look forward and in every departmental devotion and in every uh meeting and gathering even in our homes. Let us work with this strategic focus so that we can grow together towards it. We shall therefore in September be looking at this uh faithful foundation family on mission. And the text that we are uh going to delve in is Joshua 24. Joshua 24. Allow me to say, brethren, as families, God brings us together. He unites us with those he allows us to interact. And when we have this love building, when we have this emotions, we have this uh these feelings that are harmonious with one another, we end up getting married. I want to say even as we look at the Old Testament and the New Testament families as a church we have good examples, men and women who have lived their life, who have guided their families well. Men and women like Elder Elias Oola. Even as we continue to comfort the family, we know that this man led his life, loved his wife, loved and cared for his family. He did the best. And like Joshua, he spoke and he was ready and said he would be among those who will be in heaven because that place that has been prepared, he himself was preparing himself for that kingdom and he was ready. Today as we come to this text, I want to say may the Lord continue to play to bless to comfort the families who have had to mourn and grieve their loved ones. But we have to live. We continue to leave you and I. And because we continue to live, we must learn these secrets which Joshua is urging the whole nation to turn and serve the Lord. Sorry. As it has been stated by the children ministry in the children's sermon, we do not have any we do not have to have a new foundation set. We are called by scripture to an already established foundation. The foundation already laid is Jesus Christ. A Christ centered foundation provides stability, resilience, and purpose, enabling couples of families to thrive together in love and faith. And so as we have this foundation, everything else, as houses, as families, as marriages, relationship requires foundations upon which the two may agree on how they will handle matters. At times life can be entered into or relationship can be entered into with totally different views and with different intentions and motives. But as believers, the Lord is telling us that relationship and marriage ought to be entered and be built upon the firm foundation which is bibilical guidance. And so as we build on scripture, as we build this foundation on the love of God that is revealed in scripture, as we get bound by grace, as we will see in August, you and I are called to unite unite together and build a firm foundation on mission. Because when we love one another as spouses, when we raise our children with grace, when we demonstrate the love of God in the family, then we are better prepared to go for mission in a united form. And so this three months as a church even as we have launched this strategic focus by also praying like Daniel. Daniel who was raised in that home and from his young early years he learned how to pray. Today the youth in the church we ought to remind ourself that yes the graces the love we have seen we have found from our parents that is demonstrated in the church by the believers in the church ought to prepare us to be like Daniel and to be like Joshua who learn from such forerunners as Daniel as Moses himself as even the patriots and prophets and the kings and he knew that the Lord is faithful because of the Lord's faithfulness. Joshua as he came to this text in Joshua chapter 24 which I invite you to come with me. We will look at three C's in Joshua 24. What we see in Joshua 24 is a man who is old. His strength is winning. He has led with Moses. He was there to support him through and through. He has led the children of Israel to gross the river Jordan. He has fought and and seen the faithfulness of God in bringing down cities that were fortified. He had divided the land to the children of Israel. He had been told, "Be courageous because I am with you. Do not turn to the left or to the right, but be faithful. Follow the Lord's commandments." Hallelujah. And this Joshua who had seen the hand of God, this Joshua who had seen the grace of God by not destroying the children of Israel who murmured knew that the Lord indeed is gracious and is full of love, that He understood that in this love of God, in this grace of God, therefore the Lord had used him, had blessed him, and he had crossed into the land of Canaan. He had understood how God interacts not as a mighty God in heaven but he comes down to personal needs wherever he prayed with the burdens of leadership. He saw God guiding and answering his prayers. He therefore formed a personal connection with God. And in this personal connection with God, he wondered as he knew his time was up, he would be dying any time. He wondered how would he prepare the children of Israel to continue serving this personal loving God who though is so suffering so high lifted up the King of Kings mighty in power yet he wanted personal connection with those who are his subjects in is therefore the man of God giving his final address to the children of Israel. The text tells us that then Joshua gathered all the tribes of Israel to Shachcham and called for the elders of Israel, for their heads, for their judges, and for their officers, and they presented themselves before God. Joshua gathered all the tribes of Israel to Shum. But then the scripture is keen to state who were called. Those who were called are said to be the heads of the community, the leaders, the judges. Number two, the calling is the calling for the heads of family. And then thirdly, it was a call to a historic place, a place known as Sich. This second, this place is where Abraham had set up an altar. He bought that place. He built an altar. It is this place when you read chapter 12 all the way. It was where the patriarchs came and built or renewed the altar that Abraham and even Isaac and Jacob himself. Even when he was running, the first place he sought comfort, the first place he sought to lay his head in darkness as a futive was in this place. It is in this place in chapter 35 of Genesis when he had come back from uh where he had run to in his uncle's place. As he came back, the Lord reminded him and said, "You I appear to you. I promise to protect and keep you." and you pledged that you would give a tithe when you come back. Now God reminded Jacob and told Jacob, "Prepare so that you can appear and build me an altar at Seum." this place when Jacob was running and when God interacted with him he called the name Bethl. It is in this place where it had all this historical connection, rich heritage that Joshua is calling the tribes of Israel and calling their leaders to come ahead, sit closer to him, even as he reminded them in the following text. He reminded these people of that place and the God that had been worshiped in Sheckchim by with Abra by Abraham by their forefathers. And so he enumerates how God called Abraham, how God led and kept the children of Israel in b in Egypt, how the Lord was faithful in leading them even to the promised land. And therefore he was telling them that they were specially made and called by God. Hallelujah. We see here friends that after telling the story of what God had done, telling and calling these people, the Lord is calling us to a mission. He's calling us to serve him. He's calling you and me. He's calling you as a leader. He's calling you as a family head. He's calling you to the place where there is heritage. There is holy history. It is in this place of such that the the man of God is presenting to the children of Israel the claims of God. And so we go to the second point, the choice. The choice that is the second sea here because of who God was to Israel, because of what God had made the Israelites to become, because of God choosing to perform the miracles that he performed in order to take these people to a place of freedom. Now that they had settled, that God had kept his covenant that God has kept his promise by giving them the promised land. Then this prophet Joshua is asking these people who have witnessed they had eaten the mana. They had been protected by the pillar of cloud. They had felt warm at night in the desert because that cloud turned into warm by night. They had drank water from this rock that followed them. The Lord became all that they needed in the desert. They had witnessed it. And just like you and me, the Lord has demonstrated his love. Even when you are unfaithful, he is still keeping you alive. He is still showing you mercy. This God who has sent his only begotten son for for us to believe in for us to to to to trust and find hope build our faith. This is the God who is calling us and after calling us and showing us what he has done, he is now asking the children of Israel in vers 14. Let's come to vers 14. The word of the Lord says Joshua having enumerated all that he had enumerated, he now tells them, "Now therefore fear the Lord, serve him in sincerity and in truth, and put away the gods which your father served in the other side of the and in Egypt serve the Lord. But this service to the Lord was not by force. He tells them, "And if it seems evil to you to serve the Lord, choose for yourself this day whom you will serve, whether the gods who the gods which your father served that were on the other side of the river or the gods of the Amorite in whose land you dwell. But as for me, as for me, as for me and my house, we will serve the Lord. Joshua is not calling these people to a forceful choice. No, he is asking for a choice in sincerity, a choice in truth, a choice that they can serve the Lord from their heart. The word translated sincerity in Greek is like taking something that is transparent or taking a liquid that is clear and placing it before the rays of the sun or light. checking for impurities or anything. And when it is clear, that is said to be sincere. When there's no impurity, that is the word translated sincere. Sincerely, he's saying serve the Lord in truth. But this calling to choose, this calling to come as a whole team is a call that the Lord intends that his children, his people would not take it that it is by force. And so we find that this choice is based on God's claim on them. What he had done to make them to be who they were. Number two, that calling was sustained by free will or free will and willing. So they were free to choose. God does not force us into serving him. He shows us his credential, what he has done, what he wants to do for you. And that is when he's he he urges us to choose him. That is why the prophet is saying this God we serve is a God who does not force people. He doesn't one forced all our giants. No, he's not a tyrant. He is not a dictator. He's a God who demonstrate love. And after demonstrating love, he wins our confidence just as he mingled with all classes of people. And after wing mingling with them, he then beat them follow me. So the Lord is asking families in this third quarter, who are you going to serve? He's asking, "Have you recognized the blessings I've given you, the children, the the the jobs I've kept, the the the the education you have had, the privileges of the job that you have held, the the places you are staying, whatever the Lord has bestowed upon you, and he has kept you when others were failing, others were suffering from their choices. You have witnessed God's mercy. Who are you going to serve? That is the choice. And so we are called, brethren, to make our own mind, not forcefully, but by grace of God because he has demonstrated his love to serve him even to the last breath as our brother, our friend, our elder, mentor. Father to son, husband, cousin, your relative and fellow colleague serve the Lord. Elder Elias is one such who serve the Lord. And Joshua is calling us to make this point clear. Hallelujah. Now unto the third sea. Commitment. Commitment. At this point when Joshua had told these people, if you are not going to do it, I don't care what your choice is. The laws will be yours. He told them, "Me, as for me and my house, we will serve the Lord." This commitment was not onesided. Joshua was not asking for what he could not commit to doing himself. He was asking this nation, this chosen community to be sincere, to walk with God in sincerity, in truth and in spirit. He was calling them, reminding them of who they were and the claims of God upon them. And at this point, he's saying, "I am not asking you to do it while I'm not doing it. If you choose not, as for me and my house, we will serve the Lord." How blessed our families would be. How much harmony and peace and joy we would witness if each and every man would first and foremost commit to lead his family into the church and therefore ask the spouse to be as faithful as himself and as children to be as faithful as they are. The children would find level ground and they would walk and serve the Lord easily. Oh man of God, you were given that family to lead to serve the Lord. It is not to show off and for physical or whatever pleasures you choose to have. No, your wife was given to you by the Lord so that you raise up in harmony, patiently building one another, so that you can raise a generation of the servants of the Lord. Friends, we are called to commit to God. And Joshua is asking for this commitment, not requiring it of others, but he himself was prepared to go the whole way. If our if our families in the Christian homes that we have, if men stood to be true men, priest and made the choice as Joshua did, we would not be seeing the corruption that we are seeing. We would not be seeing the burning of schools and even uh police stations and the anger that is expressed as if people do not go to churches. We would not be threatened by Sabah Saba or whatever time that GNC's place because those GNC's and these young people and whoever would be marching to the places that they have said we are going and spend the time that they have listed. But isn't it corruption that you go beyond the places that you stated? Isn't it lying and trying to seek something else when you extend time beyond what you have said you would spend? Can we be honest? And so friends, a nation, if we want to be a people who are blessed, can we truly serve God and put those leaders who have missed us in check when we ourself are honest. You cannot ask of someone what you cannot do yourself. Freedom somebody has said is not free. And therefore time has come that we who are believers like Joshua ought to know that we have responsibilities over each other's rights even if we are demanding our own. For Joshua here, he said that calling these people he himself he said I and then he said my house. Then he turned to the community and said, "If you the community will not agree to serve the Lord, I am committing I and my family because I know each one of them. I and my family because I know how we have prayed and how we have spent time with everyone of my family members. We love the Lord. They serve the Lord. I know my family. Praise the Lord, friend. The Lord is calling you. Calling you to commit, to be sincere, to be truthful, to serve the Lord, not to be mingle and be mixed up. Our leaders, the Lord is calling us to serve the Lord. In as much as we fear for this nation, you leaders have the responsibility of being truthful, true to your calling. Keep the constitution and help this nation. Guide them. Be truthful. Even if you are a politician, whatever you are, let us call others into account. Praise the Lord. As I call the chesters to come up forward, I want to urge each and every one of us. There's a paper that you have gotten. As I go over what Joshua challenged the people on vers 16, what do we read? We read this and I want to ask that we go quickly. It says, "So the people answered and said, far be it from us that we should forsake the Lord to serve and to serve other gods." But then the man of God told them, you cannot you cannot serve God just because you have said it in your lips. The Lord is Jillas and says, "And the Lord drove out from before us all the people. The Lord's power made others run away." I want you to look with me vers 20. It says if you forsake the Lord and serve for rain gods then he will turn away and consume you. But these people said no we will serve the Lord. I just want to read verses 26 and 27. It says, "Then Joshua wrote these words in the book of the law of God, and he took a large stone and set it up there under the oak that was by the sanctuary of the Lord." And Joshua said to all the people, "Behold, this stone shall be a witness to you us, for it has heard all the words of the Lord, which he has spoken to us. It shall therefore be a witness to you, lest you deny your God." Praise the Lord. Joshua said, "You are a witness." And so I want to ask you if you are witness that you are going to serve the Lord today fill it and say how you are committing to serve the Lord. These papers I hope you have it. Let me see if you have it. Let's be serious with God because he's serious with us. If you have it, commit being obedient, covenanting, and having a statute, having a degree, write it, and then ordinance that you are committing to have a monument. Set up time, set up a place of worship. 

==================================================

TIMESTAMPED TRANSCRIPT:
[1.2s] Um,
[2.8s] I want to thank thank the Lord for all
[5.8s] of us and uh invite
[9.4s] anyone who has visited us including
[13.7s] maybe the ministers of the gospel in our
[16.9s] mid east other than the church pastors
[20.9s] and the families who have come. Do we
[23.5s] have any minister of the gospel who has
[27.0s] come to our congregation? Wherever you
[29.8s] are, you may rise so that we recognize
[32.2s] you. We thank them. We are happy to have
[36.0s] ministers of the gospel either who are
[38.0s] visiting or on transit in our community
[41.4s] in our congregation. Are you there? If
[44.9s] you are there, please rise. Thank you so
[47.3s] much. We have one at the back there. You
[49.8s] are welcome uh to fellowship with us.
[53.7s] May God bless and keep you and bless
[57.8s] your ministry.
[59.6s] Friends,
[61.7s] this week
[64.1s] we have had
[66.2s] the first whole week of prayer and
[71.0s] fasting.
[73.0s] We began on Sunday
[75.7s] and we dealt with pray like Daniel
[81.8s] faithful foundations.
[84.7s] That was the theme. It was so because
[89.0s] this is the beginning of the third
[93.2s] quarter
[95.0s] and having our strategic focus
[99.8s] which is
[102.8s] themed
[104.3s] rooted and growing.
[108.3s] We have dealt for the last
[113.2s] six months
[115.6s] with
[117.3s] the rooting and building,
[122.3s] clearing the rubble
[125.4s] and how in the first term we could grow
[130.2s] in this aspect of being rooted
[136.2s] in this third quarter.
[139.5s] We are looking at the family
[144.8s] and therefore the faithful foundations
[147.4s] that we are looking at are actually the
[152.9s] foundations that make families strong.
[158.0s] the foundation that will cement,
[163.4s] bind souls,
[166.1s] knit them together so that they
[171.0s] live in harmony and prepare for
[174.6s] eternity.
[177.1s] This is the way we will walk for these
[183.2s] three months that are ahead of us.
[187.9s] And so
[189.8s] it coincided with prayer and fasting
[195.3s] because every beginning of the quarter,
[200.5s] that Sabbath
[203.0s] is prayer and fasting Sabbath.
[206.9s] And so the theme has been pray like
[211.0s] Daniel.
[212.6s] And we got our lessons
[217.1s] and we followed Daniel
[220.6s] right from the time he stepped in
[224.6s] Babylon with his
[227.8s] uh four colleagues and the many
[230.4s] including the king and the many who had
[233.3s] been carried into Babylon. being exiled
[236.9s] from the comfort that he had, being
[240.7s] exiled from the place he got used to.
[244.6s] Yet we see him and his companions not
[251.5s] winning, not
[254.5s] drifting back. Instead, even in a
[257.8s] foreign land with this traumatizing
[261.1s] experience, they stuck close to God and
[265.7s] they called upon the Lord by standing
[270.1s] also on the principles that they had
[272.2s] learned
[274.3s] in their early years. And so friends, we
[278.9s] have found the secret that we can pray
[282.9s] through uncertain troubles moments. We
[286.5s] can pray with assurance of the kingdom.
[289.7s] We can pray into the kingdom. We can
[293.7s] pray with our prayer partners. We can
[297.1s] intercede
[299.0s] for our
[301.1s] friends
[303.0s] as country or people.
[307.2s] Friends, we looked at this until when we
[311.4s] came to Wednesday, we started looking
[315.5s] now at the
[318.2s] church
[319.9s] and we looked at how the family in the
[324.6s] church
[326.6s] can be like Jesus Christ who says he has
[332.8s] been exposed
[335.0s] to the church by the ministers of the
[338.1s] gospel so that those who are believers
[343.1s] may be prepared and appear before the
[346.6s] Lord without wringle or any spot.
[352.1s] And so the church
[355.8s] as a bride exposed to Christ,
[360.4s] we all ought to recognize that we are a
[365.8s] family, a family that God has come to
[371.7s] purchase, to redeem.
[374.7s] I invite you
[377.4s] to now come with me
[381.0s] to build on this faithful foundation
[385.4s] to look at how
[389.0s] as we saw on Wednesday
[392.4s] that we are called to build on the love
[397.8s] of God which is his character. And then
[401.1s] we looked at the grace
[403.9s] and we saw that you and I without the
[407.8s] grace of God that builds our faith
[412.7s] that leads us to see the love of God in
[416.4s] its fullness. Because while we were yet
[419.5s] sinners, Christ died for the ungodly.
[423.2s] And the love of God constrains us so
[426.2s] that we are new creation.
[429.4s] In this new creation, we become partners
[434.0s] with God. And so in this we see that you
[439.3s] and I because of the love of God that
[443.4s] love when we understand it then we can
[446.1s] love fellow
[449.0s] believers and above all we can show love
[453.0s] to our spouses.
[455.7s] We can express true concern because we
[461.3s] know that we have one who has expressed
[464.3s] true concern and has lifted us up from
[468.4s] where we were we were to where he has
[472.1s] brought us to be as believers. In this
[478.5s] this love is what makes God have grace.
[483.9s] And so as families
[487.0s] in in in August we shall look at the
[492.9s] grace of God and in September is where
[497.8s] I'm concluding today by setting this
[501.7s] launching this so that we can look
[504.5s] forward and in every departmental
[509.4s] devotion and in every uh meeting and
[513.7s] gathering even in our homes. Let us work
[517.8s] with this strategic focus so that we can
[521.0s] grow together towards it. We shall
[524.2s] therefore in September be looking at
[528.5s] this
[530.2s] uh faithful foundation family on
[534.5s] mission. And the text that we are uh
[538.8s] going to delve in is Joshua 24.
[545.3s] Joshua 24.
[548.6s] Allow me to say, brethren,
[552.4s] as families,
[554.6s] God brings us together.
[557.1s] He unites us with those he allows us to
[561.1s] interact.
[563.0s] And when we have this love building,
[570.2s] when we have this emotions, we have this
[575.0s] uh these feelings
[578.0s] that are harmonious with one another, we
[582.0s] end up getting married. I want to say
[586.6s] even as we look at the Old Testament and
[589.6s] the New Testament families
[592.7s] as a church we have good examples,
[596.2s] men and women who have lived their life,
[599.8s] who have guided their families well.
[603.7s] Men and women like
[608.1s] Elder Elias Oola.
[612.2s] Even as we continue to comfort the
[617.0s] family,
[618.7s] we know that this man led his life,
[624.7s] loved his wife, loved and cared for his
[629.5s] family. He did the best. And like
[633.2s] Joshua,
[635.2s] he spoke and he was ready and said he
[642.9s] would be among those who
[647.1s] will be in heaven because that place
[651.6s] that has been prepared,
[654.6s] he himself was preparing himself for
[658.4s] that kingdom and he was ready.
[661.4s] Today as we come to this text,
[666.2s] I want to say may the Lord continue to
[668.9s] play to bless to comfort the families
[672.1s] who have had
[675.3s] to mourn
[677.2s] and grieve their loved ones.
[680.8s] But we have to live. We continue to
[684.6s] leave you and I. And because we continue
[688.5s] to live, we must learn these secrets
[692.5s] which Joshua is urging the whole nation
[697.6s] to turn and serve the Lord.
[703.0s] Sorry.
[711.6s] As it has been stated by the children
[714.5s] ministry in the children's sermon,
[720.4s] we do not have any
[725.2s] we do not have to have a new foundation
[729.0s] set.
[731.7s] We are called by scripture
[734.6s] to an already established foundation.
[739.8s] The foundation already laid is Jesus
[743.0s] Christ.
[744.6s] A Christ centered foundation provides
[747.8s] stability,
[749.9s] resilience, and purpose,
[753.8s] enabling couples of families to thrive
[757.5s] together
[759.0s] in love and faith.
[764.2s] And so
[766.4s] as we have this foundation,
[770.6s] everything else, as houses, as families,
[775.6s] as marriages, relationship
[779.5s] requires
[781.0s] foundations upon which
[784.2s] the two may agree on how they will
[788.6s] handle matters.
[792.1s] At times life can be entered into or
[796.6s] relationship can be entered into with
[799.7s] totally different views and with
[803.5s] different intentions and motives.
[807.8s] But as believers, the Lord is telling us
[812.6s] that relationship and marriage
[816.6s] ought to be entered and be built upon
[820.3s] the firm foundation which is bibilical
[824.2s] guidance.
[828.2s] And so
[830.6s] as we
[832.8s] build on scripture,
[836.5s] as we build this foundation on the love
[839.8s] of God that is revealed in scripture,
[844.8s] as we get bound by grace, as we will see
[849.4s] in August,
[852.4s] you and I are called to unite unite
[856.8s] together
[858.4s] and build a firm foundation
[862.7s] on mission.
[865.5s] Because when we love one another as
[868.5s] spouses,
[870.3s] when we raise our children with grace,
[875.0s] when we demonstrate the love of God
[880.0s] in the family,
[882.3s] then we are better prepared to go for
[888.0s] mission in a united form.
[891.9s] And so this three months as a church
[897.9s] even as we have launched this strategic
[902.6s] focus by also praying like Daniel.
[907.8s] Daniel who was raised in that home and
[913.2s] from his young early years he learned
[917.1s] how to pray. Today the youth in the
[920.9s] church we ought to remind ourself that
[924.4s] yes the graces the love we have seen we
[927.8s] have found from our parents that is
[930.2s] demonstrated in the church by the
[932.7s] believers in the church ought to prepare
[935.8s] us to be like Daniel and to be like
[940.5s] Joshua who learn from such forerunners
[944.7s] as Daniel as Moses himself as even the
[949.4s] patriots and prophets and the kings and
[952.6s] he knew that the Lord is faithful
[957.4s] because of the Lord's faithfulness.
[961.4s] Joshua
[963.0s] as he came to this text in Joshua
[966.9s] chapter 24 which I invite you to come
[969.8s] with me.
[972.4s] We will look at three C's
[976.6s] in Joshua
[980.6s] 24.
[983.8s] What we see in Joshua 24
[987.8s] is a man who is old.
[992.2s] His strength is winning.
[996.7s] He has led with Moses.
[1000.0s] He was there to support him through and
[1004.0s] through.
[1005.7s] He has led the children of Israel to
[1008.2s] gross the river Jordan.
[1011.5s] He has fought and and seen the
[1015.7s] faithfulness of God in bringing down
[1020.1s] cities that were fortified.
[1023.7s] He had divided the land to the children
[1027.5s] of Israel.
[1030.4s] He had been told, "Be courageous because
[1034.4s] I am with you. Do not turn to the left
[1037.7s] or to the right, but be faithful. Follow
[1041.8s] the Lord's commandments." Hallelujah.
[1045.4s] And this Joshua
[1047.9s] who had seen the hand of God,
[1051.5s] this Joshua who had seen the grace of
[1056.3s] God
[1058.0s] by not destroying
[1060.4s] the children of Israel who murmured
[1064.4s] knew that the Lord indeed is gracious
[1069.1s] and is full of love,
[1072.4s] that He
[1075.0s] understood
[1076.7s] that in this love of God, in this grace
[1080.3s] of God, therefore the Lord had used him,
[1085.9s] had blessed him, and he had crossed into
[1089.0s] the land of Canaan.
[1092.1s] He had understood
[1094.4s] how God interacts
[1098.0s] not as a mighty God in heaven but he
[1101.0s] comes down to personal needs wherever he
[1105.0s] prayed with the burdens of leadership.
[1108.5s] He saw God guiding and answering his
[1112.8s] prayers.
[1115.1s] He therefore formed a personal
[1118.6s] connection with God.
[1121.5s] And in this personal connection with
[1124.4s] God,
[1126.7s] he wondered as he knew his time was up,
[1131.0s] he would be dying any time. He wondered
[1134.6s] how would he prepare the children of
[1138.4s] Israel to continue serving this personal
[1143.4s] loving God who though is so suffering so
[1148.5s] high lifted up the King of Kings mighty
[1152.4s] in power
[1154.6s] yet he wanted personal connection with
[1158.6s] those who are his subjects
[1162.2s] in is therefore
[1166.4s] the man of God
[1170.0s] giving his final address to the children
[1174.2s] of Israel.
[1176.1s] The text tells us that then Joshua
[1180.6s] gathered all the tribes of Israel to
[1183.6s] Shachcham and called for the elders of
[1189.0s] Israel,
[1190.6s] for
[1192.2s] their heads, for their judges, and for
[1195.9s] their officers, and they presented
[1199.4s] themselves before God.
[1203.4s] Joshua gathered all the tribes of Israel
[1207.6s] to Shum.
[1209.8s] But then the scripture is keen to state
[1214.1s] who were called.
[1217.0s] Those who were called
[1220.4s] are said to be the heads
[1226.1s] of the community,
[1228.2s] the leaders, the judges.
[1231.4s] Number two, the calling is the calling
[1234.3s] for the heads of family.
[1237.8s] And then thirdly,
[1240.5s] it was a call to a historic place, a
[1244.1s] place known as Sich.
[1247.4s] This second,
[1249.8s] this place is where
[1253.3s] Abraham
[1255.0s] had set up an altar. He bought that
[1260.7s] place. He built an altar.
[1264.3s] It is this place when you read chapter
[1268.9s] 12
[1270.5s] all the way. It was where the patriarchs
[1276.2s] came and built or renewed the altar that
[1280.6s] Abraham and even Isaac and Jacob
[1285.2s] himself. Even when he was running, the
[1289.2s] first place he sought comfort,
[1293.5s] the first place he sought
[1296.6s] to lay his head in darkness as a futive
[1301.0s] was in this place.
[1304.4s] It is in this place in chapter 35 of
[1307.9s] Genesis when he had come back from
[1313.8s] uh where he had run to in his uncle's
[1317.3s] place. As he came back, the Lord
[1320.2s] reminded him and said,
[1323.9s] "You I appear to you.
[1327.4s] I promise to protect and keep you."
[1331.5s] and you pledged that you would give a
[1335.8s] tithe
[1337.6s] when you come back. Now God reminded
[1340.8s] Jacob and told Jacob, "Prepare so that
[1345.2s] you can appear and build me an altar at
[1350.4s] Seum."
[1352.1s] this place
[1354.6s] when Jacob was running and when God
[1357.4s] interacted with him he called the name
[1361.1s] Bethl.
[1363.3s] It is in this place
[1366.3s] where it had all this historical
[1369.4s] connection,
[1371.1s] rich heritage
[1373.2s] that
[1374.8s] Joshua is calling the tribes of Israel
[1380.6s] and calling their leaders to come ahead,
[1385.4s] sit closer to him, even as he reminded
[1391.4s] them in the following text. He reminded
[1395.8s] these people of that place and the God
[1401.0s] that had been worshiped in Sheckchim by
[1404.2s] with Abra by Abraham by their
[1408.0s] forefathers.
[1411.4s] And so he
[1414.6s] enumerates
[1416.6s] how God called Abraham, how God led and
[1420.6s] kept the children of Israel in b in
[1423.8s] Egypt, how the Lord was faithful in
[1427.7s] leading them even to the promised land.
[1433.0s] And therefore he was telling them that
[1436.2s] they were specially made and called by
[1441.6s] God. Hallelujah.
[1447.2s] We see here friends
[1451.4s] that after telling the story of what God
[1455.8s] had done,
[1458.1s] telling and calling these people, the
[1462.1s] Lord is calling us to a mission. He's
[1466.4s] calling us to serve him. He's calling
[1469.8s] you and me.
[1473.0s] He's calling you as a leader. He's
[1476.3s] calling you as a family head. He's
[1479.8s] calling you to the place where there is
[1485.2s] heritage. There is holy history.
[1489.1s] It is in this place of such
[1492.6s] that the the man of God is presenting to
[1496.5s] the children of Israel the claims of
[1500.2s] God.
[1502.0s] And so we go to the second point,
[1506.4s] the choice.
[1509.1s] The choice that is the second sea
[1513.8s] here because of who God was to Israel,
[1519.9s] because of what God had made the
[1523.1s] Israelites to become,
[1526.1s] because of God choosing to perform the
[1529.4s] miracles that he performed in order to
[1533.2s] take these people to a place of freedom.
[1538.8s] Now that they had settled,
[1541.4s] that God had kept his covenant
[1544.8s] that God has kept his promise by giving
[1549.0s] them the promised land.
[1552.2s] Then this prophet Joshua
[1556.0s] is asking
[1558.1s] these people who have witnessed they had
[1563.3s] eaten the mana. They had been protected
[1569.1s] by the pillar of cloud.
[1573.0s] They had felt warm at night in the
[1577.1s] desert because that cloud turned into
[1582.9s] warm by night.
[1586.2s] They had drank water
[1589.2s] from this rock that followed them.
[1593.7s] The Lord became all that they needed
[1598.4s] in the desert. They had witnessed it.
[1603.0s] And just like you and me,
[1607.4s] the Lord has demonstrated his love. Even
[1611.6s] when you are unfaithful, he is still
[1615.4s] keeping you alive. He is still showing
[1618.2s] you mercy.
[1620.6s] This God
[1623.5s] who has sent his only begotten son for
[1627.9s] for us to believe in for us to to to to
[1632.2s] trust and find hope build our faith.
[1638.5s] This is the God who is calling us and
[1642.2s] after calling us and showing us what he
[1645.1s] has done, he is now asking the children
[1648.8s] of Israel in vers 14.
[1653.0s] Let's come to vers 14.
[1656.5s] The word of the Lord
[1659.8s] says Joshua having enumerated all that
[1663.3s] he had enumerated,
[1665.2s] he now tells them, "Now therefore
[1669.8s] fear the Lord,
[1671.9s] serve him
[1673.8s] in sincerity and in truth,
[1677.9s] and put away the gods which your father
[1682.0s] served in the other side of the
[1687.3s] and in Egypt
[1690.1s] serve the Lord.
[1693.4s] But this service to the Lord was not by
[1696.3s] force.
[1698.8s] He tells them, "And if it seems evil
[1704.9s] to you to serve the Lord,
[1708.6s] choose for yourself
[1714.0s] this day whom you will serve, whether
[1718.2s] the gods
[1720.1s] who
[1722.0s] the gods which your father served that
[1725.8s] were on the other side of the river or
[1730.2s] the gods of the Amorite in whose land
[1734.1s] you dwell. But as for me,
[1738.6s] as for me,
[1741.1s] as for me and my house, we will serve
[1746.5s] the Lord.
[1750.8s] Joshua is not calling these people to
[1756.8s] a forceful choice. No,
[1760.1s] he is asking for a choice in sincerity,
[1765.9s] a choice in truth,
[1769.2s] a choice that they can serve the Lord
[1773.6s] from their heart.
[1777.1s] The word translated sincerity in Greek
[1783.2s] is like taking
[1786.3s] something that is transparent
[1790.4s] or taking a liquid that is clear
[1796.2s] and placing it before the rays of the
[1801.1s] sun or light.
[1804.0s] checking for impurities
[1807.0s] or anything. And when it is clear,
[1812.1s] that is said to be sincere.
[1816.0s] When there's no impurity,
[1819.2s] that is the word translated sincere.
[1823.9s] Sincerely,
[1826.7s] he's saying serve the Lord in truth.
[1833.2s] But this calling
[1835.8s] to choose,
[1838.3s] this
[1839.8s] calling
[1842.7s] to come as a whole team
[1846.2s] is a call that the Lord
[1850.2s] intends that his children,
[1853.8s] his people
[1856.2s] would not
[1858.9s] take it that it is by force.
[1861.9s] And so we find that this choice
[1866.2s] is based on God's claim on them. What he
[1873.1s] had done to make them to be who they
[1876.2s] were.
[1877.8s] Number two,
[1879.8s] that calling was sustained by free will
[1885.9s] or free will and willing.
[1890.6s] So they were free to choose. God does
[1894.5s] not force us
[1896.9s] into
[1898.4s] serving him. He shows us his credential,
[1902.8s] what he has done, what he wants to do
[1906.4s] for you. And that is when he's he he
[1909.9s] urges us to choose him.
[1913.8s] That is why the prophet is saying this
[1916.6s] God we serve is a God who does not force
[1919.9s] people.
[1922.2s] He doesn't one forced all our giants.
[1925.6s] No, he's not a tyrant. He is not a
[1929.0s] dictator. He's a God who demonstrate
[1932.2s] love. And after demonstrating love, he
[1935.3s] wins our confidence just as he mingled
[1939.3s] with
[1940.8s] all classes of people. And after wing
[1944.0s] mingling with them, he then beat them
[1946.9s] follow me.
[1950.2s] So the Lord is asking families in this
[1955.1s] third quarter,
[1957.6s] who are you going to serve?
[1961.8s] He's asking, "Have you recognized the
[1965.2s] blessings I've given you, the children,
[1967.9s] the the the jobs I've kept, the the the
[1970.9s] the education you have had, the
[1974.2s] privileges of the job that you have
[1977.0s] held, the the places you are staying,
[1980.9s] whatever the Lord has bestowed upon you,
[1984.4s] and he has kept you when others were
[1987.8s] failing, others were suffering from
[1990.4s] their choices.
[1993.3s] You have witnessed God's mercy. Who are
[1998.1s] you going to serve?
[2001.8s] That is the choice.
[2005.7s] And so we
[2008.2s] are called, brethren,
[2012.3s] to make our own mind,
[2015.9s] not forcefully, but by grace of God
[2020.5s] because he has demonstrated his love to
[2024.5s] serve him even to the last breath as our
[2029.2s] brother, our friend, our elder, mentor.
[2035.0s] Father to son, husband, cousin,
[2040.3s] your relative and fellow colleague serve
[2044.6s] the Lord. Elder Elias is one such who
[2048.6s] serve the Lord.
[2051.4s] And Joshua is calling us to make this
[2055.6s] point clear.
[2057.7s] Hallelujah.
[2059.5s] Now unto the third sea.
[2063.6s] Commitment.
[2066.4s] Commitment.
[2071.3s] At this point when Joshua had told these
[2074.2s] people,
[2078.6s] if you are not going to do it,
[2082.6s] I don't care what your choice is.
[2086.6s] The laws will be yours.
[2089.8s] He told them, "Me, as for me and my
[2095.1s] house, we will serve the Lord."
[2100.7s] This commitment was not
[2104.6s] onesided.
[2107.0s] Joshua was not asking for what he could
[2111.0s] not commit to doing himself.
[2115.4s] He was asking this nation,
[2119.3s] this chosen
[2122.1s] community
[2124.1s] to be sincere, to walk with God in
[2128.2s] sincerity, in truth and in spirit.
[2132.0s] He was calling them, reminding them of
[2136.2s] who they were and the claims of God upon
[2139.8s] them.
[2141.5s] And at this point, he's saying, "I am
[2145.3s] not asking you to do it while I'm not
[2149.1s] doing it. If you choose not,
[2154.1s] as for me
[2156.4s] and my house, we will serve the Lord."
[2162.0s] How blessed
[2164.4s] our families would be.
[2167.2s] How much harmony and peace and joy we
[2170.9s] would witness
[2173.0s] if each and every man
[2177.8s] would first and foremost commit to lead
[2182.3s] his family into the church and therefore
[2186.1s] ask the spouse to be as faithful as
[2189.6s] himself and as children to be as
[2193.5s] faithful as they are. The children would
[2197.8s] find level ground and they would walk
[2201.0s] and serve the Lord easily.
[2205.2s] Oh man of God,
[2208.4s] you were given that family to lead to
[2211.4s] serve the Lord.
[2213.7s] It is not to show off and for physical
[2217.5s] or whatever pleasures you choose to
[2220.6s] have. No,
[2222.7s] your wife was given to you by the Lord
[2227.1s] so that you raise up in harmony,
[2231.8s] patiently building one another, so that
[2235.7s] you can raise a generation of the
[2238.2s] servants of the Lord.
[2241.8s] Friends,
[2243.3s] we are called
[2246.1s] to commit to God.
[2249.4s] And Joshua is asking for this
[2252.6s] commitment,
[2255.3s] not requiring it of others, but he
[2259.1s] himself was prepared to go the whole
[2262.2s] way.
[2264.3s] If our if our families in the Christian
[2268.3s] homes that we have, if men stood to be
[2272.2s] true men, priest and made the choice as
[2276.6s] Joshua did,
[2279.2s] we would not be seeing the corruption
[2281.4s] that we are seeing.
[2283.5s] We would not be seeing the burning of
[2286.9s] schools and even uh police stations
[2291.4s] and the anger that is expressed
[2294.6s] as if people do not go to churches.
[2299.4s] We would not be threatened by Sabah Saba
[2303.3s] or whatever
[2305.2s] time that GNC's place because those
[2309.4s] GNC's and these young people and whoever
[2314.4s] would be marching to the places that
[2317.4s] they have said we are going and spend
[2319.8s] the time that they have listed. But
[2322.6s] isn't it corruption that you go beyond
[2325.0s] the places that you stated?
[2329.0s] Isn't it lying and trying to seek
[2333.0s] something else when you extend time
[2336.3s] beyond what you have said you would
[2338.6s] spend?
[2340.8s] Can we be honest?
[2343.8s] And so friends, a nation,
[2347.8s] if we want to be a people who are
[2351.9s] blessed, can we truly serve God and put
[2357.7s] those leaders who have missed us in
[2361.6s] check when we ourself are honest.
[2367.8s] You cannot ask of someone what you
[2370.3s] cannot do yourself.
[2374.2s] Freedom
[2376.5s] somebody has said is not free.
[2379.6s] And therefore time has come that we who
[2384.1s] are believers like Joshua ought to know
[2388.9s] that we have responsibilities
[2391.8s] over each other's rights even if we are
[2394.9s] demanding our own.
[2397.5s] For Joshua here, he said
[2401.6s] that
[2405.2s] calling these people he himself he said
[2409.1s] I
[2410.9s] and then he said my house.
[2415.0s] Then he turned to the community and
[2418.2s] said,
[2419.8s] "If you the community will not agree to
[2424.6s] serve the Lord,
[2426.8s] I am committing
[2429.1s] I and my family because I know each one
[2431.8s] of them. I and my family because I know
[2436.0s] how we have prayed and how we have spent
[2439.0s] time with everyone of my family members.
[2442.6s] We love the Lord. They serve the Lord. I
[2446.2s] know my family. Praise the Lord,
[2449.7s] friend.
[2451.8s] The Lord is calling you.
[2454.3s] Calling you to commit, to be sincere, to
[2457.0s] be truthful, to serve the Lord,
[2462.0s] not to be mingle and be mixed up.
[2466.3s] Our leaders, the Lord is calling us to
[2470.2s] serve the Lord.
[2472.4s] In as much as we fear for this nation,
[2476.1s] you leaders have the responsibility of
[2478.6s] being truthful, true to your calling.
[2481.5s] Keep the constitution and help this
[2484.8s] nation. Guide them. Be truthful. Even if
[2489.4s] you are a politician, whatever you are,
[2493.5s] let us call others into account. Praise
[2496.6s] the Lord. As I call the chesters to come
[2500.2s] up forward,
[2502.6s] I want to urge each and every one of us.
[2505.0s] There's a paper that you have gotten.
[2508.9s] As I go over
[2511.8s] what Joshua challenged the people on
[2516.6s] vers
[2518.9s] 16, what do we read?
[2522.0s] We read this and I want to ask that we
[2525.4s] go quickly. It says, "So the people
[2527.9s] answered and said, far be it from us
[2531.6s] that we should forsake the Lord to serve
[2535.8s] and to serve other gods." But then the
[2539.5s] man of God told them, you cannot you
[2542.6s] cannot serve God just because you have
[2545.6s] said it in your lips. The Lord is Jillas
[2550.2s] and says, "And the Lord drove out from
[2555.9s] before us all the people. The Lord's
[2561.1s] power made others run away." I want you
[2565.0s] to look with me vers 20.
[2569.0s] It says if you forsake the Lord and
[2572.7s] serve for rain gods then he will turn
[2577.4s] away and consume you. But these people
[2580.7s] said no we will serve the Lord. I just
[2583.6s] want to read verses 26
[2586.8s] and 27. It says, "Then Joshua wrote
[2590.0s] these words in the book of the law of
[2593.2s] God, and he took a large stone and set
[2597.2s] it up there under the oak that was by
[2602.2s] the sanctuary of the Lord." And Joshua
[2605.6s] said to all the people, "Behold, this
[2608.5s] stone shall be a witness to you us, for
[2613.0s] it has heard all the words of the Lord,
[2618.3s] which he has spoken to us. It shall
[2621.8s] therefore be a witness to you,
[2625.8s] lest you deny your God." Praise the
[2629.4s] Lord.
[2631.2s] Joshua said, "You are a witness." And so
[2634.0s] I want to ask you if you are witness
[2637.1s] that you are going to serve the Lord
[2639.8s] today
[2641.9s] fill it and say how you are committing
[2644.7s] to serve the Lord.
[2647.8s] These papers
[2649.9s] I hope you have it. Let me see if you
[2651.8s] have it.
[2653.8s] Let's be serious with God because he's
[2655.9s] serious with us. If you have it, commit
[2661.4s] being obedient,
[2663.8s] covenanting, and having a statute,
[2667.8s] having a degree, write it, and then
[2670.9s] ordinance
[2673.0s] that you are committing to have a
[2676.2s] monument. Set up time, set up a place of
[2680.3s] worship.
