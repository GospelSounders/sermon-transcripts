FULL TRANSCRIPT:
um I'm a good friend of the young professionals at Maxwell Church um I think this is my fourth session if I'm not wrong kit I was here last year during the YP convention and we have also done some online programs so I'm very happy to be here and like I said last time it's always a pleasure being back home I mentioned last year that uh I wed In This Very church when the church was still under construction and I remember the pillars were not very sightly so we had to uh to uh wrap them up so um we have I think half an hour and uh if I want to appreciate the way you have introduced um the convention the fact that we have a career shift I recall when I was um um I'm happy to have fcpa Rose here she's a good friend of mine and also one of my referees for a very long time and when I was doing a career shift I recall at the time you needed to have a recommendation from your referee I'm very certain that these days we don't have to well we have those referees on our CVS but hardly do employers go there because they want to see what you do on social media that's where the background checks are happening and also want to see because I have have sat in um meal interview several times and sometimes people get very excited and they say oops I think I got the job they invited me to dinner they invited me to lunch little do you know that that is still part of the what the interview and I think that's why the council decided that today we talk about official dining ethet so for the last for the next few minutes we're going to talk about official uh dining e so thank you for the warm welcome and the introduction I would like us to go straight into the session and uh we are here to have a conversation about the general principles of dining etiquette cesy and manners we have had several sessions on um protocol and etiquette generally etiquette and uh when I was coming up kit reminded me that um I remember the last time you said a good handbag is the one that must sit so she tells me that she has thrown away all her handbags that don't do what that don't sit so these are little little things that we take for granted but they create Impressions about us and remember that you have never heard about Second Impressions do they exist we always talk about what First Impressions so when I walked in into the waiting room and I saw Mr mangeli so looking so speak and span on a Sunday the first thing I told him is you're looking very very smart yeah so thank you very much so we will also talk about how do you manage interpersonal Dynamics when you are in in important encounters particularly at the table how do you avoid causing offense or embarrassment when you are in high-profile situations and how do you interact in a manner that is that is respectable with people who come from different cultures different nations and different regions so that's basically going to be our session outline we will look at the general principles uh dining etiquette and I would like us to link dining etiquette and the job interviews we will then conclude and I'll give you a parting short I want us to start with a quote just to reflect that business in today's scenario is not a national match but is an Olympics where there are international players only that individual or organization can survive which has done its homework well and developed its uniqueness what does that tell you that we are no longer talking about just yourself and your organization where you work the world is now a global village we interact with a lot of colleagues many networks that we are creating potential employers and clients from across the globe whether you're meeting them physically whether you're meeting them online and therefore we must start to appreciate that we have cultural differences that we must appreciate and respect if we are to be ahead of the game but then what does the Bible say first things first you recall Luke chapter 14 dining with what humility Jesus teaches about the taking the lowest seat at a banquet rather than seeking honor and that basically encourages humility over Pride when we are in Social settings uh when you look at 1 Corinthians 10:31 it talks about consideration for others and it advises Believers to do everything for the glory of God which can include being considerate about dietary preferences and restrictions when dining with others I don't know how many of us sited here were in boarding school put up your hands if you ever attended a boarding school almost everybody and I am very certain for the men because I have been a high school teacher and I taught boys what happens at lunchtime when the bell goes H there's always what a rush H and uh why do people rush and yet the food is enough the gentleman do you remember what you called what top what top layer so you're struggling to make sure that you get top player now tell me if students in a school were given the opportunity to serve themselves do you think lunch would be enough for everybody because there's that lack of consideration for others and I think that's something that we're getting from um 1 Corinthians chapter 10:31 so when we talk about dining etiquette remember even though we are not focusing so much about you enjoying your ugali in the house with your managu when we talk about professional etiquette we talking about a formal lunch a formal dinner what does that tell us there are things that you can do at home that you cannot do in a formal in a formal setup if you're in a house in your house you can relax in jeans in pants you can relax in a little nice dress but if you're stepping out for a formal meeting then things have to do what to change and that also happens when it comes to dining etiquette so I want to give us 2 minutes please stand to your neighbor and share irritating table mannerisms what irritates you or what has embarrassed you before please turn to your neighbor and share that what irritates you the most so what irritates you the most let's hear you can share your your own experience of what your colleagues have shared I love that are there people here from Western I'm not saying that's the Habit there but they love tea isn't it there's a lady who told me in our class that she told the boss to transfer her to another office because she could no longer stomach the way the colleague SI his tea and I think we've seen a good example there okay another irritating mannerism when someone eats like this chewing loudly thank you let's have more examples when St when you st your tee uh when you st sugar in your tea you have to hit the the glass tinging thank you very much by way did you know that sugar in hot tea naturally dissolves so all you need to do is to Aid it just a little but what do we do we really fight thank you what else irritates you let's hear um stretching across the table to reach salt that is far away thank you very much I want to pause a minute and talk about that in a meal interview when you stretch your hand across somebody else's food or across another table you know it it indicates a behavior about yourself what behavior is that you cannot be a good team player why aren't you making use of the team member next to you to make the task simpler excuse me please could you pass the salt and many times when you tell somebody to pass the salt what do they do they suddenly remember they also needed it so they say okay please wait a minute then you can also come out across as somebody who is not considerate so let the salt go then you do what you ask for it let's have two last ones I'm Joseph I would say picking teeth with the tooth pick in the middle of eating picking your teeth yeah thank you we will talk about that serving more than you can eat and then leaving it on the plate imagine serving a lot of food and then leaving it where on the plate we'll also be talking about that so dining etiquette is an essential skill for building positive impressions in both social and professional settings and we also appreciate like we have already mentioned that different countries have different ways of doing things different regions have different ways of doing things if you go to China will they give you a fork and a knife what will they give you Chopsticks yeah but please don't go hungry if you're not able to use the Chopsticks at has flexibility you can always ask for an alternative Continental style is about FK and knife and many question I mean a common question most participants have always asked in my classes why don't I just wash my hands and uh enjoy my fish with my fingers or I enjoy my chicken with what with my fingers but remember if you look at most formal setups when you go in they'll give you a hot towel to do what to clean your hands you're not cleaning your hands to eat the fish with your fingers you're cleaning your hands because there items that you might touch so your hands need to be clean like for example go ribs you can you can use your fingers apples you can touch when you're passing the salt your hands need to be clean they never give you a hot towel as you come out so imagine you have enjoyed your fish your chicken your fingers are all h messed up isn't it and then at the end of the meal a guest ask for your business card there's no water there's no hot towel how do you get your how do you pick your business card how do you get into your handbag it becomes a challenge so we have to appreciate and respect that and so I think the best way forward really is to observe how other people behave hoping that you are also observing somebody who is doing the right thing I think the last time we were here last year I gave an example about this gentleman it's a very interesting example who noticed that during the first dinner there was RA meat on every table and he was wondering in our country we don't eat raw meat the only person he could ask was a Kenan counterpart but he was SE across another table so as he looked you know how you try dashing their eyes to see whether they can he noticed the colleague was already munching the RO meat and then suddenly he saw apparent every table had a burner so you were actually supposed to roast the meat as you eat you who has already started munching the raw meat do you stop and start roasting or do you pretend that is how you wanted it it can get very embarrassing isn't it please ask by the way you don't look foolish by asking but you look ridiculous by doing something that is contrary to expectation so is basically about rules that govern expectations somebody talked about what irritates him is when you Ser a lot of food and you don't finish the expectation is serve what you can finish moderation is the key word so etiquette and doram are visible signs that you are a polished and knowledgeable professional who among you seated here would not want to look professional who would not want to look knowledgeable even the way you hold your fork and your knife so etiquette is about good manners it's about making others feel comfortable in social situations um I like the way you demonstrated the siping You Pull It You Pull It are you making other people feel comfortable are you making people what are you making the people around you uh feel so getting now into um the actual dining etiquette we want to say that as a young professional I think Young is relative H even Nora is Young isn't it at heart I am also at heart young at heart we all young because it doesn't matter whether you are starting your career uh even older people here also want to shift careers isn't it so these rules are applicable good table manners is a must we don't have choice because we are constantly attending occasions either as hosts or as guests and like we have already said table etiquette varies considerably with different cultures allow me to look at a few General Basics if you're ever invited to a formal lunch or a formal dinner please keep time please keep time I don't want to ask what time you arrived for this convention do you want me to ask you know what time you arrived isn't it please learn to do what to keep time it creates positive Impressions the reason why I think um partly the organizers were not able to start the program on time is because we you know today is Sunday so we have to wash our clothes we have to do what clean the house but how many times does this Council run the YP convention once once a month once a year so why not delegate today or Outsource those services so if you are invited to a formal lunch a formal dinner please learn to keep time we will talk about the order of service order easy to eat food please remember we have said it's not about using our fingers what is it you can comfortably eat with a fork and a knife if you have never eaten spaghetti don't try it practice at home if you don't know how to eat spaghetti with a fork and a knife this is not the day to do what to Adventure serve something that you can eat gracefully with a fork and a knife I sat in a um um um a function where somebody was really struggling to cut a wing with a fork and a knife Ka po you can imagine it Landing on somebody else's plate do you tell them excuse me sir can I have my do you ask for it do you let them have it it can be very very embarrassing please can buffets can be very long have an idea what is on offer if there's no queue you can actually take a walk and see what is on offer otherwise sometimes you're at that fourth point of service your plate is already full and then you're seeing your favorite food ahead I saw in a wedding you know how weddings people line up for to serve so a lady saw something she liked and then she's telling the person behind because her plate was already full can I give you some rice who told you she want your rice she also want to pick something that she likes please serve an item at a time when you are at a function you are all there for the same purpose so don't be in a hurry never find yourself at the table with your salad you bring the soup because you bring the main meal you bring the dessert then now you do what you sit Nora was talking about entrepreneurship this is not an opportunity to mobilize resources you can mobilize the resources elsewhere isn't it but at the table serve an item at an item at a time move in t you're sharing a table three people four people please make sure that you're moving at the same pace so that you don't eat so quickly or you skip some items and then you finish eating and the others are still eating what will you be doing then now that is when you see people being tempted to use their phones on the table which is also not good manners and this is something I have also observed you know as Adventists we always told by nutritionists that fruit are best eaten before the meal isn't it but they will also tell you eat the fruit um how many minutes before the meal 30 minutes you realize in a formal lunch I'm always we always hosting Mr mangeli at KSG in formal functions he will tell you in a formal lunch you don't have that privilege of 30 minutes so because of that please don't look ridiculous in a formal setup because if you're eating fruit when others are taking soup it is like the driver on the road who is driving in the opposite what direction for this particular day haia please eat the fruit as dessert as planned in that particular what in that particular setup and then we can do our our normal uh fruits before the meal at home when we have enough time to do the 30 minutes never intercept a pass I think we talked about intercepting salt or an item if you need to leave the table before everybody else please remember to say excuse me it doesn't matter whether you know them or not this is what our colleague has talked about please serve what you can finish please look at that plate that bread is not even touched is it touched huh and who served it yourself serve what you can finish we talked about the hot towel and you can also be given a finger bowel the hot towel is for cleaning your hands like we said you need to have your hands clean please don't say hey they knew how I was sweating so you start wiping your neck you wipe your face we have even seen people blow their noses into those napkins it can be so irritating please remember it is for cleaning your hands if you look at the finger finger ball it's called a finger ball because you're supposed to clean the tips of your fingers don't go dipping your whole hand can you imagine your hand in that little glass so you start splashing water on the nice linen use it to clean your fingertips and if you look there's Cutlery by the side there's beautiful linen and a nice little glass with lemon water please don't mistake it for the first item of the meal we have seen people do what take it there are also napkins that look like um you know you remember PCO they look like Parco so you're supposed to do what to dissolve it in water and then it opens up some people think there's somebody who took it and threw it in the mouth and then what does the saliva do it it opens it up so you can imagine the discomfort and the embarrassment Okay so so where do you place the napkin place it on the lap never force it here like a baby beb have you seen people have their napkins here some people even put settes here honestly it looks so ridiculous gentlemen there are some that have a button hole at the at one corner that allows you to button it on your shirt but otherwise without that place it on the lab however I like giving a precaution if you think when you eat you're normally a little clumsy because we all different I would rather you look ridiculous by having it here than messing your what your nice Shar yeah so there's that flexibility when you're seated at the table sit upright let the food come to the mouth don't take your head where to the plate we do that several times and then don't put your elbows your elbows on the table um in terms of uh setup we normally say your solids are to the left your liquids are to your right solid in this case refers to your side plate because it carries your bread and butter your water your glasses are the ones on your right hand side please remember on a round table the side plate on the left and the one on the right are very close to you so if you're going to use the side plate on the right stick to your lane side plate to the left your water your liquid to your right now in terms of the cut we normally start from the outside coming inside and that will tell you um sorry that will tell you the item that will come first um on the menu if you look at that setup what do you think is first on the menu what is first on the menu soup and the waiters will keep clearing until finally you're left with what the meat knife and the meat fork for the main for the main meal that plate looks very be beautiful and big but the only plate or part of the plate that is called a functional plate is the one that is not dotted can you see the inner part of the plate that is the only part that is called a functional what so your food should never find it place on the dotted part of the plate but how many of us find food on the dotted part of the plate why do we have food on the dotted part of the plate because we never appreciate the meaning of buffet buffet means you have a variety to do what to choose from but what do we normally do we serve ugali chapati both white and brown rice mimo M then we do what fish chicken go ribs and injah you're just next to the Integrity Center what else would you call corruption you might find yourself in that building isn't it answering questions so please make sure that your food is confined to the inner part of the plate image is important First Impressions we said when you're serving your food you should never have food on top of another you put your beef rice on top chapati on top know so you're supposed to serve your food on the plate so that you have portions every food should occupy its own own portion I think sister Eva the next time we do a practicum eh we should have a formal lunch where we doing this practically so you serve and then you make sure that what is hard to cut like the beef or the whatever that you need to cut with a knife is closest to you so that you're not stretching the knife too far and that is how you have spillage on the table um in terms of handling utensils the index fingers do the supp h i was H I was hoping I have a pen so you hold with the index Fingers um thank you sister Rose the index fingers doing the support you hold your knife like that and the F but how do we normally hold sometimes like this you're ready for war isn't it or you hold like you're going to scoop sand now I don't know um how many spoons do you see on the table only please name them soup and dessert where do you get the soup for eating rice on the table so you're supposed to use your fork and knife for the main meal and make sure that you're holding it properly this is called rest position when you put place your Cy knife and fork side by side like facing 11:00 on the on the wall clock it means finished position you're beckoning the waiter to come and clear when you place your cut like this you're not done with your meal probably you're taking part in small talk on the table small conversation or you're relaxing otherwise that is how sometimes you have saved you know that best part of the chicken for last you go to pick something you come back your plate has been because you didn't keep place your cery in the rightful position please learn to cut cut a mouthful at a time one bite at a time like what you can see on my left which is your right please never find yourself cutting everything and then some people even mix up eh you mix up mix things up on the plate and then you start eating it does not give a good impression it can also make your food to go cold okay now we talked about um did we talk about passing food when you're passing food you pass it from the left to the right so look at how you you're SE on the table if somebody's at the far end you don't have to also pass your hand across the table to pass the salt you let the food go in a circle so you pass it to the next person who will then also pass it and then if you have two Salt I mean two shakers there's salt and there's pepper sometimes we are not very sure which is salt which is paper please pass both let the person be the one to discover so that you don't kill them with pipil when they're thinking it is salt that you're giving them if anything Falls sometimes we stand we forget we had a napkin and it falls please never crawl under the table call the waiter to do what H you can imagine Mr mangel in his tie under the table to pick a napkin and then he gets stuck and I waiter means waiting upon you so just call the waiter and they will be able to assist please don't use the phone on the table sometimes we are eating and we are still chatting with friends or you're picking calls it is not good maners uh to pick your phone at the table don't talk with your utensils do you remember what we said in the YP convention eh you're you're doing what you're pointing with a fork and a knife it's not good manners um remember to place it in the rest position ladies where should we do that in the bathroom don't freshen up um don't freshen up at the table okay so I have additional uh tips chew with your mouth closed remember the sounds that our colleague talked about please engage in polite conversation don't just focus on on the meal you're just eating you have a neighbor that is an opportunity to network take part in polite conversation test your food before seasoning have you seen people who sit at the table and they quickly do what they add salt even before they test in an interview you would fail because that means that you make hasty decisions who has told you the food does not have enough salt uh thank the host always Express gratitude after the meal and thank the host for their host Hospitality don't pick at your food I have seen people sometimes you enjoying a meal and then they e this beef today it's terrible this chicken it's and somebody is really enjoying on the other side please keep those to yourself yeah avoid making a scene about disliking something don't monopolize the conversation allow others to speak and be considerate of everyone's input and don't make loud noises I think we talked about that don't start eating too early even if you're too hungry yeah please get cues from the host don't discuss money or the bill it considered impolite they sell chicken at 1,200 if you have been invited please enjoy enjoy the meal so what about uh proper dining etiquette and job interviews proper dining etiquette in a job interview is more than just knowing how to use your forend your knife we talked about Impressions it is one more way to make sure you leave a lasting impression that is positive to your potential employer so I will share uh seven tips and then we conclude the first one is First Impressions count your behavior during the meal is an opportunity to make a strong first impression poor dining etiquette can reflect negatively on your overall professionalism it actually shows that you you don't pay attention to details uh dining etiquette when it is practiced properly it shows respect because then it means you have consideration for other people the third tip is it can actually be a demonstration of good communication skills light conversation demonstrates your ability to balance polite small talk with eating or having your meal so therefore it is a key to fostering good rapport with interviewers and it shows your social competence remember that when we talk about self-awareness for example you talk about are you aware about yourself and the actions that you do how do they affect what impact do they have on others that's the social competence Go dining etiquette reflect self-awareness let's move on to the fifth one it minimizes distruction you can imagine those sounds that we talked about they can be so distracting you're taking your tea you're slapping it you're chewing your food have you ever sat next to somebody who when they're chewing their food they also showering you with food particles it can be very distracting yeah so it also represents cultural sensitivity In some cultures dining etiquette holds particular significance and therefore when you show awareness of those practices it means you respect the culture of those people it is therefore important if the job involves international relations or working with diverse teams because then it means that you are culturally sensitive and finally it reflects professionalism your ability to maintain composure in a dining setting is part of your overall presentation of professionalism so when you're able to navigate a lunch interview with Grace with deorum and courtesy it sets you apart from the other candidates remember when you go for a normal interview you have all met the same criteria because if it is academic qualifications you're at the same level professional experience you're at the same level so what sets you apart so these are just additional strategies that are used to pick those who stand out from the crowd so in conclusion we want to say etiquette is an essential element that shapes an individual's image your reputation and your relationships etiquette ensures interaction are respectful professional and considerate and in a world where First Impressions and ongoing relationships matter more than ever knowing and understanding and embracing etiquette particularly the etiquette uh the dining etiquette that we are talking about today is key to success both at your personal level and even at your professional level I have a parting shot and that's an African proverb that says you don't ask for or a chair when you visit a place where the chief himself sits on the floor in other words when you go to Rome you do as you do as the Romans do so thank you very much ladies and gentlemen I hope we have some two three minutes for questions so the first question is um I eat very slowly and often have business or lunch discussions where I end up being the last person to finish and have to derail the other person how can I save myself out of these situations that's the first one and then the second question on etiquette is um I still feel that we esteem other people's cultures to the detriment of ours I ask what is wrong with our African or Kenyan way of eating or dining so I think we'll start with those two questions speed at which we eat is so different there are those who eat very fast the ones we saidak when the others are eating and this one is a slow can we call them a slow eater and sometimes you find um probably you're being left behind I have a personal experience where I had a business meeting and I I tagged a colleague along and she ate so slowly even when everybody's um like the host had actually indicated they're in a hurry and you could actually see they want to stand and she's still there enjoying her enjoying her meal how do we balance that between not completely uh enjoying the meal and the speed at which we ought to move because of other engagement and this is something that I have always said when you're going to a formal lunch or a formal engagement please don't go on a hungry stomach don't go on a hungry stomach because sometimes when you're so hungry you're tempted to probably just ensure that you have eaten to your f make sure that you're not too hungry so that because this is not something that you're going to overcome overnight if you're naturally if you naturally eat slowly you will definitely eat slowly so please serve just enough that we make sure that you will finish with the rest and because you will have eaten then you will not be too hungry but I think even for the host I want to encourage them when you realize that you have a guests who are eating slowly you can also slow your pace so that you don't inconvenience your guest so it's two way the other question is why are we glorifying other cultures and not our Kenyan way of dining by the way everything that we have talked about is African I know we did not have Fox and knife and when we talk about glorifying other cultures we are talking about a shift why are we wearing this clothes that we are wearing maybe that is where we should start why do we use computers How African is a computer so we have embraced cultures that we must also respect the fact that we are speaking English that is not our mother tongue it means that we have embraced other people's cultures but allow me to go back to the African culture in terms of dining etiquette how many people come from Western specifically luah put up your hands if you come from the Lua culture yeah did you know among the Lua culture you know traditionally when you look at the lah culture most of the some of the activities that you have in the culture is um traditionally bull fighting and circum and there's one drink that you can never miss which is tea in fact they say China so what happened traditionally when uh te was served it was not served in cups and saucers like we Ser today people would be seated on the ground on the grass cups are distributed and somebody goes around with a tea on yeah and when you see your guest Even in our normal homes when you see the guest the tea is getting to the bottom of the cup what do we normally do we replenish and how do we do it how do we normally say if you don't want a second cup how do you normally tell the host you shake your head those who wear earrings they're even likely to fall off you even cover the cup isn't it which is not good manners in the lyer culture traditionally when you're holding that cup and the cup has a handle you turn the cup to face the person who is approaching you with the tea that way you have communicated that no thank you I will not have enough traditionally if if you look at how um they did things traditionally in the African culture they would tell you that H you don't eat hot food especially mandazi yeah they would have Proverbs they would have saying to discourage you from doing things that they thought were contrary because they were trying to inculcate uh specific aspect of eate so this is not really about a foreign culture but there are cultures that are mixed both African and Western and because we have embraced then we have to observe the rules we didn't have cars in the African culture but now we are driving them and when you hit the road you know there's a rule that says keep left if you keep right what will happen you'll cause an accident and there'll be confusion there'll be traffic jam so there's a h we have to have a balance between the two thank you what do you do if the host chooses to wash hands and eat the ugali with their hands um so I'm assuming the person is afraid of eating ugali with their hands yes if the boss actually decides to eat ugali with their hands so do you follow protocol uh that's a very good question because sometimes as the host or as the boss you're supposed to probably re relax the rules if you notice where maybe people are having a cocktail and they both decides to be the one to be the first on the dance floor they are flexing the rules to make people comfortable so if the boss or the host washes their hands they're basically saying you're free to to do the same so you can do the same thank you for that and then the last question is a personal question to you on your um education background so the question says how did you shift your career from education to where you are right now I love that okay um first I believe I'm still an educator because I teach I train uh there's a little shift because of the passion I have for what I do now um in terms of protocol and etiquette I think as I grew up I have had uh several motivating factors one of my um eate gurus as I grew up some of them were my grandmothers I noticed how they did things um without taking a lot of time I I'll talk about two scenarios one is a grandmother of mine who would always in terms of dress code she would always wear stockings to the market and I don't know at that time where she would get her wig she would be so smart when other women were wearing head C she would have her with and she' always carry a handbag she's going to the market and when she buys her items at the market she' never carry them on her head you know traditionally by there you could send anybody's child so she would just pick on anybody and tell them this is my shopping basket please take it home then she would walk home slowly with her handbag I really used to admire her even if it rain should not run she just walk and you know later the networking that probably the other speakers will be talking about when my came to our village and they were asking for a representative who do you think the village has nominated everybody said penina and that is how my grandmother landed an opportunity to serve as m laer w so even just maintaining your mannerisms at the table can land you an opportunity you never know the second one I think uh uh that's enough for my grandmothers the second one is high school um I went to moal high school Elder and uh we never cured for lunch we would always eat eat at tables so 10 people per table the four ones were responsible for bringing the food to the table in bowels then they were supposed to arrange the plates the form twos would be the ones to clear the table after lunch the form threes would be the ones to serve the food so we learned how to share because then if you don't balance the food somebody else will miss a piece of chicken or beef isn't it so we learned to share and then the pH Falls it's your time to relax enjoy the meal and go away leave the plate on the table for the form to to do what to clear we were never allowed to eat with our fingers we ate with a fork and a knife and apart from that there were many other things that we learned uh we would be told slippers a bathroom shoes just a few to share I was so shocked when I went to the university and I would see men wearing slippers to class for me it was a culture shock so I think that really um encouraged me to get so interested in this uh soft skills to say when I became a teacher I taught English and literature and I actually noticed in the curriculum I don't know if there are any teachers here there were sessions on etiquette but the teachers would not teach they would not focus because you know in school people focus on what examinable items but I enjoyed I enjoyed teaching that in fact I remember when I I joined one school I didn't know that teachers can also be bullied I was given you know that the loudest class the the one that has rude boys I taught in boys schools and so I felt what do I Do by the the boys were very dirty and loud and rude but I decided the best way is to make them my friends and then it is not very comfortable when you go to class and there's a fou smell the class is dirty so I told them why don't we clean so we started cleaning the class sweeping and soon everybody wanted to come and teach in that class that class that nobody wanted to to come and teach one step I took I told them I want to visit you how come when I I am on duty I never see those clothes hang when do you wash them they're looking at me like you m you mean those ones are normally washed I'm sure the men here are listening to me and that is making some sense so we opened one of the routine checks we opened one box I told them I'm visiting so we opened a box you find bread half and it is open next we is soap the soap they used in the morning next we is kiwi open next wheat is a pile of innerware that so water I don't know when last and let me tell you the Sten that came out of that box was enough to make somebody fall so I told them let's start washing these things let's start cleaning this is not uh um blowing my own trumpet but I want to tell you for the first time by the time those boys got to form four for the first time in the history of that school they took boys to the university so I believe there's a link between being clean and and being clean upstairs isn't it yeah so that is how I got the interest and uh that explains the shift thank you 

==================================================

TIMESTAMPED TRANSCRIPT:
[0.8s] um I'm a good friend of the young
[5.1s] professionals at Maxwell Church um I
[8.2s] think this is my fourth session if I'm
[11.1s] not wrong kit I was here last year
[13.8s] during the YP convention and we have
[16.5s] also done some online programs so I'm
[18.5s] very happy to be here and like I said
[21.0s] last time it's always a pleasure being
[23.1s] back home I mentioned last year that uh
[26.3s] I wed In This Very church when the
[29.0s] church was still under construction and
[30.8s] I remember the pillars were not very
[32.4s] sightly so we had to uh to uh wrap them
[38.3s] up so um we have I think half an hour
[43.7s] and uh if I want to appreciate the way
[46.1s] you have
[47.3s] introduced um the convention the fact
[49.7s] that we have a career
[51.4s] shift I recall when I was um um I'm
[56.6s] happy to have fcpa Rose here she's a
[59.3s] good friend of mine and also one of my
[62.0s] referees for a very long time and when I
[64.9s] was doing a career shift I recall at the
[68.8s] time you needed to have a recommendation
[71.8s] from your referee I'm very certain that
[74.4s] these days we don't have to well we have
[77.2s] those referees on our CVS but hardly do
[80.3s] employers go there because they want to
[82.8s] see what you do on social media that's
[85.2s] where the background checks are
[87.1s] happening and also want to see because I
[89.8s] have have sat in um meal interview
[92.6s] several times and sometimes people get
[95.8s] very excited and they say oops I think I
[98.3s] got the job they invited me to dinner
[100.8s] they invited me to lunch little do you
[103.4s] know that that is still part of the what
[106.2s] the interview and I think that's why the
[109.2s] council decided that today we talk about
[112.3s] official dining ethet so for the last
[115.4s] for the next few minutes we're going to
[116.9s] talk about official uh dining e
[120.9s] so thank you for the warm welcome and
[122.6s] the introduction I would like us to go
[124.2s] straight into the session and uh we are
[127.1s] here to have a conversation about the
[129.8s] general principles of dining etiquette
[132.6s] cesy and manners we have had several
[136.0s] sessions on um protocol and etiquette
[139.2s] generally etiquette and uh when I was
[141.7s] coming up kit reminded me that um I
[144.6s] remember the last time you said a good
[147.4s] handbag is the one that must sit so she
[150.4s] tells me that she has thrown away all
[152.2s] her handbags that don't do what that
[154.5s] don't sit so these are little little
[157.1s] things that we take for granted but they
[159.4s] create Impressions about us and remember
[162.6s] that you have never heard about Second
[164.5s] Impressions do they exist we always talk
[167.4s] about what First Impressions
[171.5s] so when I walked in into the waiting
[174.3s] room and I saw Mr mangeli so looking so
[178.0s] speak and span on a Sunday
[180.4s] the first thing I told him is you're
[181.7s] looking very very smart yeah so thank
[185.3s] you very much so we will also talk about
[187.4s] how do you manage interpersonal Dynamics
[190.2s] when you are in in important encounters
[192.7s] particularly at the table how do you
[195.3s] avoid causing offense or embarrassment
[198.5s] when you are in high-profile situations
[200.8s] and how do you interact in a manner that
[202.9s] is that is respectable with people who
[205.7s] come from different cultures different
[208.0s] nations and different regions
[210.5s] so that's basically going to be our
[212.8s] session outline we will look at the
[214.9s] general
[215.9s] principles uh dining etiquette and I
[219.5s] would like us to link dining etiquette
[221.7s] and the job interviews we will then
[224.1s] conclude and I'll give you a parting
[226.5s] short I want us to start with a quote
[229.9s] just to reflect that business in today's
[233.2s] scenario is not a national match but is
[236.6s] an
[237.3s] Olympics where there are international
[240.1s] players only that individual or
[243.0s] organization can survive which has done
[245.8s] its homework well and developed its
[248.6s] uniqueness what does that tell you that
[251.6s] we are no longer talking about just
[254.0s] yourself and your organization where you
[255.8s] work the world is now a global village
[259.7s] we interact with a lot of
[262.8s] colleagues many networks that we are
[265.2s] creating potential employers and clients
[268.5s] from across the globe whether you're
[270.5s] meeting them physically whether you're
[272.6s] meeting them online and therefore we
[274.7s] must start to appreciate that we have
[277.2s] cultural differences that we must
[279.0s] appreciate and respect if we are to be
[282.9s] ahead of the
[284.4s] game but then what does the Bible say
[286.8s] first things
[288.0s] first you recall Luke chapter
[291.2s] 14 dining with what humility Jesus
[295.8s] teaches about the taking the lowest seat
[298.6s] at a banquet rather than seeking honor
[301.6s] and that basically encourages humility
[304.3s] over Pride when we are in Social
[307.6s] settings uh when you look at 1
[310.1s] Corinthians
[311.8s] 10:31 it talks about consideration for
[314.7s] others and it advises Believers to do
[317.6s] everything for the glory of God which
[319.8s] can include being considerate about
[322.4s] dietary preferences and restrictions
[325.1s] when dining with others I don't know how
[327.9s] many of us sited here were in boarding
[330.9s] school put up your hands if you ever
[333.3s] attended a boarding school almost
[336.5s] everybody and I am very certain for the
[339.6s] men because I have been a high school
[341.8s] teacher and I taught boys what happens
[344.3s] at lunchtime when the bell
[346.5s] goes H there's always
[349.0s] what a rush H and uh why do people
[354.2s] rush and yet the food is
[358.0s] enough the gentleman do you remember
[360.4s] what you called what top what top layer
[365.8s] so you're struggling to make sure that
[367.5s] you get top player now tell me if
[370.5s] students in a school were given the
[372.9s] opportunity to serve themselves do you
[375.8s] think lunch would be enough for
[377.4s] everybody because there's that lack of
[379.6s] consideration for others and I think
[382.1s] that's something that we're getting from
[384.6s] um 1 Corinthians chapter
[388.0s] 10:31 so
[390.3s] when we talk about dining etiquette
[394.8s] remember even though we are not focusing
[397.1s] so much about you enjoying your
[400.1s] ugali in the house with your
[403.7s] managu when we talk about professional
[406.6s] etiquette we talking about a formal
[408.3s] lunch a formal dinner what does that
[410.7s] tell us there are things that you can do
[412.8s] at home that you cannot do in a formal
[415.0s] in a formal setup if you're in a house
[417.9s] in your house you can relax
[420.3s] in jeans in pants you can relax in a
[423.4s] little nice dress but if you're stepping
[425.8s] out for a formal meeting then things
[427.8s] have to do what to change and that also
[430.4s] happens when it comes to dining
[432.2s] etiquette so I want to give us 2 minutes
[435.2s] please stand to your neighbor and share
[438.1s] irritating table
[440.3s] mannerisms what irritates you or what
[442.8s] has embarrassed you before please turn
[445.1s] to your neighbor and share that what
[447.8s] irritates you the most so what irritates
[450.9s] you the most let's hear you can share
[453.4s] your your own experience of what your
[455.4s] colleagues have
[461.6s] shared I love
[465.0s] that are there people here from
[471.9s] Western I'm not saying that's the Habit
[474.4s] there but they love tea isn't it there's
[477.0s] a lady who told me in our class that she
[479.9s] told the boss to transfer her to another
[482.4s] office because she could no longer
[484.5s] stomach the way the colleague SI his tea
[488.0s] and I think we've seen a good example
[489.8s] there okay another irritating mannerism
[492.1s] when someone eats like
[494.5s] this chewing loudly thank you let's have
[498.8s] more examples when St when you st your
[502.4s] tee uh when you st sugar in your tea you
[504.9s] have to hit the the glass tinging thank
[508.2s] you very much by way did you know that
[511.7s] sugar in hot tea naturally dissolves so
[516.8s] all you need to do is to Aid it just a
[519.2s] little but what do we do we really fight
[523.3s] thank you what else irritates you let's
[525.8s] hear um stretching across the table to
[529.0s] reach salt that is far away thank you
[531.6s] very much I want to pause a minute and
[533.8s] talk about that in a meal interview when
[536.8s] you stretch your hand across somebody
[538.9s] else's food or across another table you
[543.0s] know it it indicates a behavior about
[545.3s] yourself what behavior is that you
[548.0s] cannot be a good team player why aren't
[551.3s] you making use of the team member next
[553.5s] to you to make the task
[556.2s] simpler excuse me please could you pass
[559.6s] the
[560.4s] salt and many times when you tell
[563.0s] somebody to pass the salt what do they
[565.0s] do they suddenly remember they also
[567.7s] needed it so they say okay please wait a
[571.7s] minute then you can also come out across
[574.1s] as somebody who is not considerate so
[576.4s] let the salt go then you do what you ask
[579.6s] for it let's have two last ones I'm
[582.8s] Joseph I would say picking teeth with
[584.8s] the tooth pick in the middle of eating
[587.0s] picking your teeth yeah thank you we
[590.0s] will talk about that serving more than
[592.5s] you can eat and then leaving it on the
[594.5s] plate imagine serving a lot of food and
[597.2s] then leaving it where on the plate we'll
[599.7s] also be talking about that so dining
[602.1s] etiquette is an essential skill for
[603.6s] building positive impressions in both
[606.4s] social and professional settings and we
[609.4s] also appreciate like we have already
[611.1s] mentioned that different countries have
[613.4s] different ways of doing things different
[615.5s] regions have different ways of doing
[617.2s] things if you go to China will they give
[620.2s] you a fork and a knife what will they
[622.8s] give you Chopsticks yeah but please
[626.0s] don't go hungry if you're not able to
[627.5s] use the Chopsticks at has flexibility
[630.7s] you can always ask for an alternative
[633.8s] Continental style is about FK and knife
[636.9s] and many question I mean a common
[638.6s] question most participants have always
[640.2s] asked in my classes why don't I just
[642.4s] wash my hands and uh enjoy my fish with
[645.4s] my fingers or I enjoy my chicken with
[647.2s] what with my fingers but remember if you
[650.2s] look at most formal setups when you go
[653.4s] in they'll give you a hot towel to do
[656.2s] what to clean your hands you're not
[660.1s] cleaning your hands to eat the fish with
[661.9s] your fingers you're cleaning your hands
[664.3s] because there items that you might touch
[666.8s] so your hands need to be clean like for
[669.4s] example go ribs you
[671.2s] can you can use your fingers apples you
[674.8s] can touch when you're passing the salt
[677.0s] your hands need to be clean they never
[679.6s] give you a hot towel as you come
[682.2s] out so imagine you have enjoyed your
[684.6s] fish your chicken your fingers are
[687.7s] all h messed up isn't it and then at the
[691.9s] end of the
[692.9s] meal a guest ask for your business card
[696.5s] there's no water there's no hot towel
[698.7s] how do you get your how do you pick your
[701.0s] business card how do you get into your
[703.3s] handbag it becomes a challenge so we
[706.1s] have to appreciate and respect that and
[708.6s] so I think the best way forward really
[710.2s] is to observe how other people behave
[713.3s] hoping that you are also observing
[714.8s] somebody who is doing the right thing I
[717.4s] think the last time we were here last
[718.8s] year I gave an example about this
[720.2s] gentleman it's a very interesting
[721.8s] example who noticed that during the
[724.9s] first dinner there was RA meat on every
[727.9s] table and he was wondering in our
[730.0s] country we don't eat raw meat the only
[733.6s] person he could ask was a Kenan
[735.5s] counterpart but he was SE across another
[738.1s] table so as he looked you know how you
[740.2s] try dashing their eyes to see whether
[741.7s] they can he noticed the colleague was
[744.0s] already munching the RO
[745.9s] meat and then suddenly he saw apparent
[749.5s] every table had a burner so you were
[751.9s] actually supposed to roast the meat as
[754.4s] you eat you who has already started
[757.3s] munching the raw meat do you stop and
[760.2s] start roasting or do you pretend that is
[763.4s] how you wanted it it can get very
[766.3s] embarrassing isn't it please ask by the
[770.2s] way you don't look foolish by asking but
[772.9s] you look ridiculous by doing something
[774.8s] that is contrary to
[777.7s] expectation so is basically about rules
[781.8s] that govern expectations somebody talked
[784.5s] about what irritates him is when you Ser
[786.2s] a lot of food and you don't finish the
[788.8s] expectation is serve what you can finish
[792.6s] moderation is the key word so etiquette
[795.1s] and doram are visible signs that you are
[798.0s] a polished and knowledgeable
[801.0s] professional who among you seated here
[804.3s] would not want to look professional who
[806.8s] would not want to look knowledgeable
[808.6s] even the way you hold your fork and your
[811.8s] knife so etiquette is
[815.1s] about good manners it's about making
[818.0s] others feel comfortable in social
[821.3s] situations um I like the way you
[824.1s] demonstrated the
[826.1s] siping You Pull It You Pull It are you
[829.3s] making other people feel
[831.5s] comfortable are you making people what
[834.1s] are you making the people around you uh
[837.0s] feel so getting now into um the actual
[841.4s] dining etiquette we want to say that as
[843.4s] a young
[845.3s] professional I think Young is relative H
[849.2s] even Nora is Young isn't it at heart I
[852.5s] am also at heart young at heart we all
[855.4s] young because it doesn't matter whether
[857.8s] you are starting your
[860.3s] career uh even older people here also
[863.2s] want to shift careers isn't it so these
[864.9s] rules are applicable good table manners
[867.4s] is a must we don't have choice because
[870.3s] we are constantly attending occasions
[872.8s] either as hosts or as guests and like we
[876.7s] have already said table etiquette varies
[879.2s] considerably with different
[882.0s] cultures allow me to look at a few
[884.6s] General Basics if you're ever invited to
[887.8s] a formal lunch or a formal dinner please
[891.2s] keep
[892.1s] time please keep
[894.4s] time I don't want to ask what time you
[897.6s] arrived for this convention
[900.4s] do you want me to ask you know what time
[903.3s] you arrived isn't it please learn to do
[906.2s] what to keep time it creates positive
[909.5s] Impressions the reason why I think um
[913.0s] partly the organizers were not able to
[915.7s] start the program on time is because we
[918.7s] you know today is Sunday so we have to
[920.3s] wash our clothes we have to do what
[923.0s] clean the house but how many times does
[926.3s] this Council run the YP convention
[929.9s] once once a month once a year so why not
[934.6s] delegate today or Outsource those
[936.5s] services so if you are invited to a
[939.2s] formal lunch a formal dinner please
[941.4s] learn to keep time we will talk about
[943.6s] the order of service order easy to eat
[946.8s] food please remember we have said it's
[949.0s] not about using our fingers what is it
[951.9s] you can comfortably eat with a fork and
[954.5s] a knife if you have never eaten
[957.9s] spaghetti don't try
[961.6s] it practice at home if you don't know
[964.7s] how to eat spaghetti with a fork and a
[966.6s] knife this is not the day to do what to
[969.5s] Adventure serve something that you can
[972.1s] eat gracefully with a fork and a knife I
[976.1s] sat in a um um um a function where
[980.2s] somebody was really struggling to cut a
[982.4s] wing with a fork and a knife Ka
[986.7s] po you can imagine it Landing on
[989.2s] somebody else's plate do you tell them
[992.0s] excuse me sir can I have my do you ask
[995.6s] for it do you let them have it it can be
[998.8s] very very
[1000.0s] embarrassing please can buffets can be
[1003.1s] very
[1004.0s] long have an idea what is on offer if
[1007.3s] there's no queue you can actually take a
[1009.3s] walk and see what is on offer otherwise
[1012.4s] sometimes you're at that fourth point of
[1015.6s] service your plate is already full and
[1018.6s] then you're seeing your favorite food
[1020.9s] ahead I saw in a wedding you know how
[1023.2s] weddings people line up for to serve so
[1026.1s] a lady saw something she liked and then
[1027.7s] she's telling the person behind because
[1029.9s] her plate was already full can I give
[1032.1s] you some
[1033.2s] rice who told you she want your rice she
[1036.3s] also want to pick something that she
[1038.5s] likes please serve an item at a time
[1043.0s] when you are at a function you are all
[1045.3s] there for the same purpose so don't be
[1047.0s] in a hurry never find yourself at the
[1050.2s] table with your salad you bring the soup
[1054.8s] because you bring the main meal you
[1057.1s] bring the dessert then now you do what
[1059.8s] you
[1061.7s] sit Nora was talking about
[1064.0s] entrepreneurship this is not an
[1065.8s] opportunity to mobilize
[1068.4s] resources you can mobilize the resources
[1071.1s] elsewhere isn't it but at the table
[1073.6s] serve an item at an item at a time move
[1078.2s] in t you're sharing a table three people
[1080.6s] four people please make sure that you're
[1082.7s] moving at the same
[1084.9s] pace so that you don't eat so quickly or
[1088.4s] you skip some items and then you finish
[1090.4s] eating and the others are still eating
[1092.1s] what will you be
[1094.3s] doing then now that is when you see
[1096.4s] people being tempted to use their phones
[1098.2s] on the table which is also not good
[1101.3s] manners and this is something I have
[1103.2s] also observed you know as Adventists we
[1105.8s] always told by nutritionists that fruit
[1108.9s] are best
[1110.0s] eaten before the meal isn't it but they
[1112.9s] will also tell you eat the
[1115.6s] fruit um how many minutes before the
[1118.4s] meal 30 minutes you realize in a formal
[1122.2s] lunch I'm always we always hosting Mr
[1125.4s] mangeli at KSG in formal functions he
[1128.2s] will tell you in a formal lunch you
[1130.1s] don't have that privilege of 30 minutes
[1133.0s] so because of that please don't look
[1136.6s] ridiculous in a formal setup
[1139.4s] because if you're eating fruit when
[1142.1s] others are taking soup it is like the
[1145.0s] driver on the road who is driving in the
[1146.8s] opposite what direction for this
[1149.8s] particular day haia please eat the fruit
[1153.7s] as dessert as planned in that particular
[1156.5s] what in that particular setup and then
[1158.6s] we can do our our normal uh fruits
[1161.9s] before the meal at home when we have
[1164.5s] enough time to do the 30 minutes never
[1167.2s] intercept a pass I think we talked about
[1169.6s] intercepting salt or an item if you need
[1172.5s] to leave the table before everybody else
[1174.5s] please remember to say excuse me it
[1177.1s] doesn't matter whether you know them or
[1179.3s] not this is what our colleague has
[1181.6s] talked about please serve what you can
[1183.4s] finish please look at that plate that
[1186.2s] bread is not even touched is it touched
[1191.6s] huh and who served it yourself serve
[1196.4s] what you can finish we talked about the
[1200.2s] hot
[1201.3s] towel and you can also be given a finger
[1204.1s] bowel the hot towel is for cleaning your
[1207.9s] hands like we said you need to have your
[1209.6s] hands clean please don't say hey they
[1212.2s] knew how I was sweating so you start
[1215.3s] wiping your neck you wipe your face we
[1218.6s] have even seen people blow their noses
[1220.6s] into those napkins it can be so
[1223.2s] irritating please remember it is for
[1225.7s] cleaning your hands if you look at the
[1228.4s] finger finger ball it's called a finger
[1230.8s] ball because you're supposed to clean
[1232.3s] the tips of your fingers don't go
[1235.2s] dipping your whole hand can you imagine
[1236.9s] your hand in that little glass so you
[1239.2s] start splashing water on the nice
[1241.6s] linen use it to clean your fingertips
[1244.5s] and if you look there's Cutlery by the
[1247.3s] side there's beautiful linen and a nice
[1249.2s] little glass with lemon water please
[1251.8s] don't mistake it for the first
[1255.2s] item of the meal we have seen people
[1259.1s] do what take it there are also napkins
[1262.6s] that look like um you know you remember
[1266.4s] PCO they look like Parco so you're
[1269.1s] supposed to do what to dissolve it in
[1272.0s] water and then it opens up some people
[1274.7s] think there's somebody who took it and
[1276.9s] threw it in the mouth and then what does
[1279.8s] the saliva do it it opens it up so you
[1283.4s] can imagine the discomfort and the
[1287.2s] embarrassment Okay so so where do you
[1289.3s] place the napkin place it on the lap
[1292.5s] never force it here like a baby beb have
[1295.6s] you seen people have their napkins here
[1298.1s] some people even put settes here
[1299.8s] honestly it looks so
[1302.1s] ridiculous gentlemen there are some that
[1304.7s] have a button hole at the at one corner
[1308.2s] that allows you to button it on your
[1309.8s] shirt but otherwise without that place
[1312.3s] it on the lab however I like giving a
[1316.0s] precaution if you think when you eat
[1319.2s] you're normally a little clumsy because
[1321.2s] we all different I would rather you look
[1324.0s] ridiculous by having it here than
[1326.2s] messing your what your nice Shar yeah so
[1330.1s] there's that
[1332.6s] flexibility when you're seated at the
[1335.2s] table sit upright let the food come to
[1338.6s] the
[1339.4s] mouth don't take your head where to the
[1343.2s] plate we do that several times and then
[1345.4s] don't put your elbows your elbows on the
[1348.0s] table
[1349.4s] um in terms of uh setup we normally say
[1353.8s] your solids are to the left your liquids
[1356.2s] are to your right solid in this case
[1358.6s] refers to your side plate because it
[1360.8s] carries your bread and butter your water
[1363.6s] your glasses are the ones on your right
[1365.7s] hand side please remember on a round
[1370.1s] table the side plate on the left and the
[1372.7s] one on the right are very close to you
[1375.2s] so if you're going to use the side plate
[1377.2s] on the right
[1380.9s] stick to your lane side plate to the
[1383.6s] left your water your liquid to your
[1385.9s] right now in terms of the cut we
[1389.0s] normally start from the
[1390.7s] outside coming inside and that will tell
[1394.2s] you um
[1396.3s] sorry that will tell you the item that
[1399.0s] will come first um on the menu if you
[1402.8s] look at that setup what do you think is
[1404.6s] first on the menu what is first on the
[1406.6s] menu soup and the waiters will keep
[1409.9s] clearing until finally you're left with
[1412.4s] what the meat knife and the meat fork
[1415.3s] for the main for the main meal that
[1418.4s] plate looks very be beautiful and big
[1422.9s] but the only plate or part of the plate
[1425.4s] that is called a functional plate is the
[1428.1s] one that is not dotted can you see the
[1430.1s] inner part of the plate that is the only
[1432.9s] part that is called a functional what so
[1436.2s] your food should never find it
[1439.2s] place on the dotted part of the plate
[1442.6s] but how many of us find food on the
[1444.4s] dotted part of the
[1446.2s] plate why do we have food on the dotted
[1449.1s] part of the plate because we never
[1451.4s] appreciate the meaning of buffet buffet
[1454.4s] means you have a variety to do what to
[1457.4s] choose from but what do we normally do
[1461.5s] we serve
[1463.1s] ugali chapati both white and brown
[1469.5s] rice
[1471.0s] mimo M then we do what
[1475.6s] fish chicken go ribs and
[1482.3s] injah you're just next to the Integrity
[1485.1s] Center what else would you call
[1489.0s] corruption you might find yourself in
[1491.3s] that building isn't it answering
[1493.8s] questions so please make sure that your
[1496.1s] food is confined to the inner part of
[1498.9s] the plate image is important First
[1502.6s] Impressions we said when you're serving
[1504.9s] your food you should never have food on
[1507.8s] top of
[1509.2s] another you put your beef rice on top
[1513.6s] chapati on
[1515.6s] top
[1519.7s] know so you're supposed to serve your
[1522.0s] food on the plate so that you have
[1525.8s] portions every food should occupy its
[1528.2s] own own portion I think sister Eva the
[1530.6s] next time we do a practicum eh we should
[1533.4s] have a formal lunch where we doing this
[1535.4s] practically so you serve and then you
[1537.3s] make sure that what is hard to cut like
[1539.8s] the beef or the whatever that you need
[1543.0s] to cut with a knife is closest to you so
[1546.0s] that you're not stretching the knife too
[1548.0s] far and that is how you have spillage on
[1550.9s] the
[1551.8s] table um in terms of handling utensils
[1556.2s] the index fingers do the supp h i was H
[1559.7s] I was hoping I have a pen so you hold
[1563.2s] with the index
[1565.0s] Fingers um thank you sister Rose the
[1568.0s] index fingers doing the support you hold
[1571.1s] your knife like
[1572.9s] that and the
[1580.5s] F but how do we normally
[1583.1s] hold sometimes like

[1605.3s] soup for eating rice on the table so
[1608.0s] you're supposed to use your fork and
[1610.4s] knife for the main meal and make sure
[1613.0s] that you're holding it properly this is
[1615.2s] called rest position when you put place
[1618.4s] your Cy knife and fork side by side like
[1622.1s] facing 11:00 on the on the wall clock it
[1625.2s] means finished position you're beckoning
[1627.1s] the waiter to come and clear when you
[1629.7s] place your cut like this you're not done
[1631.8s] with your meal probably you're taking
[1634.0s] part in small talk on the table small
[1636.0s] conversation or you're relaxing
[1638.8s] otherwise that is how sometimes you have
[1640.4s] saved you know that best part of the
[1641.8s] chicken for last you go to pick

[1665.5s] some people even mix up eh you mix up
[1669.4s] mix things up on the plate and then you
[1671.0s] start eating it does not give a good
[1673.4s] impression it can also make your food to
[1675.6s] go cold okay now we talked about um did
[1679.4s] we talk about passing food when you're
[1681.1s] passing food you pass it from the left
[1683.1s] to the right so look at how you you're
[1684.8s] SE on the table if somebody's at the far
[1687.4s] end you don't have to also pass your
[1690.1s] hand across the table to pass the salt
[1693.2s] you let the food go in a circle so you
[1696.3s] pass it to the next person who will then
[1698.9s] also pass it and then if you have two
[1701.7s] Salt I mean two shakers there's salt and
[1704.7s] there's pepper sometimes we are not very
[1707.1s] sure which is salt which is paper please
[1709.4s] pass both let the person be the one to
[1712.1s] discover so that you don't kill them
[1713.7s] with pipil when they're thinking it is
[1715.8s] salt that you're giving them if anything
[1719.5s] Falls sometimes we stand we forget we
[1722.0s] had a napkin and it falls please never
[1725.2s] crawl under the table call the waiter to
[1728.6s] do what H you can imagine Mr mangel in
[1732.4s] his tie under the table to pick a napkin
[1735.6s] and then he gets stuck and I
[1743.0s] waiter means waiting upon you so just
[1746.1s] call the waiter and they will be able to
[1748.8s] assist please don't use the phone on the
[1751.1s] table sometimes we are eating and we are
[1753.9s] still chatting with friends or you're
[1756.9s] picking calls it is not good maners uh
[1760.3s] to pick your phone at the table don't
[1762.7s] talk with your utensils do you remember
[1765.2s] what we said in the YP convention eh
[1768.8s] you're you're doing what you're pointing
[1771.2s] with a fork and a knife it's not good
[1774.0s] manners um remember to place it in the
[1777.7s] rest position ladies where should we do
[1780.2s] that in the bathroom don't freshen up um
[1784.9s] don't freshen up at the table okay so I
[1788.0s] have additional uh tips chew with your
[1791.3s] mouth closed remember the sounds that
[1793.8s] our colleague talked about please engage
[1796.0s] in polite conversation don't just focus
[1797.9s] on on the meal you're just eating you
[1800.2s] have a neighbor that is an opportunity
[1802.3s] to network take part in polite
[1804.6s] conversation test your food before
[1806.7s] seasoning have you seen people who sit
[1808.9s] at the table and they quickly do what
[1811.2s] they add salt even before they test in
[1813.2s] an interview you would fail because that
[1816.2s] means that you make hasty decisions who
[1819.2s] has told you the food does not have
[1821.3s] enough salt uh thank the host always
[1824.3s] Express gratitude after the meal and
[1826.9s] thank the host for their host
[1828.0s] Hospitality don't pick at your food I
[1830.6s] have seen people sometimes you enjoying
[1832.8s] a meal and then they e this beef today
[1835.5s] it's terrible this chicken it's and
[1837.8s] somebody is really enjoying on the other
[1839.8s] side please keep those to yourself yeah
[1843.7s] avoid making a scene about disliking
[1846.0s] something don't monopolize the
[1848.1s] conversation allow others to speak and
[1850.4s] be considerate of everyone's input and
[1852.8s] don't make loud noises I think we talked
[1854.8s] about that don't start eating too early
[1857.4s] even if you're too hungry yeah please
[1860.4s] get cues from the host don't discuss
[1863.1s] money or the bill it considered
[1867.8s] impolite they sell chicken at
[1873.0s] 1,200 if you have been invited please
[1876.2s] enjoy enjoy the
[1878.3s] meal so what about uh proper dining
[1881.9s] etiquette and job interviews proper
[1883.9s] dining etiquette in a job interview is
[1885.7s] more than just knowing how to use your
[1887.2s] forend your knife we talked about
[1889.4s] Impressions it is one more way to make
[1891.6s] sure you leave a lasting impression that
[1894.0s] is positive to your potential employer
[1897.2s] so I will share uh seven tips and then
[1900.0s] we conclude the first one is First
[1902.2s] Impressions count your behavior during
[1904.6s] the meal is an opportunity to make a
[1907.1s] strong first
[1908.8s] impression poor dining etiquette can
[1911.2s] reflect negatively on your overall
[1913.6s] professionalism it actually shows that
[1915.6s] you you don't pay attention to details
[1918.3s] uh dining etiquette when it is practiced
[1920.6s] properly it shows respect because then
[1923.3s] it means you have consideration for
[1925.4s] other people the third tip is it can
[1929.3s] actually be a demonstration of good
[1931.5s] communication skills light conversation
[1934.2s] demonstrates your ability to balance
[1936.9s] polite small talk with eating or having
[1940.0s] your meal so therefore it is a key to
[1942.4s] fostering good rapport with interviewers
[1945.4s] and it shows your social competence
[1948.1s] remember that when we talk about
[1950.4s] self-awareness for example you talk
[1952.2s] about are you aware about yourself and
[1955.2s] the actions that you do how do they
[1957.6s] affect what impact do they have on
[1960.2s] others that's the social competence Go
[1962.7s] dining etiquette reflect self-awareness
[1965.4s] let's move on to the fifth one it
[1967.8s] minimizes
[1969.2s] distruction you can imagine those sounds
[1971.5s] that we talked about they can be so
[1973.0s] distracting you're taking your tea
[1975.0s] you're slapping it you're chewing your
[1976.9s] food
[1978.6s] have you ever sat next to somebody who
[1980.1s] when they're chewing their food they
[1981.7s] also showering you with food particles
[1984.6s] it can be very
[1986.4s] distracting yeah so it also represents
[1990.0s] cultural sensitivity In some cultures
[1993.3s] dining etiquette holds particular
[1995.4s] significance and therefore when you show
[1997.9s] awareness of those practices it means
[1999.9s] you respect the culture of those people
[2002.7s] it is therefore important if the job
[2004.6s] involves international relations or
[2007.2s] working with diverse teams because then
[2009.2s] it means that you are culturally
[2011.9s] sensitive and finally it reflects
[2014.8s] professionalism your ability to maintain
[2017.4s] composure in a dining setting is part of
[2020.1s] your overall presentation of
[2022.1s] professionalism so when you're able to
[2023.9s] navigate a lunch interview with Grace
[2026.6s] with deorum and courtesy it sets you
[2029.8s] apart from the other candidates
[2033.3s] remember when you go for a normal
[2035.6s] interview you have all met the same
[2038.2s] criteria because if it is academic
[2040.3s] qualifications you're at the same level
[2042.7s] professional experience you're at the
[2044.4s] same level so what sets you apart so
[2047.5s] these are just additional strategies
[2050.1s] that are used to pick those who stand
[2052.0s] out from the
[2053.6s] crowd so in conclusion we want to say
[2056.9s] etiquette is an essential element that
[2059.5s] shapes an individual's
[2061.8s] image your reputation and your
[2065.3s] relationships etiquette ensures
[2067.3s] interaction are respectful professional
[2070.1s] and considerate and in a world where
[2072.7s] First Impressions and ongoing
[2074.8s] relationships matter more than ever
[2077.7s] knowing and understanding and embracing
[2080.2s] etiquette particularly the etiquette uh
[2082.8s] the dining etiquette that we are talking
[2084.4s] about today is key to success both at
[2087.7s] your personal level and even at your
[2090.0s] professional
[2091.4s] level I have a parting shot and that's
[2094.3s] an African proverb that says you don't
[2097.2s] ask for or a chair when you visit a
[2100.0s] place where the chief himself sits on
[2102.4s] the floor in other words when you go to
[2106.0s] Rome you do as you do as the Romans do
[2109.2s] so thank you very much ladies and
[2110.7s] gentlemen I hope we have some two three
[2113.0s] minutes for questions so the first
[2115.7s] question is um I eat very slowly and
[2119.2s] often have business or lunch discussions
[2121.5s] where I end up being the last person to
[2123.7s] finish and have to derail the other
[2126.2s] person how can I save myself out of
[2128.7s] these situations that's the first one
[2131.3s] and then the second question on
[2133.0s] etiquette is um I still feel that we
[2137.0s] esteem other people's cultures to the
[2139.6s] detriment of ours I ask what is wrong
[2143.3s] with our African or Kenyan way of eating
[2145.9s] or dining so I think we'll start with
[2148.7s] those two questions speed at which we
[2151.2s] eat is so different there are those who
[2153.5s] eat very
[2154.7s] fast the ones we saidak
[2157.8s] when the others are eating and this one
[2160.6s] is a slow can we call them a slow
[2163.7s] eater and sometimes you find um probably
[2167.7s] you're being left behind I have a
[2170.2s] personal experience where I had a
[2171.8s] business meeting and I I tagged a
[2175.0s] colleague along and she ate so slowly
[2178.2s] even when everybody's um like the host
[2181.3s] had actually indicated they're in a
[2182.8s] hurry and you could actually see they
[2184.8s] want to stand and she's still there
[2187.6s] enjoying her enjoying her meal how do we
[2191.4s] balance that between not completely uh
[2195.9s] enjoying the meal and the speed at which
[2198.2s] we ought to move because of other
[2200.7s] engagement and this is something that I
[2202.6s] have always said when you're going to a
[2204.1s] formal lunch or a formal engagement
[2206.8s] please don't go on a hungry
[2208.7s] stomach don't go on a hungry stomach
[2211.0s] because sometimes when you're so hungry
[2212.7s] you're tempted to probably just ensure
[2214.6s] that you have eaten to your f
[2218.2s] make sure that you're not too hungry so
[2220.0s] that because this is not something that
[2221.8s] you're going to overcome overnight if
[2224.3s] you're naturally if you naturally eat
[2226.1s] slowly you will definitely eat slowly so
[2228.4s] please serve just enough that we make
[2230.9s] sure that you will finish with the rest
[2234.3s] and because you will have eaten then you
[2236.2s] will not be too hungry but I think even
[2239.5s] for the host I want to encourage them
[2241.9s] when you realize that you have a guests
[2245.1s] who are eating slowly you can also slow
[2248.2s] your pace so that you don't
[2250.0s] inconvenience your guest so it's two way
[2253.5s] the other question is why are we
[2255.2s] glorifying other cultures and not our
[2258.4s] Kenyan way of
[2259.8s] dining by the way everything that we
[2262.7s] have talked about is
[2265.1s] African I know we did not have Fox and
[2268.1s] knife and when we talk about glorifying
[2270.9s] other cultures we are talking about a
[2274.4s] shift why are we wearing this clothes
[2276.8s] that we are wearing maybe that is where
[2278.4s] we should start why do we use computers
[2281.5s] How African is a
[2283.2s] computer so we have
[2285.5s] embraced cultures that we must also
[2289.3s] respect the fact that we are speaking
[2291.4s] English that is not our mother tongue it
[2293.8s] means that we have embraced other
[2295.4s] people's cultures but allow me to go
[2297.8s] back to the African culture in terms of
[2299.6s] dining
[2301.3s] etiquette how many people come from
[2303.6s] Western specifically luah put up your
[2306.5s] hands if you come from the Lua culture
[2310.4s] yeah did you know among the Lua culture
[2314.3s] you know traditionally when you look at
[2315.9s] the lah culture most of the some of the
[2318.8s] activities that you have in the culture
[2320.4s] is um traditionally bull fighting and
[2323.5s] circum and there's one drink that you
[2325.8s] can never miss which is tea in fact they
[2328.4s] say
[2331.0s] China so what happened traditionally
[2334.4s] when uh te was served it was not served
[2337.6s] in cups and saucers like we Ser today
[2340.8s] people would be seated on the ground on
[2344.2s] the grass cups are distributed and
[2347.5s] somebody goes around with a tea
[2349.9s] on yeah and when you see your guest Even
[2352.8s] in our normal homes when you see the
[2355.0s] guest the tea is getting to the bottom
[2356.8s] of the cup what do we normally do we
[2359.6s] replenish and how do we do it how do we
[2362.9s] normally say if you don't want a second
[2364.8s] cup how do you normally tell the host
[2367.6s] you shake your head those who wear
[2369.7s] earrings they're even likely to fall off
[2372.4s] you even cover the cup isn't it which is
[2374.8s] not good manners in the lyer culture
[2378.3s] traditionally when you're holding that
[2380.8s] cup and the cup has a handle you turn
[2383.9s] the cup to face the person who is
[2387.8s] approaching you with the tea that way
[2390.1s] you have communicated that no thank you
[2393.7s] I will not have enough traditionally if
[2397.4s] if you look at
[2399.7s] how um they did things traditionally in
[2402.5s] the African culture they would tell
[2405.3s] you that H you don't eat hot food
[2409.9s] especially
[2411.0s] mandazi
[2413.6s] yeah they would have Proverbs they would
[2415.9s] have saying to discourage you from doing
[2418.2s] things that they thought were contrary
[2420.0s] because they were trying to inculcate uh
[2422.6s] specific aspect of eate so this is not
[2425.0s] really about a foreign culture but there
[2428.0s] are cultures that are mixed both African
[2430.1s] and Western and because we have embraced
[2432.4s] then we have to observe the rules we
[2435.4s] didn't have cars in the African culture
[2437.4s] but now we are driving them and when you
[2439.4s] hit the road you know there's a rule
[2440.9s] that says keep left if you keep right
[2443.7s] what will happen you'll cause an
[2445.9s] accident and there'll be confusion
[2447.3s] there'll be traffic jam so there's a h
[2449.6s] we have to have a balance between the
[2451.2s] two thank you what do you do if the host
[2454.3s] chooses to wash hands and eat the ugali
[2457.0s] with their
[2458.0s] hands um so I'm assuming the person is
[2461.2s] afraid of eating ugali with their hands
[2464.2s] yes if the boss actually decides to eat
[2467.4s] ugali with their hands so do you follow
[2471.3s] protocol uh that's a very good question
[2474.0s] because sometimes as the host or as the
[2477.2s] boss you're supposed to probably re
[2479.8s] relax the rules if you notice where
[2482.8s] maybe people are having a
[2485.2s] cocktail and they both decides to be the
[2488.1s] one to be the first on the dance floor
[2490.4s] they are flexing the rules to make
[2492.2s] people comfortable so if the boss or the
[2495.3s] host washes their hands they're
[2497.8s] basically saying you're free to to do
[2500.9s] the same so you can do the same thank
[2503.7s] you for that and then the last question
[2505.8s] is a personal question to you on your um
[2510.1s] education background so the question
[2511.8s] says how did you shift your career from
[2514.3s] education to where you are right now
[2518.2s] I love that
[2519.8s] okay
[2523.2s] um first I believe I'm still an educator
[2526.1s] because I teach I train uh there's a
[2529.2s] little shift because of the passion I
[2531.0s] have for what I do now um in terms of
[2534.2s] protocol and etiquette I think as I grew
[2537.5s] up I have had uh several motivating
[2542.0s] factors one of
[2544.2s] my um eate gurus as I grew up some of
[2550.4s] them were my
[2552.0s] grandmothers I noticed how they did
[2554.9s] things um without taking a lot of time I
[2558.1s] I'll talk about two scenarios one is a
[2561.0s] grandmother of mine who would always in
[2564.0s] terms of dress code she would always
[2566.4s] wear
[2567.3s] stockings to the
[2569.3s] market and I don't know at that time
[2572.0s] where she would get her wig she would be
[2574.4s] so smart when other women were wearing
[2576.8s] head C she would have her with and she'
[2579.1s] always carry a handbag she's going to
[2581.0s] the market and when she buys her items
[2583.9s] at the market she' never carry them on
[2586.1s] her
[2587.3s] head you know traditionally by there you
[2589.8s] could send anybody's child so she would
[2592.6s] just pick on anybody and tell them this
[2594.7s] is my shopping basket please take it
[2597.2s] home then she would walk home slowly
[2599.9s] with her
[2601.3s] handbag I really used to admire her even
[2604.5s] if it rain should not run she just walk
[2608.3s] and you know later the networking that
[2610.6s] probably the other speakers will be
[2612.2s] talking about when my came to our
[2615.5s] village and they were asking for a
[2617.7s] representative who do you think the
[2619.5s] village has
[2620.8s] nominated everybody said penina and that
[2623.4s] is how my grandmother landed an
[2625.4s] opportunity to serve as m laer w so even
[2629.1s] just maintaining your mannerisms at the
[2631.7s] table can land you an opportunity you
[2633.6s] never know the second one I think uh uh
[2637.2s] that's enough for my grandmothers the
[2638.6s] second one is high
[2640.7s] school um I went to moal high school
[2644.7s] Elder and uh we never cured for
[2650.4s] lunch we would always eat eat at tables
[2654.7s] so 10 people per table the four ones
[2659.0s] were responsible for bringing the food
[2661.4s] to the table in bowels then they were
[2664.0s] supposed to arrange the plates
[2667.2s] the form twos would be the ones to clear
[2670.3s] the table after lunch the form threes
[2673.4s] would be the ones to serve the food so
[2675.6s] we learned how to share because then if
[2678.4s] you don't balance the food somebody else
[2680.5s] will miss a piece of chicken or beef
[2682.5s] isn't it so we learned to share and then
[2684.4s] the pH Falls it's your time to relax
[2687.8s] enjoy the meal and go away leave the
[2689.8s] plate on the table for the form to to do
[2691.6s] what to clear we were never allowed to
[2694.4s] eat with our fingers we ate with a fork
[2699.3s] and a knife and apart from that there
[2701.5s] were many other things that we learned
[2703.9s] uh we would be told slippers a bathroom
[2706.5s] shoes just a few to share I was so
[2709.7s] shocked when I went to the university
[2711.9s] and I would see men wearing slippers to
[2714.4s] class for me it was a culture shock so I
[2718.6s] think that really um encouraged me to
[2722.6s] get so interested in this uh soft skills
[2725.7s] to say when I became a teacher I taught
[2728.6s] English and literature and I actually
[2731.0s] noticed in the curriculum I don't know
[2733.2s] if there are any teachers here there
[2735.0s] were sessions on etiquette but the
[2737.8s] teachers would not teach they would not
[2739.7s] focus because you know in school people
[2742.5s] focus on what examinable items but I
[2746.6s] enjoyed I enjoyed teaching that in fact
[2749.1s] I remember when I I joined one
[2753.8s] school I didn't know that teachers can
[2755.9s] also be bullied
[2757.6s] I was given you know that the loudest
[2761.1s] class the the one that has rude boys I
[2764.8s] taught in boys schools and so I felt
[2768.0s] what do I Do by the the boys were very
[2770.0s] dirty and loud and rude but I decided
[2774.6s] the best way is to make them my friends
[2777.6s] and then it is not very comfortable when
[2779.1s] you go to class and there's a fou smell
[2781.5s] the class is dirty so I told them why
[2783.5s] don't we clean so we started cleaning
[2785.4s] the class sweeping and soon everybody
[2788.4s] wanted to come and teach in that class
[2790.2s] that class that nobody wanted to to come
[2792.4s] and teach one step I took I told them I
[2795.4s] want to visit you how come when I I am
[2797.3s] on duty I never see those clothes hang
[2800.4s] when do you wash them they're looking at
[2802.3s] me like you m you mean those ones are
[2804.0s] normally washed I'm sure the men here
[2806.1s] are listening to me and that is making
[2808.4s] some sense so we opened one of the
[2810.9s] routine checks we opened one box I told
[2814.5s] them I'm visiting so we opened a box
[2818.1s] you find bread half and it is open next
[2822.2s] we is soap the soap they used in the
[2825.2s] morning next we is kiwi
[2828.0s] open next wheat is a pile of
[2832.0s] innerware that so water I don't know
[2834.9s] when last and let me tell you the Sten
[2837.8s] that came out of that box was enough to
[2839.6s] make somebody fall so I told them let's
[2842.0s] start washing these things let's start
[2844.8s] cleaning this is not uh um blowing my
[2848.8s] own trumpet but I want to tell you for
[2851.6s] the first time by the time those boys
[2853.4s] got to form four for the first time in
[2855.6s] the history of that school they took
[2857.6s] boys to the university so I believe
[2860.2s] there's a link between being clean
[2864.0s] and and being clean upstairs isn't it
[2867.1s] yeah so that is how I got the interest
[2869.8s] and uh that explains the shift thank you
