read from the book of James 1 verse1 17 I say earlier that God has given us a gift and the Bible says in the Book of James 1:1 17 every good and perfect gift is from above H Allelujah coming down from the father of the Heavenly light who the does not change like shifting Shadows that gift is in the person of Jesus Christ God has given us a gift a special gift and because we are celebrating something that the Lord has done for Humanity the gift of Freedom that the Lord has given to humanity through the person of Jesus Christ and this day we are celebrating the person of Jesus J Christ himself because through him that God has brought freedom to this world freedom in Jesus Christ as the Bible says in the Book of John 8:36 so if the son sets you free you will be free indeed Hallelujah if the son set you free you will be free indeed is there anyone who doesn't like the freedom from God is there anyone at all all of us we are in need of Freedom why are we in need of freedom because there are so many bondages we live in a world of bondages spiritual bondages bondages from sin from fear of death condemnation Satan's control and deception idolatry and false worship we need freedom freedom from emotional bondages anxiety worry depression and despair bitterness and unforgiveness we need freedom from relational bondages bondages freedom from toxic relationships and abusive patterns we need freedom from unhealthy dependencies we need freedom from racial and ethnic divisions we need freedom from physical bondages freedom from sickness freedom from all kinds of diseases freedom from addiction freedom from substance abuse freedom from oppression and Injustice we need freedom from mental illnesses freedom from mental bondages negative thought patterns and strongholds fear doubt and unbelief confusion and disorientation in Christ today we are called to be free from these bondages and to live a life of Freedom joy and purpose as we look around the world we see thousands of people who live in bondages but Christ is letting us today know reminding us that we have freedom in him and that is the gift that God himself has given to the world freedom in Jesus Christ as we walk around we travel around the world we see people living in bondages and as as sometime I W I remember some stories stories of a young boy not more than 10 years old walking around a trash can for food looking for food his eyes were sunken his clothes Ted and his spirit Crush he is the victim of neglect a victim of Abandonment Satan has bound him with chains of hopelessness and he has lost his sense of dignity and Worth to that boy of 10 years old as he grows up he keeps in mind that God is not a loving God Satan has bound him I also remember a story of a young woman a young woman named akua who live in a village a rural Village she was struggling to find a job and was desperate for a solution and then a friend came to her and introduced her to a wit Doctor Who promised her to help her find an employment AKA was skeptical at first but the rich doctor promises were enticing and soon she began visiting that rich doctor looking for help but not knowing that Satan himself was capturing capturing in her I also remember a story of a family in a small town that was deeply involved in idol worship they will offer sacrifices to their idols and seek their guidance and protection however as time went on the family began to experience a series of misfortunes their crops will fail their animals will fall ill and their relationship will become stren we live in a world of bondage bondage from so many places I also remember a story of a br brilliant student of the name Kofi who became fascinated with mystical Supernatural and devilish practices that students soon spend time hours studying books on witchcraft and demonology and he even began to practice some of these rituals and spells captured by the devil captured by the devil the devil put him in his cage I also remember a story of a girl young girl Amar who was possessed by a demon she will experience violent convulsions and she will speak in a voice that was not her own Satan capture her I also remember a story of group of young people who got GED around a street corner maybe some of you may have seen them inhaling glue and other substances their eyes are glassy their speech slow and their fatures uncertain they are captives of addiction Bound by the chains of substance abuse Satan has deceived them into believing that these substances will bring them escape and comfort captured by the Devil Himself captured by the satans I also remember the stories of prostitutes prostitutes and adulterers who engage into acts that dishonor God their souls are wounded they they are victims they are victims of devise of Satan himself Satan has bound them with chains of Shame and exploitation they are controlled by the whims of Satan remember I also remember the story of a man as I saw him walking ping back and forth on the sidewalk talking to himself and jering widely he is the victim of mental illness Bound by the chains of confusion fear and isolation Satan has deceived him into believing that he is alone that no one cares and that he is beyond God's Rich captured by Satan himself I also remember the story of this corrupt businessman as I saw him driving a luxurious C wearing expensive clothes and flushing a fake smile but behind the faade he is bound by the chains of GED corruption and deceit Satan has deceived him into believing that wealth and power are the ultimate goals and that the ends justifies the mean the list is so long we can think of corrupt police officers corrupt lawyers Maybe corrupt pastors and who know maybe who knows maybe corrupts Elders corrupt church members these stories illustrate the reality of spiritual bondage in our Human Experience Satan chains are real they are binding people in various forms of captivity but the good news is that God has given us a gift has given a gift that gift is in Jesus Christ who has come to set the captives free as Jesus were walking around as we read it in the Book of Matthew chapter 9:35 when he was here on Earth when he was walking around through the cities and Villages he preached the good news good news of the kingdom and he healed every form of spiritual and mental disease all kinds of spiritual and even physical bondages Jesus has the power I want to let you know to break every chain to heal every wound and to set every captive free are you in the bondage today the good news as we see in the Book of John chter 8:36 so if the son set you free you will be you will be free indeed hallelujah our freedom is in Christ the Bible clearly Define what we mean we mean by Freedom according to the Bible according Freedom according to the Bible is the presence of a new nature empowered by the Holy Spirit to live a life that honors God and serves others that is the freedom that Christ has come to give us Brethren and sisters the new nature set us free from external bondages and I even don't know which kind of bondages you find yourself in but the good news is that God has prepared away and he is ready even now to set us free to the Jews the Bible says who had believed him Jesus said if you hold to my teaching you are really my disciple then you will know the truth and the truth will set you free Hallelujah freedom is in Jesus Christ it is not in the world but is in the person of Jesus himself now when we look at the freedom of what the Satan himself is giving us is different from the one that Christ is given us as we move to the next slide freedom of Satan set you in a cage to dishonor God recently I I think that was on Thursday as I was reading through some news through BBC News and then I came across something a story whereby hundreds and even thousands of people of of the same sex who were celebrating something that their country did their country did for them and and that is in Thailand the law has approved the marriage the marriage of people of the same sex and then as some of them now gather to get married then they made this big claim they said today we open the door of freedom to all Humanity they said they open the door of freedom to all Humanity not knowing that Satan is putting them where in his cage Satan is putting them in his cage that is not freedom Freedom according to the will of God is to live a life that honors God the ministry of Jesus himself was centered on the concept of Freedom his work was a work of Liberation for instance as we go through the Book of Mark Jesus is portrayed as the one who brings freedom freedom to those for who follow him this freedom is not just from external circumstances but also from internal bondage such as Sin fear and guilt by embracing Jesus as Lord and Savior we can experience the liberating power of his love and grace and that is the freedom the gift that God has given us through the person of Jesus Christ freedom from demonic possession freedom from sin and guilt freedom from fear and anxiety Freedom that leads us to service and love love Jesus teaches that true greatness comes from serving others freeing his followers to live a life of Selfless Love and service Hallelujah that is the kind of Freedom that God himself has given to humanity Freedom according to the Book of Mark freedom from the power of death that we find in Jesus Christ himself Jesus resurrection for instance demonstrate his victory over death those who have lost the loved ones recently can can relate with this can relate with the freedom that Christ is given to humanity victory over death offering freedom from the fear of death and the promise of eternal life freedom in Jesus Christ now when we look at the name of Jesus every aspect of the name of Jesus is connected to the concept of Freedom the Christians gospel is inseparably connected to Freedom and this appears in the very name of Jesus Christ which means yeh saves Jesus Christ is freedom and the gift that God has given to humanity as I look through the name of Jesus I was looking through every aspect of his name and I came to understand that every aspect of Jesus Christ of the name of Jesus Christ is connected to the concept of what of Freedom you may refer to his name as Savior you may refer to his name as Messiah Christ the Lamb of God bridegroom Living Water Redeemer Tree of Life Strong Tower deliverer the door Yeshua the the name the name every aspect of his name Lion of the tribe of Judah the way truth and life the great Physicians the Good Shepherd Alpha and Omega Everlasting father the Chief Cornerstone faithful and true great high priest the word of God The Great I Am Prince of Peace Kings of Kings Lords of Lord bread of life son of man Son of God Emmanuel Refuge friend every name of Jesus Christ is connected to the concept of freedom and that's why the Bible says God has given us a gift and that gift is in Jesus Christ and that is the gift of Freedom that he himself gives to humanity only the one who is totally free can ultimately be a liberator it is only Jesus Christ who is completely free that can set you free today you cannot look for your freedom in somebody else that freedom is found in Jesus Christ the content of the Christian message is essentially the proclamation of the person of Jesus the embodyment of God's self Revelation and the freedom he offers Jesus is the freedom of God to the world the god of freedom is committed to set you free even today to set us all of us free those who live in bondages Jesus Christ is the perfect model of what it means he is the perfect model of what it means to be human and at the same time the Supreme Revelations of God revealing God's character will and purposes to Human Jesus Christ his life is a life of Freedom when we come to him we live a life of Freedom a while on Earth instead of restoring the Kingdom of Israel as his disciple were requesting him Jesus aim was actually to restore and expand God's kingdom to the whole world and his kingdom is the kingdom of Freedom Jesus has brought Freedom the New Covenant is the freedom that God has brought to humanity God has come to set us free through the person of Jesus himself the New Covenant is the Covenant of what the New Covenant is the Covenant of freedom and that freedom is in the person of Jesus himself in Jesus we have access to God in Jesus we have freedom and that freedoms brings us to God to have access to God and I don't know which kind of bondages in you find yourself in in which kind of B you find yourself but the good news is today is that Jesus is ready to set you free Hallelujah now let me tell you something Brethren and my sisters in Christ Our intrinsic value and worth come from being children of God redeemed and set free by Jesus Christ that is where our value lies our value lies in the fact that we are children of God in Christ we find Redemption we are brought we are brought back from the slavery of sin and its consequences in Christ we find forgiveness forgiveness for for our sins our sins are forgiven and we are reconciled to God in Christ we find Freedom we are set free from the law of sin and death and we receive the gift of eternal life freedom in Christ in Christ we find adoption we are adopted as as children of God receiving a new identity and inheritance in Christ we find a creation we are made new in Christ with a new heart and mind through freedom is indeed in Christ now let me ask you some questions and I have put on the screen two questions that I want you to answer them what do people see when they look at me ask yourself this question what do people see when they look at you ask yourself the question this question what do I see when I look at my neighbor what do you see do you identify your neighbor by what he has or what she has by his car or her car or by his positions or her positions his house or her house how do you look at your neighbor how do you measure the value of somebody I want to let you know today our intrinsic value is not based on our achievements or performances it is not based by our past is not based defined by our past mistakes or fails is not determined by our external circumstances or opinions our intrinsic value is not measured by our possessions or status but how is our intrinsic value measured but rather our value and wealth are rooted in goals unconditional love and acceptance in Christ Redemption and sacrifice our identity as children of God because Christ has set us free that is where our value is is our inheritance as heres of God's kingdom our value is rooted in the fact that we are children of God set free by Jesus Christ not the way the world is setting us free but the way God himself set us free in Christ we are valuable worthy and love to those who are very desperate to those who are in bondages in all forms of bondages the good news is that in Christ we are available worthy and love regardless of our circumstances in life Jesus has brought freedom to this world and indeed Freedom given to us freely and the only thing that he wants us to do is just to come to him my mind goes to this Bible passage found in the book of 1 Peter chapter 2 9-10 but you are a chosen people a royal priesthood a holy nation God's special possession that you may declare the Praises of him who called you out of Darkness into his wonderful light once you were not a people but now you are the people of God hallelujah once you had not received Mercy but now you have received Mercy you have been set free by Jesus Christ God has given you his freedom and that is the freedom that we need to set us free from all forms of bondages God has given us a gift as I say the sufficient gift the sufficient gift of God and that gift is in Jesus Christ to those who are who are crying in the cities and who are listening to us today we want to let you know that Jesus is the Supreme gift of God to you Jesus is the Supreme gift of God to you to set you free from all kinds of bondages he is the one sent to bless us by God himself he is wisdom righteousness sanctification and Redemption he is freedom the gift of Freedom sent by God himself to humanity he is the savior salvation is Liberation from all evil it is ultimately an exodus from death and its symptoms it is the gift of an incredible surprise of being graciously led by God to the discovery of who God is Jesus Christ the freedom that God has given unto us it is a response to God's generous invitation and Hospitality to align the whole of one's life to the revelations of God's character sovereignity lordship and Leadership it is a restoration of a relationship with the Living God it is an invitation to an everlasting Fellowship freedom in Christ Jesus Christ has given us the freedom God has given us freedom he freedom to separate us uh to lead us to fellowship with God from separation to Fellowship with God that is the kind of freedom God has given us from misrepresentations of God to vindications and clearing of his them from meaninglessness to a Purpose Driven Life from Death to eternal life from the penalty of sin to a life of gratitude of being acquitted from power of sin to a life of Holiness from walking according to the flesh to walking according to the spirit from Satan to Christ lordship from self to service from self-sufficiency to Christ sufficiency from chaos to God's Kingdom from addiction to freedom from guilt to acceptance of forgiveness freedom in Christ from exile to homecoming from the presence of evil to an environment Purge of all evil from a troubl heart to peace from Fear to confidence from despair to Hope from exclusion to inclusion freedom in Christ from doubt to Faith from Character defects to the fruit of the spirit from being defiled to sanctification from hatred to love from division to reconciliation from a fragmented world to Unity under the lordship and Leadership of Jesus Christ that is the freedom that God has given to humanity and that freedom is is in the name of Jesus as we say the name that brings Freedom joy and peace and that name is Jesus Jesus Jesus that's the name that brings freedom freedom and joy and peace to the world he establishes the communication with God the way is the way the truth and the life the Redeemer the one who reconciled to God the new Adam his name is Jesus Christ and Jesus Christ is the Lord of freedom is the Lord of Freedom sometime when we think of Freedom we think that we think of when we speak of bondages we think that that bondages refer only to those who are outside the church but those that is not true even within the church we think of bondages we live in the world of bondages I think of church members who are struggling with adultery hiding their sin behind a mask of righteousness they live a life of bondage they are bound by the chains of guilt shame and deception I also think of church members or church Elders or leaders who are embezzling fans using their positions of trust for personal gain they are captives to the love of money and the fear of being exposed I also think I think of church members who are addicted to pornography secretly struggling with lust and shame they enslaved by the chains of Temptation and sexual sin they live a life of of bond age I also think of church members who are harboring bitterness and unforgiveness refusing to let go of P hurt they are bound by the chains of resentment and anger these stories are not unique to our church communities they are a reflections of The Human Condition a reminder that we are all susceptible to sin and bondage but there is a good news the good news is in Jesus Christ who has come to set us free the Bible says in the Book of Romans chapter 8:2 for the law of the spirit of life has set you free in Christ Jesus from the law of sin and death through his death and Resurrection Jesus has broken the power of sin and death he has offered us forgiveness Redemption and Freedom the question that we have to ask Jesus is calling us calling us to a life of Freedom do you feel trapped by the chains of sin shame or fear Brethren oh my sister are you longing for a freedom that goes beyond the superficial a freedom that touches the deepest part of your soul where can you find that freedom that freedom is in Jesus Christ Jesus Christ the son of God came to set the captive free he came to break the chain to break the chains that binds us to chatter the strongholds that holds us back I don't know what you're going through with in life I know I have my own chance but I have the good news to let you know that Jesus Christ has come to set me free Hallelujah Jesus Christ has come to set me free in him you can find freedom freedom from the guilt and shame of past mistakes have you committed things in the past that still follow you you can't get rid of these things the guilt of past mistakes shames and past mistake the fear of what others think or say you are the weight of anxiety and worry Jesus is setting you free from all these kind of things the bondage of addiction and sin the bondes of the spirit of unforgiveness Jesus is ready to set you free the Lord of freedom is calling you to experience the liberating power of his love walk in the freedom of his forgiveness discover the joy to live in his presence and the Bible say in the book of Galatians chapter 5:1 it is for Freedom that Christ has set us free Hallelujah the true freedom is in Christ it is not in this world it is for Freedom that Christ came to set us free stand firm then and do not let yourself be burdened again by a yoke of slavery why are you going back to your past mistakes when you know that Christ has come to set you free and I don't know which kind of bondages you find yourself in but the good news that Jesus Christ has come to set you free and today he's reminding you he's reminding you that he is still ready to set you free even today even right now will you surrender to the Lord of freedom and let him set you free again come and experience the freedom that only Jesus can give and the Bible says in the Book of John 8:36 if the Lord set you free you will be free indeed the true freedom is in Christ I don't know the kind of bondages in which you find yourself but goodness is that Jesus Christ right now he is ready to set you free and he is calling you do you want to receive this Freedom do you want to receive this Freedom will you receive his freedom today Jesus Christ is calling you and I don't know if there is anyone of you anyone of you who find himself in something in a situation that he or she cannot get rid of it who or the person cannot come out of it Jesus is extending you the call today will you receive my freedom will you receive my freedom today is there anyone of you who can raise up his hand that I want Jesus to set me free and I don't know which kind of bondage will you find yourself Jesus is telling you is there any of you who may want to receive my freedom as I say it is not only outside the church even right here now can I see the hand of somebody who want to be set free again because the person lives in a bondage and that he wants Jesus again to come to him and set him free can I see the hand of that one just one person just one person just one person who want to be set free by Jesus Christ who say I've been struggling with unforgiveness I've been struggling with adultery I've been struggling with something with pornography I've been struggling with so many things that keep me away from you but today I want to be set free by you and Jesus is Calling You will you receive his freedom today let me see the hand of those one if there is any who want to be set free because the person lives in a special bondage maybe for years you have tried you want to abandon that sin but you couldn't you have tried again you have tried for several years but Jesus Christ is extending you his freedom today if there is a single person who find himself or herself in that kind of situation you have struggled for years days but you cannot get out of the B bondage where the satans have put you I want you to come if there is only one I want you to come here then I will invite

[378.4s] mind that God is not a loving God Satan
[381.4s] has bound him I also remember a story of
[384.6s] a young woman a young woman named akua

[469.9s] practices that students soon spend time
[474.4s] hours studying books on

[489.0s] in his cage I also remember a story of a
[492.8s] girl young girl Amar who was possessed
[495.8s] by a demon she will experience violent
[499.1s] convulsions and she will speak in a

[504.7s] her I also remember a story of group of
[507.9s] young people who got GED around a street
[510.8s] corner maybe some of you may have seen
[512.8s] them inhaling glue and other substances

[520.9s] and their fatures uncertain they are
[523.9s] captives of addiction Bound by the
[526.5s] chains of substance abuse Satan has
[529.3s] deceived them into believing that these
[531.9s] substances will bring them escape and
[535.0s] comfort captured by the Devil Himself
[537.7s] captured by the satans I also remember
[541.3s] the stories of prostitutes prostitutes
[544.0s] and adulterers who engage into acts that
[547.4s] dishonor God their souls are wounded
[550.7s] they they are victims they are victims
[552.9s] of devise of Satan himself Satan has
[556.1s] bound them with chains of Shame and
[559.2s] exploitation they are controlled by the
[561.8s] whims of Satan remember I also remember
[565.6s] the story of a man as I saw him walking
[569.0s] ping back and forth on the sidewalk
[571.9s] talking to himself and jering widely he
[575.1s] is the victim of mental illness Bound by
[578.4s] the chains of confusion fear and
[581.3s] isolation Satan has deceived him into
[584.4s] believing that he is alone that no one
[587.2s] cares and that he is beyond God's Rich
[591.6s] captured by Satan himself I also
[594.3s] remember the story of this corrupt
[597.0s] businessman as I saw him driving a
[599.6s] luxurious
[600.8s] C wearing expensive clothes and flushing
[604.6s] a fake smile but behind the faade he is
[608.2s] bound by the chains of GED corruption
[611.4s] and deceit Satan has deceived him into
[615.4s] believing that wealth and power are the
[618.3s] ultimate goals and that the ends
[621.0s] justifies the mean the list is so long
[625.2s] we can think of corrupt police officers
[627.8s] corrupt lawyers Maybe corrupt pastors
[630.3s] and who know maybe who knows maybe
[632.4s] corrupts Elders corrupt church members
[635.4s] these stories illustrate the reality of
[639.0s] spiritual bondage in our Human
[641.7s] Experience Satan chains are real they
[645.6s] are binding people in various forms of
[648.0s] captivity but the good news is that God
[651.3s] has given us a
[652.8s] gift has given a gift that gift is in
[657.1s] Jesus Christ who has come to set the
[660.6s] captives free as Jesus were walking
[663.6s] around as we read it in the Book of
[665.2s] Matthew chapter
[666.5s] 9:35 when he was here on Earth when he
[669.1s] was walking around through the cities
[671.2s] and Villages he preached the good news
[674.4s] good news of the kingdom and he healed
[677.2s] every form of spiritual and mental
[681.8s] disease all kinds of spiritual and even
[685.7s] physical
[686.8s] bondages Jesus has the power I want to
[689.8s] let you know to break every chain to
[692.8s] heal every wound and to set every
[695.6s] captive free are you in the bondage
[698.5s] today the good news as we see in the
[701.5s] Book of John chter 8:36 so if the son
[704.8s] set you free you will be you will be
[708.1s] free indeed
[709.8s] hallelujah our freedom is in Christ the
[713.0s] Bible clearly Define what we mean we
[715.7s] mean by Freedom according to the Bible
[719.7s] according Freedom according to the Bible
[722.3s] is the presence of a new nature
[725.4s] empowered by the Holy Spirit to live a
[728.2s] life that honors God and serves others
[732.3s] that is the freedom that Christ has come
[734.4s] to give us Brethren and sisters the new
[738.0s] nature set us free from external
[740.6s] bondages and I even don't know which
[742.9s] kind of bondages you find yourself in
[745.9s] but the good news is that God has
[748.8s] prepared away and he is ready even now
[752.1s] to set us free to the Jews the Bible
[755.2s] says who had believed him Jesus said if
[758.4s] you hold to my teaching you are really
[761.7s] my disciple then you will know the truth
[765.1s] and the truth will set you free
[767.2s] Hallelujah freedom is in Jesus Christ it
[770.6s] is not in the world but is in the person
[773.2s] of Jesus himself now when we look at the
[775.6s] freedom of what the Satan himself is
[778.2s] giving us is different from the one that
[780.5s] Christ is given us as we move to the
[782.8s] next
[783.5s] slide freedom of Satan set you in a cage
[787.7s] to dishonor God recently I I think that
[791.1s] was on Thursday as I was reading through
[794.8s] some news through BBC News and then I
[797.8s] came across something a story whereby
[801.1s] hundreds and even thousands of people of
[803.9s] of the same sex who were celebrating
[806.2s] something that their country did their
[807.8s] country did for them and and that is in
[809.7s] Thailand the law has approved the
[812.6s] marriage the marriage of people of the
[815.0s] same sex and then as some of them now
[817.4s] gather to get married then they made
[820.4s] this big claim they said today we open
[823.6s] the door of freedom to all Humanity they
[826.8s] said they open the door of freedom to
[829.0s] all Humanity not knowing that Satan is
[832.7s] putting them where in his cage Satan is
[836.5s] putting them in his cage that is not
[838.4s] freedom Freedom according to the will of
[840.9s] God is to live a life that honors God
[844.7s] the ministry of Jesus himself was
[846.8s] centered on the concept of Freedom his
[849.6s] work was a work of
[851.2s] Liberation for instance as we go through
[853.9s] the Book of Mark Jesus is portrayed as
[857.0s] the one who brings freedom freedom to
[859.6s] those
[860.9s] for who follow him this freedom is not
[864.4s] just from external circumstances but
[867.6s] also from internal bondage
[869.8s] such as Sin fear and guilt by embracing
[873.5s] Jesus as Lord and Savior we can
[876.5s] experience the liberating power of his
[878.6s] love and grace and that is the freedom
[881.0s] the gift that God has given us through
[883.5s] the person of Jesus
[885.2s] Christ freedom from demonic possession
[888.8s] freedom from sin and
[891.2s] guilt freedom from fear and anxiety
[895.8s] Freedom that leads us to service and
[898.8s] love love Jesus teaches that true
[901.0s] greatness comes from serving others
[903.7s] freeing his followers to live a life of
[906.2s] Selfless Love and service Hallelujah
[909.9s] that is the kind of Freedom that God
[912.0s] himself has given to
[914.1s] humanity Freedom according to the Book
[917.0s] of Mark freedom from the power of death
[919.9s] that we find in Jesus Christ himself
[922.5s] Jesus resurrection for instance
[924.5s] demonstrate his victory over death those
[927.4s] who have lost the loved ones recently
[930.0s] can can relate with this can relate with
[932.6s] the freedom that Christ is given to
[935.0s] humanity victory over death offering
[938.6s] freedom from the fear of death and the
[941.1s] promise of eternal life freedom in Jesus
[945.0s] Christ now when we look at the name of
[947.6s] Jesus every aspect of the name of Jesus
[950.8s] is connected to the concept of Freedom
[954.1s] the Christians gospel is inseparably
[957.2s] connected to Freedom and this appears in
[960.6s] the very name of Jesus Christ which
[963.5s] means yeh saves Jesus Christ is freedom
[968.3s] and the gift that God has given to
[970.4s] humanity as I look through the name of
[972.7s] Jesus I was looking through every aspect
[975.2s] of his name and I came to understand
[978.7s] that every aspect of Jesus Christ of the
[982.2s] name of Jesus Christ is connected to the
[984.4s] concept of what of
[986.6s] Freedom you may refer to his name as
[990.0s] Savior you may refer to his name as
[992.4s] Messiah Christ the Lamb of God
[996.2s] bridegroom Living Water Redeemer Tree of
[1000.3s] Life Strong Tower deliverer the door
[1004.4s] Yeshua the the name the name every
[1007.1s] aspect of his name Lion of the tribe of
[1009.8s] Judah the way truth and life the great
[1014.0s] Physicians the Good Shepherd Alpha and
[1016.9s] Omega Everlasting father the Chief
[1019.4s] Cornerstone faithful and true great high
[1022.4s] priest the word of God The Great I Am
[1025.9s] Prince of Peace Kings of Kings Lords of
[1029.7s] Lord bread of life son of man Son of God
[1034.0s] Emmanuel Refuge friend every name of
[1037.8s] Jesus Christ is connected to the concept
[1040.4s] of freedom and that's why the Bible says
[1043.6s] God has given us a gift and that gift is
[1046.7s] in Jesus Christ and that is the gift of
[1049.2s] Freedom that he himself gives to
[1052.1s] humanity only the one who is totally
[1054.8s] free can ultimately be a liberator it is
[1057.9s] only Jesus Christ who is completely free
[1060.2s] that can set you free today you cannot
[1062.8s] look for your freedom in somebody else
[1065.5s] that freedom is found in Jesus Christ
[1068.4s] the content of the Christian message is
[1070.9s] essentially the proclamation of the
[1072.9s] person of Jesus the embodyment of God's
[1076.2s] self Revelation and the freedom he
[1078.1s] offers
[1079.9s] Jesus is the freedom of God to the world
[1083.2s] the god of freedom is committed to set
[1085.5s] you free even today to set us all of us
[1088.6s] free those who live in bondages Jesus
[1091.5s] Christ is the perfect model of what it
[1094.3s] means he is the perfect model of what it
[1097.2s] means to be human and at the same time
[1101.5s] the Supreme Revelations of God revealing
[1105.6s] God's character will and purposes to
[1108.4s] Human
[1109.8s] Jesus Christ his life is a life of
[1113.5s] Freedom when we come to him we live a
[1115.3s] life of Freedom a while on Earth instead
[1118.4s] of restoring the Kingdom of Israel as
[1120.4s] his disciple were requesting him Jesus
[1123.2s] aim was actually to restore and expand
[1126.2s] God's kingdom to the whole world and his
[1128.6s] kingdom is the kingdom of Freedom Jesus
[1131.8s] has brought Freedom the New Covenant is
[1134.4s] the freedom that God has brought to
[1136.6s] humanity God has come to set us free
[1139.7s] through the person of Jesus himself the
[1142.2s] New Covenant is the Covenant of what the
[1144.9s] New Covenant is the Covenant of freedom
[1147.7s] and that freedom is in the person of
[1150.0s] Jesus himself in Jesus we have access to
[1155.0s] God in Jesus we have freedom and that
[1158.1s] freedoms brings us to God to have access
[1161.4s] to God and I don't know which kind of
[1165.0s] bondages in you find yourself in in
[1167.6s] which kind of B you find yourself but
[1170.3s] the good news is today is that Jesus is
[1173.3s] ready to set you free Hallelujah now let
[1176.6s] me tell you something Brethren and my
[1179.0s] sisters in Christ Our intrinsic value
[1182.2s] and worth come from being children of
[1185.1s] God redeemed and set free by Jesus
[1188.0s] Christ that is where our value lies our
[1191.5s] value lies in the fact that we are
[1193.1s] children of God in Christ we find
[1195.9s] Redemption we are brought we are brought
[1198.3s] back from the slavery of sin and its
[1200.8s] consequences in Christ we find
[1203.1s] forgiveness forgiveness for for our sins
[1206.3s] our sins are forgiven and we are
[1208.2s] reconciled to God in Christ we find
[1211.0s] Freedom we are set free from the law of
[1213.2s] sin and death and we receive the gift of
[1216.0s] eternal life freedom in Christ in Christ
[1219.7s] we find adoption we are adopted as as
[1222.1s] children of God receiving a new identity
[1225.1s] and
[1226.2s] inheritance in Christ we find a creation
[1229.6s] we are made new in Christ with a new
[1232.2s] heart and mind through freedom is indeed
[1235.4s] in Christ now let me ask you some
[1237.9s] questions and I have put on the screen
[1241.0s] two questions that I want you to answer
[1243.4s] them what do people see when they look
[1246.5s] at me ask yourself this question what do
[1249.8s] people see when they look at you ask
[1252.4s] yourself the question this question what
[1254.6s] do I see when I look at my neighbor what
[1256.9s] do you see do you identify your neighbor
[1259.4s] by what he has or what she has by his
[1262.6s] car or her car or by his positions or
[1265.8s] her positions his house or her house how
[1269.7s] do you look at your neighbor how do you
[1272.9s] measure the value of somebody I want to
[1275.6s] let you know today our intrinsic value
[1278.8s] is not based on our achievements or
[1281.4s] performances it is not based by our past
[1284.6s] is not based defined by our past
[1286.6s] mistakes or fails is not determined by
[1290.2s] our external circumstances or opinions
[1293.4s] our intrinsic value is not measured by
[1296.2s] our possessions or status but how is our
[1300.7s] intrinsic value measured but rather our
[1303.7s] value and wealth are rooted in goals
[1306.4s] unconditional love and acceptance in
[1309.4s] Christ Redemption and sacrifice our
[1312.3s] identity as children of God because
[1315.9s] Christ has set us free that is where our
[1318.1s] value is
[1319.1s] is our inheritance as heres of God's
[1323.0s] kingdom our value is rooted in the fact
[1325.9s] that we are children of God set free by
[1329.1s] Jesus Christ not the way the world is
[1331.5s] setting us free but the way God himself
[1334.8s] set us free in Christ we are valuable
[1338.5s] worthy and love to those who are very
[1340.8s] desperate to those who are in bondages
[1343.3s] in all forms of bondages the good news
[1346.0s] is that in Christ we are available
[1348.6s] worthy and love regardless of our
[1351.1s] circumstances in life Jesus has brought
[1354.4s] freedom to this world and indeed Freedom
[1358.0s] given to us freely and the only thing
[1360.2s] that he wants us to do is just to come
[1362.4s] to him my mind goes to this Bible
[1366.3s] passage found in the book of 1 Peter
[1368.9s] chapter 2 9-10 but you are a chosen
[1372.5s] people a royal priesthood a holy nation
[1376.5s] God's special possession that you may
[1379.2s] declare the Praises of him who called
[1381.2s] you out of Darkness into his wonderful
[1384.2s] light once you were not a people but now
[1388.1s] you are the people of God hallelujah
[1391.0s] once you had not received Mercy but now
[1393.8s] you have received Mercy you have been
[1395.7s] set free by Jesus Christ God has given
[1398.6s] you his freedom and that is the freedom
[1400.9s] that we need to set us free from all
[1403.6s] forms of bondages God has given us a
[1406.8s] gift as I say the sufficient gift the
[1410.2s] sufficient gift of God and that gift is
[1412.8s] in Jesus Christ to those who are who are
[1415.5s] crying in the cities and who are
[1417.3s] listening to us
[1418.8s] today we want to let you know that Jesus
[1422.3s] is the Supreme gift of God to you Jesus
[1425.7s] is the Supreme gift of God to you to set
[1428.6s] you free from all kinds of bondages he

[1442.9s] himself to humanity he is the savior
[1446.5s] salvation is Liberation from all evil it
[1450.2s] is ultimately an exodus from death and
[1453.0s] its symptoms it is the gift of an
[1455.6s] incredible surprise of being graciously
[1457.7s] led by God to the discovery of who God
[1461.0s] is Jesus Christ the freedom that God has
[1465.0s] given unto us it is a response to God's
[1467.9s] generous invitation and Hospitality to
[1470.7s] align the whole of one's life to the
[1473.3s] revelations of God's character
[1475.2s] sovereignity lordship and Leadership it
[1478.5s] is a restoration of a relationship with
[1481.0s] the Living God it is an invitation to an
[1483.9s] everlasting Fellowship freedom in Christ
[1487.4s] Jesus Christ has given us the freedom
[1489.9s] God has given us freedom he freedom to
[1493.4s] separate us uh to lead us to fellowship
[1496.0s] with God from separation to Fellowship
[1498.4s] with God that is the kind of freedom God
[1500.4s] has given us from misrepresentations of
[1503.6s] God to vindications and clearing of his
[1506.5s] them from meaninglessness to a Purpose
[1509.5s] Driven Life from Death to eternal life
[1513.2s] from the penalty of sin to a life of
[1515.7s] gratitude of being acquitted from power
[1518.7s] of sin to a life of
[1522.4s] Holiness from walking according to the
[1524.8s] flesh to walking according to the spirit
[1527.4s] from Satan to Christ

[1533.8s] self-sufficiency to Christ sufficiency
[1536.7s] from chaos to God's Kingdom from
[1539.2s] addiction to freedom from guilt to
[1541.6s] acceptance of forgiveness freedom in
[1545.4s] Christ from exile to homecoming from the
[1549.5s] presence of evil to an environment Purge
[1552.3s] of all evil from a troubl heart to peace

[1582.8s] that is the freedom that God has given
[1585.4s] to humanity and that freedom is is in
[1588.6s] the name of Jesus as we say the name
[1591.2s] that brings Freedom joy and peace and
[1594.2s] that name is Jesus Jesus Jesus that's
[1597.8s] the name that brings freedom freedom and
[1600.3s] joy and peace to the world he

[1607.5s] life the
[1609.2s] Redeemer the one who reconciled to God
[1612.5s] the new Adam his name is Jesus Christ
[1616.8s] and Jesus Christ is the Lord of freedom
[1620.0s] is the Lord of Freedom sometime when we
[1621.6s] think of Freedom we think that we think
[1623.8s] of when we speak of bondages we think
[1625.9s] that that bondages refer only to those
[1628.1s] who are outside the church but those
[1630.1s] that is not true even within the church
[1632.7s] we think of bondages we live in the
[1635.4s] world of bondages I think of church
[1637.9s] members who are struggling with adultery
[1641.0s] hiding their sin behind a mask of
[1643.2s] righteousness they live a life of
[1645.0s] bondage they are bound by the chains of
[1647.5s] guilt shame and deception I also think
[1650.2s] of church members or church Elders or
[1652.5s] leaders who are embezzling fans using
[1655.6s] their positions of trust for personal
[1657.8s] gain they are captives to the love of
[1660.8s] money and the fear of being exposed I
[1663.4s] also think I think of church members who
[1666.0s] are addicted to pornography secretly
[1669.1s] struggling with lust and shame they
[1672.2s] enslaved by the chains of Temptation and
[1675.2s] sexual sin they live a life of of bond
[1678.3s] age I also think of church members who
[1681.1s] are harboring bitterness and
[1683.3s] unforgiveness refusing to let go of P
[1686.4s] hurt they are bound by the chains of
[1688.6s] resentment and anger these stories are
[1691.8s] not unique to our church communities
[1694.2s] they are a reflections of The Human
[1696.3s] Condition a reminder that we are all
[1698.7s] susceptible to sin and bondage but there
[1701.6s] is a good news the good news is in Jesus
[1704.6s] Christ who has come to set us free the
[1707.8s] Bible says in the Book of Romans chapter
[1709.8s] 8:2 for the law of the spirit of life
[1713.4s] has set you free in Christ Jesus from
[1716.1s] the law of sin and death through his
[1720.4s] death and Resurrection Jesus has broken
[1723.6s] the power of sin and death he has
[1726.9s] offered us forgiveness Redemption and
[1729.7s] Freedom the question that we have to ask
[1732.2s] Jesus is calling us calling us to a life
[1734.1s] of Freedom do you feel trapped by the
[1737.0s] chains of sin shame or fear Brethren oh

[1759.0s] chain to break the chains that binds us
[1761.7s] to chatter the strongholds that holds us
[1764.2s] back I don't know what you're going
[1766.5s] through with in life I know I have my
[1768.6s] own chance but I have the good news to
[1771.8s] let you know that Jesus Christ has come
