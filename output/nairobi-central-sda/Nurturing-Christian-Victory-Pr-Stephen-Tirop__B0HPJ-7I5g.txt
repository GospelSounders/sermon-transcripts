FULL TRANSCRIPT:
Nurturing Christian victory according to the text that has been read before us and I request that I read it again in your hearing. Paul having been urged to respond to the issues that the church which he spend so much time to plan was seeking answers to one of these areas where members were having issues for they thought that Christ would come back as quickly in their generations. But they saw their brethren dying and they buried so many and questions arose. What is the Christian hope? What is the assurance to a believer? What benefit is there for a believer if he dies just like anybody else? And so Paul took time to write this episode to this congregation so that he would give them hope despite experiencing sorrow and death in their congregation in their midst. And so this remain to be every man's question, every man's desire so that the rough ages and the mysteries of life and the assurance of faith is made clear to every believer. Paul after talking about other issues finally comes to this point where he must handle this heavy matter death and the hope for the Christian. It is in this context that Paul is speaking to the church knowing that in this Gregor Roman time some ideas had gone on on what the soul and the body relationship is and therefore what is it that would happen to a believer? It is in this context that he relates to the congregation what it means to have faith in the Lord, to believe in the gospel and why the gospel is the way God chose that his son would come and die. and after death resurrect bodily. So in this uh chapter chapter 15 Paul is laying the basis of his hope in of his comforting message to this church. Most of whom were actually in a city that had been plagued by immorality because part of the wor part part of the activities that took place in this city was the worship of the fertility god. And they worship this fertility god by really sending even mothers who are lured into this worship by being told if you engage in immorality you will have very beautiful uh very beautiful girls or handsome children. And if you even sent your children who are beautiful into this city to worship this fertility god by really acting, by really participating in this immoral acts, then you are going to be blessed more abundantly. And so Corinth was the place where any dirty imagination would be. It is said that any any evening there would be 10,000s or so women coming down from the temple and going into the city and in fact they got a name Corinth which means to be made a Corinthian. It was a negative thing. And so in this city which now God told his servant, don't be in a hurry to leave because I have many souls in this city. Paul is seeking to assure them that despite having chosen to believe to live this immoral life, live a virtuous life, they even if they were dying, there is victory in the Lord. This is the context of this episode and especially this chapter whereby Paul is trying to let the believer that our action in the body matters. that our bodies are not only vehicles for the soul in its journey to the next war. That in fact the soul and the body are actually one and the same and there's no immortality of the soul. And so with this, Paul is taking a believer into this tenets of faith. So that his action, whatever he does, he ought to know that he is either sowing through the body and the decision to the spirit or sowing to the flesh. You know my brother and sister, God who created us though he created us from the dust but he breathed to our nostril and we became the living soul. And so this combination makes up the total being the human being. Who has all these faculties that the body should not be viewed as totally evil and a burden although it's weak and so the Lord will deliver us though we this flesh and blood shall not inherit the kingdom in this nature but it will be changed that which will be changed is that which existed and so that is why there will be translation Jesus who resurrected had the marks of the crucifixion That is why he would say to Thomas, feel my the marks of the nails through the bumps of my hand and look at my sight. Put your hand over there. There were those scars. And so this translation means that just as Christ took the body, the gospel is that in the life, death and resurrection of Jesus Christ, there is a lesson that should give us hope although we struggle with sin in this body. And so it is important for us to nurture Christian victory because that victory is through Christ. And that is why Paul having spoken of our hope in verse 13 verse 13. This is what he says. So that I move to verses for 57 and 58. Let me allow me to begin from verses 12. It says this. Now if Christ is preached that he has been raised from the dead, how do some among you say that there is no resurrection of the dead dead? But if there's no resurrection of the dead, then Christ is not risen. And if Christ is not risen, 14, then our preaching is empty. And you you are found false witnesses of God because we have testified of God that he raised up Christ whom he did not uh whom he did not raise up if in fact the dead do not rise. And so when we come to verses 57 and 54, no 57 and 58, Paul here is saying in Christ's resurrection and in our final bodily resurrection Because that which is sown in disgrace must rise in immortality and glory. Therefore, he says a time is coming when believers will mock death and say, "Oh death, verse 55, where is your sting? whole graves or heads, where is your victory? And so in Christ Jesus as a believer though living in this body, Paul assures and concludes and tells a believer in cor in Corenth who may have engaged in immorality but having believed in the Lord he is leading a vicious life. So that is confronting him or her. He is telling this believer, "Thanks be to God who gives us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ." Therefore, my beloved brethren, therefore, my beloved sister and brother, my child, you who is wondering what will happen, how comes that my mother who was singing in the choir, who was at Dones, my father who has been faithful, my wife, my friend, how comes that he died, what shall become or what value is my faith? Listen, Paul is telling the church, thanks be to God who gives us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ. And because there is victory that we experience this resurrection power in our life even in this nature that although we are struggling with these forces yet we have been given through believing the gospel through yielding to the control of the Holy Spirit We are living the resurrected life of Jesus Christ by faith. That's why scripture says that we count it this way that one died for all. Just as in Adam has he sinned all became sinners. saw the gospel in Christ coming in bodily. Though he was not taken conception through natural way, but the Holy Spirit hoovered covered Mary so that God would have a tool to use just as the devil persuaded lied and convinced Eve that they would not be dead, that in choosing to eat the fruit which God has said not eat and which is going against the word of God. You see, God spoke and things came into being. And therefore, what you read, what you hear builds faith. And if you don't take care what you believe, if you don't watch the tenets of the scripture, the teachings, you can be swayed here and there. And so just as Adam became an instrument with Eve by being lawless, getting into sin and plunching the entire human race into sin. Christ came in the body by the power of the Holy Spirit so that through his body as one he would test death for all people. And in this testing death, we are no longer held captive by our nature or our hereditary effects. No, we have the new Adam. We are created into the newness of life. And that is how Paul is saying Adam who became earthly who became weak is here sin as bringing into the human race no hope of resurrection because sin has taken captive. of the human being. My friend, I want you to see this and look at this that if one died for all just as one by accepting the deception of the devil became the source of degradation, the source of plunching the human race into sin. Then God took this weak human being, this flesh and the communication by angels that a son would be born by one who had experiences of this weakness so that in this son a Messiah would be there who has the same weakness as you and I this victory ought to be real and we ought to believe in it so that we can overcome the lies of the evil one who tries to accuse us that we still have this envys, we still have this hatred. We still have this uh this selfishness. Yes, we are. But we are a work in progress. Thanks be to God who gives us the victory. It is not just any victory. It is the victory in Christ Jesus. And that is why he is saying that be steadfast in this hope. Be steadfast in this faith. Be steadfast in this belief. Be steadfast in understanding why it took God to plan for salvation by sending his only begotten son. So that in Christ Jesus according to 2 Corinthians chapter 5 and you read it on it says we are no longer living for ourself but we are living for him who offered himself a sacrifice an atoning sacrifice for Christ who died for us. Hallelujah. And so this victory that we ought to nurture just as we saw the children are credible telling us there's a seed that was planted and this seed ought to germinate and the leaves come and then it is connected so that if any fruit would come it is because there is a seed that germinated well took root and is being pruned and taken care of by the heavenly husband men. Hallelujah. So this victory, this hope that we have in Christ becomes that only victory that is ours. Not because we struggle to change our nature, but we believe that one has made us new creatures. If anyone be in Christ Jesus, he is a new creature. The old is gone. Behold, it is new. And because of that newness, we do not become ambassadors of our hereditary uh feelings and nature. No, we are ambassadors together with God. And God is speaking through us because of the Holy Spirit who dwells within us, pleading with everyone who is still in sin that be reconciled to God. Praise the Lord. And so friends, we need to re-evaluate our understanding of our bodies because in Gregor Roman time, they believe that the body being a vehicle of the of the soul can be made better. And that is why they would exercise and they would come as a society and watch those who had perfected the body. And they would run and run naked or act and have these um theaters where they would display the perfect or the ideal body. And here we see that in this Gregor Roman age they were glorifying gratification, satisfaction and pleasure. That is why Corinth became a center and they started a worship of the gods where by this body ought not to be denied anything. But in the belief as a Christian we are one. And here we see Paul talking about this view that we have a new allegiance, not to the body, not to the nature, nor to the flesh, but to the one who has given us hope through Christ coming and dying our death and rising again into glory. Friends, it doesn't matter how your body or how you may have been cheated and lured into intelligence to gratify the desires of the body. No, we have a new being who loves us, who died for us, and who has given us the victory. Hallelujah. And that is how when we read about this you realize my friend that Paul in verse two is reminding the church. Let me read it to verse four. says, "For I deliver to you first of all that which I also received, that Christ died for our sins, according to the scriptures, and that he was buried, and that he rose again in the third day according to the scriptures, and that he was seen by suffers. Then by the 12 unenumerates eyewitnesses who saw Jesus having been raised from the dead. And so he is laying bases that this Christ who lived a perfect life who overcame the devil by saying it is what written. Even when he was tempted to use his divine power, he said, "You shall not be presumptuous and tempt the Lord your God." So that in whatever levels we are in, when favored by God, the evil one should not overcome us. We have the victory, the example of Jesus Christ who lived a righteous life in a sinful body. And because he lived a righteous life in a sinful body by relying, obeying, and being submissive to the father, you and I, by submitting to the rule of the Holy Spirit, can lead a righteous life. Though we are struggling and battling, yes, sin will still be there. It might try to raise its head, but thanks be to God. He has given us victory. Christ who came has paid the the the penalty. You and I have this hope in the Lord Jesus Christ. Hallelujah. And so Paul here has laid this foundation and he talks about this victory which came because when Christ obeyed where Adam failed in Romans 5 you can read that study it and you will see that the two Adams are contrasted. And so by grace when we were still sinners, Christ died for the ungodly. That you and I, we do not have to remain in that sinful condition and think that we are doomed. It is only God who will have grace on me when he comes in glory. He's the one who will choose. I don't know whether I'll make it to heaven. No, there is victory in the Lord. You are not to be held captive as if you are a slave to your to your to your nature or whatever. Says resist evil. Flee from it. You have a choice, my friend. In Paul's letters, you re realize that he's trying to make a believer understand this quickly. Allow me to run through a few with you. In Philippians, Philippians chapter 2 vers 5, he says, "Let this mind because victory is in Christ Jesus." So, let this mind that was in who? Christ Jesus be in you. What you believe your mind ought to be filled by the truth of the gospel. It is the only way that you will have hope and look at death and know that you can look and face death. Even a a disease that might be degenerative, you can look at it and not worry, but say, even if my body waste, as Job said, even if I may be rotting in this body, yet because I believe in the Lord and his grace and I have lived obediently, my eyes shall see the Lord. My eyes are not another. And it says, "And he will one to bring me into glory when he stands upon the earth." Hallelujah. And so look at this scripture. Let this mind be in you that was also in who? In Christ Jesus. And it says in in this he was obedient when he came in flesh living the glory in heaven. He came with in this flesh and in that flesh he was obedient to the death even the dead in the Hallelujah. Praise the Lord. So here is the secret having the spirit rulers is that the spirit operates and that is why it is the forehead that is sealed for a Christian. It is our thoughts. It is our mind that we have to allow study scripture. Understand understand the the the the gospel and by you understanding allow to be ruled by the spirit. in this rule of the spirit. Then he says in verses 12 to 14, Philippians 2 12-4, come with me my brother, my sister. This is the gospel. He says, "Therefore, my beloved, as you have always obeyed, not as in my presence only, but now much more in my absence, walk out your own salvation with fear and trembling. For it is God who works in us who works in you both to will and to do according to his good pleasure. Do all things without complaining and disputing. It is in the body that all this is done. And the body is taken captive by allowing the Holy Spirit and the mind of Christ to be in us. And so receiving salvation, accepting the gospel is actually understanding how Christ came, how he lived and choosing and saying that which he did and why he did it the way he did, I am choosing to live in that manner and obey the gospel. This is where we are planting sewing to the spirit. This is where you and I according to this episode he says I counted that I have not completely overcome but one thing I'm doing I forget the past chapter 3 that is verse 13 and I stretch myself to the hope to this victory that has held me that has made me choose to remain a believer. And so I stretch forth into it and he continues to say, "The Lord has made me captive in this." And so you are not struggling alone. God is working in us so that we are willing and we are actually doing it in our body. That is why he concludes in chapter 4 by saying don't worry, don't be anxious in anything but by thanksgiving and supplication let your request be made known to God. Whatever you are struggling, whatever you are your your pain, whatever Paul is saying you are not weak. The Lord shall keep your mind in perfect peace. Peace that passes understanding. And he says that because he believe he's not weak because the Lord is in him. He says I can do. How many in who? who does what? This belief is not just a belief. It is effective. It changes us. My friend, let me conclude by inviting you to Ephesians chapter 3. Ephesians chapter 3. And in this Paul is talking to this other congregation who he said you are in danger of being of being sifted here and there. Wolves would come. Ravenous wolves. Brethren among you shall rise and draw others into their own thinking. Let the mind of Christ rule in you so that we are a unit. So he says this God who loved us chapter 1 verse 19 and chapter 3 verse 19 he says in fact we are called to have God in our being. is saying that the resurrection power is available for you and for me when we believe in Christ Jesus. Hallelujah. And so we are not to live in that nature that has been for us the source of thinking that we are weak. We are not to struggle alone. Here we are given the resurrection power in Christ Jesus. And that is why holy communion becomes a very important part of a believer. It is you to walk out your salvation so that in this body make the right choices. Let your mind be occupied by the Holy Spirit. be sealed because you have been adopted. You have been accepted. The Lord has loved you and he has sealed you for eternity given you heritage in the Lord Jesus Christ. Victory is yours and so faith is the victory my brothers. Let us remain steadfast in this faith. Hallelujah. And so he says your labors in the flesh is not in vain. What you do, you are resisting the evil is not in vain. May I invite the chesters to come so that they can give us a song so that we can have this moment to let the Lord rule over our hearts. Hallelujah. So that we know we should be steadfast, immovable in our faith and abound in good works because we are created to live in this newness of life. Hallelujah. So my brother, trust in the Lord. Yield to him. Obey these traditions that have been handed over to us. Participate and understand so that like in first Corinthians 11, as we are invited to partake of the Holy Communion as believers, victory is not in your strength. It is in obeying the gospel. It is in letting the mind of Christ be in you. Whatever your struggle as a believer, if Christ welcome a traitor, who would sell him, washed his feet? If he went to Peter who said, "No, you are higher than me." And he said, "If I don't wash your feet, we have no part." In this unity, brethren, the Lord is serving us and reminding us that he is in the business of cleansing us. Hallelujah. How many with me today are saying, Lord, it is by grace that you came and you died. It is by grace that you let me understand the gospel and you created faith. That is why I chose to be baptized. And Lord, I won in this newness of life because I'm a new creature. Christ has paid the penalty. I am no longer the old person. I am new in Christ Jesus who has given me the victory. I want to draw closer as a baptized member to the Holy Communion where the Lord shall cleanse me as he cleanses my feet through my brethren. Are you there as a baptized man? Are you there? And if you are going to partake of the holy communion, you can rise as we sing this song. And even if you are not baptized, you will be baptized soon. And there's victory in the Lord. He has died for us. Young man, believe in the Lord. Accept him. Let him rule over your life. Let this mind be in you that was in Christ Jesus Christ and let's take up this faith. Hallelujah. Welcome. 647 647 from him. I rise in the glory of the coming of the Lord. He is jumping on the wed. He has [Music] [Applause] loosing. Glory, glory, hallelujah. Glory, glory, hallelujah. [Music] Glory, glory, hallelujah. His truth is [Applause] [Music] mighty. He has the trumpet retreat. He is all hearts open before his godly seat. Oh, sweet my soul to answer. He will [Music] be my home. Glory, glory, hallelujah. Glory, glory, hallelujah. Glory, glory, hallelujah. His truth [Applause] [Music] is in the beauty of the living Christ was born across the sea. be the glory in his voice of God to feed us as you and me. As he died to make men holy, let us live to make you free. Oh, [Music] [Applause] maring. Glory, glory, hallelujah. Glory, glory, hallelujah. Glory, glory, hallelujah. His truth is [Applause] [Music] mighty. Shall we pray? Eternal gracious father, you are the Lord God Almighty who has loved us and who has paid the price for us. Thank you because when you are born, you came to set men free so that we can live free from sin. And though we struggle because these bodies are yet to be delivered, but Lord, in these bodies, you are telling us to sow to the spirit. So the Lord, we yield to you and let your mind take control over our minds to lead and rule over our spirit so that you sanctify us in our spirit, in our soul, and in the flesh. Mighty King, let your will be done over your children, even as we draw near to the table of the Lord, to the emblems and this orordinance that reminds us of your death and the price that you paid. Father, may we choose so that we can give an ultimate sacrifice by choosing to live holy lives and to give of our being, of our faculties, of our abilities, of our resources for the glory and honor of your name. Accept our service and ministry. Let us indeed be your ambassadors of the great wonderful transaction. The Lord we can speak to many and ask them to be reconciled to you because you have reconciled us. Reconciling the entire world unto yourself through Christ. Thank you, Lord, because you've given us victory and this victory is ours so that we are steadfast, immovable, strengthened by this faith in the Lord Jesus Christ. We pray and believe. 

==================================================

TIMESTAMPED TRANSCRIPT:
[1.0s] Nurturing Christian
[4.4s] victory according to the text that has
[7.6s] been read before us and I request that I
[11.8s] read it again in your hearing.
[17.2s] Paul having
[19.4s] been urged to respond to the issues that
[23.8s] the church which he spend so much time
[27.9s] to
[28.8s] plan was seeking answers
[34.5s] to one of these areas where members were
[40.6s] having
[42.4s] issues for they thought that Christ
[45.2s] would come back as
[47.2s] quickly in their
[51.3s] generations. But they saw their brethren
[55.0s] dying and they buried so
[58.4s] many and questions
[61.4s] arose. What is the Christian
[65.4s] hope? What
[68.0s] is the
[69.9s] assurance to a believer?
[73.8s] What benefit is there
[77.0s] for a
[79.5s] believer if he
[82.2s] dies just like anybody
[86.0s] else? And so Paul took
[89.3s] time to write this
[92.7s] episode to this
[95.0s] congregation so that he would give them
[98.3s] hope
[100.0s] despite
[101.6s] experiencing sorrow and death in
[107.0s] their congregation in their midst.
[113.5s] And so this remain to
[116.9s] be every man's question, every man's
[121.1s] desire so that the rough ages and the
[126.3s] mysteries of life and the assurance of
[129.8s] faith is made clear to every believer.
[137.4s] Paul after talking about other
[142.4s] issues finally comes to this point where
[147.9s] he must handle this heavy
[152.8s] matter
[154.7s] death and the hope for the Christian.
[159.9s] It is in this
[162.4s] context that
[166.8s] Paul is speaking to the
[170.9s] church knowing that in this Gregor
[175.2s] Roman
[177.2s] time some ideas had gone on on what the
[184.9s] soul and the body relationship is and
[190.4s] therefore what is it that would happen
[195.2s] to a
[196.8s] believer? It is in this
[200.0s] context that he
[202.3s] relates to the
[205.2s] congregation what it
[207.9s] means to have faith in the Lord, to
[212.6s] believe in the gospel and why the gospel
[218.2s] is the way God chose that his son would
[223.0s] come and die. and after death
[229.1s] resurrect
[231.2s] bodily. So in this
[235.5s] uh chapter chapter
[238.3s] 15 Paul is laying the
[243.3s] basis of
[245.7s] his hope in of his comforting message to
[252.0s] this
[253.8s] church. Most of whom were actually in a
[257.9s] city that had been plagued by immorality
[262.3s] because part of the wor part part of the
[266.8s] activities that took place in this city
[270.4s] was the worship of the fertility god.
[273.8s] And they worship this fertility god by
[278.6s] really sending even mothers who are
[284.0s] lured into this worship by being told if
[287.8s] you engage in immorality you will have
[291.3s] very beautiful uh very beautiful girls
[295.2s] or handsome children. And if you even
[300.0s] sent your children who are beautiful
[304.5s] into this city to worship this fertility
[308.5s] god by really
[312.7s] acting, by really participating in this
[317.2s] immoral
[319.6s] acts, then you are going to be blessed
[324.1s] more
[326.0s] abundantly. And so
[329.0s] Corinth was the place where any dirty
[334.3s] imagination would be. It is said that
[337.9s] any any evening there would be 10,000s
[343.1s] or so women coming down from the temple
[348.0s] and going into the city and in
[351.8s] fact they got a name
[356.8s] Corinth which means to be made a
[361.0s] Corinthian. It was a negative thing. And
[366.2s] so in this city which now
[370.6s] God told his servant, don't be in a
[375.0s] hurry to leave because I have many souls
[378.6s] in this city.
[381.8s] Paul is
[383.9s] seeking to assure them that
[388.0s] despite having chosen to believe to live
[392.4s] this immoral life, live a virtuous
[397.3s] life, they even if they were
[401.5s] dying, there is victory in the Lord.
[406.9s] This is the
[408.9s] context of
[412.0s] this episode and especially this
[416.4s] chapter whereby Paul is trying to let
[421.2s] the
[422.2s] believer that our action in the body
[429.2s] matters. that our bodies are not only
[434.6s] vehicles for the soul in its
[437.8s] journey to the next
[440.9s] war.
[442.4s] That in
[444.4s] fact the soul and the body are actually
[450.2s] one and the
[452.4s] same and there's
[454.8s] no immortality of the
[458.7s] soul. And so with this, Paul is
[464.9s] taking a
[467.4s] believer into this
[470.4s] tenets of
[472.5s] faith. So that his
[476.4s] action, whatever he does, he ought to
[481.6s] know that he is either sowing through
[486.8s] the body and the decision
[489.8s] to the spirit or sowing to the
[494.4s] flesh. You know my brother and
[498.4s] sister, God who created us though he
[502.7s] created us from the
[504.5s] dust but he breathed to our nostril and
[509.2s] we became the
[511.7s] living soul.
[515.3s] And so this
[517.6s] combination makes up the
[521.6s] total being the human being.
[527.1s] Who has all these
[531.2s] faculties that the
[533.6s] body should not be viewed as totally
[538.8s] evil and a
[541.2s] burden although it's
[544.0s] weak and so the Lord will
[547.4s] deliver
[549.3s] us though we this flesh and blood shall
[554.5s] not inherit
[557.7s] the kingdom in this nature but it will
[562.4s] be
[564.4s] changed that which will be
[567.9s] changed is that which
[571.6s] existed and so that is why there will be
[575.6s] translation Jesus who
[579.6s] resurrected had the
[582.8s] marks of the crucifixion
[587.6s] That is why he would say to Thomas,
[592.8s] feel
[594.4s] my the marks of the nails through the
[599.6s] bumps of my
[601.1s] hand and look at my
[604.5s] sight. Put your hand over
[607.8s] there. There were those
[611.0s] scars. And so this
[615.4s] translation means that just as Christ
[619.0s] took the
[620.5s] body, the
[622.5s] gospel is that in the life, death and
[627.6s] resurrection of Jesus
[630.3s] Christ, there is a lesson that should
[634.0s] give us hope although we struggle with
[637.8s] sin in this body. And so it is important
[641.8s] for us to
[644.8s] nurture Christian victory because that
[649.2s] victory is through
[651.5s] Christ. And that is why Paul having
[655.5s] spoken of our
[657.8s] hope in verse
[662.3s] 13 verse 13. This is what he says. So
[668.3s] that I move to verses for 57 and
[676.2s] 58. Let me allow me to begin from verses
[681.4s] 12. It says this. Now if Christ is
[685.2s] preached that he has been raised from
[688.2s] the dead, how do some among you say that
[693.2s] there is no resurrection of the dead
[696.1s] dead?
[697.7s] But if there's no resurrection of the
[701.2s] dead, then Christ is not
[704.8s] risen. And if Christ is not risen, 14,
[709.4s] then our preaching is empty.
[714.3s] And you you are
[718.0s] found false witnesses of God because we
[723.1s] have testified of God that he raised up
[727.1s] Christ whom he did not uh whom he did
[732.8s] not raise up if in fact the dead do not
[739.6s] rise. And so when we come to verses
[745.4s] 57 and 54, no 57 and
[750.8s] 58, Paul
[754.1s] here is
[756.5s] saying in Christ's
[761.1s] resurrection and in our final bodily
[768.2s] resurrection
[770.6s] Because that which is sown in
[774.8s] disgrace must rise in
[778.1s] immortality and
[780.3s] glory. Therefore, he
[782.5s] says a time is coming when believers
[788.0s] will mock death and say, "Oh death,
[793.5s] verse
[794.5s] 55, where is your sting?
[798.3s] whole graves or heads, where is your
[804.0s] victory? And so in Christ Jesus as a
[808.0s] believer though living in this
[811.2s] body, Paul assures and concludes and
[816.3s] tells a believer in cor in Corenth who
[820.9s] may have engaged in immorality but
[824.0s] having believed in the Lord he is
[827.0s] leading a vicious life. So that is
[830.8s] confronting him or her. He is telling
[835.0s] this
[837.0s] believer,
[839.0s] "Thanks be to
[842.5s] God who gives us the
[846.4s] victory through our Lord Jesus Christ."
[851.0s] Therefore, my beloved
[854.8s] brethren, therefore, my beloved sister
[858.1s] and
[859.5s] brother, my
[861.4s] child, you who is wondering what will
[865.6s] happen, how comes that my mother who was
[869.2s] singing in the choir, who was at Dones,
[872.5s] my father who has been faithful, my
[876.0s] wife, my
[878.4s] friend, how comes that he died, what
[882.8s] shall become or what value is my faith?
[888.8s] Listen, Paul is telling the
[892.4s] church, thanks be to
[895.3s] God who gives us the
[899.8s] victory through our Lord Jesus Christ.
[905.5s] And because there is
[907.3s] victory that we experience this
[911.2s] resurrection power in our life even in
[916.9s] this nature that although we are
[921.0s] struggling with these forces yet we have
[925.4s] been given through believing the gospel
[929.3s] through yielding to the control of the
[932.5s] Holy Spirit We are living the
[937.6s] resurrected life of Jesus Christ by
[941.8s] faith. That's why scripture says
[946.5s] that
[948.3s] we count it this way that one
[953.8s] died for all. Just as in
[958.5s] Adam has he
[960.8s] sinned all became
[963.3s] sinners. saw the gospel in Christ coming
[968.2s] in
[969.3s] bodily. Though he was
[972.1s] not taken conception through natural
[977.4s] way, but the Holy Spirit hoovered
[981.6s] covered Mary so that God would have a
[985.7s] tool to use just as the
[991.0s] devil persuaded
[997.9s] lied
[1000.5s] and convinced Eve that they would not be
[1008.4s] dead, that
[1010.9s] in choosing to eat the fruit which God
[1014.1s] has said not
[1016.0s] eat and which is going
[1020.8s] against the word of
[1023.8s] God. You see, God spoke and things came
[1027.6s] into
[1028.8s] being. And therefore, what you read,
[1031.9s] what you
[1033.7s] hear builds
[1036.6s] faith. And if you don't take
[1040.6s] care what you
[1043.6s] believe, if you don't
[1047.5s] watch the
[1049.6s] tenets of the scripture, the
[1053.6s] teachings, you can be
[1056.7s] swayed here and
[1059.5s] there. And so just
[1062.6s] as Adam became an
[1067.0s] instrument with Eve
[1070.8s] by being
[1074.0s] lawless, getting into sin and plunching
[1077.8s] the entire human race into sin.
[1083.4s] Christ came in the
[1085.8s] body by the power of the Holy Spirit so
[1089.8s] that through his body as
[1093.3s] one he would test death for all
[1098.4s] people. And in this testing
[1102.1s] death, we are no
[1105.1s] longer held captive by our nature or our
[1113.2s] hereditary effects.
[1116.1s] No, we have the new Adam. We are created
[1122.0s] into the
[1123.9s] newness of life. And that is how Paul is
[1129.3s] saying Adam who
[1132.5s] became
[1134.2s] earthly who became
[1138.8s] weak
[1141.7s] is here sin as bringing into the human
[1148.0s] race no
[1149.9s] hope of resurrection because sin has
[1154.9s] taken captive.
[1156.4s] of the human being.
[1159.2s] My
[1160.4s] friend, I want you to see this and look
[1164.8s] at this that if one died for all just as
[1170.6s] one by accepting the deception of the
[1174.6s] devil became the source of
[1179.6s] degradation, the source of plunching the
[1182.4s] human race into
[1184.6s] sin. Then God took this weak human
[1189.7s] being, this flesh and the communication
[1194.6s] by
[1195.8s] angels that a son would be born by one
[1201.0s] who had experiences of this weakness so
[1205.2s] that in this son a Messiah would be
[1210.1s] there who has the same weakness as you
[1214.1s] and I this victory ought to be real and
[1219.6s] we ought to believe in it so that we can
[1224.5s] overcome the lies of the evil one who
[1228.7s] tries to accuse us that we still have
[1233.0s] this envys, we still have this hatred.
[1235.8s] We still have this uh this selfishness.
[1243.8s] Yes, we are. But we are a work in
[1249.6s] progress. Thanks be to God who gives us
[1254.1s] the victory. It is not just any victory.
[1258.7s] It is the victory in Christ Jesus. And
[1262.8s] that is why he is saying that be
[1266.6s] steadfast in this hope. Be steadfast in
[1269.8s] this faith. Be steadfast in this
[1276.4s] belief. Be steadfast in understanding
[1280.8s] why it took
[1284.4s] God to plan for salvation by sending his
[1289.2s] only begotten son.
[1292.0s] So that in Christ
[1294.6s] Jesus according to 2
[1298.2s] Corinthians chapter 5 and you read it on
[1302.8s] it says we are no longer living for
[1306.5s] ourself but we are living for him who
[1310.8s] offered himself a sacrifice an atoning
[1316.4s] sacrifice for Christ who died for
[1321.0s] us. Hallelujah.
[1323.9s] And so this victory that we ought to
[1327.5s] nurture just as we saw the children are
[1333.4s] credible telling us there's a seed that
[1336.1s] was planted and this seed ought to
[1339.6s] germinate and the leaves come and then
[1343.7s] it is connected so that if any fruit
[1346.7s] would come it is because there is a seed
[1350.5s] that germinated well took root and is
[1355.1s] being pruned and taken care of by the
[1359.1s] heavenly husband
[1360.8s] men.
[1362.4s] Hallelujah. So this
[1364.8s] victory, this hope that we have in
[1371.1s] Christ
[1372.6s] becomes that only victory that is ours.
[1379.1s] Not because we
[1381.6s] struggle to change our nature, but we
[1386.4s] believe that one has made us new
[1391.2s] creatures. If anyone be in Christ Jesus,
[1395.3s] he is a new
[1398.2s] creature. The old is gone. Behold, it is
[1403.0s] new. And because of that newness, we do
[1406.2s] not become ambassadors of our hereditary
[1409.8s] uh feelings and nature. No, we are
[1413.6s] ambassadors together with God. And God
[1417.0s] is speaking through us because of the
[1419.4s] Holy Spirit who dwells within us,
[1423.2s] pleading with everyone who is still in
[1425.7s] sin that be reconciled to God.
[1433.0s] Praise the Lord.
[1436.9s] And so friends, we need to
[1442.1s] re-evaluate our understanding of our
[1445.5s] bodies because in Gregor Roman
[1451.1s] time, they
[1454.0s] believe that the
[1456.4s] body being a vehicle of
[1459.6s] the of the
[1463.1s] soul can be made
[1466.2s] better. And that is why they would
[1469.2s] exercise and they would come as a
[1472.0s] society and watch those who had
[1476.0s] perfected the
[1477.9s] body. And they would
[1480.7s] run and run
[1483.7s] naked or act and have these um theaters
[1491.7s] where they would
[1494.3s] display the perfect or the ideal
[1498.8s] body. And here we see that in this
[1503.5s] Gregor Roman age they
[1509.2s] were
[1510.8s] glorifying
[1512.8s] gratification, satisfaction and
[1515.0s] pleasure.
[1516.6s] That is why Corinth became a center and
[1519.4s] they started a worship of the
[1522.7s] gods where
[1526.1s] by this body
[1529.6s] ought not to be denied
[1532.8s] anything. But in the belief as a
[1537.5s] Christian we are one. And here we see
[1543.0s] Paul talking
[1545.8s] about
[1547.7s] this view that we have a new
[1553.5s] allegiance, not to the body, not to the
[1557.6s] nature, nor to the flesh, but to the one
[1561.9s] who has given us hope through Christ
[1565.1s] coming and dying our death and rising
[1568.8s] again into
[1571.2s] glory.
[1573.1s] Friends, it doesn't matter how your body
[1578.2s] or how you may have been cheated and
[1582.1s] lured into intelligence to gratify the
[1586.0s] desires of the body.
[1588.3s] No, we have a new being who loves us,
[1593.2s] who died for us, and who has given us
[1597.4s] the
[1599.4s] victory. Hallelujah.
[1603.2s] And that is
[1605.0s] how when we read about
[1608.6s] this you realize my
[1611.3s] friend that Paul in verse two is
[1617.1s] reminding the
[1619.0s] church. Let me read it to verse four.
[1622.6s] says, "For I deliver to you first of all
[1626.6s] that which I also
[1628.8s] received, that Christ died for our sins,
[1633.2s] according to the scriptures, and that he
[1637.3s] was buried, and that he rose again in
[1643.0s] the third day according to the
[1646.2s] scriptures, and that he was seen by
[1651.2s] suffers.
[1652.3s] Then by the 12
[1654.9s] unenumerates
[1656.4s] eyewitnesses who saw Jesus having been
[1660.2s] raised from the
[1662.5s] dead. And so he is laying
[1667.1s] bases that this Christ who lived a
[1671.6s] perfect life who overcame the devil by
[1676.4s] saying it is
[1679.3s] what
[1681.6s] written. Even when he was tempted to use
[1686.0s] his divine power, he said, "You shall
[1690.2s] not be presumptuous and tempt the Lord
[1694.2s] your
[1696.6s] God." So that in whatever levels we are
[1700.7s] in, when favored by God, the evil one
[1705.6s] should not overcome us. We have the
[1709.3s] victory, the example of Jesus Christ who
[1712.9s] lived a righteous life in a sinful
[1716.1s] body. And because he lived a righteous
[1719.1s] life in a sinful body by relying,
[1723.6s] obeying, and being submissive to the
[1728.3s] father, you and I, by submitting to the
[1733.0s] rule of the Holy Spirit, can lead a
[1736.7s] righteous life. Though we are struggling
[1739.5s] and
[1740.4s] battling, yes, sin will still be there.
[1745.0s] It might try to raise its head, but
[1748.4s] thanks be to God. He has given us
[1752.7s] victory. Christ who came has paid the
[1757.4s] the the penalty. You and I have this
[1760.6s] hope in the Lord Jesus Christ.
[1762.7s] Hallelujah.
[1766.3s] And so
[1767.7s] Paul here has laid
[1771.7s] this foundation and he talks about this
[1777.3s] victory
[1779.2s] which came because when Christ
[1784.3s] obeyed where Adam failed in Romans 5 you
[1788.8s] can read that study it and you will see
[1792.0s] that the two Adams are
[1796.1s] contrasted. And so by
[1799.8s] grace when we were still sinners, Christ
[1803.9s] died for the
[1806.6s] ungodly. That you and I, we do not have
[1810.6s] to remain in that sinful condition and
[1814.8s] think that we are doomed. It is only God
[1817.8s] who will have grace on me when he comes
[1821.0s] in glory. He's the one who will choose.
[1823.4s] I don't know whether I'll make it to
[1825.5s] heaven. No, there is victory in the
[1829.6s] Lord. You are not to be held captive as
[1833.1s] if you are a slave to your to your to
[1835.9s] your nature or whatever. Says
[1839.7s] resist evil. Flee from
[1843.5s] it. You have a choice, my friend.
[1847.4s] In Paul's letters, you re realize that
[1850.5s] he's trying to make a believer
[1853.4s] understand this quickly. Allow me to run
[1857.2s] through a few with you.
[1861.0s] In
[1863.2s] Philippians, Philippians chapter 2 vers
[1867.2s] 5, he says, "Let this mind because
[1870.1s] victory is in Christ Jesus." So, let
[1873.3s] this mind that was in who? Christ Jesus
[1877.4s] be in
[1880.3s] you. What you
[1882.8s] believe your mind ought to be filled by
[1888.1s] the truth of the gospel. It is the only
[1892.4s] way that you will have hope and look at
[1897.2s] death and know that you can look and
[1902.6s] face death. Even a a disease that might
[1907.0s] be degenerative, you can look at it and
[1910.8s] not worry, but say, even if my body
[1915.1s] waste, as Job said, even if I may be
[1919.5s] rotting in this body, yet because I
[1922.8s] believe in the Lord and his grace and I
[1926.2s] have lived
[1927.8s] obediently, my eyes shall see the Lord.
[1932.7s] My eyes are not
[1935.2s] another. And it says, "And he will one
[1939.3s] to bring
[1940.8s] me into glory when he stands upon the
[1946.3s] earth."
[1947.4s] Hallelujah. And so look at this
[1950.1s] scripture. Let this mind be in you that
[1953.4s] was also in who? In Christ Jesus. And it
[1957.8s] says in in this he was obedient when he
[1961.5s] came in flesh living the glory in
[1964.8s] heaven. He came with in this flesh and
[1968.2s] in that flesh he was obedient to the
[1971.8s] death even the dead in
[1974.0s] the
[1975.6s] Hallelujah. Praise the Lord.
[1979.2s] So here is the
[1983.5s] secret having the
[1986.0s] spirit rulers is that the spirit
[1989.6s] operates and that is why it is the
[1992.0s] forehead that is sealed for a
[1995.0s] Christian. It is our thoughts. It is our
[1998.9s] mind that we have to allow study
[2003.4s] scripture.
[2004.7s] Understand understand the the the the
[2008.3s] gospel and by you understanding allow to
[2013.1s] be ruled by the spirit.
[2016.6s] in this rule of the spirit. Then he says
[2020.6s] in verses 12 to 14, Philippians 2
[2026.0s] 12-4, come with me my brother, my
[2029.1s] sister. This is the gospel. He says,
[2031.9s] "Therefore, my beloved, as you have
[2034.7s] always obeyed, not as in my presence
[2038.1s] only, but now much more in my absence,
[2042.7s] walk out your own salvation with fear
[2047.4s] and trembling.
[2049.4s] For it is
[2050.8s] God who works in us who works in you
[2056.6s] both to will and to do according to his
[2061.1s] good
[2063.1s] pleasure. Do all things without
[2067.5s] complaining and
[2070.3s] disputing. It is in the body that all
[2073.4s] this is
[2074.8s] done. And the body is taken captive by
[2080.6s] allowing the Holy Spirit and the mind of
[2083.6s] Christ to be in us. And so receiving
[2088.9s] salvation, accepting the gospel is
[2093.3s] actually understanding how Christ came,
[2097.8s] how he lived and choosing and saying
[2102.1s] that which he did and why he did it the
[2106.0s] way he did, I am choosing to live in
[2110.6s] that manner and obey the gospel.
[2115.0s] This is
[2116.4s] where we are planting sewing to the
[2120.4s] spirit.
[2121.8s] This is where you and
[2124.4s] I
[2126.2s] according to this episode he says I
[2131.3s] counted that I have
[2133.6s] not completely
[2136.0s] overcome but one thing I'm doing I
[2139.5s] forget the past chapter 3 that is verse
[2143.5s] 13 and I stretch myself to the
[2147.4s] hope to this victory that has held me
[2152.0s] that has made me choose to remain a
[2155.9s] believer. And so I stretch forth into
[2160.1s] it and he continues to say, "The Lord
[2166.2s] has made me captive in this." And so you
[2169.8s] are not struggling alone. God is working
[2173.1s] in us so that we are willing and we are
[2177.2s] actually doing it in our body. That is
[2180.9s] why he
[2182.0s] concludes in chapter 4 by saying don't
[2186.2s] worry, don't be anxious in anything but
[2190.2s] by thanksgiving and
[2192.9s] supplication let your request be made
[2195.9s] known to God. Whatever you are
[2198.4s] struggling, whatever you are your your
[2201.8s] pain, whatever Paul is
[2205.1s] saying you are not weak. The Lord shall
[2209.0s] keep your mind in perfect peace. Peace
[2211.9s] that passes
[2213.3s] understanding. And he says
[2216.9s] that because he believe he's not weak
[2221.8s] because the Lord is in him. He says I
[2225.9s] can
[2226.9s] do. How
[2230.2s] many in who?
[2233.8s] who does
[2236.0s] what? This belief is not just a
[2240.2s] belief. It is
[2242.9s] effective. It changes us. My friend, let
[2247.1s] me conclude by inviting you to Ephesians
[2252.1s] chapter
[2253.4s] 3. Ephesians chapter 3. And in
[2258.6s] this Paul is talking to this other
[2264.4s] congregation who he said you are in
[2267.2s] danger of
[2270.2s] being of being sifted here and there.
[2274.0s] Wolves would
[2276.0s] come. Ravenous wolves. Brethren among
[2279.8s] you shall rise and draw
[2283.2s] others into their own thinking. Let the
[2287.3s] mind of Christ rule in you so that we
[2291.2s] are a unit. So he
[2294.1s] says this God who loved us chapter 1
[2299.2s] verse 19 and chapter 3 verse 19 he says
[2305.0s] in fact we are called to
[2308.6s] have God in our being.
[2313.1s] is saying that the resurrection power is
[2317.6s] available for you and for me when we
[2321.1s] believe in Christ Jesus.
[2323.0s] Hallelujah. And so we are not to live in
[2329.2s] that
[2330.9s] nature that has
[2333.6s] been for us the source of thinking that
[2337.1s] we are weak. We are not to struggle
[2339.9s] alone. Here we are given the
[2342.8s] resurrection power in Christ Jesus. And
[2346.2s] that is why holy communion becomes a
[2349.3s] very important part of a
[2352.1s] believer. It is you to walk out your
[2357.3s] salvation so that in this body make the
[2361.5s] right
[2362.5s] choices. Let your mind be occupied by
[2366.0s] the Holy Spirit. be sealed because you
[2369.7s] have been adopted. You have been
[2371.9s] accepted. The Lord has loved you and he
[2376.2s] has sealed you for eternity given you
[2380.5s] heritage in the Lord Jesus Christ.
[2383.6s] Victory is yours and so faith is the
[2387.8s] victory my brothers. Let us remain
[2390.9s] steadfast in this faith. Hallelujah.
[2394.2s] And so he says your labors in the flesh
[2399.8s] is not in
[2401.9s] vain. What you do, you are resisting the
[2405.5s] evil is not in vain. May I invite the
[2410.1s] chesters to come so that they can give
[2414.4s] us a song so that we can have this
[2419.8s] moment to let the Lord rule over our
[2425.5s] hearts. Hallelujah.
[2427.8s] So that we know we should be steadfast,
[2432.4s] immovable in our faith and abound in
[2436.4s] good works because we are
[2440.7s] created to live in this newness of life.
[2444.8s] Hallelujah. So my
[2447.8s] brother, trust in the
[2451.2s] Lord. Yield to him.
[2454.7s] Obey these traditions that have been
[2457.0s] handed over to us. Participate and
[2460.7s] understand so that like
[2465.1s] in first Corinthians 11, as we are
[2470.2s] invited to partake of the Holy Communion
[2472.6s] as
[2473.5s] believers, victory is not in your
[2476.6s] strength. It is in obeying the gospel.
[2480.2s] It is in letting the mind of Christ be
[2482.8s] in you. Whatever your struggle as a
[2486.0s] believer, if Christ
[2489.2s] welcome a traitor, who would sell him,
[2493.0s] washed his feet? If he went to Peter who
[2499.0s] said, "No, you are higher than me." And
[2500.9s] he said, "If I don't wash your feet, we
[2504.2s] have no part." In this unity, brethren,
[2508.0s] the Lord is serving us and reminding us
[2511.2s] that he is in the business of cleansing
[2513.9s] us.
[2515.3s] Hallelujah. How many with me today are
[2520.0s] saying, Lord, it is by grace that you
[2522.9s] came and you died. It is by grace that
[2526.5s] you let me understand the gospel and you
[2529.8s] created faith. That is why I chose to be
[2532.7s] baptized. And Lord, I won in this
[2536.7s] newness of life because I'm a new
[2539.8s] creature. Christ has paid the penalty. I
[2544.5s] am no longer the old person. I am new in
[2548.6s] Christ Jesus who has given me the
[2550.8s] victory. I want to draw closer as a
[2554.3s] baptized member to the Holy Communion
[2557.4s] where the Lord shall cleanse me as he
[2560.4s] cleanses my feet through my brethren.
[2563.0s] Are you
[2564.7s] there as a baptized man? Are you
[2569.9s] there? And if you are going to partake
[2572.2s] of the holy communion, you can rise as
[2574.2s] we sing this song. And even if you are
[2576.8s] not baptized, you will be baptized soon.
[2579.2s] And there's victory in the Lord. He has
[2581.8s] died for us. Young
[2584.6s] man, believe in the Lord. Accept him.
[2587.7s] Let him rule over your life. Let this
[2590.2s] mind be in you that was in Christ Jesus
[2593.4s] Christ and let's take up this faith.
[2596.0s] Hallelujah.
[2597.6s] Welcome.
[2600.0s] 647 647 from him.
[2606.6s] I rise in the glory of the coming of the
[2611.4s] Lord. He is jumping on the
[2617.7s] wed. He has
[2623.7s] [Music]
[2626.3s] [Applause]
[2630.8s] loosing.
[2632.4s] Glory, glory,
[2637.0s] hallelujah.
[2638.5s] Glory, glory, hallelujah.
[2641.8s] [Music]
[2644.7s] Glory, glory,
[2648.8s] hallelujah. His truth is
[2652.7s] [Applause]
[2653.1s] [Music]
[2655.9s] mighty. He has the
[2660.8s] trumpet retreat. He is all hearts open
[2666.7s] before his godly seat. Oh, sweet my soul
[2671.4s] to answer. He will
[2674.3s] [Music]
[2677.5s] be
[2679.0s] my
[2682.2s] home.
[2683.7s] Glory, glory,
[2688.4s] hallelujah.
[2690.0s] Glory, glory, hallelujah.
[2696.2s] Glory, glory,
[2700.4s] hallelujah. His truth
[2704.4s] [Applause]
[2704.8s] [Music]
[2707.6s] is in the beauty of the living Christ
[2712.2s] was born across the sea. be the glory in
[2717.2s] his voice of God to feed us as you and
[2720.8s] me. As he died to make men holy, let us
[2725.8s] live to make you free.
[2730.0s] Oh,
[2731.5s] [Music]
[2731.6s] [Applause]
[2734.8s] maring.
[2736.4s] Glory, glory, hallelujah.
[2742.9s] Glory, glory,
[2747.9s] hallelujah.
[2749.4s] Glory, glory,
[2753.9s] hallelujah. His truth is
[2758.2s] [Applause]
[2758.8s] [Music]
[2762.1s] mighty. Shall we pray?
[2765.4s] Eternal gracious father, you are the
[2768.2s] Lord God Almighty who has loved us and
[2772.3s] who has paid the price for
[2775.0s] us. Thank you because when you are born,
[2779.6s] you came to set men free so that we can
[2784.4s] live free from sin.
[2787.4s] And though we
[2789.5s] struggle because these bodies are yet to
[2792.5s] be delivered, but Lord, in these bodies,
[2796.3s] you are telling us to sow to the spirit.
[2800.1s] So the Lord, we yield to you and let
[2802.6s] your mind take control over our
[2807.1s] minds to lead and rule over our spirit
[2811.4s] so that you sanctify us in our spirit,
[2815.6s] in our soul, and in the flesh.
[2819.7s] Mighty King, let your will be done over
[2823.4s] your children, even as we draw near to
[2827.3s] the table of the Lord, to the emblems
[2830.3s] and this orordinance that reminds us of
[2835.2s] your death and the price that you paid.
[2838.5s] Father, may we choose so that we can
[2843.0s] give an ultimate
[2844.9s] sacrifice by choosing to live holy lives
[2848.9s] and to give of our being, of our
[2851.5s] faculties, of our abilities, of our
[2854.3s] resources for the glory and honor of
[2857.4s] your name. Accept our service and
[2860.4s] ministry. Let us indeed be your
[2863.5s] ambassadors of the great wonderful
[2867.4s] transaction. The Lord we can speak to
[2870.8s] many and ask them to be reconciled to
[2874.2s] you because you have reconciled us.
[2876.9s] Reconciling the entire world unto
[2879.6s] yourself through Christ. Thank you,
[2882.2s] Lord, because you've given us victory
[2884.6s] and this victory is ours so that we are

[2891.8s] this faith in the Lord Jesus Christ. We
