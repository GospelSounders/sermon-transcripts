what it was josephin said it was another name for vacation bible school and it was a lot of fun kissy didn't want to disappoint josephin but she didn't want to go it was summer and she wanted to stay outdoors and play tag in hide-and seek and to climb on things so she didn't go to Bible boot camp when it started but her older brother and sister went and they loved it Kia's sister told her I thought it was boring at first but it was really fun her brother said there are lots of fun games and the food is yummy as Kia listened she thought to herself hm I want to have fun she went to Bible boot camp with her sister and brother there she learned a lot about God she learned that he rested in the seventh day of creation and that he asked people to also rest on the Sabbath she was glad to know more about God after Bible boot camp ended josephin invited Kia to go to church on Sabbath Kia didn't want to disappoint josephin but she didn't want to go it was still summer and she wanted to stay outside to play tag and hideand-seek and climb on things but then josephin told Kia's mother about going to church on Sabbath mother said to Kia I think it's a good idea I want you to go to church on Sabbath then Kia's older brother and sister also invited her to go with them to church on Sabbath they start they had started going after Bible boot camp tiia it seemed like everyone wanted her to go to church on Sabbath so she went at church she learned more about God and she was happy to know God better the next summer when Kia was 11 josephin told her about a summer campor kids enjoyed yummy food making new friends and learned more about God would you like to go josephin asked K said didn't have to be asked twice it was summer and at the camp she could play tag and hideand-seek and climb on things she also wanted to know more about God at first Kia didn't get to know more about God at Camp Polaris she was too busy enjoying the food and making new friends she was so happy to see that josephin was a camp leader as the camp continued Kia got to know more about God as she sang songs and listened to morning and evening worship talks before she knew it the week was over and the kids were packing up to go back home Kia felt sad to say goodbye to her new friends but then her friend spoke about coming back to Camp next year Kia thought next year I didn't know there is a next year the next summer she returned to camp and she kept on coming back every year after that when she was 16 she became more than a camper she became a counselor in training her helping Camp leaders work with their kids Kia said it was hard to learn to act like a grown-up leader at Camp I am used to being a kid she said but I'm trying to be a leader part of a previous 13th Sabbath offering helped improve camp pois with new cabins and real toilets and showers Kia and the children at Camp poers are grateful to everyone who gave to that 13th Sabbath offering you can help Alaskan

fourth quarter of the teens's cor Stone Connections lesson before we begin I'd like our pist to introduce themselves and then we can pray hi my name is Brenda Maya hi my name is Winston hi my name is Silas and my name is jonan magana I'll ask Winston to pray with us before we begin okay let us pray almighty God we come before you this wonderful time to thank you for the gift of life thank you for being with us all thank you for this opportunity to discuss this book dear Lord may you protect us guide us help us to understand whatever you going to learn father protect also our listener so that he may be blessed in whatever we're going to say here Lord be with us and let us talk your words Lord be with us now forever more in Jesus name we pray and believe amen amen amen amen thank you Winston uh question um sorry before we get the question our topic is risky witness risky witness being a witness is not something that's really um smiled a point in our world right now right people call you snitch snitches get stitches you know um people don't really want to be at the Forefront of anything we like being in the comfort of a whatever we doing we don't want to get out there push ourselves to the limits but our lesson is about someone who was a risky witness a little story um a boy was flying a kite on a cloudy day it was on a TI very long string so at one point the wind blew the kite into the clouds and he couldn't see it but he was still holding on to the string a man was passing by and asked a young man young boy why you still holding on to the stream what are you holding on to said my kite is up there the man told him but you cannot see it the boy said I know it's there because I can feel the tug on my string our story today is about Nehemiah Nehemiah was holding on to God a God he did not see because Nehemiah was actually born in captivity in Babylon he had never seen Jerusalem he did not know anything about its people right just knew these are my fellow Israelites who them in captivity but he did not really experience his homeland but he held on to God and he listened to a god he's never really you know um witnessed his miracles from he listened to the tug that he felt on his string our belief for the lesson today is belief number 14 that is unity in the body of Christ unity in the body of Christ so we'll just I read about that um the church is like the body right different parts different things that is what Paul tells us but we'll now get into the lesson and I'd like to ask Silas to take us through the what do you think section so if you have your lesson you can just flip to the what you think section and I'll ask Silas to lead us through that syas okay the what do you think section is talking about different kind of leaders there they are Visionary leaders and their doers but very rare do you find that someone can do both to some degree so the first question is work hard at what you know is right and God will accompany your efforts and uh the second one is pray first and wait for God to guide you in what you do you should do so which do you think is better let's start from Brenda uh this this is a trick question cuz these are both things I believe in but not necessarily do uh for me I think for this one I'll go with the second one pray fast and wait for God to guide you in what you should do I'm really 5050 in it but I picked this one cuz the first one work harder what you think is right then God will accompany your efforts it really goes hand in hand with God only helps those who help themselves and that's not something that necessarily we believe in it's not the Bible actually it's not it's not based off the Bible so and also you might for you to have that strength to work hard you have to have talked to God to give you that strength that's why I went to the second one cuz it it makes more sense in regards to trusting in God yeah mhm um for me I'll definitely not go with the first one that says that work hard at what you know is right and God God's will will accompany your efforts you know what you might think is right basically somehow might might not be right you might be thinking that something is right and while it's definitely not right so I won't go with that but I'd rather go with pray fast and wait for God to guide you in what you shall you should do cuz you know it's like we putting God as our foundation you know so that whatever I'm doing it might be according to God's will yeah so that's why i' go with the second one all right silus what do you think what would you go with I think uh I'd go with the second one because uh God is the principle of what you're doing yeah all right um yeah I think also go to the second one you know the Bible says in Proverbs 3:5 trust in the Lord with all your heart and lean not on your own understanding and that negates the first verse it says you know work hard at what you what you know is right not what God says is right and God is our standard for every single thing that we're doing so that is it thank for that Silas um before we proceed just like us to read from 1 Peter 1:3 I have it open here you can just read it 1 Peter chapter 1:3 says therefore guard up the loins of your mind be sober and rest your hope fully upon the grace that is to be brought to you at the revelation of Jesus Christ this practically just tells us we need to rely on God fully okay I think there was a lesson we learned a few weeks ago that should be lesson six about Ezra and Leadership a true leader relies on God and what God tells them to do do not rely on your own understanding all right so we'll go to our story and brend will take us through that and our story comes from the book of Nehemiah chapter 1 so if you have your Bibles you can just flip to that if you have the lesson just go to the into the story Nehemiah chapter 1 and chapter 2 Brenda will give us a summary uh thank you CH Jordan um I'll just try and make a summary because of time I don't want to bore you with the details but um it starts with uh in the month of Nissan in the 20th year of King say axis I don't know if that's how you pronounce it I'm not sure I don't know Axis or something yeah um and it's basically dwelling on the topic of how nemiah was a cup Bearer for a king and let me give you some backstory a cup bearer was the person who would taste all the meals and drinks of the king before he had them before uh so so that if it has poison they' be able to know that the King was trying to be killed right and in a way this means was basically the scape goat of death for the king if that makes sense and um in this in these times this was a very honorable job for someone to have in in the Kingdom right and that means he had a very comfortable life yeah and when he heard about the stories of what's going on back home and how people were were in distress how the walls were broken down like there was so much going back he had never been there but he he was sad for his people and it showed on his face and back then it was illegal to go in the presence of the king with a sad face he was supposed to be constantly smiling all the time which honestly I think would be so hard for me but mhm the king did not he did not um take that as an offense because he had known neiah for a long time and uh he he he asked nayah what's what's wrong why are you so sad anded why is your face downcast nemiah explained to him uh he was very respectful he was like oh King live forever this is happening and this is why I'm sad so he told him about the situation back in Jerusalem and the King asked him how long will it take for you to go and come back and this this Overjoyed him because before he had told the king about his problems he had sent a small prayer to God he had prayed and even before in our past lesson we learned about how he prayed about this specific issue and this was an answered this was God answering his prayer through the king and he then let later on goes and tells the king to give him letters to the governors of transits so they they may provide him protection on his way to Judah and uh he also asked that he might be given uh letters to assab The Keeper of the royal Parks so that he may be given timber for the work that needed to be done in Jerusalem and it just goes on on how he asked in detail on what what he needed from the King to give him and he then later on tells us about some men that uh are very I I don't know how to describe these men but they are basically uh the people what we like to call them um delayers of progress of progress yes yeah so they're called sunbal the horonite and Tob the ammonite and their officials they heard about what was going on and they had someone's coming to promote the benefit or the wealth of the Israelites and this this made them so mad you know these these they haters you know they like ah we cannot have these guys get get well we don't they didn't like the fact that Israel was on a way of being healed from the years of Exile and torment and he just talks about how he went to Jerusalem he was safe on his journey because of his request the king to get uh protection on the way to Jerusalem yeah all right thank you that Brenda um I'm actually picking something new from this story something I've never thought about before the value of knowing what exactly you want when you go towards your king and our King is God know neemi knew exactly in detail I need this number I mean this amount of Timber I need this type of stones I need this and this and this he was very specific um Christ told his disciples when he was teaching them knock and you shall find knock and the door will be opened seek and you shall find same thing applies to us as Christians you know know exactly what you want right and then something else I have noted Proverbs 22:29 it says do you see a man skillful in his work he will stand before Kings he will not stand before obscure men nemiah was very diligent in what he did you know being being the king's cap be they actually said long leave the king and goodbye the cabar you know in casee he tasted the wrong food or something but it was a very honorable job this guy was a slave now you you're practically taken from your country right now Winston taken to the neighboring country to become a slave to the king but he was diligent in the work he did it's surprising that he says it's the first time he was s in front of the king first time serving him all those years I mean this shows us whatever situation you're in just be cheerful there there's value in smiling a smile is infectious when you smile someone else sees you smile they start smiling it's like a very obvious thing kid kids pick it up very easily right so thank you for that Brenda where you can just answer a few questions from the out of the story section uh yeah so the there are few questions that caught my eyes in the out of the story section that I feel like we really need to answer it really would bring out the message and the first one I'd like to talk to ask is what leadership qualities do you see in nemiah and uh Chun you talked about something about uh Naya's you know the qualities he had could you answer this for us leadership um I tie that back to the story of the kite and the boy right Nehemiah was tied to God the same way the kite was tied to the young boy's hand and by keeping himself connected to God always he drew his source of strength and direction when a kite is held in your hand you're the one who directing weight moves as much as the wind is going to blow it you're the one who's going to reel it into you or let it go further away that is the same thing with God when you stay connected to God he controls our lives and as a leader you need to rely on the ultimate leader who is God so that is one of the quality portrays always being connected to God uh Winston um for me first I'd say nemiah was bold uh or more like courageous cuz from what we see here you know in those days approaching the king wasn't something very easy cuz even when you see here um before neemi presented the the wine that the king would drink he would have first drunk it first and I feel like this shows how bold he was cuz um he chose to speak out what was in his heart and tell him that you know he wanted to go rebuild his you know his own country yeah his own his own country so I feel like he was courageous and that's quite a good quality for a leader yeah uh syus do you have a quality you'd like to add in I think uh he's among the rare we were seeing in the what do you think section he has the vision and he also does what he envisions yeah thank you so much and uh there was also a question up here I would't go deep into discussion about it but uh what we're told about the interaction between the king and and Ne say guys neiah and um how it how uh does the interaction between them portray relationships between Kings and servants and to what to what do you attribute the good willll or support support of the king and something I just noticed during the whole during the whole time I was reading in the into the story there were was reciprocity between the king and nemiah right cuz for the king to not even he the king didn't even consider you know should I let him go should I he said how long he went to say to the how long would you need because him and had grown a sort of respect you know a sort of relationship where they didn't need such they didn't have distrust in it right and you need you need that with your C be cuz this this this the guy that that is basically saving your life and nemiah was was very respectful very respectful and also regarding to what jonan said he was cheerful this is the first time he was sad which and that affects those around you and nemiah being cheerful and respectful to the king it it had an influence on the king and how he responded to nehemiah's distress uh one more question I'd just like to ask it's very similar to the first one but uh what wise step does nemiah follow as he undertakes this project like during the story we see certain things nemiah does in order for this project that he's taking up to succeed there are certain things if he didn't do they would have this story wouldn't even be here in the first place so what do did you Rie any did you notice anything in the story um for me I like to answer the first question you asked uhuh about the considering the interaction between the king and nemiah MH how does it portray the relationship between Kings and Servants of course right now we don't have Kings and servants but let's just say um leaders and subordinates I feel like um you know there should be that first respectful we should be like us as subordinates we should be respectful to you know our leaders and another thing is we should be hardw working and from what you said um you know when nemiah approached the the king he did not hesitate giving him the chance to go rebuild his own country cuz for me I feel like you know let's say I was a king I wouldn't give someone a chance someone who let's say always messed up and did bad stuff so for nemiah to be given this chance I think he was always dedicated to whatever he used to do and all that yeah yeah thank you so much um if there's anyone else um there's a question you had asked um um you know about uh sorry I think it's the same one as Winston actually just want to answer that yeah you know um when you can be trusted with the little work that you're doing it means even a greater task that you ask for it will be granted to you you know same thing as winst has said when you're diligent in your work you can be entrusted to do more you know the king should favor into him yeah Sal had something to say uh I think uh from if he was not bold as a person nothing of none of this would have happened he was bold enough to go tell the king that he his City where his ancestors lie is in Ruins yeah also I think something else I've just remembered um Ellen White speaks about it in prophets and Kings chapter 53 where she says that nemiah gauged the king's countenance when he was going to take the wine to him he took a while aftering the news he stayed for a couple of months I think around 4 months before he actually presented his request to the king yeah so he gauged how the king's mood was before he went and presented their request even us we do the same when you want something to from your folks you just going to wait see uh today they look good in a good mood all right good then you go asking mom I want this or dad I want this yeah same thing neiah did but it's it's very comforting to know that we don't have to do that with our God you know we don't have to gauge God's mood like God today sad I'm not going to ask him for anything we can go to a god at any single time that's the only difference we have between you know our Earthly leaders and our Heavenly leader amen that's so true and in in reference to to that and just what um Salas was saying about how neiah was bold and all the characteristics of basically seen in the story of him being a leader uh one thing I think that if he didn't do this wouldn't have succeeded is if he didn't ask for all those letters regarding materials and protection cuz we already know he had enemies of progress waiting for him so if he didn't go ahead and ask the king I need this and this and this this story would have never happened and that's that's very important even regarding our spiritual life if we don't ask God for protection if we don't ask God for strength we won't be able to be the leaders that he wants us to be or do what we need to do in in in this world even in delivering his message to other people cuz he takes a lot of strength needs a lot of courage and we can't do that without asking him cuz the devil the devil is our enemy of progress and he's waiting on us to not ask and just dive into the work head fast no protection nothing and I feel like this is very it's a very important uh quality we should all have as Christians amen yeah thank you that Brenda um so we'll just segue into the flashlight and I'll ask Winston to just read that for us um the flashlight of today's story says Nehemiah holds nehemiah's whole heart whole soul was in the Enterprise he had undertaken his hope his energy his enthusiasm his determination were contagious inspiring others with the same high courage of lofty purpose each each Man became aniah in his turn and helped to make stronger the Heart and Hand of his neighbor I think from the flashlight we see the the weight of our emotions the effect it has on on the people surrounding us cuz we see that um Nehemiah actually influenced very many people around him he like became a role model to a number of people and this is basically because of his courage yeah his boldness as we've seen in the story and his his lofty purpose and I think we get something also from the Tuesday section where we see that um Nehemiah was was willing to risk his life for this cause and this there they they've actually asked us a question that what cause do you believe in so much that you might be willing to risk your life for it is there something in your life that you always say that I'd do anything I'd risk anything to do in my life so I'd like to leave you as my listener with this question is there something there that you're willing to do anything whatever it takes um just like Nehemiah did with his course yeah amen thank for that um the greatest purpose in our lives you know we we all need to have something that drives us someone once told me dreams are not what you see at night when you're sleeping dreams are what wake you up in the morning know you you wake up with that dream that you're chasing and we when you have that one thing you're very convicted about that I want to see this thing through you will walk towards it with all your might and once you um place that your request and your plans and to the Lord is going to direct our paths into it thank you for that Winston so I'll ask uh Silas to read for us from uh Proverbs chapter 3 verse 5 and 6 that's uh proy vers 5 and 6 it's also in our punch lines as well can just follow along so Proverbs 3: 5 and 6 and as he's getting it um just a question for us to think about is there when you just look at the punch lines right just look at a verse that speaks to Your Heart Right and I just encourage you to just try memorize it we have about one to about five five punchlines and they all relate to our lesson today so just pick one punch line try to memorize it and let it guide you to the coming week so I'll ask say let's to read for us Proverbs 3: 5 and 6 Proverbs 3: 5 and 6 says trust in the Lord with all thine heart and lean not unto thy own understanding in all thy ways acknowledge Him and He Shall direct your path thank you so I'd like to ask you silus why do you think um this verse you know how how does it speak to your heart and your life how do you think it applies to your life and how can it apply to other people's lives that uh in all our ways we should acknowledge God and he will direct all our paths it's pretty much as for thank you for that um so just moving on Sly uh we have uh something in the Thursday section I'd like to ask Winston again to read that for us and there's a verse there as well Colossians chapter 1 verse 3 and 4 colians 1: 3 and 4 um on the thir section um as Silas opens Colossians 1 vers verse 3 and 4 i' like to read the questions that are there uh the first one says whom do you know that has seen a cause through to a frusion take time to write a note of affirmation and encouragement to someone in your church or Community who has worked to see an idea through to reality share with them how they are share with them how they are like nemiah and what a contribution this makes to others and say a prayer that the same spirit will grow in you so Colossians 3:1 and vers Colossians 1:3 and 4 yes Colossians 1 vers 3 and 4 he says we give thanks to God and the father of our Lord Jesus Christ paying always praying always for us for you sorry since we heard of your faith in Jesus Christ and the love which he have to all the saints amen amen um giving thanks to God always I'm praying for you nemiah upon hearing the distress that his people going through you know the cap is had gone back he felt pricked in his heart he felt like I need to do do something and that is exactly what he did great people in this world you know theyve always been holding on to things either for Christians they hold on to God for non-christians they always had that belief that was driving them okay but as Christians holding on to God who we've never seen I'm sure no one in this panel has ever seen God face to face right or our listeners as well but we know he exists and God has put in each and every one of us a certain drive a certain purpose you know a reason why you're here on Earth and most of us actually we we might be worried we haven't discovered it yet you're like when I ever know why I'm here on this Earth for but the same God who created you is the same God who can reveal that to you the Lord who reveals secrets and interpret dreams for us so just pray to God and ask him to show you what is my purpose in life what is that thing that's going to be driving me God what can I do for you okay that is it's a very big and powerful prayer and once he shows it to you be prepared to just follow it through yourself so will Brenda have something to say no no okay all right so as we wrap up I'd like us to read the final verse that is in um let me get it Proverbs 11:14 as we close up proverbs 11: vers 14 get it I have it thank you Brenda uh Proverbs 11: 14 and it says where there is no councel the people fall but in the multitude of counselors there is safety mhm where there is no councel people fail and with a lot of councel there is safety so as you reflect on you know this nemiah story what fears or questions do you have about your own abilities that inhibit you from following you know your dream and from your willingness to take risks for for God how do the stories of all the Believers who have gone before you that took risks cause give you courage what would a similar cause in your own Journey look like so this is a more reflective question that we're going to be ending with seeing all these people in the Bible who took great risks for God I mean the biggest example you know is Daniel standing up to the King as a Young Man 17 years old and and telling them I'm not going to eat your food or I'm not going to worship you I'm not going to do this and this and this that was a big risk he took and God saw him through the fire David young man very very probably very small but he took on a giant because he took the risk um there is a uh I'm trying to remember the quote those who dare win right there's a certain military I think it's the British military Special Forces their main motto is He Who Dares wins and God calls us you know I have not given you spirit of fear but a Spirit of Courage and of sound mind what more can we ask for courage God has given us the courage to just walk through fire walk through Temptations he promises I will be there with you if you want to do something I will see you through it because I have given you the courage and I promise you victory God says he has good plans for us so I just want you to believe in the good plans of God as we close I just need to get uh any comment you have from our panelists as we wrap up um what I'd like to say as we close is basically what comes out in the one of the punch lines Psalms 5:8 um it says Lead Me Lord in your righteousness because of my enemies make your way straight before me um we realize that we're currently living in a world that there always uh they're always um I'd say enemies of good um despite Satan being one of them um there always people who will always be on your back trying to make you give up and here we we have a privilege where we can invite God to walk with us throughout this journey and we realize that the company of God is basically just energetic and with him we get to achieve really much just as we see from even the story of Nehemiah right yeah thank you Wiston Silas you have anything say passing short um I'll just this one quote underneath a further Insight by Ellen G white from prophets and Kings page 645 in every crisis his people may confidently declare if God be for us who can be against us so as we go on reading our lesson uh reading deeply you know studying it more let's let's always remember this even in our daily lives cuz nemiah had to understand this for him to take up the courage and do what he needed to do so yeah I think that's that's one of the biggest lessons I've learned amen so I'll leave you with one verse Jeremiah 10911 for I know the plans I have for you declares the Lord plans to give you plans to prosper you and not to harm you plans to give you hope and a future so if your desire is to embrace this plan for your life then be willing to receive the instruction and the adversity that you're going to face in life when you accept God's plan for your life so thank you so much for sitting with us for this lesson I'd like to ask um Brenda pray this yeah uh let's bow our heads for out of prayer Our Father in heaven we come before you this day we thank you for the breath of life for the gift of Salvation and grace and mercy Lord we don't take it for granted we thank you for helping us through this lesson and all the panelists who have been here to discuss uh today's lesson help us to be like nemiah the character that we've read about today help us to be respectful to be servants to you and to learn how to to be diligent in the work that we do in our everyday lives help us to be leaders and to learn to be leaders help us to ask you for the strength and the courage needed to do your work as we go on with our lives help us to take these characters and characteristics from nemiah and help help us to learn them and make them a part of us so that you may be proud of who we become as young adults in Jesus name we pray amen amen thank you so much have a blessed week see you in the next lesson

[81.1s] it was really fun her brother said there
[83.5s] are lots of fun games and the food is
[86.2s] yummy as Kia listened she thought to
[89.2s] herself hm
[90.5s] I want to have fun she went to Bible
[92.8s] boot camp with her sister and brother
[94.7s] there she learned a lot about God she
[96.7s] learned that he rested in the seventh
[98.3s] day of creation and that he asked people
[100.4s] to also rest on the Sabbath she was glad
[103.6s] to know more about God after Bible boot
[106.5s] camp ended josephin invited Kia to go to
[109.1s] church on Sabbath Kia didn't want to
[111.2s] disappoint josephin but she didn't want
[113.2s] to go it was still summer and she wanted
[115.6s] to stay outside to play tag and
[117.5s] hideand-seek and climb on things but
[119.7s] then josephin told Kia's mother about
[121.6s] going to church on Sabbath mother said
[123.6s] to Kia I think it's a good idea I want
[126.4s] you to go to church on Sabbath then
[128.5s] Kia's older brother and sister also
[130.2s] invited her to go with them to church on
[132.0s] Sabbath they start they had started
[134.0s] going after Bible boot camp tiia it
[136.6s] seemed like everyone wanted her to go to
[138.2s] church on Sabbath so she went at church
[141.6s] she learned more about God and she was
[143.6s] happy to know God better the next summer
[146.9s] when Kia was 11 josephin told her about
[149.4s] a summer campor kids enjoyed yummy food
[151.9s] making new friends and learned more
[153.9s] about God would you like to go josephin
[156.7s] asked K said didn't have to be asked
[158.9s] twice it was summer and at the camp she
[161.5s] could play tag and hideand-seek and
[163.2s] climb on things she also wanted to know
[165.6s] more about God at first Kia didn't get
[168.5s] to know more about God at Camp Polaris
[170.8s] she was too busy enjoying the food and
[172.7s] making new friends she was so happy to
[175.7s] see that josephin was a camp leader as
[178.1s] the camp continued Kia got to know more
[180.1s] about God as she sang songs and listened
[182.2s] to morning and evening worship talks
[184.5s] before she knew it the week was over and
[187.2s] the kids were packing up to go back home
[189.6s] Kia felt sad to say goodbye to her new
[191.5s] friends but then her friend spoke about
[193.5s] coming back to Camp next year Kia
[195.9s] thought next year I didn't know there is
[198.6s] a next year the next summer she returned
[200.9s] to camp and she kept on coming back
[202.9s] every year after that when she was 16
[205.5s] she became more than a camper she became
[207.8s] a counselor in training her helping Camp
[210.2s] leaders work with their kids Kia said it
[212.6s] was hard to learn to act like a grown-up
[215.4s] leader at Camp I am used to being a kid
[217.8s] she said but I'm trying to be a leader
[220.5s] part of a previous 13th Sabbath offering
[223.4s] helped improve camp pois with new cabins
[225.8s] and real toilets and showers Kia and the
[228.3s] children at Camp poers are grateful to

[395.9s] welcome to lesson 8 of the fourth
[398.8s] quarter of the teens's cor Stone
[401.1s] Connections lesson before we begin I'd
[404.2s] like our pist to introduce themselves
[406.0s] and then we can pray hi my name is

[412.0s] Winston hi my name is Silas and my name
[415.7s] is jonan magana I'll ask Winston to pray
[418.6s] with us before we begin
[420.1s] okay let us pray almighty God we come
[422.7s] before you this wonderful time to thank
[424.4s] you for the gift of life thank you for
[426.6s] being with us all thank you for this
[429.0s] opportunity to discuss this book dear
[431.0s] Lord may you protect us guide us help us
[433.4s] to understand whatever you going to
[434.6s] learn father protect also our listener

[445.6s] us now forever more in Jesus name we
[447.5s] pray and believe amen amen amen amen
[450.3s] thank you
[451.4s] Winston uh question um sorry before we
[455.4s] get the question our topic is risky
[459.1s] witness risky witness being a witness is
[462.9s] not something that's really um smiled a
[465.6s] point in our world right now right
[467.8s] people call you snitch snitches get
[470.3s] stitches you know um people don't really
[473.8s] want to be at the Forefront of anything
[476.8s] we like being in the comfort of a
[479.1s] whatever we doing we don't want to get
[480.7s] out there push ourselves to the limits
[483.7s] but our lesson is about someone who was
[486.0s] a risky
[487.9s] witness a little story um a boy was
[490.8s] flying a kite on a cloudy day it was on
[494.2s] a TI very long string so at one point
[497.2s] the wind blew the kite into the clouds
[499.5s] and he couldn't see it but he was still
[501.6s] holding on to the
[503.3s] string a man was passing by and asked a
[506.6s] young man young boy why you still
[509.0s] holding on to the stream what are you
[510.3s] holding on to said my kite is up there
[513.7s] the man told him but you cannot see it
[516.1s] the boy said I know it's there because I
[518.4s] can feel the tug on my string our story
[521.7s] today is about
[523.3s] Nehemiah Nehemiah was holding on to God
[527.5s] a God he did not see because Nehemiah
[530.2s] was actually born in captivity in
[533.0s] Babylon he had never seen Jerusalem he
[536.6s] did not know anything about its people
[538.9s] right just knew these are my fellow
[540.6s] Israelites who them in captivity but he
[542.5s] did not really experience his homeland
[545.8s] but he held on to God and he listened to
[548.3s] a god he's never really you know um
[552.0s] witnessed his miracles from he listened
[555.4s] to the tug that he felt on his string
[558.6s] our belief for the lesson today is
[561.5s] belief number
[563.5s] 14 that is unity in the body of Christ
[567.3s] unity in the body of Christ so we'll
[569.0s] just I read about that um the church is
[572.7s] like the body right different parts
[575.1s] different things that is what Paul tells
[576.8s] us but we'll now get into the lesson and
[580.0s] I'd like to ask Silas to take us through
[582.0s] the what do you think section so if you
[584.3s] have your lesson you can just flip to
[585.6s] the what you think section and I'll ask
[587.9s] Silas to lead us through that
[590.9s] syas okay the what do you think section
[594.5s] is talking about different kind of
[596.7s] leaders there they are Visionary leaders
[599.5s] and their doers but very rare do you
[602.8s] find that someone can do both to some
[606.7s] degree
[608.5s] so the first question is work hard at
[613.1s] what you know is right and God will
[614.8s] accompany your efforts and uh the second
[618.2s] one is pray first and wait for God to
[621.7s] guide you in what you do you should do
[625.0s] so which do you think is better let's
[628.6s] start from
[632.0s] Brenda uh this this is a trick question
[634.8s] cuz these are both things I believe in
[639.6s] but not necessarily do uh for me I think
[643.3s] for this one I'll go with the second one
[645.6s] pray fast and wait for God to guide you
[648.3s] in what you should do I'm really 5050 in
[650.8s] it but I picked this one cuz the first
[653.2s] one work harder what you think is right
[655.1s] then God will accompany your efforts it
[657.4s] really goes hand in hand with
[659.8s] God only helps those who help themselves
[662.5s] and that's not something that
[664.0s] necessarily we believe in it's not the
[666.6s] Bible actually it's not it's not based
[668.2s] off the Bible so and also you might for
[671.3s] you to have that strength to work hard
[673.0s] you have to have talked to God to give
[675.8s] you that strength that's why I went to
[678.0s] the second one cuz it it makes more
[680.8s] sense in regards to trusting in God yeah
[684.6s] mhm um for me I'll definitely not go
[688.4s] with the first one that says that work
[691.3s] hard at what you know is right and God
[694.8s] God's will will accompany your efforts
[697.3s] you know what you might think is right
[701.2s] basically somehow might might not be
[703.7s] right you might be thinking that
[705.6s] something is right and while it's
[707.3s] definitely not right so I won't go with
[710.3s] that but I'd rather go with pray fast
[714.0s] and wait for God to guide you in what
[716.2s] you shall you should do cuz you know
[719.3s] it's like we putting God as our
[720.8s] foundation you know so that whatever I'm
[723.4s] doing it might be according to God's
[725.6s] will yeah so that's why i' go with the
[727.6s] second one all right silus what do you
[729.5s] think what would you go with I think uh
[732.5s] I'd go with the second one because
[735.6s] uh God is the principle of what you're
[739.0s] doing yeah all right um yeah I think
[743.4s] also go to the second one you know the
[745.2s] Bible says in Proverbs 3:5 trust in the
[748.0s] Lord with all your heart and lean not on
[750.4s] your own understanding and that negates
[753.1s] the first verse it says you know work
[755.4s] hard at what you what you know is right
[758.2s] not what God says is right and God is
[760.3s] our standard for every single thing that
[761.9s] we're doing so that is it thank for that
[764.4s] Silas um before we proceed just like us
[767.3s] to read from 1 Peter
[770.3s] 1:3 I have it open here you can just
[772.6s] read it 1 Peter chapter 1:3 says
[776.6s] therefore guard up the loins of your
[778.7s] mind
[779.6s] be sober and rest your hope fully upon
[782.2s] the grace that is to be brought to you
[784.5s] at the revelation of Jesus Christ this
[787.8s] practically just tells us we need to
[789.3s] rely on God fully okay I think there was
[792.8s] a lesson we learned a few weeks ago that
[795.6s] should be lesson six about Ezra and
[798.3s] Leadership a true leader relies on God
[801.3s] and what God tells them to do do not
[803.4s] rely on your own understanding all right
[806.3s] so we'll go to our story and brend will
[808.8s] take us through that and our story comes
[810.6s] from the book of Nehemiah chapter 1 so
[813.2s] if you have your Bibles you can just
[814.8s] flip to that if you have the lesson just
[816.4s] go to the into the story Nehemiah
[818.3s] chapter 1 and chapter 2 Brenda will give
[821.2s] us a
[822.1s] summary uh thank you CH Jordan um I'll
[825.2s] just try and make a summary because of
[827.6s] time I don't want to bore you with the
[830.3s] details but um it starts with uh in the
[835.4s] month of Nissan in the 20th year of King
[839.2s] say axis I don't know if that's how you
[841.0s] pronounce it I'm not sure I don't know
[843.5s] Axis or something yeah um and it's
[846.4s] basically dwelling on the topic of how
[848.8s] nemiah was a cup Bearer for a king and
[850.8s] let me give you some backstory a cup
[852.8s] bearer was the person who would taste
[856.3s] all the meals and drinks of the king
[858.1s] before he had them before uh so so that
[861.8s] if it has poison they' be able to know
[864.4s] that the King was trying to be killed
[866.7s] right and in a way this means was
[869.4s] basically the scape goat of death for
[871.1s] the king if that makes sense and um in
[875.5s] this in these times this was a very
[877.1s] honorable job for someone to have in in
[881.2s] the Kingdom right and that means he had
[883.4s] a very comfortable life yeah and when he
[886.8s] heard about the stories of what's going
[889.3s] on back home and how people were were in
[892.7s] distress how the walls were broken down
[895.2s] like there was so much going back he had
[896.8s] never been there but he he was sad for
[899.9s] his people and it showed on his face and
[902.9s] back then it was illegal to go in the
[906.0s] presence of the king with a sad face he
[908.1s] was supposed to be constantly smiling
[910.3s] all the time which honestly I think
[912.2s] would be so hard for me but mhm the king
[916.0s] did not he did not um take that as an
[918.9s] offense because he had known neiah for a
[920.8s] long time and uh he he he asked nayah
[925.3s] what's what's wrong why are you so sad
[926.9s] anded why is your face downcast nemiah
[929.6s] explained to him uh he was very
[932.1s] respectful he was like oh King live
[933.9s] forever this is happening and this is
[936.3s] why I'm sad so he told him about the
[938.3s] situation back in Jerusalem and the King
[941.2s] asked him how long will it take for you
[942.8s] to go and come back and this this
[945.8s] Overjoyed him because before he had told
[948.3s] the king about his problems he had sent
[950.4s] a small prayer to God he had prayed and
[952.5s] even before in our past lesson we
[954.3s] learned about how he prayed about this
[956.7s] specific issue and this was an answered
[959.4s] this was God answering his prayer
[960.9s] through the king and he then let later
[964.3s] on goes and tells the king to give him
[966.8s] letters to the governors of transits so
[969.9s] they they may provide him protection on
[972.0s] his way to Judah and uh he also asked
[975.6s] that he might be given uh letters to
[978.4s] assab The Keeper of the royal Parks so
[980.9s] that he may be given timber for the work
[983.4s] that needed to be done in Jerusalem and
[985.8s] it just goes on on how he asked in
[988.1s] detail on what what he needed from the
[989.9s] King to give him and he then later on
[992.8s] tells us about some men that uh are very
[997.1s] I I don't know how to describe these men
[999.1s] but they are basically uh the people
[1001.5s] what we like to call them
[1003.4s] um delayers of
[1005.6s] progress of progress yes yeah so they're
[1009.3s] called sunbal the horonite and Tob the
[1012.0s] ammonite and their officials they heard
[1015.1s] about what was going on and they had
[1017.6s] someone's coming to promote
[1019.4s] the benefit or the wealth of the
[1020.8s] Israelites and this this made them so
[1023.2s] mad you know these these they haters you
[1025.8s] know they like ah we cannot have these
[1028.4s] guys get get well we don't they didn't
[1031.2s] like the fact that Israel was on a way
[1033.4s] of being healed from the years of Exile
[1036.0s] and torment and he just talks about how
[1039.2s] he went to Jerusalem he was safe on his
[1041.2s] journey because of his request the king
[1043.6s] to get uh protection on the way to
[1047.2s] Jerusalem yeah all right thank you that
[1049.2s] Brenda um I'm actually picking something
[1051.5s] new from this story something I've never
[1053.8s] thought about before the value of
[1056.3s] knowing what exactly you want when you
[1059.0s] go towards your king and our King is God
[1061.5s] know neemi knew exactly in detail I need
[1064.0s] this number I mean this amount of Timber
[1066.3s] I need this type of stones I need this
[1068.3s] and this and this he was very
[1070.8s] specific um Christ told his disciples
[1074.2s] when he was teaching them knock and you
[1075.8s] shall find knock and the door will be
[1077.4s] opened seek and you shall find same
[1079.4s] thing applies to us as Christians you
[1080.8s] know know exactly what you want right
[1083.8s] and then something else I have noted
[1086.4s] Proverbs
[1087.9s] 22:29 it says do you see a man skillful
[1091.2s] in his work he will stand before Kings
[1094.0s] he will not stand before obscure
[1096.9s] men nemiah was very diligent in what he
[1100.0s] did you know being being the king's cap
[1102.9s] be they actually said long leave the
[1105.0s] king and goodbye the cabar you know in
[1107.6s] casee he tasted the wrong food or
[1109.3s] something but it was a very honorable
[1111.4s] job this guy was a slave now you you're
[1115.1s] practically taken from your country
[1116.6s] right now Winston taken to the
[1117.8s] neighboring country to become a slave to
[1119.8s] the king but he was diligent in the work
[1123.0s] he did it's surprising that he says it's
[1126.1s] the first time he was s in front of the
[1128.3s] king first time serving him all those
[1131.4s] years I mean this shows us whatever
[1133.8s] situation you're in just be
[1135.8s] cheerful there there's value in smiling
[1138.4s] a smile is infectious when you smile
[1140.9s] someone else sees you smile they start
[1142.3s] smiling it's like a very obvious thing
[1144.3s] kid kids pick it up very easily right so
[1146.9s] thank you for that Brenda where you can
[1148.3s] just answer a few questions from the out
[1149.7s] of the story section uh yeah so the
[1153.0s] there are few questions that caught my
[1154.3s] eyes in the out of the story section
[1157.2s] that I feel like we really need to
[1158.4s] answer it really would bring out the
[1160.0s] message and the first one I'd like to
[1163.1s] talk to ask is what leadership qualities
[1166.6s] do you see in nemiah and uh Chun you
[1171.0s] talked about something about uh Naya's
[1174.5s] you know the qualities he had could you
[1176.1s] answer this for us leadership um I tie
[1179.9s] that back to the story of the kite and
[1181.5s] the boy right Nehemiah was tied to God
[1184.6s] the same way the kite was tied to the
[1186.4s] young boy's hand and by keeping himself
[1190.0s] connected to God always he drew his
[1192.5s] source of strength and direction when a
[1195.3s] kite is held in your hand you're the one
[1197.0s] who directing weight moves as much as
[1198.5s] the wind is going to blow it you're the
[1200.2s] one who's going to reel it into you or
[1202.6s] let it go further away that is the same
[1204.7s] thing with God when you stay connected
[1206.3s] to God he controls our lives and as a
[1209.0s] leader you need to rely on the ultimate
[1212.4s] leader who is God so that is one of the
[1214.3s] quality portrays always being connected
[1216.4s] to God uh Winston um for me first I'd
[1220.0s] say nemiah was
[1222.6s] bold uh or more like courageous cuz from
[1226.4s] what we see here you know in those days
[1229.3s] approaching the king wasn't something
[1231.4s] very easy cuz even when you see here um
[1235.0s] before neemi presented the the wine that
[1238.3s] the king would drink he would have first
[1240.6s] drunk it first and I feel
[1244.3s] like this shows how bold he was cuz um
[1249.8s] he chose to speak out what was in his
[1252.2s] heart and tell him that you know he
[1256.4s] wanted to go rebuild his you know his
[1258.9s] own country yeah his own his own country
[1261.3s] so I feel like he was courageous and
[1264.4s] that's quite a good quality for a leader
[1267.2s] yeah uh syus do you have a quality you'd
[1270.3s] like to add in I think uh he's among the
[1274.0s] rare we were seeing in the what do you
[1276.2s] think section he has the vision and he
[1279.5s] also does what he
[1282.2s] envisions yeah thank you so much and uh
[1286.0s] there was also a question up here I
[1287.8s] would't go deep into discussion about it
[1290.0s] but uh what we're told about the
[1292.8s] interaction between the king and and Ne
[1295.7s] say guys
[1297.6s] neiah and um how it how uh does the
[1301.8s] interaction between them portray
[1303.8s] relationships between Kings and servants
[1306.2s] and to what to what do you attribute the
[1309.4s] good willll or support support of the
[1311.2s] king and something I just noticed during
[1314.1s] the whole during the whole time I was
[1315.9s] reading in the into the story there were
[1318.7s] was reciprocity between the king and
[1321.2s] nemiah right cuz for the king to not
[1324.8s] even he the king didn't even consider
[1328.1s] you know should I let him go should I he
[1330.0s] said how long he went to say to the how
[1332.3s] long would you need because him and had
[1335.4s] grown a sort of respect you know a sort
[1339.4s] of relationship where they didn't need
[1343.2s] such they didn't have distrust in it
[1345.2s] right and you need you need that with
[1346.7s] your C be cuz this this this the guy
[1348.4s] that that is basically saving your life
[1350.7s] and nemiah was was very respectful very
[1353.6s] respectful and also regarding to what
[1355.7s] jonan said he was cheerful this is the
[1358.6s] first time he was sad which and that
[1360.6s] affects those around you and nemiah
[1362.8s] being cheerful and respectful to the
[1365.8s] king it it had an influence on the king
[1368.4s] and how he responded to nehemiah's
[1371.2s] distress uh one more question I'd just
[1373.3s] like to ask it's very similar to the
[1375.0s] first one but uh what wise step does
[1379.0s] nemiah follow as he undertakes this
[1381.4s] project like during the story we see
[1383.9s] certain things nemiah does in order for
[1386.1s] this project that he's taking up to
[1388.8s] succeed there are certain things if he
[1390.4s] didn't do they would have this story
[1392.6s] wouldn't even be here in the first place
[1394.9s] so what do did you Rie any did you
[1397.4s] notice anything in the story um for me I
[1400.1s] like to answer the first question you
[1401.8s] asked uhuh about the considering the
[1405.0s] interaction between the king and nemiah
[1407.2s] MH how does it portray the relationship
[1410.0s] between Kings and Servants of course
[1412.4s] right now we don't have Kings and
[1413.9s] servants but let's just say um leaders
[1418.1s] and subordinates I feel like um you know
[1422.0s] there should be that first respectful we
[1425.7s] should be like us as subordinates we
[1427.9s] should be respectful to you know our
[1430.3s] leaders and another thing is we should
[1432.6s] be hardw working and from what you said
[1436.0s] um you know when nemiah approached the
[1438.4s] the king he did not hesitate giving him
[1440.6s] the chance to go rebuild his own country
[1443.5s] cuz for me I feel like you know let's
[1447.1s] say I was a king I wouldn't give someone
[1449.8s] a chance someone who let's say always
[1452.0s] messed up and did bad stuff so for
[1455.6s] nemiah to be given this chance I think
[1458.2s] he was always dedicated to whatever he
[1460.9s] used to do and all that yeah yeah thank
[1463.7s] you so much um if there's anyone else um
[1467.0s] there's a question you had asked um
[1469.0s] um you know about uh sorry I think it's
[1472.1s] the same one as Winston actually just
[1473.9s] want to answer that yeah you know um
[1477.3s] when you can be trusted with the little
[1478.8s] work that you're doing it means even a
[1481.4s] greater task that you ask for it will be
[1483.6s] granted to you you know same thing as
[1485.6s] winst has said when you're diligent in
[1487.3s] your work you can be entrusted to do
[1489.6s] more you know the king should favor into
[1491.8s] him yeah Sal had something to say uh I
[1496.6s] think uh from
[1499.0s] if he was not bold as a person nothing
[1502.7s] of none of this would have happened he
[1504.9s] was bold enough to go tell the king that
[1507.9s] he his City where his ancestors lie is
[1512.1s] in Ruins yeah also I think something
[1514.5s] else I've just remembered um Ellen White
[1517.1s] speaks about it in prophets and Kings
[1519.2s] chapter 53 where she says that nemiah
[1521.9s] gauged the king's countenance when he
[1524.6s] was going to take the wine to him he
[1526.7s] took a while aftering the news he stayed
[1529.4s] for a couple of months I think around 4
[1530.8s] months before he actually presented his
[1532.5s] request to the king yeah so he gauged
[1534.9s] how the king's mood was before he went
[1537.7s] and presented their request even us we
[1539.6s] do the same when you want something to
[1541.3s] from your folks you just going to wait
[1543.4s] see uh today they look good in a good
[1545.6s] mood all right good then you go asking
[1547.2s] mom I want this or dad I want this yeah
[1549.3s] same thing neiah did but it's it's very
[1553.0s] comforting to know that we don't have to
[1554.3s] do that with our God you know we don't
[1556.3s] have to gauge God's mood like God today
[1558.4s] sad I'm not going to ask him for
[1559.5s] anything we can go to a god at any
[1561.6s] single time that's the only difference
[1563.1s] we have between you know our Earthly
[1565.5s] leaders and our Heavenly leader amen
[1568.0s] that's so true and in in reference to to
[1572.9s] that and just what um Salas was saying
[1575.8s] about how neiah was bold and all the
[1578.8s] characteristics of basically seen in the
[1580.5s] story of him being a
[1582.3s] leader uh one thing I think that if he
[1585.3s] didn't do this wouldn't have succeeded
[1587.5s] is if he didn't ask for all those
[1589.7s] letters regarding materials and
[1592.4s] protection cuz we already know he had
[1594.0s] enemies of progress waiting for him so
[1596.8s] if he didn't go ahead and ask the king I
[1600.2s] need this and this and this this story
[1603.2s] would have never happened and that's
[1605.4s] that's very important even regarding our
[1607.3s] spiritual life if we don't ask God for
[1610.0s] protection if we don't ask God for
[1611.6s] strength we won't be able to be the
[1614.7s] leaders that he wants us to be or do
[1617.1s] what we need to do in in in this world
[1619.3s] even in delivering his message to other
[1621.2s] people cuz he takes a lot of strength
[1623.2s] needs a lot of courage and we can't do
[1625.3s] that without asking him cuz the devil
[1626.8s] the devil is our enemy of progress and
[1628.7s] he's waiting on us to not ask and just
[1631.6s] dive into the work head fast no
[1634.0s] protection nothing and I feel like this
[1636.4s] is very it's a very important uh quality
[1638.6s] we should all have as Christians amen
[1640.8s] yeah thank you that Brenda um so we'll
[1643.1s] just segue into the flashlight and I'll
[1645.6s] ask Winston to just read that for us um
[1649.0s] the flashlight of today's story says
[1652.0s] Nehemiah holds nehemiah's whole heart
[1655.1s] whole soul was in the Enterprise he had
[1657.7s] undertaken his hope his energy his
[1661.0s] enthusiasm his determination were
[1663.8s] contagious inspiring others with the
[1666.6s] same high courage of lofty purpose each
[1669.7s] each Man became aniah in his turn and
[1673.6s] helped to make stronger the Heart and
[1676.2s] Hand of his neighbor I think from the
[1679.4s] flashlight we see the the weight of our
[1683.2s] emotions the effect it has
[1686.2s] on on the people surrounding us cuz we
[1690.0s] see that um Nehemiah actually influenced
[1694.2s] very many people around him he like
[1696.2s] became a role model to a number of
[1699.2s] people and this is basically because of
[1701.8s] his courage yeah his boldness as we've
[1704.7s] seen in the story and his his lofty
[1707.4s] purpose
[1708.8s] and I think we get something also from
[1711.4s] the Tuesday section where we see that um
[1716.2s] Nehemiah was was willing to risk his
[1719.3s] life for this cause and this there they
[1722.8s] they've actually asked us a question
[1724.4s] that what cause do you believe in so
[1726.8s] much that you might be willing to risk
[1729.1s] your life for it is there something in
[1731.2s] your life that you always say that I'd
[1734.4s] do anything I'd risk anything to do in
[1736.6s] my life so I'd like to leave you as my
[1739.7s] listener with this question is there
[1741.6s] something there that you're willing to
[1744.0s] do anything whatever it takes um just
[1747.5s] like Nehemiah did with his course yeah
[1750.9s] amen thank for that um the greatest
[1753.7s] purpose in our lives you know we we all
[1755.6s] need to have something that drives us
[1758.0s] someone once told me dreams are not what
[1760.6s] you see at night when you're sleeping
[1762.7s] dreams are what wake you up in the
[1764.4s] morning know you you wake up with that
[1766.9s] dream that you're chasing
[1769.1s] and we when you have that one thing
[1771.4s] you're very convicted about that I want
[1773.4s] to see this thing through you will walk
[1776.6s] towards it with all your might and once
[1779.0s] you um place that your request and your
[1782.2s] plans and to the Lord is going to direct
[1783.7s] our paths into it thank you for that
[1785.6s] Winston so I'll ask uh Silas to read for
[1789.0s] us from uh Proverbs chapter 3 verse 5
[1792.7s] and 6 that's uh proy vers 5 and 6 it's
[1796.1s] also in our punch lines as well can just
[1798.1s] follow along so Proverbs 3: 5 and 6 and
[1802.7s] as he's getting
[1804.4s] it um just a question for us to think
[1808.8s] about is there when you just look at the
[1811.8s] punch lines right just look at a verse
[1815.4s] that speaks to Your Heart Right and I
[1818.3s] just encourage you to just try memorize
[1820.1s] it we have about one to about five five
[1822.9s] punchlines and they all relate to our
[1824.8s] lesson today so just pick one punch line
[1828.0s] try to memorize it and let it guide you
[1829.4s] to the coming week so I'll ask say let's
[1831.2s] to read for us Proverbs 3: 5 and
[1834.2s] 6 Proverbs 3: 5 and 6 says trust in the
[1838.7s] Lord with all thine heart and lean not
[1842.0s] unto thy own understanding in all thy
[1845.0s] ways acknowledge Him and He Shall direct
[1848.2s] your path thank you so I'd like to ask
[1851.6s] you silus why do you think um this verse
[1855.2s] you know how how does it speak to your
[1856.8s] heart and your life
[1858.6s] how do you think it applies to your life
[1860.5s] and how can it apply to other people's
[1862.8s] lives that uh in all our ways we should
[1866.5s] acknowledge God and he will direct all
[1869.9s] our paths it's pretty much as for thank
[1873.2s] you for that um so just moving on Sly uh
[1877.2s] we have uh something in the Thursday
[1879.6s] section I'd like to ask Winston again to
[1881.4s] read that for us and there's a verse
[1883.6s] there as well Colossians chapter 1 verse
[1886.0s] 3 and 4 colians 1: 3 and 4 um on the
[1891.0s] thir section
[1893.4s] um as Silas opens Colossians 1 vers
[1898.0s] verse 3 and 4 i' like to read the
[1900.6s] questions that are there uh the first
[1902.7s] one says whom do you know that has seen
[1905.6s] a cause through to a frusion take time
[1910.6s] to write a note of affirmation and
[1913.1s] encouragement to someone in your church
[1915.6s] or Community who has worked to see an
[1919.3s] idea through to reality share with them
[1922.7s] how they are share with them how they
[1925.3s] are like nemiah and what a contribution
[1928.7s] this makes to others and say a prayer
[1932.2s] that the same spirit will grow in you so
[1935.7s] Colossians 3:1 and vers Colossians 1:3
[1939.3s] and 4 yes Colossians 1 vers 3 and 4 he
[1942.6s] says we give thanks to God and the
[1944.9s] father of our Lord Jesus Christ paying
[1948.2s] always praying always for us for you
[1951.0s] sorry since we heard of your faith in
[1955.4s] Jesus Christ and the love which he have
[1957.9s] to all the
[1959.6s] saints amen amen um giving thanks to God
[1965.3s] always I'm praying for you nemiah upon
[1968.6s] hearing the distress that his people
[1970.7s] going through you know the cap is had
[1972.4s] gone back he felt pricked in his heart
[1976.5s] he felt like I need to do do something
[1978.5s] and that is exactly what he
[1981.0s] did great people in this world you know
[1984.8s] theyve always been holding on to
[1987.8s] things either for Christians they hold
[1990.1s] on to God for non-christians they always
[1992.1s] had that belief that was driving them
[1994.7s] okay but as Christians holding on to God
[1997.5s] who we've never seen I'm sure no one in
[2000.2s] this panel has ever seen God face to
[2001.6s] face right or our listeners as well but
[2004.2s] we know he
[2005.9s] exists and God has put in each and every
[2008.9s] one of us a certain drive a certain
[2011.9s] purpose you know a reason why you're
[2014.4s] here on Earth and most of us actually we
[2018.8s] we might be worried we haven't
[2020.0s] discovered it yet you're like when I
[2022.6s] ever know why I'm here on this Earth for
[2025.6s] but the same God who created you is the
[2027.4s] same God who can reveal that to you the
[2029.8s] Lord who reveals secrets and interpret
[2032.0s] dreams for us so just pray to God and
[2034.4s] ask him to show you what is my purpose
[2037.9s] in life what is that thing that's going
[2039.6s] to be driving me God what can I do for
[2042.8s] you okay that is it's a very big and
[2045.4s] powerful prayer and once he shows it to
[2047.3s] you be prepared to just follow it
[2049.6s] through yourself so will Brenda have
[2052.3s] something to say no no okay all right so
[2055.5s] as we wrap up I'd like us to read the
[2058.7s] final verse that is in um let me get it
[2062.3s] Proverbs
[2064.0s] 11:14 as we close up proverbs 11: vers
[2069.0s] 14 get
[2070.8s] it I have it thank you Brenda uh
[2074.4s] Proverbs 11: 14 and it says where there
[2077.5s] is no councel the people fall but in the
[2079.9s] multitude of counselors there is safety
[2083.5s] mhm where there is no councel people
[2086.6s] fail and with a lot of councel there is
[2089.2s] safety so as you reflect on you know
[2092.0s] this nemiah
[2093.6s] story what fears or questions do you
[2096.2s] have about your own abilities that
[2098.0s] inhibit you from following you know your
[2100.5s] dream and from your willingness to take
[2103.0s] risks for for God how do the stories of
[2105.7s] all the Believers who have gone before
[2107.3s] you that took risks cause give you
[2110.6s] courage what would a similar cause in
[2112.8s] your own Journey look like so this is a
[2115.1s] more reflective question that we're
[2116.9s] going to be ending with seeing all these
[2119.5s] people in the Bible who took great risks
[2121.7s] for God I mean the biggest example you
[2124.0s] know is Daniel standing up to the King
[2126.6s] as a Young Man 17 years old and and
[2129.4s] telling them I'm not going to eat your
[2131.1s] food or I'm not going to worship you I'm
[2133.2s] not going to do this and this and this
[2135.9s] that was a big risk he took and God saw
[2138.6s] him through the fire David young man
[2143.3s] very very probably very small but he
[2145.5s] took on a giant because he took the risk
[2149.0s] um there is a uh I'm trying to remember
[2153.7s] the
[2154.4s] quote those who dare win right there's a
[2158.0s] certain military I think it's the
[2160.0s] British military Special
[2161.7s] Forces their main motto is He Who Dares
[2165.1s] wins and God calls us you know I have
[2168.3s] not given you spirit of fear but a
[2169.9s] Spirit of Courage and of sound mind what
[2172.5s] more can we ask for courage God has
[2176.0s] given us the courage to just walk
[2178.0s] through fire walk through Temptations he
[2179.9s] promises I will be there with you if you
[2182.2s] want to do something I will see you
[2184.2s] through it because I have given you the
[2186.2s] courage and I promise you victory
[2188.9s] God says he has good plans for us so I
[2192.4s] just want you to believe in the good
[2194.4s] plans of God as we close I just need to
[2197.7s] get uh any comment you have from our
[2199.8s] panelists as we wrap up um what I'd like
[2203.6s] to say as we close is basically what
[2206.5s] comes out in the one of the punch lines
[2209.1s] Psalms
[2210.3s] 5:8 um it says Lead Me Lord in your
[2214.6s] righteousness because of my enemies make
[2217.7s] your way straight before me um we
[2221.4s] realize that we're currently living in a
[2223.6s] world that there
[2226.0s] always uh they're always um I'd say
[2230.4s] enemies of good um despite Satan being
[2233.7s] one of them um there always people who
[2236.6s] will always be on your back trying to
[2239.5s] make you give up and here we we have a
[2243.7s] privilege where we can invite God to
[2246.2s] walk with us throughout this journey and
[2250.1s] we realize that the company of God is
[2252.6s] basically just energetic and with him we
[2256.2s] get to achieve really much just as we
[2258.5s] see from even the story of Nehemiah
[2261.0s] right yeah thank you Wiston Silas you
[2263.1s] have anything say passing
[2266.4s] short um I'll just this one quote
[2269.4s] underneath a further Insight by Ellen G
[2271.6s] white from prophets and Kings page
[2274.8s] 645 in every crisis his people may
[2278.1s] confidently declare if God be for us who
[2280.8s] can be against us so as we go on reading
[2285.2s] our
[2286.2s] lesson uh reading deeply you know
[2288.8s] studying it more let's let's always
[2291.4s] remember this even in our daily lives
[2293.8s] cuz nemiah had to understand this for
[2296.7s] him to take up the courage and do what
[2299.4s] he needed to do so yeah I think that's
[2302.6s] that's one of the biggest lessons I've
[2303.8s] learned amen so I'll leave you with one
[2306.0s] verse Jeremiah 10911
[2308.1s] for I know the plans I have for you
[2309.9s] declares the Lord plans to give you
[2312.9s] plans to prosper you and not to harm you
[2314.8s] plans to give you hope and a future so
[2318.5s] if your desire is to embrace this plan
[2321.2s] for your life then be willing to receive
[2323.3s] the instruction and the adversity that
[2325.9s] you're going to face in life when you
[2329.4s] accept God's plan for your life so thank
[2331.6s] you so much for sitting with us for this
[2333.3s] lesson I'd like to
[2335.4s] ask um Brenda pray this yeah uh let's
