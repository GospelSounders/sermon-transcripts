mistakes also we read from them and say mm- we should not do what they did did but powerful women indeed so women of note in the Old Testament like I said we've talked about Eve we've gone and we've talked about Sarah we've also talked about uh Rebecca and in this fourth episode we are talking about joked who was joked jocabed was Moses mom the mother of Moses Moses is known in the Bible as God's Prophet God's Prophet God's friend so he had a powerful mother why did we say why do we say that jobed was powerful she was a mother of three leaders three leaders I'm telling you I don't know if my children three leaders I think everyone would know I'll be like excuse me my child he has led the Israelites you know from the desert those stubborn Israelites and I have a daughter named Mam and I have another son named my friend my children are powerful anyway the humility the humility when we are called to service we are called to be to be humble so we want to read Exodus chapter 1 vers 8 Meen please help us uh Exodus 1:8 it says then a new king who did not know Joseph came to power in Egypt look he said to his people the Israelites have become too much numerous for us come we must deal shly with them or they will become even more num numerous and if War breaks out we uh will join our enemies and fight against us and leave the country so Pharaoh there came a pharaoh who did not know Joseph you know Joseph had done many things but we want to learn about Jed here so here we are in trouble as as as the Egyptians they've told themselves and they've said we need to get rid of all these Israelites they're becoming too powerful they're becoming too many they need to die so this is the time where we see Jo Abed powerful woman what does she do now let's let's let um Norah read for us what does chapter 2 um we want to read where she says where we are told how jobed gave birth chapter 2 vers one and a man of the house of Levy mhm went and took as wife a daughter of Levy yes so the woman conceived and bore a son and when she saw that he was a bey beautiful child she hid him 3 months three months but when she could MH but when she could no longer hide him she took an ark of bull rushes for him dobbed it with asphalt and peit put the child in it and laid it in the rids by the Rivers's Bank wow that tells you how meticulous industrious this woman is and organized she's not remember this the the the k a pharaoh who wanted to kill and destroy all Israelite but she did not scream you know some of us women when we in trouble you want to moan scream yell and the whole house is like I thought you were the mother can you fix the problem she did not put her head like this and say we're in trouble she quickly decided to put the things together and here she was hidden for 3 months you can imagine the quietness m and then she took him to the river wow now I know Elizabeth is there anything the women Ministry leadership is doing to help the our daughters in this church or our daughters out here to to know how to make things with their hands like jobed did what are they doing yeah um in the women Ministries Department we encourage uh women to be self-reliant yes to have skills yes and in the course of this year yes uh there is a program to help women to use their talent their skill what can you learn to weave to knead to crochet wow to make even a bed or other things that we can do so welcome aboard uh to women Ministries that's where we learn and we develop each other let's learn how to make things with our hands what Elizabeth is not telling you I think even in October we are going to learn how to do massage wow and it's good to learn it the right way with with professionals so thank you very much so here is Jered industrious able to make a safety you know a a safe heaven for her own child now like we said she's a powerful woman she led three she had three leaders in her home we know Moses led the Israelites Miriam not only LED she also sang and she was taught very well by her mother we're going to learn about Miriam next then we have Aaron who now to took over from from Moses now we we want to learn like we have just explained that this was a cruel cruel decree but jokab did not sit she did not sit and worry she knew that Satan was at work MH but she did not say now that Satan is at work I'm defeated she said what can I do to save my child and she actually got up because she trusted that the Angels were watching and trusted that yes the enemy is real but actually the enemy cannot be more powerful than her God and and she trusted that there's no way she can put her child in the river with crocodiles what kind of faith is that the river has what crocodiles yeah what kind of faith is that courage courage you know and I'm imagining the T she had because she must have told her husband this guy is going to the river yeah I mean I don't know how many men will allow you to just you know pray over your son in the river yeah you know so it's you can imagine she must have had some tact but she trusted and and and Daughters of God tells us she did not just deal she prayed so what kind of prayers do you think Jo Jacob bed was praying she was praying serious prayers remember three months have passed the child has stopped crying well not stop crying but is crying too loudly now really it's time to get out of the house M she now started praying different prayers for the river praying that all the crocodiles will swim away all the by standers will not be there so she did she did well so it's calling us to prayer as as well she decided to save her son by doing what she had to do now that it says here that the sister of Moses immediately came forward to inquire what did she come uh forward to inquire about when the basket was in the river who who got to see the basket the princess the princess Pharaoh's daughter yes remember Pharaoh is the same pharaoh who has pastor but how God works wow his own daughter has God has used his own daughter yeah to save to save mes but you know Miriam had uh been trained Miriam was Moses's sister enough to quickly say cuz she was watching the basket as it moves every day so when the the baby was drawn from the water she quickly said can I get someone to nurse you know a Hebrew woman to nurse the baby she went and got the mother not just any woman the real mother I mean how smart is that that means uh jobed also taught her children well yeah she didn't just say when you reach there just do anything she was doing the right you know she trained Miriam well so when she went there she did not just go there and say I'm now no longer a slave I'm in the palace she went and she was teaching Moses she was teaching him day and night about God the god of Israel because we are told later that Moses actually remembered the lessons of the the mother so we are called to be like chabet amen what would you like to say okay we have something yes we find uh joa bre she was a teacher and her education system or curriculum was God God based exactly and one of the objective of God's uh education is to be a critical thinker and a problem solver that is it yeah and and she understood the assignment very well yes cuz in Saving her son she applied the story of Noah she made an AR that is it isn't it she made an AR yeah and finally you find that this AR talks about salvation the plan that God has always had for mankind amen you see and finally you find that when you read that story the daughter of pharaoh had come to the river to perform a ritual a cleansing ritual isn't it and in there God created an incident where now the basket was there yeah wow powerful I have a question teacher yes don't you think um do you think the the princess the princess yes um could have known that this is one of the yeah a child from from the one of the Hebrew women hid her child here yes just because of the decree that was passed by her father Yes actually she did the Bible says she did the Bible says oh my goodness well not in these words but like you know here is a Hebrew child actually being hidden from the decree you know so she knew but she decided now he's my child M so God used her to protect his own exactly so even sometimes you're in the you're in the deep end even in your office or in school that's why we we pray for favor uh from God and with man but God uses he tells man how to favor you you think man just wakes up and says today I'll favor Grace no it's God who says now go favor it's God who told told uh um fero's daughter pick the child now and bring to your house because he had a grand plan for for Moses yes yeah and I think the story goes so much to show the impact that a mother's influence can have on her children like okay we are not really told much about the kind of woman that jobed was but I think we can derive quite a few things from the story as we have said over here but whatever character she had it was enough to make all three of her kids to be the people that they were exactly so we are called to do to do better as women for our children for the church amen you know if we have a joker bed in the church the church will benefit yes okay yes uh just to resonate what Grace has said this not so much from her end but you can get the impact from her children you see when Moses died the devil wanted his body cuz he knew how much if he he personated Moses it will have cre a great impact isn't it to show that how much Jo CH had really invested in his children bottom line God had plans for Moses God had plans for Aaron God had plans for S Miriam but overall God had planned for the Israelites and they were going to get to the promised land amen and and so what joed did for for the Plan of Salvation was important and we thank God for that so we want to invite our viewers please get the QR code get the book go get the actual copy from the bookstore we have done episode 4 of chapter 2 thank you go back and watch chapter 1 this is really a good book let's enjoy it we look forward to seeing you next week when we'll be learning about Miriam the sister of Moses and we really appreciate your presence God bless you God bless you

[149.4s] powerful anyway the humility the
[151.8s] humility when we are called to service
[153.2s] we are called to be to be humble so we
[156.2s] want to read Exodus chapter 1 vers 8
[158.3s] Meen please help us uh Exodus 1:8 it
[162.0s] says then a new king who did not know
[164.5s] Joseph came to power in Egypt look he
[167.9s] said to his people the Israelites have
[169.9s] become too much numerous for us come we
[174.6s] must deal shly with them or they will
[177.4s] become even more num numerous and if War
[181.4s] breaks out
[184.2s] we uh will join our enemies and fight
[187.4s] against us and leave the country so
[189.5s] Pharaoh there came a pharaoh who did not
[191.6s] know Joseph you know Joseph had done
[193.2s] many things but we want to learn about
[195.6s] Jed here so here we are in trouble as as
[199.4s] as the Egyptians they've told themselves
[201.8s] and they've said we need to get rid of
[203.2s] all these Israelites they're becoming
[204.6s] too powerful they're becoming too many
[206.3s] they need to die so this is the time

[212.2s] does she do now let's let's let um Norah
[216.2s] read for us what does chapter 2 um we
[219.9s] want to read where she says where we are
[222.3s] told how jobed gave birth chapter 2 vers
[225.6s] one and a man of the house of Levy mhm
[230.1s] went and took as wife a daughter of Levy
[233.6s] yes so the woman conceived and bore a
[236.8s] son and when she saw that he was a bey
[239.8s] beautiful child she hid him 3 months
[243.4s] three months but when she could MH but
[246.3s] when she could no longer hide him she
[248.8s] took an ark of bull rushes for him
[252.4s] dobbed it with asphalt and peit put the
[255.9s] child in it and laid it in the rids by
[259.4s] the Rivers's Bank wow that tells you how
[264.7s] meticulous
[266.7s] industrious this woman is and organized
[271.0s] she's not remember this the the the k a
[274.4s] pharaoh who wanted to kill and destroy

[291.9s] we're in trouble she quickly decided to
[294.3s] put the things together and here she was
[296.5s] hidden for 3 months you can imagine the
[298.6s] quietness m and then she took him to the
[301.6s] river wow now I know Elizabeth is there
[304.8s] anything the women Ministry leadership
[307.0s] is doing to help the our daughters in

[360.7s] the right way with with professionals so
[363.2s] thank you very much so here is Jered
[365.0s] industrious able to make a safety you
[368.7s] know a a safe heaven for her own child
[371.8s] now like we said she's a powerful woman
[374.6s] she led three she had three leaders in
[377.7s] her home we know Moses led the
[379.3s] Israelites Miriam not only LED she also
[382.6s] sang and she was taught very well by her
[385.4s] mother we're going to learn about Miriam
[387.0s] next then we have Aaron who now to took
[389.8s] over from from Moses now we we want to
[393.6s] learn like we have just explained that
[395.8s] this was a cruel cruel decree but jokab
[399.0s] did not sit she did not sit and worry
[402.0s] she knew that Satan was at work MH but
[405.3s] she did not say now that Satan is at
[407.2s] work I'm defeated she said what can I do
[410.0s] to save my child and she actually got up
[413.3s] because she trusted that the Angels were
[415.8s] watching and trusted that yes the enemy
[418.8s] is real but actually the enemy cannot be
[420.5s] more powerful than her God and and she
[423.4s] trusted that there's no way she can put
[426.5s] her child in the river with crocodiles
[429.4s] what kind of faith is that the river has
[432.2s] what crocodiles yeah what kind of faith
[435.4s] is that courage
[437.9s] courage you know and I'm imagining the T
[441.0s] she had because she must have told her
[442.3s] husband this guy is going to the river
[446.5s] yeah I mean I don't know how many men
[448.9s] will allow you to just you know pray
[451.6s] over your son in the river yeah you know
[454.2s] so it's you can imagine she must have
[456.3s] had some tact but she trusted and and
[459.2s] and Daughters of God tells us she did
[460.6s] not just deal she prayed so what kind of
[465.2s] prayers do you think Jo Jacob bed was
[467.7s] praying she was praying serious prayers
[470.6s] remember three months have passed the
[473.0s] child has stopped crying well not stop
[475.2s] crying but is crying too loudly now
[477.5s] really it's time to get out of the house
[479.6s] M she now started praying different
[481.8s] prayers for the river praying that all
[484.4s] the crocodiles will swim away all the by
[487.5s] standers will not be there so she did
[489.8s] she did well so it's calling us to
[491.7s] prayer as as well she decided to save
[495.3s] her son by doing what she had to do now
[499.5s] that it says here that the sister of
[501.5s] Moses immediately came forward to
[503.4s] inquire what did she come uh forward to
[505.8s] inquire about when the basket was in the
[509.2s] river
[510.7s] who who got to see the basket the
[512.8s] princess the princess Pharaoh's daughter
[515.4s] yes remember Pharaoh is the same pharaoh
[516.9s] who has
[518.7s] pastor but how God works
[521.7s] wow his own daughter has God has used
[525.8s] his own daughter yeah to save to save
[529.4s] mes but you know Miriam had uh been
[533.5s] trained Miriam was Moses's sister enough
[535.7s] to quickly say cuz she was watching the
[538.5s] basket as it moves every day so when the
[541.3s] the baby was drawn from the water she
[543.6s] quickly said can I get someone to nurse
[546.8s] you know a Hebrew woman to nurse the
[548.6s] baby she went and got the mother not
[550.9s] just any woman the real
[553.0s] mother I mean how smart is that that
[555.4s] means uh jobed also taught her children
[558.3s] well yeah she didn't just say when you
[560.5s] reach there just do anything she was
[562.3s] doing the right you know she trained
[564.6s] Miriam well so when she went there she
[568.0s] did not just go there and say
[570.4s] I'm now no longer a slave I'm in the
[572.8s] palace she went and she was teaching
[576.2s] Moses she was teaching him day and night
[579.3s] about God the god of Israel because we
[582.7s] are told later that Moses actually
[584.9s] remembered the lessons of the the mother
[588.3s] so we are called to be like chabet amen
[593.2s] what would you like to say okay we have
[595.3s] something yes we find uh joa bre she was
[599.0s] a teacher
[600.1s] and her education system or curriculum
[602.8s] was God God based exactly and one of the
[606.8s] objective of God's uh education is to be
[610.5s] a critical thinker and a problem solver
[613.2s] that is it yeah
[615.6s] and and she understood the assignment
[618.1s] very well yes cuz in Saving her son she
[622.0s] applied the story of Noah she made an AR
[625.2s] that is it isn't it she made an AR yeah
[628.1s] and finally you find that this AR talks
[629.9s] about salvation the plan that God has
[631.8s] always had for mankind amen you see and
[634.4s] finally you find that when you read that
[635.9s] story the daughter of pharaoh had come
[638.0s] to the river to perform a ritual a
[640.2s] cleansing ritual isn't it and in there
[643.3s] God created an incident where now the
[646.2s] basket was there yeah wow powerful I
[649.2s] have a question teacher yes don't you
[652.2s] think
[654.2s] um do you think the the princess the
[657.6s] princess yes
[660.0s] um could have known that this
[664.4s] is one of the yeah a child
[668.7s] from from the one of the Hebrew women
[671.8s] hid her child here yes just because of
[674.8s] the decree that was passed by her father
[677.8s] Yes actually she did the Bible says she
[680.0s] did the Bible says oh my goodness well
[683.0s] not in these words but like you know
[685.5s] here is a Hebrew child actually being
[687.2s] hidden from the decree you know so she
[691.4s] knew but she decided now he's my child M
[694.8s] so God used her to protect his own
[698.2s] exactly so even sometimes you're in the
[700.3s] you're in the deep end even in your
[702.0s] office or in school that's why we we
[704.7s] pray for favor uh from God and with man
[709.4s] but God uses he tells man how to favor
[712.0s] you you think man just wakes up and says
[713.6s] today I'll favor Grace no it's God who
[716.3s] says now go favor it's God who told told
[719.7s] uh um fero's daughter pick the child now
[723.5s] and bring to your house because he had a
[725.7s] grand plan for for Moses yes yeah and I
[729.4s] think the story goes so much to show the
[732.2s] impact that a mother's influence can
[735.2s] have on her
[736.2s] children like okay we are not really
[738.5s] told much about the kind of woman that
[740.6s] jobed was but I think we can derive
[742.8s] quite a few things from the story as we
[744.4s] have said over here but whatever
[747.0s] character she had it was enough to make
[749.2s] all three of her kids to be the people
[751.2s] that they were exactly so we are called
[754.1s] to do to do better as women for our
[756.6s] children for the church amen you know if
[759.3s] we have a joker bed in the church the
[761.7s] church will benefit yes okay yes uh just
[765.4s] to resonate what Grace has said this not
[768.0s] so much from her end but you can get the
[770.9s] impact from her children you see when
[773.2s] Moses died the devil wanted his body cuz
[776.0s] he knew how much if he he personated
[779.3s] Moses it will have cre a great impact
[782.3s] isn't it to show that how much Jo CH had
[785.5s] really invested in his children bottom
[788.7s] line God had plans for Moses God had
[792.2s] plans for Aaron God had plans for S
[795.5s] Miriam but overall God had planned for
[798.5s] the Israelites and they were going to
[800.1s] get to the promised land amen and and so
[802.2s] what joed did for for the Plan of
[804.8s] Salvation was important and we thank God
[807.4s] for that so we want to invite our
[809.5s] viewers please get the QR code get the
[813.3s] book go get the actual copy from the
