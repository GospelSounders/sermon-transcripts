FULL TRANSCRIPT:
good morning good afternoon good evening from wherever you're watching us from kibun Sana to our episode uh our our third episode for the daughters of God and uh this uh time we are going to read about the story of Rebecca and uh before we delve into the the story of Rebecca I'm here with beautiful ladies who are the daughters of God who are joining me today to discuss uh the story of Rebecca and I'd like them to introduce themselves hi everyone Ruby from the Youth Department hi ad from Deon Department hello Elizabeth women Ministries Department hi Grace from the youth choir good good evening good morning uh everyone even good night to some of you we want to welcome you um my name is Nora from the publishing Ministries Department Mara my name is Joan from interest coordination amen and I'm aen from the pal department and uh we are reading the book Daughters of God you can get this book from your favorite bookstore or you can also scan the QR code that is running on your screen and I want to welcome you once again as we look into the story of Rebecca we we in chapter one we looked at what the book is all about and we have also looked at the story of Eve and uh the story of Sarah you can always go back and uh uh watch these episodes so that we can move together so um the story of Rebecca comes from the is in the Book of Genesis chapter 24 and uh maybe I can ask Elizabeth what do you say about the story of Rebecca who was she thank you aen so um just a little story about Rebecca is that um after the death of Sarah in Genesis 23 Abraham decided it was time for his son Isaac MH to find a wife and uh not wanting Isaac to marry a local Canaanite who did not know God M um he sent his most trusted servant uh to Abraham's Homeland remember he had uh gone to another land so he sent his servant to go to his homeland to look for a wife for his son I I I I how many parents nowadays do such you know uh asking their their relatives to look for a wife for their son yeah so um we see that um Abraham wanted to to maintain um that relationship with God he didn't want to have a the the son to marry somebody who is an idolator where because where they were staying current at that particular moment in time there there was so much idolatry going on and if he if they could have gotten a wife for for Isaac where they were chances are that they could have gotten a woman who was not after the heart of God and uh we see that in his wisdom he sent out um his servant to go and look for a wife for for his son Joan um do you think that uh parents nowadays would would uh really do something like that to go send their relatives or someone one that you know my son is in that age of getting married and I I want you to to to to help me look I think the parents are Keen um but the children might not be as Keen so and but some children and some cultures honestly really take it up and their children are obedient to say you're wise you help me do it because if you see how um the servant went and how he prayed specific prayers yes when I reach there this lady who is going to come back home with me to be with Isaac should be able to you know get me uh water to drink should be able to in you know be hospitable should be able to even even up to the part where she was from the home you know of H of Abraham's uh uh Homeland Homeland you know how God basically just to convince the parents you know our mothers our fathers that you can actually pray specific prayers yes and God will answer as specific as you pray MH for your child's husband or your child's wife sometimes you feel ah really God these things it is matters of the heart but God is the one who knows the matters of the heart so we should seek Him and actually trust that when we pray he answers like he did for Abraham we also see that I agree with Joan sorry elen I agree with Joan there that um yes our children may not agree but I as a mother to grownup kids would wish if they would let me do it but I know they will not agree so we let them but as um a parent I think our role will be to pray with them and I know that uh I've seen actually some parents uh whose prayer has turned around the situation sometimes uh this could not have been the best companion for their child and through serious um prayers uh the situation turns around yeah so we may not really choose for them but we can influence them through our prayers amen because we also see that uh before Abraham sent out the servant he he had assured the the servant that God will lead him and God will will will direct the servant to to the right person to to the right lady and we see that uh even um the this uh servant when he was traveling when he was there he honestly prayed to God for direction in choosing a wife for for for for for Isaac and he gave the specifics you know like the way Joan has said that he gave the specifics that uh this lady will come uh will give me water we'll also uh give water to to my camel you know there was a specific line and uh when uh when Rebecca showed up uh when he asked for water she did that she she she gave him water then uh she even offered to to to draw water for all his camels and I can imagine there were several of them yeah so drink so that's really hospitable yeah very much so so uh she she did that and uh remember that um the servant went ahead and uh when when when when all these things were being um revealed and like God is answering the prayers before his eyes he he has brought this woman so uh he gave um he he he gave her a a Bangles or bracelets and a and a nose ring and also uh asked her where do you come from who are you and uh she she introduced herself and the the the guy realized like oh this lady comes from my Master's Clan you know so how how how gracious is our God you know when you when you pray he answers and uh the the same thing I would say that uh for for those who are looking for spouses yeah uh you can always pray you ask God that um I want I'm I'm I'm I want to get married if it is your desire if it is God's desire that I get married then uh please um guide me to the right person Yeah because sometimes our desires might not be God's desires but we also our will or rather our desires must be uh in alignment to God's will God's will so uh even as young people I would like to encourage you that when uh you feel when when you get to the age that you want to get married kindly go before the Lord and uh and ask him if it is his will that I get married kindly bring the the right person along and give the specifics but we we don't need to give ridiculous um specifics yeah we don't need to to to to give demands that are quite impossible but we our hearts first must be in line with God we must have that relationship with God we saw Abraham had a relationship with God and he walked with with God the servant as well had a relationship with God yeah so even us as individuals we need to have a relationship with God um I don't know if it'll be you want to add something yes uh on the part of the idolatry that was present in the Canan area I feel that in this day and age apart from the man-made Gods we have other gods that we may intentionally or unintentionally be serving so even when we are looking for spouses or even the people we hang around we should know that we have an influence over them and they have an influence over us so as much as we may say you know I'll just get married to her but or him but I'll convert them that may not necessarily be what will happen so we should be very cautious because we are influencers in our own way whether we know it or not yeah I like the way she was hospitable she invited him after all that water she's like now come to the house and it was just I mean it's really how many of us meet people on the road help them help them then even invite them you know now we are so scared so many things but even after she did that she had to get consent from her family you know sometimes as young people we are not interested in what our our parents say or our family members even an auntie can say I don't like that young man you're like uh-uh he's the man I have chosen to marry so even just getting the consent was really really nice and of course towards the end we are also told how when she saw her her master now her husband you know she got off the horse C covered her face ah that there's beauty in all that not revealing herself just like that immediately and then of course at the end we are told she conforted yeah that's that's just beautiful as well yes yeah um sorry what I wanted to also add here uh in Genesis 24:16 M it tells us that no man had known her yes meaning that she was a virgin she was and it calls for um our young people to be pure to keep themselves pure because when you when you keep yourself pure yourself pure it means you're you're you're actually um um you're actually following God's commandment but by not uh being uh drawn into forication yeah or defilement and then the other thing that comes out with um Rebecca's character is that while she was waiting because she was of age while she was waiting she was busy serving at home she was busy doing chores at home some of us our daughters are waiting without doing any chores so how are you focusing your energies as a young person how how are you trying to help as you wait I know our young people most of them are engaged by maybe some are employed some are still studying uh but while you are not doing that how are you engaging yourself as you wait so uh thank you so much and that is all from our discussion uh for for the story of Rebecca so as we continue to serve God as we continue to look for the right people in our lives kindly let let us prayerfully do so and let us also continue um to ask God for for guidance as we end I'd like uh morine to pray for us okay let's believe and pray our heavenly father marriage is yours and you always want us to be happy in this institution oh Lord father for us younger sisters who have not gotten their spouses Lord we pray that you guide them you be with them oh Lord and for those that are already in marriage oh Lord we pray that the joy that Rebecca brought Isaac be theirs oh Lord and bless every family bless everyone oh Lord and thank you for this this is our ask in Jesus name amen amen thank you so much for tuning in we we look forward to seeing you in the next uh episode have a blessed time amen amen

[78.8s] welcome you once again as we look into
[81.8s] the story of Rebecca we we in chapter
[85.3s] one we looked at what the book is all
[87.6s] about and we have also looked at the
[89.4s] story of Eve and uh the story of Sarah
[91.9s] you can always go back and uh uh watch
[95.4s] these episodes so that we can move
[97.6s] together so um the story of Rebecca
[100.5s] comes from the is in the Book of Genesis
[103.1s] chapter
[104.0s] 24 and uh maybe I can ask Elizabeth what
[108.6s] do you say about the story of Rebecca
[111.1s] who was she thank you aen so um just a
[114.4s] little story about Rebecca is that um
[116.9s] after the death of Sarah in Genesis 23
[120.0s] Abraham decided it was time for his son
[122.5s] Isaac MH to find a wife and uh not
[127.3s] wanting Isaac to marry a local Canaanite
[130.0s] who did not know God M um he sent his
[134.0s] most trusted
[135.3s] servant uh to Abraham's Homeland
[138.0s] remember he had uh gone to another land
[141.8s] so he sent his servant to go to his
[144.5s] homeland to look for a wife for his
[148.0s] son I I I I how many parents nowadays do
[152.6s] such you know uh asking their their
[154.8s] relatives to look for a wife for their
[157.0s] son yeah so um we see that um Abraham
[162.4s] wanted to to maintain um that
[165.9s] relationship with God he didn't want to
[168.4s] have a the the son to marry somebody who
[171.6s] is an idolator where because where they
[174.4s] were staying current at that particular
[176.5s] moment in time there there was so much
[178.7s] idolatry going on and if he if they
[181.5s] could have gotten a wife for for Isaac
[184.8s] where they were chances are that they
[187.2s] could have gotten a woman who was not
[189.5s] after the heart of God and uh we see
[192.3s] that in his wisdom he sent out um his
[195.4s] servant to go and look for a wife for
[198.7s] for his son Joan um do you think that uh
[203.4s] parents nowadays would would uh really
[206.2s] do something like that to go send their
[208.7s] relatives or someone one that you know
[211.7s] my son is in that age of getting married
[214.8s] and I I want you to to to to help me
[216.9s] look I think the parents are Keen um but
[220.2s] the children might not be as Keen
[223.6s] so and but some children and some
[225.9s] cultures honestly really take it up and
[228.2s] their children are obedient to say
[230.0s] you're wise you help me do it because if
[232.5s] you see how um the servant went and how
[236.9s] he prayed specific prayers yes when I
[240.1s] reach there this lady who is going to
[242.6s] come back home with me to be with Isaac
[245.1s] should be able to you know get me uh
[249.4s] water to drink should be able to in you
[252.0s] know be hospitable should be able to
[254.6s] even even up to the part where she was
[256.9s] from the home you know of H of Abraham's
[261.1s] uh uh Homeland Homeland you know how God
[265.2s] basically just to convince the parents
[267.0s] you know our mothers our fathers that
[269.7s] you can actually pray specific prayers
[272.3s] yes and God will answer as specific as
[274.9s] you pray MH for your child's husband or
[277.7s] your child's wife sometimes you feel ah
[280.9s] really God these things it is matters of
[282.9s] the heart but God is the one who knows
[284.6s] the matters of the heart so we should
[286.6s] seek Him and actually trust that when we
[289.4s] pray he answers like he did for Abraham
[292.8s] we also see that I agree with Joan sorry
[295.7s] elen I agree with Joan there that um yes
[299.2s] our children may not agree but I as a
[303.1s] mother to grownup kids would wish if
[307.3s] they would let me do it but I know they
[309.2s] will not agree so we let them but as um
[312.8s] a parent I think our role will be to
[315.4s] pray with them and I know that uh I've
[319.7s] seen actually some parents uh whose
[323.4s] prayer has turned around the situation
[326.2s] sometimes uh this could not have been
[328.2s] the best companion for their child and
[331.0s] through serious um prayers uh the
[335.1s] situation turns around yeah so we may
[338.0s] not really choose for them but we can
[340.5s] influence them through our prayers amen
[343.6s] because we also see that uh before
[345.7s] Abraham sent out the servant he he had
[348.6s] assured the the servant that God will
[350.9s] lead him and God will will will direct
[353.2s] the servant to to the right person to to
[356.0s] the right lady and we see that uh even
[359.0s] um the
[360.6s] this uh servant when he was traveling
[363.3s] when he was there he honestly prayed to
[365.7s] God for direction in choosing a wife for
[368.6s] for for for for Isaac and he gave the
[372.1s] specifics you know like the way Joan has
[375.0s] said that he gave the specifics that uh
[377.5s] this lady will come uh will give me
[379.9s] water we'll also uh give water to to my
[382.5s] camel you know there was a specific line
[386.5s] and uh when uh when Rebecca showed up uh
[390.2s] when he asked for water she did that she
[393.6s] she she gave him water then uh she even
[396.7s] offered to to to draw water for all his
[400.2s] camels and I can imagine there were
[401.8s] several of them yeah so drink so that's
[405.7s] really hospitable yeah very much so so
[409.2s] uh she she did that and uh remember that
[412.6s] um the servant went ahead and uh when
[415.3s] when when when all these things were
[417.0s] being um revealed and like God is
[420.2s] answering the prayers before his eyes he
[423.2s] he has brought this woman so uh he gave
[426.4s] um he he he gave her a a Bangles or
[430.6s] bracelets and a and a nose ring and also
[434.4s] uh asked her where do you come from who
[437.5s] are you and uh she she introduced
[439.8s] herself and the the the guy realized
[442.8s] like
[443.7s] oh this lady comes from my Master's Clan
[447.7s] you know so how how how gracious is our
[450.4s] God you know when you when you pray he
[452.6s] answers and uh the the same thing I
[454.7s] would say that uh for for those who are
[457.7s] looking for spouses yeah uh you can
[460.6s] always pray you ask God that um I want
[464.8s] I'm I'm I'm I want to get married if it
[467.2s] is your desire if it is God's desire
[469.9s] that I get married then uh please um
[474.3s] guide me to the right person Yeah
[476.7s] because sometimes our desires might not
[480.0s] be God's desires but we also our will or
[482.9s] rather our desires must be uh in
[485.5s] alignment to God's will God's will so uh
[488.2s] even as young people I would like to
[489.8s] encourage you that when uh you feel when
[492.6s] when you get to the age that you want to
[494.4s] get married kindly go before the Lord
[497.6s] and uh and ask him if it is his will
[501.8s] that I get married kindly bring the the
[504.6s] right person along and give the
[506.3s] specifics but we we don't need to give
[508.9s] ridiculous
[510.2s] um specifics
[513.3s] yeah we don't need to to to to give
[515.8s] demands that are quite impossible but we
[518.8s] our hearts first must be in line with
[521.4s] God we must have that relationship with
[523.3s] God we saw Abraham had a relationship
[525.5s] with God and he walked with with God the
[528.0s] servant as well had a relationship with
[530.3s] God yeah so even us as individuals we
[532.9s] need to have a relationship with God um
[536.2s] I don't know if it'll be you want to add
[538.0s] something yes uh on the part of the
[541.5s] idolatry that was present in the Canan
[544.9s] area I feel that in this day and age
[547.9s] apart from the man-made Gods we have
[551.0s] other gods that we may intentionally or
[554.9s] unintentionally be serving so even when
[557.4s] we are looking for spouses or even the
[560.5s] people we hang around we should know
[562.9s] that we have an influence over them and
[565.2s] they have an influence over us so as
[567.0s] much as we may say you know I'll just
[569.5s] get married to her but or him but I'll
[571.9s] convert them that may not necessarily be
[575.1s] what will happen so we should be very
[577.4s] cautious because we are influencers in
[580.7s] our own way whether we know it or not
[583.6s] yeah I like the way she was hospitable
[586.6s] she invited him after all that water
[589.7s] she's like now come to the house and it
[592.1s] was just I mean it's really how many of
[593.9s] us meet people on the road help them
[595.6s] help them then even invite them you know
[597.6s] now we are so scared so many things but
[600.5s] even after she did that she had to get
[604.2s] consent from her
[605.8s] family you know sometimes as young
[608.0s] people we are not interested in what our
[611.2s] our parents say or our family members
[612.7s] even an auntie can say I don't like that
[615.4s] young man you're like uh-uh he's the man
[617.9s] I have chosen to marry so even just
[619.8s] getting the consent was really really
[621.8s] nice and of course towards the end we
[624.0s] are also told how when she saw her her
[628.0s] master now her husband
[629.9s] you know she got off the horse
[634.2s] C covered her face ah that there's
[638.2s] beauty in all that not revealing herself
[640.5s] just like that immediately and then of
[642.8s] course at the end we are told she
[644.6s] conforted yeah that's that's just
[647.8s] beautiful as well yes yeah um sorry what
[652.2s] I wanted to also add here uh in Genesis
[656.7s] 24:16 M it tells us that no man had
[660.3s] known her yes meaning that she was a
[663.3s] virgin she was and it calls for um our
[667.1s] young people to be pure to keep
[669.6s] themselves pure because when you when
[673.1s] you keep yourself pure yourself pure it
[675.3s] means you're you're you're actually
[678.7s] um um you're actually following God's
[682.4s] commandment but by not uh being uh drawn
[686.6s] into forication yeah or defilement
[690.2s] and then the other thing that comes out
[692.1s] with
[693.2s] um Rebecca's character is that while she
[696.6s] was waiting because she was of age while
[700.2s] she was waiting she was busy serving at
[703.2s] home she was busy doing chores at
[707.3s] home some of us our daughters are
[710.6s] waiting without doing any chores so how
[713.6s] are you focusing your energies as a
[715.3s] young person how how are you trying to
[718.2s] help as you wait I know our young people
[722.0s] most of them are engaged by maybe some
[725.0s] are employed some are still studying uh
[728.4s] but while you are not doing that how are
[730.6s] you engaging yourself as you
[733.8s] wait so uh thank you so much and that is
[738.3s] all from our discussion uh for for the
[741.3s] story of Rebecca so as we continue to
[743.6s] serve God as we continue to look for the
[745.8s] right people in our lives kindly let let
[748.1s] us prayerfully do so and let us also
[751.2s] continue um to ask God for for guidance
[755.2s] as we end I'd like uh morine to pray for
[757.9s] us okay let's believe and pray our
[760.6s] heavenly father marriage is yours and
[763.6s] you always want us to be happy in this
[765.5s] institution oh Lord father for us
[768.7s] younger sisters who have not gotten
[770.4s] their spouses Lord we pray that you
[772.6s] guide them you be with them oh Lord and
[775.3s] for those that are already in marriage
[776.8s] oh Lord we pray that the joy that
[780.2s] Rebecca brought Isaac be theirs oh Lord
[783.3s] and bless every family bless everyone oh
[786.4s] Lord and thank you for this this is our
[788.8s] ask in Jesus name amen amen thank you so

[794.8s] seeing you in the next uh episode have a
[798.2s] blessed time amen amen
