FULL TRANSCRIPT:
Praise the Lord. Amen. Thank you our church choir for that good number. And I want to thank the church elders and the pastors for welcoming me to their pullpit. Our missionary purpose. Luke 11 verse 29. As the clowns increased, Jesus said, "This is a wicked generation. It hurts for a sign, but none will be given it except one, the sign of Jonah." Let us pray. We thank you Lord and our father for a ch a second chance as you gave to Jonah that you are willing to give us for the many and great assignments that you have given us and we pray that Lord we will all akin to the assignment of the great commission that is ours. We pray in Jesus name. Amen. Today most of the television is overflowing with prison prison crimes and dramatic witness. It is either child abuse, mass killings, terrorism, anarchy, pornography, ruthless dictatorship. It's all what what you see. corruption, hatred, violence, you can name them church members. Suppose one morning God appeared to you directly and told you to take the good news of salvation to the worst of the offenders that you see in the television. How could you react? How could you respond if God asked you to meet one of the offenders that you regularly see in television? The book of Jonah is set up in such a scenario. Ninev city which is the capital of Assyria was a cruel city so cruel a city it was I'll come to that now this book of Jonah is much more than talking of a story of a man and a huge fish. It is a book telling of a story of a prophet in the person of Jonah. And the book rather than centering on the prophecies of Jonah as a prophet, it is centers on the behavior and the conduct of the prophet. It is important for you to note that as I continue. However, this book also is a story of a profound illustration of God's mercy and God's grace. This is so because no one needed God's favor than the Nvites than the Assyrians. Jonah is an ordained prophet of God and he knew all this. He is much aware and he knew that God would forgive. God could bless the Ninevites if they repented, if they turned from their sins and worshiped the living God. He knew the power of God's message. Surely as a prophet and a preacher whether he underestimated himself I am very sure Jonah really knew that the people in Ninev were the whole or a few following his preaching a few or whole would be converted but Jonah and as we read the book of Jonah you get this word but Jonah Jonah did not want any conversions in this city. He may have feared this cruel city of Assyria knowing that he could me be mistreated or be killed in this city. Now, here are the opening ones of the book of Jonah. And I want to invite you to Jonah chapter 1 verse one to verse 4. Just those few verses. And I want to read this morning. The word of the Lord came to Jonah son of Amiti. And I want to qualify this here that Jonah is real. Jonah is a man you can touch. [Music] is a human being. There is nothing whatsoever allegorical about the person of Jonah. He is an historical figure. Verse two. And those who have the King James version, you have the right translation in the King James version. Verse two, when the word when Jesus met Jonah, this is what he said. go to the great city of Nineveh and cry, preach. But the right word used there, Jonah was to cry against the city because his wickedness and come up before me. Jonah did not dream. Brothers and sisters, it is the Lord who met him directly. It was not a dream. It was not a vision. Verse three, but Jonah ran away from the Lord and headed to Tashis. He went down to Jopa where he b he found a ship board to Tashis where then after paying for the fair he went aboard and sailed to Tashis to free from the Lord. Verse four and you know the story anyway. Then the Lord sent a great wind on the sea, and such a violent storm arose that the ship threatened to break up throughout the Old Testament. As you read the Old Testament, Genesis to Malachi, this is the only case, this is the only record we have in which an Old Testament prophet is directly sent to the Gentiles. There's no other book that you get a prophet sent directly to the Gentiles. Therefore, this book points so clearly to everybody reading the book of Jonah that God included the Gentiles as well in his plan of salvation. Everybody is included in the plan of salvation. And so the book of Jonah reveals the universal divine mercy without favoritism either for Jews or Gentiles. That is what you get as you open the pages in the book of Jonah. Jonah is only a tool that God used to proclaim his message to all the nations. you too today. God must use you. God is looking for a Jonah in our ministry. He's searching for that Jonah. Would that be Marud or you? God wants to awaken a Jonah in a congregation to send him or her to the nations, to send him to Somaria, to send him to South Sudan, to send him to Congo. Let's get back to the book of Jonah. Jonah was reluctant given the mission he found distestful to him. You know friends what I am saying here is that we want you to board and go to South Sudan to preach. Marundu, we want to send you to Somaria and we want to send you to Congo. Now, when Jesus personally met Jonah, not only did Jonah find it distasteful, but he ran away. He decided to run away. He did not run away from the command of God. No, he ran from the presence of the Lord. He did not want to associate with the Lord and he even questioned the wisdom of such an assignment. If you were to be asked to go to South Sudan where they are fighting today, you may want to question such an assignment. Let me take you to the pen of inspiration. What sister White has written in the book of Patriots and Prophets. No, no, sorry. Patriots and Kings. Patriots and Kings. And I want to read about Jonah. It says like this. As the pro as the prophet thought of the difficulties and the seeming impossibilities of this mission, he was tempted to question the wisdom of the call. From a human viewpoint, it seemed as if nothing could be gained by proclaiming such message to that proud city. He forgot for the moment that the God whom he served was all wise. The God whom he served was all powerful. While he has stated, I want you to mark what prophet and king is saying, Patus and king is saying while he has stated still doubting Satan the devil overwhelmed the prophet with discouragement, the prophet was sieged with a great dread and he rose up to flee unto Tashis. In the charge given him, Jonah had been entrusted with a heavy responsibility. Yet he who unbidden him to go was able to sustain a servant and grant him success. And the prophet obeyed unquestioningly. He would have been spared the many bitter experiences and would have been blessed abundantly. Yet in the heart of Jonah's despair, praise the Lord, the Lord did not desert him. Through a series of trial and strange providences, the prophet's confidence in God and in his infinite power to save was revived. And I want to say this morning that we too stand in the foot of Jonah. And we must not fear in our mission assignments. For we shall be strengthened whenever we undertake mission. But you need to take the initiative. But Jonah, he chose to run away from God rather than to obey him. Now like Jonah, this is how we behave as Christians. My viewers this morning, if you are a Christian, that is exactly how we behave in our Christian journey when we do not want to do what God has commissioned us to do. It's not different. And there today too there are many Nvites that must be reached by you and I. And sometimes we find ourselves wanting to run away. We even give excuses or reasons and want to hide from the assignment. And we hope to escape. We exactly behave like Jonah. I exactly behave like Jonah and would want to escape from God's assignment as Jonah did. But I want to ask this question. Is it possible who will preach to the Ninevites of our day? Who will preach in South Sudan? Who will preach in Somaria? Who will preach in Congo? Now let's get back to Jonah. Jonah is running from the presence of the Lord, not from the command. He is running away from the presence of the Lord, not from the ones that he received. He is not able to face Jesus. And I I will qualify. He's not able and he does not want to face the world. nor take his directives and so he decides to run away. But will Jonah really manage? Will we manage? I am reminded of the African proverb that goes like this. There is nowhere on earth where the weed does not blow. And I want to remind you too that our God is om present. Go to the waters. Go to the skies. He's there. God told Jonah to preach in Nineve, the capital of Assyria. And as you read how Ninev was cruel, you may not capture it. Grabs it all from the book of Jonah. Furthermore, the book of Jonah is only 48 verses. You just need one sitting to read through the 48 verses for the entire book of Jonah. And I want to say you can see that throughout the book as you scan through you don't get much to know about the wickedness of Nineveh. You gather it all about the wickedness of Nineveh from the book of N. And I want to take you to a few verses. If you are writing you can write them to read at home. N says that Nineveh was guilt of four things and I want to name them. One Nap 1 verse 9 evil plots against God. That's what Naom says about Nineveh. Two Ninev was guilt for exploitation of the hopeless. Now chapter 2:12 then she also expounds about the cruity number three the quality of the city their quality in war that is in Nap 2 verse 12 and 13. Now let me explain how well they were. If you they captured you they could not just shoot you. They could either cut one finger at a time, but they like also skinninging people when you are alive. They remove your skin and they leave you to die as you breed. Just imagine the way you go to the butcher and you see the skin of a cow or so. They remove your skin if you are a captive. That's how well the Assyrians were. Number four, N will explain in N chapter 3 verse 4, idolatry, prostitution and witchcraft. My question is this, is our world any better today from the guilt of Nineve or Assyria? Aren't these vices allowed us? Now, for those reading from the King James version, God told Jonah to go to Ninev and cry. Go to Kericho. And when you get to Kericho, you begin by saying, you begin by crying. Are you there my church on that you go to Kajando but the moment you get there you begin by crying. That is how Jonah was instructed. I want to interpret the crying here. Lift up your voice Jonah. They did not have the microphone those days. But he was to lift up his voice. Why? Lift up his voice so that all in Nineve might hear and to declare. That the people would receive mercy and forgiveness if they repented. Now, while the message from God to Ninev is good of repentance, that's a gospel. This book also shows a person of Jonah entertaining misgivings and perpacities to what God has him to do in Nineveh. For Jonah, the very thought of going to Nineveh, to this metropolis city of the time, and the difficulties and the seeming impossibilities of the task made him to shrink from undertaking the divine missionary purpose. Dear friends, what is it that has prevented you and myself from accomplishing the great commission as a signed? That's a question I want you to answer inwardly. What is it? If we want our Lord Jesus Christ to come, we must work. While it is there, Jonah sank into discouragement and despair. But why? One, he knew the loving kindness of God. Jonah knew the longsuffering of God. And he was particularly afraid that if he went to Nineveh and preached the divine message to the Ninevites and this heathen city accepted the message, the doom, get me right, the doom that God pronounced upon them then could not pass could not come to pass and Jonah could not endure that. Jonah could not take that because the last thing Jonah wanted was salvation for the Ninevites because they were great enemies for the Israelites. Ninevites, Assyrians. No, no, that is Jonah reasoning. And so he takes a different route for Jonah. He had the belief, he has the belief that Jews or the chosen people, Israel, were the only ones entitled to receive God's mercy. I want to say God's mercy is not only for Adventists. It's not only for the Catholics. It is for all of us, the Hindus and the Muslims. So Jonah is running away from his assignment and he ended up spending three nights, three days. Let me qualify. Three days in the bury of a great fish. But when Jonah got out, he preached God's message and saw the city repent. Now, let me get back to the verse that we read, church members, and I want you to mark this. God and asked Jonah to preach repentance to the Gentiles, to the non-Jews. And so in Luke 11 29, Jesus was affirming Jonah's message. Remember our key verse this morning. Jesus is saying that salvation that he has come to offer is not only for Jews but for all people on earth. That is the point the Lord is stressing here. Therefore, Jesus personally came and met Jonah and using the sign of Jonah who was now inside a huge fish for 3 days, Jesus also was predicting his death and resurrection. You can peruse that in the book of Matthew 12 verse 28-42. Matthew 12:38-42 that Jesus could die and rise after three days just as the prophet Jonah and being rescued after three days in the burying of a great fish. Now let me go back again to Jonah. Eventually Jonah obeyed God and there's no time you know this story just went 48 verses. I want to challenge you to go and read through this book. He obeyed preached in the streets of Nineve and the people repented. They did not dismiss the message. They did not fight back those Israelites preaching to them. They did not ignore the message and therefore they were delivered from the judgment. Now I want you to look at me. After this Jonah complained to God. He complained to God. And this is Jonah now. sent this what I said Lord when I was at home. Jonah is speaking to God. That is what I tried to forto God. This is what I knew. I knew you God. I knew you that you are a gracious and compassionate God. slow to anger and abounding in love and a God who remains from sending calamity. Jonah 4:2, that's where you'll find that the very calamity that Jonah wanted for his enemies now is withdrawn. Dear church members, I want to remind you that the gospel is meant for all and possibly through the working of the Holy Spirit. Many will repent if you will only take a step to go and speak to your neighbor. For we have no time to stay in this planet. Would we be avoiding reaching out for those of other backgrounds fearing that they may not respond to the messages? I want to ask are there a people behold redemption here is the truth of our God. God is gracious to all. Praise the Lord. And he brings salvation to all who return to him. The Ninevites turn to God. Check from your Bible. Titus 2:1. Very simple and short verse. For the grace of God has appeared that offers salvation to all people. It has appeared. The grace of the mighty God. Salvation is not confined to one people. Salvation is not confined to one community. It is for all. Jonah knew that God and a specific job for him, but he did not want to do it. And by journeying to Tarsis in an opposite direction is trying to get as far and far away from God's presence and the assignment as possible. How do you and I behave towards the great commission of our time? When God gives me mar direction through the scriptures whenever you read the Bible way that's how God can only speak to you how do I respond maybe do not do this or do this how do I respond or do I claim that God you are asking for too much recently I was scanning about the territories that we have not entered. Gregoris is unentered. Northeastern Kenya is unentered for us. Muranga in your conference and entered some parts of elder and entered. Naro most unentered. Motto day is not entered. Bet is not entered. Mada you may name them. Then I noticed even some portions of Yamira. We have a work to do. What made Jonah run from mission and from the presence of God? What made him to run away? You know Jonah does not flee from the command of the Lord. He does not flee from the word of the Lord. The scripture is very clear when you read it. The scripture is explicitly clear that Jonah free from the presence of the Lord. Now check this verse and underline it. Check it. Revelation chapter 19 verse 13 a very short verse also it says in my version that Jesus Christ is the word of God period revelation the last book 19 verse3 Jesus Christ is the word of God so the word of God Jesus Christ came to Jonah son of Amatai. Two persons and they faced each other and they were talking. Lord himself came and he spoke to Jonah. But Jonah got up. Jonah rose and freed from the real and physical presence of the Lord Jesus. And I said Jonah was not dreaming. Now let me quarantine from the scriptures from the Old Testament as well. Ken did the same thing. The first mander, he did the same thing. Genesis 4:E 16. came and a physical encounter with God and he went out from the presence of the Lord and he dwelt in the land of Nord on the eastern of Heden. God was speaking with Moses. God was speaking with Adam and Eve. God could speak with Cain. And in this Old Testament time, God, the Lord Jesus met Jonah and sent him, dear members, I want you to know that whenever we flee from the directions of God's word, whatever you read from the Bible and from how we are directed by the Bible, We are literally freeing from Jesus himself. What is it that is making me marundu to run away from what I read from what I find in the Bible about the great commission. I want to urge you brethren that um determined to turn and obey God as Jonah did later. Jonah was not forced to preach in. The word came to him again and the option of preaching or not preaching but he chose to preach and Jonah was forgiven while in the belly of the huge fish. Then he is now in Na and he cried to the Assyrians with the gospel message of repentance and there was a great harvest. I want to tell you, you too today determine to obey God and do whatever the Lord says or direct you to do and going wherever he reigns and God will always be with you. Try it. Try it. Do it even through a message to afraid. Now through this message of Jonah, God is reminding Marundu and you of our missionary purpose. Today we too must check for the many Nineve cities allowed us to reach out to. Ninev was known as a cruel and a warlike nation. Their Syria was war cruel. But God needed someone to bring them back to him. So even the greatest offenders that you may know, your relative, God needs someone called Jonah. And that Jonah is you to bring him back to the Lord. God needs you for any nine allowed. And I want to say that you can literally go or you can financially support a missionary to an entered territory. And I'm saying you. I am not saying we. A time has come not for us to go as a group but you need to determinate it yourself and do it. You can set aside a regular offering and you know this church respect the offering. What you write in the envelope they must respect the donor. If you assign an offering for an entered area, it can never be used by any treasurer from the general conference to the local church for any other assignment other than the one you as the donor assigned. How many territories would we fear to visit and go but a radio or a television program would reach a brother or a sister if it was supported by you or Marundu. We must remember God wants you and I to proclaim his love in words and in actions and to the whole world. Then and only then shall he come to take us home. I'm talking to someone who is tired of living in this planet. God is looking for such a person. And now when the reluctant preacher went to Nineth, there was a great response. Now I want you to mark this. Jonah's disobedience did not endanger the life of the ship crew only, but it endangered the Ninevites as well. You know, when you read from the book, you only see the the crew. Those in the ship are the ones you see as if they endangered. But that's not the case. His disobedience was endangering the Ninevites as well. We have a great responsibility. My disobedience and your disobedient to our responsibility does not only endanger myself and the others in the crew but those around us as well. And therefore my sin of disobedience not only affects but actually will hurt those we are expectant to reach out to. Who will reach my cousin who is a drunkard? Who will reach my relative who is a robber and a mander? It is you. It is me. Check also with the lives of the ship crew in verse 5 of chapter one. Each of them cried to his own God. I'm reading Jonah chapter 1 verse5. each as there was a storm everybody except one. This to me suggests that the crew were from different countries and they worshiped different gods. Then they turn to one person who was not praying and then discovered that they are perishing. Actually Jonah was sound asleep. Before I continue, mama and m how is your prayer life? When did you last pray? We pray always. Three times anyone here will pray. But I'm talking of the time you seek God. When did you last pray with your family? When did you last pray with your spouse, with your children? Oh Marund, the traffic in town. Are you new in this town? Now because Jonah was sound asleep, the crew resorted to a common practice of the time that is the casting of rots. casting of rots. And when the crew drew rots to identify and determine the person responsible for bringing the greatest storm, lo and behold, despite these lots being cast by Gentiles, the living God answered their lots And I I am saying when they cast in the lot, the lots were effective in exposing the guilty servant of the Lord Jonah. That is in verse 8. Chapter 1:8. Now I want to remind you that God can use a donkey. Numbers 22:28 to 30. God can bring information through Nebuchadnezzar. Daniel chapter 2, he used an heathen king Nebuchadnezzar to bring the information he wanted. And he answered the ship crew by exposing the servant of God. But Jonah when the others were praying, he did not want to do that. God wanted his wayward servant Jonah to confess his sin and tell about God. He believed in to these Gentiles in the ship. But Jonah did not want to do that. Actually when you read the book of Jonah you will also visit N as I have seen for the wickedness of the city. Jonah is a character who makes no apology for the numerous sins in his heart. As you read through the book of Jonah, in all this, he is content to state what he did, but offers no excuse for his conduct. He would rather have the crew throw him into the waters than jump into the water himself. That is Jonah. Now let me go back to the best part of the message. Jonah later Jonah is in Nv and is obedient and preach by crying. He began crying in every street of Nineveh and people turned to God. And you know with fasting even with the animals, God is about to do a similar thing at this point in our world history. If you and I will establish an invitement, what I mean is this. It is not enough to share the privileges of Christianity just coming to church Sabbath after Sabbath. Yes, I understand it is a good practice to fellowship on Sabbath. Right? That's okay. But it is not enough without the efforts to bring to God our brethren who are out there in darkness. We need to go for them. It begins with you turning in obedience to God. And you will witness many in Nineveh come to God. And because God is ever loving, he will bring them including those of different backgrounds, including other faiths and other religious background. Set aside my listener today and my viewer for a preaching because everyone is assigned to preach a support whether financially. The hope channel is just here. You can set an offering for the hope channel. The Adventist media center is here. The one the the radio is here. But what about also your phone? You can reach many with your phone as well. Our book of Jonah is insisting that we must go to them and cry in a loud voice so that they can come to God. Actually in the entire Bible I cannot recall a verse where God instructed us to wait for someone to come seeking for the message. I can't trace any verse on that. It is only with the Ethiopian una who actually was standing the scroll and he only sought explanation to understand it well and God still sent Philip to him. All throughout the Bible, we are directed to our mission mission purpose to go to all the world. Mark 16:15. As the Father has sent me, even so I sent you. John 20:1. onto the uttermost parts of the earth. Acts chapter 1 verse8. Our time on the planet is long gone members. My challenge this morning through the book of Jonah is that God wants a Jonah and that is you and I to pick up to the great assignments that we have of doubling the membership and that can only happen by you going out and me going out and bringing one. I want to charge and pray with one of you who is willing that you can go out literally or you can go through support of a radio program or television. If you are that man that you would want us to pray together, I ask you to stand that you want to become the one who can speak to a congregation to a people around you. It may be you are cursing that is the N that you need to visit. Let us pray. Almighty father and God in heaven, we want to thank you for speaking to us through the word that came to Jonah and it is you now literally speaking to us this morning through the book of Jonah. Help us, oh Lord, to take the assignment. Thank you Lord for extending your grace for a second chance for every member for Marundu and the brother and sister who as he stood and therefore Lord may you help us to understand our missionary purpose so that all of us can be involved in one way or another to bring us all to the kingdom is our prayer in Jesus name. him.

TIMESTAMPED TRANSCRIPT:
[0.4s] Praise the Lord. Amen. Thank you our
[3.4s] church choir for that good number. And I
[5.5s] want to thank the church elders and the
[7.8s] pastors for welcoming me to their
[11.3s] pullpit. Our missionary
[15.6s] purpose. Luke 11
[19.8s] verse 29.
[23.1s] As the clowns
[25.3s] increased, Jesus
[27.4s] said, "This is a wicked
[31.3s] generation. It hurts for a sign, but
[35.0s] none will be given it except
[39.9s] one, the
[42.2s] sign of
[44.8s] Jonah." Let us pray.
[49.1s] We thank you Lord and our
[52.7s] father for a ch a second chance as you
[56.2s] gave to Jonah that you are willing to
[59.4s] give us for the many and great
[62.2s] assignments that you have given us and
[65.5s] we pray that Lord we will all akin to
[68.7s] the assignment of the great commission
[70.8s] that is ours. We pray in Jesus name.
[75.0s] Amen.
[76.8s] Today most of the
[79.2s] television is
[81.1s] overflowing with
[84.1s] prison prison crimes and dramatic
[88.7s] witness. It is either child
[92.6s] abuse, mass killings,
[96.4s] terrorism,
[98.2s] anarchy,
[100.0s] pornography, ruthless dictatorship. It's
[103.1s] all what what you see. corruption,
[106.8s] hatred, violence, you can name
[110.8s] them church
[113.2s] members. Suppose one morning God
[116.4s] appeared to you
[119.9s] directly and told you to take the good
[123.4s] news of
[125.2s] salvation to the worst of the offenders
[129.1s] that you see in the television.
[133.6s] How could you
[136.5s] react? How could you
[142.0s] respond if God asked
[144.7s] you to meet one of the offenders that
[147.8s] you regularly see in
[150.1s] television? The book of Jonah is set up
[155.0s] in such a
[156.9s] scenario.
[159.1s] Ninev city which is the capital of
[162.8s] Assyria was a cruel city so cruel a city
[167.5s] it
[169.4s] was I'll come to that now this book of
[173.7s] Jonah is much more
[178.5s] than talking of a story of a man and a
[182.6s] huge
[184.1s] fish. It is a
[186.7s] book telling of a story of a prophet in
[191.0s] the person of
[193.7s] Jonah. And the book rather than
[198.3s] centering on the prophecies of Jonah as
[202.8s] a prophet, it is centers on the behavior
[206.9s] and the
[208.8s] conduct of the prophet.
[211.8s] It is important for you to note that as
[214.6s] I
[215.7s] continue. However, this book also is a
[219.8s] story of a profound illustration of
[222.9s] God's mercy and God's grace.
[229.8s] This is so
[234.3s] because no one
[238.0s] needed God's
[240.6s] favor than the
[242.9s] Nvites than the
[247.4s] Assyrians. Jonah is an
[250.1s] ordained prophet of God and he knew all
[255.6s] this. He is much aware and he knew that
[259.9s] God would
[261.3s] forgive. God could bless the
[264.9s] Ninevites if they
[267.6s] repented, if they turned from their sins
[270.9s] and worshiped the living God. He knew
[274.8s] the power of God's message. Surely as a
[279.2s] prophet and a preacher whether he
[282.6s] underestimated himself I am very sure
[286.2s] Jonah really
[288.0s] knew that the people in
[290.7s] Ninev were the whole or a few following
[294.1s] his
[295.6s] preaching a few or whole would be
[299.5s] converted but Jonah and as we read the
[303.3s] book of Jonah you get this word but
[306.5s] Jonah
[307.8s] Jonah did not want any
[311.1s] conversions in this
[316.0s] city. He may have
[318.9s] feared this cruel city of
[323.0s] Assyria knowing that he could me be
[326.4s] mistreated or be killed in this
[330.0s] city. Now, here are the opening ones of
[333.4s] the book of Jonah. And I want to invite
[335.5s] you to Jonah chapter 1 verse one to
[338.8s] verse 4. Just those few verses. And I
[341.2s] want to read this
[343.9s] morning. The word of the Lord came to
[348.2s] Jonah son of Amiti. And I want to
[352.3s] qualify this here that Jonah is
[356.9s] real. Jonah is a man you can touch.
[363.4s] [Music]
[366.0s] is a human
[368.1s] being. There is nothing whatsoever
[371.4s] allegorical about the person of Jonah.
[374.3s] He is an historical figure. Verse two.
[377.6s] And those who have the King James
[379.4s] version, you have the right translation
[381.9s] in the King James version. Verse
[385.6s] two, when the word when Jesus met Jonah,
[389.2s] this is what he said.
[391.8s] go to the great city of Nineveh and
[396.9s] cry,
[399.2s] preach. But the right word used there,
[402.8s] Jonah was to
[404.8s] cry against the city because his
[410.0s] wickedness and come up before
[413.9s] me. Jonah did not dream.
[417.5s] Brothers and
[419.2s] sisters, it is the Lord who met him
[423.2s] directly. It was not a dream. It was not
[426.1s] a
[426.8s] vision. Verse three, but
[431.0s] Jonah ran away from the Lord and headed
[435.3s] to
[436.3s] Tashis. He went down to
[439.2s] Jopa where he b he found a ship board to
[444.6s] Tashis
[446.1s] where then after paying for the
[450.7s] fair he went aboard and sailed to
[454.4s] Tashis to free from the
[460.3s] Lord. Verse four and you know the story
[463.4s] anyway.
[465.8s] Then the Lord sent a great wind on the
[470.3s] sea, and such a violent storm
[475.2s] arose that the ship
[478.0s] threatened to break
[480.9s] up throughout the Old Testament. As you
[484.3s] read the Old Testament, Genesis to
[487.6s] Malachi, this is the only case, this is
[491.4s] the only record we have in which an Old
[496.2s] Testament prophet is directly sent to
[500.2s] the
[502.8s] Gentiles. There's no other book that you
[505.8s] get a prophet sent directly to the
[509.0s] Gentiles. Therefore, this book points so
[513.6s] clearly to everybody reading the book of
[516.6s] Jonah that God
[519.3s] included the Gentiles as well in his
[522.8s] plan of
[524.6s] salvation. Everybody is included in the
[528.2s] plan of salvation. And so the book of
[531.3s] Jonah reveals the universal divine
[536.1s] mercy without favoritism either for Jews
[539.9s] or Gentiles. That is what you get as you
[544.8s] open the pages in the book of Jonah.
[548.0s] Jonah is only a
[550.9s] tool that God used to proclaim his
[555.2s] message to all the nations.
[562.0s] you too
[563.7s] today. God must use you. God is looking
[568.6s] for a
[569.5s] Jonah in our
[572.2s] ministry. He's searching for that Jonah.
[574.7s] Would that be Marud or
[577.2s] you? God wants to awaken a Jonah in a
[581.5s] congregation to send him or her to the
[586.4s] nations, to send him to
[589.2s] Somaria, to send him to South Sudan, to
[593.5s] send him to
[596.7s] Congo. Let's get back to the book of
[599.0s] Jonah.
[600.7s] Jonah was
[602.9s] reluctant given the mission he found
[607.3s] distestful to
[610.2s] him. You know friends what I am saying
[613.2s] here is that we want you to board and go
[619.4s] to South Sudan to preach.
[624.2s] Marundu, we want to send you to
[627.5s] Somaria and we want to send you to
[633.2s] Congo. Now, when Jesus
[636.9s] personally met
[639.2s] Jonah, not only did Jonah find it
[644.4s] distasteful, but he ran away. He
[648.2s] decided to run away.
[652.4s] He did not run away from the command of
[657.3s] God.
[659.6s] No, he ran from the
[663.5s] presence of the
[667.6s] Lord. He did not want to
[670.9s] associate with the
[673.8s] Lord and he even questioned the wisdom
[678.6s] of such an assignment.
[682.0s] If you were to be asked to go to South
[684.3s] Sudan where they are fighting today, you
[686.6s] may want to question such an assignment.
[690.2s] Let me take you to the pen of
[691.7s] inspiration. What sister White has
[693.7s] written in the book of Patriots and
[697.2s] Prophets. No, no, sorry. Patriots and
[699.8s] Kings. Patriots and Kings. And I want to
[702.1s] read about Jonah. It says like this.
[706.1s] As the pro as the prophet thought of the
[709.8s] difficulties and the seeming
[711.5s] impossibilities of this
[714.0s] mission, he was tempted to question the
[717.9s] wisdom of the call. From a human
[721.2s] viewpoint, it seemed as if nothing could
[724.8s] be gained by proclaiming such message to
[728.6s] that proud city.
[731.6s] He forgot for the moment that the God
[736.2s] whom he served was all wise. The God
[741.4s] whom he served was all powerful.
[745.8s] While he has stated, I want you to mark
[748.2s] what prophet and king is saying, Patus
[751.6s] and king is saying while he has
[754.8s] stated still doubting Satan the devil
[759.4s] overwhelmed the prophet with
[763.7s] discouragement, the prophet was sieged
[766.6s] with a great
[768.2s] dread and he rose up to flee unto
[773.7s] Tashis.
[775.8s] In the charge given
[777.7s] him, Jonah had been entrusted with a
[782.4s] heavy
[784.4s] responsibility. Yet he who unbidden him
[787.9s] to go was able to sustain a servant and
[791.7s] grant him
[793.8s] success. And the prophet
[796.9s] obeyed unquestioningly.
[800.2s] He would have been spared the many
[804.5s] bitter
[807.3s] experiences and would have been blessed
[811.6s] abundantly. Yet in the heart of Jonah's
[816.6s] despair, praise the Lord, the Lord did
[820.2s] not desert him.
[823.6s] Through a series of trial and
[828.3s] strange
[830.1s] providences, the prophet's confidence in
[833.3s] God and in his infinite power to
[837.9s] save was revived.
[842.4s] And I want to say this morning that we
[844.5s] too
[846.0s] stand in the foot of
[848.5s] Jonah. And we must not fear in our
[851.5s] mission
[853.4s] assignments. For we shall be
[855.4s] strengthened whenever we undertake
[858.7s] mission. But you need to take the
[861.5s] initiative.
[865.0s] But
[866.1s] Jonah, he chose to run
[869.9s] away from God rather than to obey
[875.2s] him. Now like
[877.4s] Jonah, this is how we
[879.9s] behave as Christians. My viewers this
[884.0s] morning, if you are a Christian, that is
[886.6s] exactly how we behave in our Christian
[889.6s] journey when we do not want to do what
[894.6s] God has commissioned us to
[900.0s] do. It's not
[903.2s] different. And there today
[906.2s] too there are many
[909.8s] Nvites that must be reached by you and
[917.1s] I. And sometimes we find ourselves
[920.2s] wanting to run
[923.2s] away. We even give
[925.9s] excuses or
[928.0s] reasons and want to hide from the
[930.9s] assignment.
[939.0s] And we hope to
[941.1s] escape. We exactly behave like Jonah. I
[944.4s] exactly behave like Jonah and would want
[947.0s] to
[949.6s] escape from God's assignment as Jonah
[953.2s] did. But I want to ask this question. Is
[956.0s] it
[959.4s] possible who will preach to the
[963.8s] Ninevites of our
[969.2s] day? Who will preach in South
[974.0s] Sudan? Who will preach in
[977.4s] Somaria? Who will preach in
[982.0s] Congo? Now let's get back to Jonah.
[984.5s] Jonah is running from the presence of
[987.7s] the Lord, not from the
[990.0s] command. He is running away from the
[993.4s] presence of the Lord, not from the
[996.0s] ones that he
[1000.2s] received. He is not able to face
[1003.8s] Jesus. And I I will qualify. He's not
[1007.4s] able and he does not want to face the
[1011.4s] world.
[1014.8s] nor take his
[1017.3s] directives and so he decides to run
[1021.2s] away. But will Jonah really
[1024.6s] manage? Will we
[1027.1s] manage? I am reminded of the African
[1031.3s] proverb that goes like
[1034.5s] this. There is nowhere on earth where
[1039.3s] the weed does not blow.
[1043.4s] And I want to remind you too that our
[1046.4s] God is om present. Go to the waters. Go
[1050.6s] to the skies. He's
[1055.6s] there. God told Jonah to
[1058.8s] preach in
[1061.5s] Nineve, the capital of Assyria.
[1065.4s] And as you
[1066.8s] read how Ninev was
[1070.8s] cruel, you may not capture it. Grabs it
[1073.8s] all from the book of Jonah. Furthermore,
[1076.8s] the book of Jonah is only 48
[1080.2s] verses. You just need one sitting to
[1083.9s] read through the 48 verses for the
[1086.7s] entire book of Jonah.
[1089.5s] And I want to say you can see that
[1093.5s] throughout the book as you scan through
[1096.3s] you don't get much to know about the
[1098.5s] wickedness of
[1100.8s] Nineveh. You gather it all about the
[1103.7s] wickedness of Nineveh from the book of
[1107.6s] N. And I want to take you to a few
[1110.1s] verses. If you are writing you can write
[1112.2s] them to read at home.
[1115.3s] N says that Nineveh was guilt of four
[1119.2s] things and I want to name them. One Nap
[1124.3s] 1 verse 9 evil plots against God. That's
[1130.4s] what Naom says about
[1133.0s] Nineveh.
[1135.1s] Two Ninev was guilt for exploitation of
[1140.1s] the hopeless.
[1143.8s] Now chapter
[1148.8s] 2:12 then she also expounds about the
[1152.2s] cruity number three the quality of the
[1154.8s] city their quality in
[1157.8s] war that is in Nap 2 verse 12 and 13.
[1163.2s] Now let me explain how well they were.
[1165.8s] If you they captured you they could not
[1169.0s] just shoot you. They could either cut
[1171.9s] one finger at a time, but they like also
[1175.0s] skinninging people when you are alive.
[1176.7s] They remove your
[1178.4s] skin and they leave you to die as you
[1181.6s] breed. Just imagine the way you go to
[1184.1s] the butcher and you see the skin of a
[1186.6s] cow or so. They remove your skin if you
[1189.8s] are a captive. That's how well the
[1192.5s] Assyrians
[1193.9s] were. Number four, N will explain in N
[1198.5s] chapter 3 verse 4,
[1203.5s] idolatry, prostitution and
[1210.0s] witchcraft. My question is
[1212.7s] this, is our world any better
[1218.6s] today from the guilt of Nineve or
[1223.0s] Assyria? Aren't these vices allowed
[1227.9s] us? Now, for those reading from the King
[1231.8s] James version, God told Jonah to go to
[1236.6s] Ninev and
[1240.8s] cry. Go to Kericho. And when you get to
[1244.4s] Kericho, you begin by saying, you begin
[1247.9s] by
[1249.1s] crying. Are you there my church on that
[1253.5s] you go to Kajando but the moment you get
[1257.0s] there you begin by
[1259.2s] crying. That is how Jonah was
[1267.2s] instructed. I want to interpret the
[1269.8s] crying here. Lift up your voice Jonah.
[1275.7s] They did not have the microphone those
[1278.6s] days. But he was to lift up his
[1281.3s] voice. Why? Lift up his voice so that
[1286.1s] all in Nineve might
[1289.6s] hear and to
[1292.7s] declare. That the people would receive
[1297.3s] mercy and
[1299.7s] forgiveness if they repented.
[1305.5s] Now, while the message from God to Ninev
[1309.3s] is
[1311.5s] good of repentance, that's a gospel.
[1316.2s] This book also shows a person of
[1321.9s] Jonah entertaining misgivings and
[1326.4s] perpacities to what God has him to do in
[1332.4s] Nineveh. For Jonah, the very thought of
[1336.6s] going to
[1337.8s] Nineveh, to this metropolis city of the
[1343.2s] time, and the difficulties and the
[1346.7s] seeming impossibilities of the
[1350.8s] task made him to
[1354.6s] shrink from
[1356.4s] undertaking the divine missionary
[1360.3s] purpose.
[1362.9s] Dear
[1364.5s] friends, what is
[1367.9s] it that has prevented you and myself
[1373.0s] from accomplishing the great
[1375.6s] commission as a
[1379.5s] signed? That's a question I want you to
[1382.1s] answer
[1382.9s] inwardly. What is
[1385.6s] it? If we want our Lord Jesus Christ to
[1389.6s] come, we must work. While it is
[1396.8s] there, Jonah
[1399.4s] sank into discouragement and despair.
[1403.4s] But
[1406.3s] why? One, he
[1408.5s] knew the loving kindness of
[1412.5s] God. Jonah knew the longsuffering of
[1416.4s] God. And he was
[1419.1s] particularly
[1420.7s] afraid that if he went to Nineveh and
[1424.0s] preached the divine message to the
[1428.6s] Ninevites and this heathen city accepted
[1433.3s] the message, the doom, get me right, the
[1437.9s] doom that God pronounced upon them then
[1443.4s] could
[1444.3s] not
[1446.1s] pass could not come to
[1449.2s] pass and Jonah could not endure
[1452.7s] that. Jonah could not take
[1459.7s] that because the last thing Jonah wanted
[1463.1s] was
[1464.1s] salvation for the Ninevites because they
[1466.9s] were great enemies for the Israelites.
[1474.3s] Ninevites, Assyrians. No, no, that is
[1478.6s] Jonah reasoning. And so he takes a
[1482.9s] different
[1485.9s] route for Jonah.
[1491.8s] He had the belief, he has the belief
[1494.2s] that Jews or the chosen people, Israel,
[1497.8s] were the only
[1499.6s] ones entitled to receive God's
[1508.3s] mercy. I want to say God's mercy is not
[1511.4s] only for
[1512.9s] Adventists. It's not only for the
[1516.0s] Catholics. It is for all of us, the
[1518.2s] Hindus and the Muslims.
[1524.8s] So Jonah is running
[1528.2s] away from his
[1530.8s] assignment and he ended up spending
[1534.6s] three nights, three days. Let me
[1538.8s] qualify. Three
[1541.1s] days in the
[1543.1s] bury of a great fish.
[1548.4s] But when Jonah got
[1550.4s] out, he
[1552.3s] preached God's message and saw the
[1557.2s] city
[1559.3s] repent. Now, let me get back to the
[1561.8s] verse that we read, church
[1564.3s] members, and I want you to mark
[1567.2s] this. God and asked Jonah to preach
[1570.9s] repentance to the Gentiles, to the
[1574.7s] non-Jews. And so in
[1577.5s] Luke 11 29, Jesus was affirming Jonah's
[1583.5s] message. Remember our key verse this
[1585.9s] morning. Jesus is saying that
[1589.0s] salvation that he has come to offer is
[1592.7s] not only for Jews but for all people on
[1598.2s] earth. That is the point the Lord is
[1601.0s] stressing here.
[1602.8s] Therefore, Jesus personally came and met
[1609.8s] Jonah and using the sign of Jonah who
[1613.9s] was now
[1615.1s] inside a huge fish for 3 days, Jesus
[1620.0s] also was predicting his death and
[1623.3s] resurrection. You can peruse that in the
[1626.3s] book of Matthew 12 verse 28-42.
[1631.4s] Matthew
[1634.6s] 12:38-42 that Jesus could die and rise
[1638.5s] after three days just as the prophet
[1642.4s] Jonah and being
[1645.1s] rescued after three days in the burying
[1649.4s] of a great
[1650.9s] fish. Now let me go back again to Jonah.
[1655.8s] Eventually Jonah obeyed God and there's
[1659.1s] no time you know this story just went 48
[1662.9s] verses. I want to challenge you to go
[1665.1s] and read through this
[1667.6s] book. He obeyed preached in the streets
[1671.4s] of
[1672.3s] Nineve and the people
[1675.6s] repented. They did not dismiss the
[1679.2s] message. They did not fight back those
[1683.4s] Israelites preaching to them. They did
[1686.5s] not ignore the
[1689.5s] message and therefore they were
[1691.7s] delivered from the
[1694.1s] judgment. Now I want you to look at
[1697.6s] me. After this Jonah complained to God.
[1703.0s] He complained to God. And this is Jonah
[1707.3s] now. sent this what I said Lord when I
[1712.1s] was at
[1713.6s] home. Jonah is speaking to
[1719.1s] God. That is what I tried to
[1726.1s] forto God. This is what I knew. I knew
[1729.1s] you God. I knew you that you are a
[1733.7s] gracious and compassionate God.
[1738.4s] slow to anger and abounding in love and
[1742.3s] a God who remains from sending
[1749.1s] calamity. Jonah 4:2, that's where you'll
[1752.3s] find that the very calamity that Jonah
[1757.3s] wanted for his enemies now is
[1762.4s] withdrawn. Dear church
[1765.6s] members, I want to remind you that the
[1767.9s] gospel is meant for all and possibly
[1772.2s] through the working of the Holy Spirit.
[1775.8s] Many will
[1776.9s] repent if you will only take a
[1780.3s] step to go and speak to your
[1783.7s] neighbor. For we have no time to stay in
[1787.4s] this
[1789.6s] planet.
[1797.2s] Would we be
[1799.7s] avoiding reaching out for those of other
[1807.3s] backgrounds fearing that they may not
[1810.2s] respond to the messages?
[1816.2s] I want to ask are there a people behold
[1825.0s] redemption here is the truth of our
[1828.9s] God. God is gracious to all. Praise the
[1834.0s] Lord. And he brings salvation to all who
[1838.0s] return to him.
[1841.1s] The Ninevites turn to God. Check from
[1845.5s] your Bible. Titus
[1847.6s] 2:1. Very simple and short
[1850.6s] verse. For the grace of God has
[1854.4s] appeared that
[1856.4s] offers salvation to
[1859.5s] all
[1861.8s] people. It has appeared. The grace of
[1866.2s] the mighty God.
[1868.4s] Salvation is not confined to one
[1872.1s] people. Salvation is not confined to one
[1876.1s] community. It is for all. Jonah
[1881.7s] knew that God and a specific job for
[1886.4s] him, but he did not want to do
[1891.2s] it. And by journeying to
[1894.5s] Tarsis in an opposite
[1897.6s] direction is trying to get as far and
[1902.2s] far away from God's presence and the
[1906.2s] assignment as
[1910.0s] possible. How do you and I behave
[1913.6s] towards the great commission of our
[1919.0s] time? When God gives me mar direction
[1923.3s] through the scriptures whenever you read
[1926.1s] the Bible way that's how God can only
[1928.5s] speak to
[1930.6s] you how do I
[1934.0s] respond maybe do not do this or do this
[1937.8s] how do I
[1941.6s] respond or do I claim that God you are
[1944.2s] asking for too much recently I was
[1947.4s] scanning about the territories that we
[1949.8s] have not entered. Gregoris is
[1954.3s] unentered. Northeastern Kenya is
[1956.7s] unentered for us. Muranga in your
[1960.4s] conference and entered some parts of
[1963.5s] elder and entered. Naro most unentered.
[1967.6s] Motto
[1971.4s] day is not entered. Bet is not entered.
[1976.0s] Mada you may name them. Then I noticed
[1979.8s] even some portions of
[1985.0s] Yamira. We have a work to
[1988.7s] do. What made Jonah run from mission and
[1993.8s] from the presence of God? What made him
[1997.2s] to run away?
[2000.2s] You
[2001.5s] know Jonah does not flee from the
[2005.6s] command of the
[2007.5s] Lord. He does not flee from the word of
[2010.8s] the Lord. The scripture is very clear
[2013.6s] when you read
[2014.8s] it. The scripture is explicitly clear
[2019.9s] that Jonah free from the presence of the
[2023.8s] Lord. Now check this verse and underline
[2026.6s] it. Check it. Revelation chapter 19
[2030.3s] verse
[2031.7s] 13 a very short verse
[2036.1s] also it says in my version that Jesus
[2040.3s] Christ is the word of
[2043.0s] God period revelation the last book 19
[2048.4s] verse3 Jesus Christ is the word of God
[2053.9s] so the word of God Jesus Christ came to
[2058.3s] Jonah son of Amatai. Two
[2062.6s] persons and they faced each other and
[2066.0s] they were
[2068.2s] talking. Lord himself came and he spoke
[2071.1s] to
[2073.6s] Jonah. But Jonah got
[2077.2s] up. Jonah rose and freed from the real
[2082.3s] and physical presence of the Lord Jesus.
[2089.7s] And I said Jonah was not
[2094.2s] dreaming. Now let me quarantine from the
[2097.8s] scriptures from the Old Testament as
[2100.6s] well. Ken did the same thing. The first
[2104.6s] mander, he did the same thing. Genesis
[2108.0s] 4:E 16.
[2110.9s] came and a physical encounter with God
[2114.6s] and he went out from the presence of the
[2118.7s] Lord and he dwelt in the land of
[2123.9s] Nord on the eastern of
[2128.3s] Heden. God was speaking with Moses. God
[2132.6s] was speaking with Adam and Eve. God
[2135.0s] could speak with Cain. And in this Old
[2137.6s] Testament time, God, the Lord Jesus met
[2141.2s] Jonah and sent
[2146.7s] him, dear
[2151.5s] members, I want you to know that
[2154.4s] whenever we flee from the directions of
[2157.8s] God's
[2159.0s] word, whatever you read from the Bible
[2161.6s] and from how we are directed by the
[2165.2s] Bible, We are
[2168.4s] literally freeing from Jesus
[2177.2s] himself. What is it that is making me
[2180.5s] marundu to run away from what I read
[2183.8s] from what I find in the Bible about the
[2187.6s] great commission.
[2190.4s] I want to urge you brethren that
[2193.2s] um determined to turn and obey God as
[2198.5s] Jonah did later.
[2202.1s] Jonah was not forced to preach
[2205.1s] in. The word came to him again
[2208.4s] and the option of preaching or not
[2211.4s] preaching but he chose to
[2214.4s] preach and Jonah was
[2217.6s] forgiven while in the belly of the huge
[2227.2s] fish. Then he is now in Na and he cried
[2232.6s] to the
[2235.1s] Assyrians with the gospel message of
[2239.4s] repentance and there was a great
[2242.3s] harvest.
[2244.8s] I want to tell you, you too
[2247.8s] today determine to obey God and do
[2252.8s] whatever the Lord says or direct you to
[2255.9s] do and going wherever he
[2258.9s] reigns and God will always be with
[2264.4s] you. Try
[2266.4s] it. Try it. Do it even through a
[2270.8s] message to afraid.
[2274.5s] Now through this message of
[2278.0s] Jonah, God is reminding Marundu and you
[2282.8s] of our missionary
[2285.6s] purpose. Today we too must check for the
[2290.1s] many Nineve
[2292.4s] cities allowed us to reach out to.
[2300.6s] Ninev was known as a
[2304.5s] cruel and a warlike
[2307.6s] nation. Their Syria was war
[2312.0s] cruel. But God needed
[2315.3s] someone to bring them back to
[2319.1s] him. So even the greatest offenders that
[2322.4s] you may know, your
[2325.0s] relative, God needs someone called
[2327.8s] Jonah. And that Jonah is you to bring
[2331.4s] him back to the Lord. God needs
[2336.2s] you for any nine
[2340.3s] allowed. And I want to say that you can
[2342.7s] literally
[2344.2s] go or you can financially support a
[2347.9s] missionary to an entered territory. And
[2351.2s] I'm saying you. I am not saying we. A
[2353.6s] time has come not for us to go as a
[2356.6s] group but you need to determinate it
[2359.5s] yourself and do
[2363.8s] it. You can set aside a regular offering
[2367.3s] and you know this church respect the
[2369.2s] offering. What you write in the envelope
[2371.8s] they must respect the donor. If you
[2374.9s] assign an offering for an entered area,
[2379.4s] it can never be used by any treasurer
[2381.9s] from the general conference to the local
[2383.8s] church for any other assignment other
[2386.6s] than the one you as the donor assigned.
[2394.2s] How many
[2395.3s] territories would we fear to visit and
[2398.4s] go but a radio or a television
[2402.6s] program would reach a brother or a
[2405.1s] sister if it was supported by you or
[2408.7s] Marundu. We must remember God wants you
[2412.5s] and I to proclaim his love in words and
[2417.0s] in
[2418.4s] actions and to the whole world. Then and
[2422.3s] only
[2423.8s] then shall he
[2426.3s] come to take us
[2428.5s] home. I'm talking to someone who is
[2432.5s] tired of living in this
[2435.6s] planet. God is looking for such a
[2438.3s] person.
[2441.8s] And now when the reluctant preacher went
[2445.4s] to
[2446.4s] Nineth, there was a great
[2451.1s] response. Now I want you to mark
[2454.0s] this. Jonah's
[2456.4s] disobedience did not
[2459.0s] endanger the life of the ship crew only,
[2463.6s] but it endangered the Ninevites as well.
[2467.8s] You know, when you read from the book,
[2469.5s] you only see the the
[2472.3s] crew. Those in the ship are the ones you
[2474.7s] see as if they endangered. But that's
[2476.5s] not the
[2477.8s] case. His disobedience was endangering
[2481.3s] the Ninevites as
[2486.2s] well. We have a great
[2490.3s] responsibility. My disobedience and your
[2494.1s] disobedient to our
[2496.0s] responsibility does not only endanger
[2498.9s] myself and the others in the
[2503.6s] crew but those around us as
[2513.6s] well. And therefore my sin of
[2517.2s] disobedience not only affects but
[2520.4s] actually will hurt those we are
[2524.4s] expectant to reach out
[2528.0s] to. Who will reach my cousin who is a
[2535.6s] drunkard? Who will reach my
[2538.8s] relative who is a
[2541.2s] robber and a mander?
[2544.6s] It is you. It is
[2550.1s] me. Check also with the
[2553.2s] lives of the ship crew in verse 5 of
[2557.9s] chapter
[2559.2s] one. Each of them cried to his own
[2565.9s] God. I'm reading Jonah chapter 1 verse5.
[2570.8s] each as there was a storm everybody
[2575.0s] except
[2576.8s] one. This to me
[2579.6s] suggests that the crew were from
[2582.7s] different
[2584.2s] countries and they worshiped different
[2587.3s] gods.
[2592.8s] Then they turn to one
[2595.4s] person who was not praying and then
[2599.2s] discovered that they are
[2601.3s] perishing. Actually Jonah was sound
[2606.4s] asleep. Before I continue, mama and
[2611.3s] m how is your prayer
[2617.0s] life? When did you last
[2626.1s] pray? We pray
[2630.4s] always. Three times anyone here will
[2633.3s] pray. But I'm talking of the time you
[2635.4s] seek
[2640.0s] God. When did you last pray with your
[2644.4s] family?
[2647.1s] When did you last pray with your spouse,
[2650.5s] with your children? Oh Marund, the
[2653.0s] traffic in town. Are you new in this
[2659.5s] town? Now because Jonah was sound
[2664.4s] asleep, the crew resorted to a common
[2669.3s] practice of the time that is the casting
[2673.4s] of rots.
[2676.2s] casting of
[2678.1s] rots. And when the crew drew rots to
[2682.3s] identify and
[2684.3s] determine the person responsible
[2689.3s] for bringing the greatest storm, lo and
[2695.7s] behold, despite these
[2698.4s] lots being cast by Gentiles, the living
[2702.6s] God answered their
[2707.6s] lots And I I am saying when they cast in
[2711.5s] the lot, the lots were
[2713.5s] effective in exposing the guilty servant
[2717.2s] of the Lord
[2720.2s] Jonah. That is in verse 8. Chapter
[2724.0s] 1:8. Now I want to remind you that God
[2727.4s] can use a donkey. Numbers 22:28 to 30.
[2733.0s] God can bring information through
[2735.7s] Nebuchadnezzar.
[2737.8s] Daniel chapter
[2739.2s] 2, he used an heathen king
[2742.9s] Nebuchadnezzar to bring the information
[2745.0s] he
[2749.9s] wanted. And he answered the ship crew by
[2754.1s] exposing the servant of God. But Jonah
[2758.4s] when the others were
[2760.2s] praying, he did not want to do that.
[2766.2s] God wanted his wayward servant Jonah to
[2769.9s] confess his sin and tell
[2776.3s] about
[2779.1s] God. He believed in to these Gentiles in
[2784.1s] the
[2785.5s] ship. But Jonah did not want to do that.
[2792.7s] Actually when you read the book of Jonah
[2795.8s] you will also visit N as I have seen for
[2798.2s] the wickedness of the
[2800.8s] city. Jonah is a character who makes no
[2806.4s] apology for the numerous sins in his
[2809.3s] heart. As you read through the book of
[2812.6s] Jonah, in all this, he is
[2815.8s] content to state what he did, but offers
[2820.8s] no excuse for his
[2825.4s] conduct. He would rather have the crew
[2829.0s] throw him into the waters than jump into
[2831.4s] the water
[2834.0s] himself. That is Jonah.
[2839.0s] Now let me go back to the best part of
[2841.3s] the message. Jonah later
[2845.0s] Jonah is in
[2847.2s] Nv and is
[2849.3s] obedient and preach by crying.
[2853.9s] He began crying in every street of
[2857.9s] Nineveh and people turned to
[2862.5s] God. And you know with fasting even with
[2866.0s] the animals, God is about to do a
[2869.5s] similar thing at this point in our world
[2874.1s] history. If you and I will establish an
[2881.1s] invitement, what I mean is
[2883.6s] this. It is not enough to share the
[2887.8s] privileges of Christianity just coming
[2890.2s] to church Sabbath after Sabbath. Yes, I
[2894.3s] understand it is a good practice to
[2896.8s] fellowship on Sabbath. Right? That's
[2899.4s] okay. But it is not enough without the
[2903.2s] efforts to bring to God our brethren who
[2908.7s] are out there in
[2912.6s] darkness. We need to go for
[2919.4s] them. It begins with you turning in
[2924.6s] obedience to God.
[2930.6s] And you will witness many in
[2932.9s] Nineveh come to God. And because God is
[2937.9s] ever
[2938.8s] loving, he will bring
[2941.9s] them including those of different
[2946.1s] backgrounds, including other faiths and
[2949.7s] other religious background.
[2953.9s] Set aside my listener today and my
[2957.0s] viewer for a preaching because everyone
[2960.2s] is assigned to
[2963.5s] preach a
[2965.7s] support whether financially. The hope
[2969.2s] channel is just
[2970.7s] here. You can set an offering for the
[2973.8s] hope
[2974.8s] channel. The Adventist media center is
[2978.0s] here. The one the the radio is here. But
[2982.3s] what about also your
[2984.0s] phone? You can reach many with your
[2987.0s] phone as
[2990.5s] well. Our book of Jonah is
[2993.9s] insisting that we must go to them and
[2997.4s] cry in a loud
[3003.9s] voice so that they can come to God.
[3007.0s] Actually in the entire Bible I cannot
[3010.7s] recall a
[3012.7s] verse where God instructed us to wait
[3016.9s] for someone to come seeking for the
[3021.5s] message. I can't trace any verse on
[3024.2s] that. It is only with the Ethiopian una
[3028.2s] who actually was standing the scroll and
[3032.0s] he only sought
[3033.6s] explanation to understand it
[3037.6s] well and God still sent Philip to him.
[3045.4s] All throughout the
[3048.2s] Bible, we are
[3050.6s] directed to our mission mission
[3055.6s] purpose to go to all the world. Mark
[3062.3s] 16:15. As the Father has sent me, even
[3066.2s] so I sent you. John
[3070.0s] 20:1. onto the uttermost parts of the
[3073.8s] earth. Acts chapter 1
[3079.0s] verse8. Our time on the planet is long
[3082.5s] gone members.
[3084.6s] My challenge this morning through the
[3086.3s] book of Jonah is that God wants a Jonah
[3089.2s] and that is you and I to pick up to the
[3093.4s] great assignments that we have of
[3096.4s] doubling the
[3100.8s] membership and that can only happen by
[3103.5s] you going out and me going out and
[3105.8s] bringing one.
[3108.6s] I want to charge and pray with one of
[3110.4s] you who is willing that you can go out
[3114.6s] literally or you can go through support
[3116.9s] of a radio program or television. If you
[3120.2s] are that man that you would want us to
[3122.0s] pray together, I ask you to
[3126.4s] stand that you want to become the one
[3129.0s] who can speak to a congregation to a
[3131.0s] people around you. It may be you are
[3134.4s] cursing that is the N that you need to
[3138.2s] visit. Let us
[3140.8s] pray. Almighty father and God in heaven,
[3144.6s] we want to thank you for speaking to us
[3146.8s] through the word that came to Jonah and
[3150.8s] it is you now literally speaking to us
[3153.2s] this morning through the book of
[3156.0s] Jonah. Help us, oh Lord, to take the
[3159.6s] assignment. Thank you Lord for extending
[3162.6s] your grace for a second chance for every
[3165.6s] member for Marundu and the brother and
[3168.2s] sister who as he stood and therefore
[3170.6s] Lord may you help us to understand our
[3173.2s] missionary purpose so that all of us can
[3176.0s] be involved in one way or another to
[3178.7s] bring us all to the kingdom is our
[3180.7s] prayer in Jesus name. him.
