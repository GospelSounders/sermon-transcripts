FULL TRANSCRIPT:
Welcome. My name is Furaha and today's mission comes from Thailand. When Mafong was four, she was given an animal cookie. Grandma had bought the cookie at a mall in Thailand and she gave it to mom to give to Mafang. The little girl happily ate the cookie. It tasted so sweet and good. But then something scary happened. Her eyes got red and puffy and she couldn't breathe. Mom was very scared and she rushed Mafong to the hospital. The doctor said Mafang was allergic to wheat gluten. That meant she couldn't eat any more animal cookies. It also meant that she couldn't eat anything made with flour. That that that was hard for the little girl, but her health depended on it. Before she ate anything, she had to to check first to see if it contained flour. So after that, when Mafang wanted a hamburger at a fast food restaurant, she only ate that. She only ate the patty and the and the cheese. She couldn't eat the bun and she put it in the trash. When she ordered a pizza, she only ate the cheese and the toppings. She couldn't eat the crust and she put the crust in the trash. At the at birthday parties, she ate the frosting of the birthday cake and put the rest in the trash. Once she leaked the frosting off a donut and asked her friends, "Does anyone want a donut? A donut?" No one did. So she put it in the trash. One day when Mafong was nine, she decided to play a prank. She was sitting at the table for supper with grandma and grandpa in the dining table in the dining room of their house in the city of in the city of Korat. Mom was in the kitchen and dad wasn't home. On the table was a meal of rice, fried fried eggs, and thin stuffed pancakes. Mafang knew that her supper was only the rice and fried eggs. She needed to stay away from pancakes because they contained flour. But she wanted to see what grandma and grandpa would do if she ate pancake. So she grabbed a pancake with her hand and bit off part of it. Grandma and grandpa were shocked. What are you doing? Grandma cried. Don't swallow it. Grandpa exclaimed at the at that moment. As Mafang grabbed and ate part of the pancake, mom came out of the kitchen. She looked on on with horror at what was happening. Mafang thought that her prank was funny, but she didn't have a plan on what to do next. Suddenly, a strong desire over came her to spit out the pancake. She had never felt that way before. She felt like the pancake was a disgusting piece of garbage in her mouth and she wanted to put it in the trash. Mafang jumped out of her chair. She ran across the room to a trash bin in the corner. Standing over it, she spit the pancake out of her mouth. Mom, Grandma, and Grandpa heaved a sigh of relief. They were so glad that she had she had spit it out. Never do that again because you could get really really sick. Mom said Mafang didn't say anything. She didn't know what to say, but she thought a lot about the unusual desire that had overcome her to spit out the pancake like a piece of garbage. She pondered it for a long time. She wondered what happened. Who gave me the desire to spit out the the pancake? Then she remembered her school where she was studying in the fourth grade. She had learned at the Seventh Day Adventist mission school about the God of heaven who created all people and cares for them. She had learned at the school to pray to God in the morning and in the evening. Mafong had an answer. The the God of heaven who created her and cared for her had filled her with the strong desire to spit out the pancake. God had saved her life. I know that that it must be God. Mafang said, "If I had swallowed the pancake, I might have been sent to the hospital. I think God is nice because he helps anyone who needs anything." Mafang now studies in Korat Adventist International School in Thailand where many children like her come from families who do not know God. Um let's let's pray. Dear God, um thank you for this day that you have given us. Please protect us and guide us throughout this day. Please heal the sick people. Please forgive our sins. Thank you for everything that you have done for us. And whatever prayed for, not prayed for, may the Holy Spirit intercede it. In Jesus name we pray and believe. Amen. Redeemed how I love to proclaim it. Redeemed by the blood of the lamb. Redeemed through his infinite mercy. his child and forever. I am redeemed. Redeemed, redeemed by the blood of the lamb. Redeemed through his infinite mercy, his child and forever I am. I think of my blessed redeemer. I think of him all the day long. I sing for I cannot be silent. His child and forever I am redeemed. Redeemed. Redeemed by the blood of the lamb. Redeemed. How I love to proclaim it his child and forever I am. I know I shall see in his beauty. I the king in whose law I delight. Who lovingly guardeth my footsteps and guideth me songs in the night. Redeemed. Redeemed. Redeemed by the blood of the lamb. Redeemed. How I love to proclaim it. His child and forever. I am. Good morning, good evening, good afternoon our lovely viewer from wherever you're watching us from. This is our cornerstone connections lesson. Lesson number nine and our lesson topic for today is not love at first sight. Our amazing panelists will take us through the whole lesson and I would ask that we introduce ourselves starting from my far left. My name is Lexand Pipim Oni and I am happy to be here with you today. My name is Albright Mora. My name is Terot and my name is Aron Pio and my name is Alvin Moses. I'll be your moderator for today. So, as we've said, our story for today is not love at first sight. But before we go into the lesson, we would like to fellowship in a word of prayer from Tera. Let's bow our heads for a word of prayer. Heavenly Father, I thank you for bringing us here. I thank you for loving us. I thank you for the gift of life. I thank you for good health and I thank you for everything you have provided for me and for my fellow panelists. I thank you for giving me the gift of knowledge and understanding for me to educate my fellow viewers on what we'll be talking about today. Thank you for everything you have provided from shelter to food to clothing for we do not take it for granted for most people do not have what we have. I thank you for the gift of knowledge and understanding and wisdom and I thank you for everything else. We do not want to we want to explain your holy name and make sure we praise you and for what I have not prayed for I put it into your holy hands in Jesus name we pray. Amen. Amen. Amen. Our story for today comes from the gospel of Luke 5 27-39. But before we dig deeper into our lesson, we first have to understand what does the topic not love at first sight mean to you? Like when you when you just see the topic not love at first sight, what emotions does does it evoke? All right. Um what I think about first when I hear the title is someone who isn't seen as someone who can be loved when the they're first seen. Yeah. Upon first sight, right? Yeah. That that is our basic understanding of the topic. But now we want to look at it in a godly way. We want to look at it from a biblical perspective and you uh we'll look at the story of Levi that will be our key character. We'll also look at Jesus and we'll look at the relationship between the two. But before we go that in the same spirit of what we think, Pip will take us through the what do you think section. Okay. In 2001, a huge money scandal involving a corporation was revealed. Many employees stole hundred millions of dollars while the victims lost all the money, the pensions, and sometimes even their homes. How would you react if one of these employees who was guilty of destroying people's lives came to your church? Aaron, how do you feel? Um, if one of those victims who destroyed the place came to my church, in a real life situation, I would be very angry and I would try to like like I would shout at them and do mean things to them. But if you take it in a Christian perspective, you'd probably want to forgive them. Yeah, that's a very realistic answer. What about you all? Bright. Um, I believe I'd be angry, but I would try not to show it. I'd try to avoid the person. And you, Terica? Realistically, I would see it as something strange for I would view it in a way of why are you here? Because you have destroyed so much and very very judgmental. But but the Christian thing to do is you should forgive them and leave it to God's hands. Yes. I think I would first of all see it in my second point of view would also be maybe they had a reason or maybe they've been misunderstood. So I'd try to see that point of view as well. Amen. So yeah, that's that's basically what we think and the answers that they've given are very realistic ways um of the human reaction to particular activities to different happenings and this is a scandal. The reaction to the scandal is quite different to how people would react to a good thing and it's quite different to how other people would react to maybe uh bad news like death. So we want to see how the Pharisees reacted to the news when they heard the news that Jesus had actually come and picked the tax collector instead of everybody else. And during these times um just to have a a small synopsis during these times uh tax collectors worked for the Romans and they were really hated. So on top of hating the tax collectors people felt like they were liars. people felt like they were the most sinful people. And then there's this one trait that Christ actually saw in Levi that made him to pick Levi over all the Pharisees that will make him pick somebody over all the church elders over the church pastor. And this person is not maybe meeting the minimum standards that have been set by the church. And in this instance, we're talking about the Pharisees. So our story today comes from the book of Luke 5 27-39. Tera will take us through. But before that just to uh to give us a brief uh outlook on it on what to on what to watch out as she's reading. First we're watching out for the man named Levi who's the key person in our story and what he was doing. He was a tax collector and how Jesus came in and how the Pharisees reacted to it. So Terica, you can read it for us. Okay. So we will be in the book of Luke 5 27-39. Love your enemies. But I say to you who hear, love your enemies. Do good to those who hate you. Bless those who curse you and pray for those who spitefully use you. To him who strikes you on the one cheek, offer the other as also. And from him who takes away your clock, do not hold your tunic either. Give to everyone who asks for of you. and from him who takes away your goods, do not take them back. And just as you want men to do to you, you also do to them likewise. But if you love those who love you, what credit is that to you? For even sinners love those who love them. But if you love those who love you, and if you do good to those who do good to you, what credit is that for you? For even sinners do the same. And if you lend to those from whom you hope to receive back, what credit is that to you? For even sinners lend to sinners to receive as much back. But love your enemies. Do good and lend hoping for nothing in return. And your reward will be great, and you will be sons of the most high, for he is kind to unthankful and evil. Therefore, be merciful, just as your father also is merciful. Judge not, and you shall not be judged. Condemn not and you shall not be condemned. Forgive and you will be forgiven. Give and it will be given to you. Good measure pressed down, shaken together, and running over will be put into your bosom. For the with the same measure that you use, it will be measured back to you. And he spoke a parable to them. Can the blind lead the blind? Will they not fall into the ditch? Amen. And I'd like to point out to to a few key factors before um Opio tells us uh uh paraphrases the verses. I'd like to point out to Luke 5 from 36. Um the scripture is talking about a parable. And the parable is the parable of the new garment on an old one. And Jesus says, "No one tears a patch from a new garment and sew it on an old one." And this is implying that his teachings which are symbolized by the new garments cannot simply be added to the old righteous practices of the Pharisees and other Jewish uh Jewish traditions which is symbolized by the old garments. Now when he talks about the new wine in old wine skins, the parable in other versions is saying that no one pours new wine into old wine skins and the wine skins were made of leather. So this would stretch when wine is fermented and if new wine which is still fermenting was put into old uh brittle wine skins they would burst because of the overstretching you know and this represented the idea that Jesus's new covenant which involves uh the holy spirit which involves grace and mercy cannot be obtained within the old ways of religious laws and rituals. That was the part that we needed to understand at the end of um uh the into the story section. So Opio would give us a brief summary of the into the story section and lead us to the out of the story where we would answer a few questions about the story. Okay. Thank you. Um in the into the story section it tells us that uh Jesus called Levi uh despised publican to be his disciple. Despite his profess profession and feeling of unworthiness, Matthew had been touched by Jesus teachings. When Jesus simply said follow me, Matthew immediately left his lucrative business to follow him. Overjoyed, Matthew hosted a feast to introduce his former colleagues to Jesus. When the Pharisees heard it, it drew a lot of no the this drew criticism from the Pharisees who questioned Jesus' association with sinners. Jesus responded that he came to seek and save the lost like a physi a physician attending to the sick emphasizing his mission to bring light to those in darkness. Thank you. Amen. So uh what what Aaron is trying to say is that Jesus shows love to everyone even those societal rejects and he calls us to do the same because to look uh at people based on what they do is quite not Christian and it is not a grounds that Christ will do that on. So I'd like to pose a question to the panelists that what do you think Jesus meant when he said no one outputs a piece from a new garment and an old one which I've talked about otherwise the new makes a te makes a tear and also the piece that was taken out of the new does not match the old according to your perspective when you read that what comes to your head even if it is not the whole parable aspect of it how do you relate that to your life that you cannot take something old and place it on something new that you have to let the past be the past. So Albreight, what do you think? Okay, so um the parable itself, I believe it was referring to how Jesus was talking about how the message that he was teaching was different from the message that the religious teachers had been teaching. So they were not to mix the two because they were entirely two different things. So how I think I can apply that to my day-to-day life. I can't take old things like I can't take the teachings of my grandparents and apply them to modern day world. Not all of them at least because things have changed and times have passed, right? Yeah, that's quite true. And pip him. Do you think Jesus worried about what others might think of him befriending such unpopular people like tax collectors who are considered sinners during the times? No, not really. Because um Jesus, he didn't really care about what people thought about him. He just wanted to um pass his message to the people. And what was his message? erh to seek and save the lost. to seek and save the lost. Amen. Thank you so much for that. So um what we are trying to say is that in as much as we feel like uh some people do not meet the minimum standards to attain a certain thing. Mostly when it comes to uh scripture and script uh spiritual matters, we we tend to leave them behind and we tend to to think that they are not worthy to be in church. And sometimes you invite someone to church then the person is like um invited me to church but yet you are a wrongdoer. The things that you do do not actually reflect what you are telling me. You tell somebody come to church. Then tomorrow a Sabbath comes and you have gone for a birthday party. The person comes to church alone. So you're just sending them to church. They'll be like why are you doing this? And as we always say in the book of Neahmiah uh the cup bearer to the king was supposed to take the king's food or the king's uh meal before the king did it. This was because he was to um confirm to the king that there was no bad thing in it. Or rather in modern times somebody will be like have you put anything in my drink? Drink it first then I drink it. Why? Because they want to see you doing the thing so that they can trust that if you can do it then I can do it. So some people end up judging people. And have you have you ever met somebody then you're like um this is not somebody who's worthy? Has anyone of you met somebody and you're like this one has to be a sinner or you're just like this one has to be a poor this one has to be you know uh a a a prostitute in the streets. Have you ever met somebody and you're like no this one can't be a Christian? Has anyone of you encountered such an occasion? I have. Tell us about it. Um there are many scenarios where I think you'll just walk around the streets and you'll see someone in poverty then you'll automatically judge them for like maybe they committed a crime or maybe they did drugs and spent all that money and I think that's generally the perspective we have nowadays in our generation especially we are very judgmental so I think it's mostly in the way of we always judge a book by its cover but pimp pim have you ever had an experience as much um personally Sometimes I I look at someone, I see I feel like they're not a Christian, but then I know I shouldn't judge deep down. What about you, Aio? Um, see, another way we can look at someone is like one day I was walking and I see somebody's clothes. uh they're rugged and they reveal a lot. With that in my mind, I can think they are prostitute or they're poor. So the Bible tells us that we're not supposed to judge others, supposed to leave that to God. And yeah, that's what I think we should do. That's very true. Now, we've talked about it from this perspective. Let's imagine it from the other person's perspective, the other person's point of view and let's put ourselves um in Levi's shoes. Uh do you think Levi himself felt unworthy when Jesus said follow me? Like you know uh when when Jesus had been selecting disciples, he wasn't really choosing the top uh in the society, the rich the richest peoples, the kings, the church scribes. I mean he went to the fishermen, they felt unworthy. He came to Levi. Do you think he was feeling unworthy? Yes. Cuz in Ages chapter 28, it tells us that he had feelings of unworthiness. But despite that, he was touched by the teachings of Jesus. So when Jesus simply called him, when Jesus said, "Follow me," he immediately went to him. And yeah, and what is this thing that Jesus saw in Levi to just go to Levi and not a Pharisee, not another tax collectors? Cuz there were many tax collectors, some of whom even dined with Levi and Christ uh at Levi's uh own house. What was this theme, Albright, that you think Christ saw in Levi? There's a particular trait that we want to to unlock that Levi had. Um, I believe that Christ saw someone who was willing to change. Someone who was waiting for someone else to point them in the right direction. Someone who was willing to look past his past errors and think of him as someone who just needed forgiveness and acceptance. You know, he is a god of second chances. I'm sure he he saw Levi and he was like he could change. And it is true. He actually changed. And now to put ourselves uh in the clothes of the Pharisees or rather the people who are watching like now if uh Christ was to come and he picks the worst of the worst you know there's that person he could change then there's Christ then there's us who are watching now that's the Pharisees what do you think or rather why because we know they were angry why do you think the Pharisees were angry may answer. I think they were upset because they thought they were most holy and Jesus was picking one of the most judged people like tax collectors and people that were sort of sinners. But I think the most realistic verse was from the book of Psalms um chapter 139 verse 16. Your eyes saw my unfolded substance. in your book were written. Every one of them, the days that were formed for me, when as yet therefore was none of them, I think personally they were just angry because they were like, "You picked someone who was a sinner over the people that were most holy in their eyes." Yeah. True, true. And also um in 1st Samuel 16:7 uh it says but the Lord said to Samuel do not look on his appearance or on the height of his nature but I have reject because I have rejected him for the Lord sees not a man sees man looks on the outward appearance but the Lord looks in the heart. The Lord is always going for in your uh whatever the content of your heart. You might be forced to do something. Of course, sometimes we do wrong things knowingly, but sometimes you are forced to do a particular job. You're forced to go to work on Sabbath. But there's a way you can counterattack that because of how you love Jesus and what is in your heart. And that is what Lord is looking for. He doesn't care about your physical appearance. He doesn't care about your status in uh the economical world. He doesn't care about your social class. It is what is in your heart. So speaking of that, Leng White in the testimonies for the church that is page 11 says that uh read for us in the further insight. When God's people are truly converted, when they realize the obligation resting on them to labor for those with within their reach, when they leave no means and tried to rescue sinners from the power of the enemy, the reproach will be removed from our churches. Amen. uh we usually allude our lessons to the desire of ages because in as much as we look at scripture there is a way other uh works of art from LG White or other writers connect us or rather give us a deeper understanding of what our lesson is talking about. So for the lesson today uh we were looking at desire of ages chapter 28 and it had a very good connection between our student lesson and our uh the spirit of prophecy. So saron would you take us through that the desire of ages? Yes. Um, the Desire of Ages was talking about Levi Matthew and it it said Levi Matthew was a despised publican and Jesus still called him to to be his disciple. Despite his profession and feeling of unworthiness, Matthew had been touched by Jesus's teachings. When Jesus simply said, "Follow me," Matthew immediately left his lucrative business to follow him. Overjoyed, Matthew hosted a feast to introduce his former colleagues to Jesus. This drew a lot of criticism from the Pharisees who questioned Jesus' association with sinners. Jesus responded that he came to call sinners to repentance like a physician attending to the sick emphasizing his mission to bring light to those in darkness. the chapter um it illustrates the trans the transformative power of Jesus call and his willingness to embrace outcasts highlighting that true disciplehip requires complete commitment. That's very true. Yeah, it's we can allude that to our scripture. uh scripture reading. It it is it is very clear that when Christ comes uh the second time, we all want to go with him. We all want to go back to heaven with him. If we if he comes during our times, we want to go. If he comes while we dead, we want to resurrect to be at the holy and to go up with him. And how do we do this? We do this by living a very righteous life and understanding that whenever we sin, he gives us a chance for forgiveness. Um Christ is a Christ of second uh chances. He gave uh Levi a second chance. No matter how much of a sinner he was, corrupt tax collectors. Uh everybody hated him. And during those times, tax collectors were were seen as traitors and nobody could accept them to their homes. They I mean they could come to someone's door then they knock and somebody locks the door instead. But then Christ saw that this is a person who could actually be changed. He forgave him because he decided to give his life to Christ. And there are many ways in which us as teenagers can give our lives to Christ. We can decide to be baptized. We can decide to confess. We can decide to be redeemed. We just have to find a way to access the kingdom. And we all have the key to the kingdom which is righteousness. We have to have to be righteous. And on top of that, the spirit of prophecy tells us that we have to spread the message to all the four corners of the world. But before that, the man of sin won't be identified and Christ will not come before that. And so back to our lesson, it teaches us that uh we our past does not really matter in whatever in uh predicting our future. Of course, there is the biblical understanding of past events to uh predict future occurrences like when Christ said when God said that he will give us a son through a Virgin Mary that happened promised us that he would die and resurrect die for our sins and that still happened and now he's promising us that he will come a second time and we believe as Christians that that will still happen but that will only happen if the things that we have talked about as the panel are put into action and connecting that to life is that every day of the week we have a scripture reading. Every day of the week we have a summarized wellput uh uh synopsis so that every day we can be able to come back to our cornerstone lesson and understand what is it is talking about. Some days have the spirit of prophecy. Some days have questions. Some days have the punchlines. Some days have scripture. We usually come back to the days from Sabbath to Friday. And that is what we want to look at as we finish our lesson for today. We want to connect this to life and see how scripture for every day of this week will be able to help us redeem ourselves to look out for salvation and to look out for the second coming. on Sabbath we will do John 3 John 6:37 and Pip will take us through that okay the church is one body with many members called from every nation kindred tongue and people in Christ we are a new creation distinction distinctions of race culture learning and nationality ity and difference and differences between high and low, rich and poor, male and female must not be divisive among us. We are all equal in Christ who by one spirit has bonded us into one fellowship with him and with one other one one another. We are to serve and be served without partially partiality or reservation. The body of Christ 7th day Adventist fundamental belief number 14. Jesus said all that the father gives me will come to me and whoever comes to me I will never cast out. Jesus sought out sinners and accepting and accepted them. He sought out people whom most of society hated. Instead of seeking to be at the home of the of a well-known or wellrespected Jewish leader, he desired to be the guest of a sinner, someone deemed an outcast in society, so that he might give that person the hope of salvation. Terica um can you name one way in which we can follow Jesus example in in accepting others? I think maybe we should never judge someone instantly. Maybe we should take time to know who they are before we even make assumptions. Amen. What about you, Aaron? Um, I think we can invite the people who don't know like to church. Like let's say you have a friend at home and they're not really Christian or they're Christian but they do come to church can invite them and they can learn where they're in church. That's a very nice point. That's very true. And you all right? Um I think you can help those in need and show kindness to everyone. Okay. So on Sunday we are reading from 2 Chronicles 7:14. And what we are getting from it is that it is sort of an encouragement that whenever you feel unworthy of something or whenever you've tried something and done something that dis dishonors God or somebody else in return, there's always a chance for forgiveness. There's always a chance for second uh trials. There is mercy and grace that comes with a good Christian life, a life well-lived and a life that is lived faithfully. On Monday, we will uh we read from James 5:20. Uh Albright, you would read that one verse. James 5:20 as Aaron open opens John 10:1 and Tera open John 6:37. and it okay so James 5 verse 20 says remember this whoever turns a sinner from the error of their ways will save them from death and cover over a m multitude of sins amen that is very clear and it's what we have talked about that our reputation should not be able to tell our future should not be able to tell what we do in future. We should be categorical about what we want with our Christian lives and we should have the understanding about what comes next after making a certain step. John 10:1 uh John 10:1 says I am the good shepherd the good shepherd lays down his life for the sheep. Amen. Amen. And on Wednesday we talked about James 4:1 11-12 that rather than look on the outside of people, we must also try and see the inside. When you see somebody and you rush to judge, maybe have a session to talk to them about one or two things related to Christianity. Then from there you can be able to judge who they really are. And if they are not saved, you can bring them to salvation. And if they are saved, you can help them continue walking in salvation. Then on Thursday, we read first Samuel verse 6, chapter 16:7. And that in this day and image in modern times, it is very crucial that that we keep our image. In as much as Christ does not look at our image, sometimes we may end up being overjudged or rather overlooked and miss some of the opportunities that come our way. Like people look at you in such a way that your image is talked about everywhere because of the rise in social media, magazines, television. The moment you set up a bad stage, nobody wants to come back to you. But there's a way of which you can come back to that through prayer and forgiveness. But before you get to that stage, you should have a way to moderate yourself to know how to appear in public. You should understand scripture and how it relates to how to appear in public and how to be a good steward of Christ. Then John 6:37. Okay. All that the all that the Father gives me will come to me. And the one who comes to me, I will by no means cast out. For I have come down from heaven not to do my own will but the will of him who sent me. Amen. So that has been our lesson for today. And even as we finish the lesson, the key points that we want to walk out of this is that Christ does not look at your outer self. Christ is a Christ of second chances. He's a forgiving Lord. And in as much as we do wrong, we should know how to come back to it and apologize. We should learn how to be faithful. We should learn how to be we should be saved. And if not, we should learn how to deal with other people mostly when it comes to this social media era, this area of magazine, cyber bullying and all that. We thank you so much for joining us today in this lesson and may God bless you as we finish with a word of prayer from Pipim. I trust that all of you are well and let's meet next time. Okay, let's bow down for a word of prayer. Thank you God for this day. Thank you for the gift of life. Thank you for bringing us this far. And now as we close our lesson study, may you be with us. help us to put everything that we've learned into our our daily lives and protect us in everything we do. In Jesus name I pray. Amen. Amen. 

==================================================

TIMESTAMPED TRANSCRIPT:
[0.2s] Welcome. My name is Furaha and today's
[2.6s] mission comes from Thailand. When Mafong
[5.0s] was four, she was given an animal
[7.2s] cookie. Grandma had bought the cookie at
[10.0s] a mall in Thailand and she gave it to
[12.3s] mom to give to Mafang. The little girl
[15.4s] happily ate the cookie. It tasted so
[17.8s] sweet and good. But then something scary
[20.2s] happened. Her eyes got red and puffy and
[22.6s] she couldn't breathe. Mom was very
[25.0s] scared and she rushed Mafong to the
[26.9s] hospital. The doctor said Mafang was
[29.0s] allergic to wheat gluten. That meant she
[32.6s] couldn't eat any more animal cookies. It
[35.7s] also meant that she couldn't eat
[37.3s] anything made with flour. That that that
[40.7s] was hard for the little girl, but her
[43.2s] health depended on it. Before she ate
[45.5s] anything, she had to to check first to
[48.2s] see if it contained flour. So after
[50.5s] that, when Mafang wanted a hamburger at
[53.3s] a fast food restaurant, she only ate
[55.8s] that. She only ate the patty and the and
[59.1s] the cheese. She couldn't eat the bun and
[61.5s] she put it in the trash. When she
[63.3s] ordered a pizza, she only ate the cheese
[65.6s] and the toppings. She couldn't eat the
[67.6s] crust and she put the crust in the
[70.2s] trash. At the at birthday parties, she
[72.9s] ate the frosting of the birthday cake
[75.4s] and put the rest in the trash. Once she
[77.6s] leaked the frosting off a donut and
[80.0s] asked her friends, "Does anyone want a
[83.0s] donut? A donut?" No one did. So she put
[86.1s] it in the trash. One day when Mafong was
[88.5s] nine, she decided to play a prank. She
[91.4s] was sitting at the table for supper with
[94.4s] grandma and grandpa in the dining table
[97.1s] in the dining room of their house in the
[99.5s] city of in the city of Korat. Mom was in
[102.5s] the kitchen and dad wasn't home. On the
[104.6s] table was a meal of rice, fried fried
[107.4s] eggs, and
[109.6s] thin stuffed pancakes. Mafang knew that
[113.4s] her supper was only the rice and fried
[115.9s] eggs. She needed to stay away from
[118.3s] pancakes because they contained flour.
[120.8s] But she wanted to see what grandma and
[122.6s] grandpa would do if she ate pancake. So
[125.2s] she grabbed a pancake with her hand and
[127.8s] bit off part of it. Grandma and grandpa
[130.0s] were shocked. What are you doing?
[131.8s] Grandma cried. Don't swallow it. Grandpa
[134.3s] exclaimed at the at that moment. As
[136.8s] Mafang grabbed and ate part of the
[139.3s] pancake, mom came out of the kitchen.
[142.3s] She looked on on with horror at what was
[147.2s] happening. Mafang thought that her prank
[150.2s] was funny, but she didn't have a plan on
[152.5s] what to do next. Suddenly, a strong
[155.0s] desire over came her to spit out the
[156.9s] pancake. She had never felt that way
[159.1s] before. She felt like the pancake was a
[161.9s] disgusting piece of garbage in her mouth
[164.4s] and she wanted to put it in the trash.
[166.6s] Mafang jumped out of her chair. She ran
[170.0s] across the room to a trash bin in the
[172.0s] corner. Standing over it, she spit the
[174.9s] pancake out of her mouth. Mom, Grandma,
[177.4s] and Grandpa heaved a sigh of relief.
[180.9s] They were so glad that she had she had
[183.1s] spit it out. Never do that again because
[185.3s] you could get really really sick. Mom
[187.6s] said Mafang didn't say anything. She
[190.3s] didn't know what to say, but she thought
[192.3s] a lot about the unusual desire that had
[195.6s] overcome her to spit out the pancake
[197.7s] like a piece of garbage. She pondered it
[201.3s] for a long time. She wondered what
[203.6s] happened. Who gave me the desire to spit
[205.8s] out the the pancake? Then she remembered
[208.8s] her school where she was studying in the
[210.9s] fourth grade. She had learned at the
[213.4s] Seventh Day Adventist mission school
[215.4s] about the God of heaven who created all
[218.5s] people and cares for them. She had
[221.3s] learned at the school to pray to God in
[223.8s] the morning and in the evening. Mafong
[226.1s] had an answer. The the God of heaven who
[229.4s] created her and cared for her had filled
[231.8s] her with the strong desire to spit out
[234.2s] the
[235.0s] pancake. God had saved her life. I know
[238.1s] that that it must be God. Mafang said,
[241.3s] "If I had swallowed the pancake, I might
[244.5s] have been sent to the hospital. I think
[247.1s] God is nice because he helps anyone who
[249.6s] needs anything." Mafang now studies in
[252.4s] Korat Adventist International School in
[255.0s] Thailand where many children like her
[257.6s] come from families who do not know
[260.3s] God. Um let's let's pray. Dear God, um
[264.9s] thank you for this day that you have
[266.2s] given us. Please protect us and guide us
[268.3s] throughout this day. Please heal the
[270.2s] sick people. Please forgive our sins.
[272.5s] Thank you for everything that you have
[273.8s] done for us. And whatever prayed for,
[276.4s] not prayed for, may the Holy Spirit
[278.2s] intercede it. In Jesus name we pray and
[279.8s] believe.
[280.8s] Amen.
[282.3s] Redeemed how I love to proclaim it.
[287.0s] Redeemed by the blood of the lamb.
[291.8s] Redeemed through his infinite mercy. his
[296.6s] child and forever. I
[300.1s] am
[302.7s] redeemed.
[305.2s] Redeemed, redeemed by the blood of the
[309.8s] lamb. Redeemed through his infinite
[314.8s] mercy, his child and forever I
[319.5s] am. I think of my blessed redeemer. I
[326.0s] think of him all the day long. I sing
[331.8s] for I cannot be silent. His child and
[336.4s] forever I
[338.8s] am
[341.3s] redeemed.
[343.8s] Redeemed. Redeemed by the blood of the
[348.4s] lamb. Redeemed.
[351.2s] How I love to proclaim it his child and
[355.6s] forever I
[358.0s] am. I know I shall see in his beauty. I
[364.4s] the king in whose law I delight. Who
[371.2s] lovingly guardeth my footsteps and
[374.5s] guideth me songs in the night.
[380.8s] Redeemed.
[383.2s] Redeemed. Redeemed by the blood of the
[387.9s] lamb.
[389.5s] Redeemed. How I love to proclaim it. His
[393.8s] child and forever. I am.
[398.0s] Good morning, good evening, good
[399.8s] afternoon our lovely viewer from
[401.7s] wherever you're watching us from. This
[403.9s] is our cornerstone connections lesson.
[406.7s] Lesson number nine and our lesson topic
[409.5s] for today is not love at first sight.
[412.3s] Our amazing panelists will take us
[414.3s] through the whole lesson and I would ask
[416.5s] that we introduce ourselves starting
[418.5s] from my far left.
[420.9s] My name is Lexand Pipim Oni and I am
[424.2s] happy to be here with you today. My name
[427.2s] is Albright Mora.
[430.3s] My name is Terot
[432.7s] and my name is Aron Pio and my name is
[435.2s] Alvin Moses. I'll be your moderator for
[437.2s] today. So, as we've said, our story for
[440.0s] today is not love at first sight. But
[441.9s] before we go into the lesson, we would
[443.8s] like to fellowship in a word of prayer
[446.0s] from Tera. Let's bow our heads for a
[448.2s] word of prayer. Heavenly Father, I thank
[450.4s] you for bringing us here. I thank you
[451.5s] for loving us. I thank you for the gift
[453.0s] of life. I thank you for good health and
[455.6s] I thank you for everything you have
[457.1s] provided for me and for my fellow
[459.3s] panelists. I thank you for giving me the
[461.9s] gift of knowledge and understanding for
[463.5s] me to educate my fellow viewers on what
[465.9s] we'll be talking about today. Thank you
[468.2s] for everything you have provided from
[469.8s] shelter to food to clothing for we do
[471.8s] not take it for granted for most people
[474.0s] do not have what we have. I thank you
[476.5s] for the gift of knowledge and
[477.8s] understanding and wisdom and I thank you
[480.2s] for everything else. We do not want to
[483.4s] we want to explain your holy name and
[485.5s] make sure we praise you and for what I
[487.7s] have not prayed for I put it into your
[489.5s] holy hands in Jesus name we pray. Amen.
[492.0s] Amen. Amen. Our story for today comes
[495.4s] from the gospel of
[497.1s] Luke 5
[499.5s] 27-39. But before we dig deeper into our
[502.6s] lesson, we first have to understand what
[505.2s] does the topic not love at first sight
[507.8s] mean to you? Like when you when you just
[510.9s] see the topic not love at first sight,
[512.6s] what emotions does does it evoke? All
[515.3s] right.
[517.3s] Um what I think about first when I hear
[519.7s] the title
[521.1s] is someone who
[524.5s] isn't seen as someone who can be
[527.5s] loved when the they're first seen. Yeah.
[530.8s] Upon first sight, right? Yeah. That that
[533.5s] is our basic understanding of the topic.
[535.5s] But now we want to look at it in a godly
[537.5s] way. We want to look at it from a
[539.3s] biblical perspective and you uh we'll
[541.9s] look at the story of Levi that will be
[544.4s] our key character. We'll also look at
[546.6s] Jesus and we'll look at the relationship
[548.3s] between the two. But before we go that
[550.5s] in the same spirit of what we think, Pip
[553.5s] will take us through the what do you
[554.8s] think
[560.2s] section. Okay.
[564.0s] In 2001, a huge money scandal involving
[567.6s] a corporation was revealed. Many
[571.1s] employees stole hundred millions of
[573.6s] dollars while the victims lost all the
[576.2s] money, the pensions, and sometimes even
[579.4s] their homes. How would you react if one
[581.8s] of these employees who was guilty of
[584.3s] destroying people's lives came to your
[587.2s] church?
[588.8s] Aaron, how do you feel? Um, if one of
[592.0s] those victims who destroyed the place
[594.8s] came to my
[598.2s] church, in a real life situation, I
[600.7s] would be very angry
[603.0s] and I would try to like
[606.8s] like I would shout at them and do mean
[610.1s] things to them.
[612.2s] But if you take it in a Christian
[616.0s] perspective, you'd probably want to
[618.4s] forgive them. Yeah, that's a very
[621.0s] realistic answer. What about you all?
[623.2s] Bright. Um, I believe I'd be angry, but
[626.6s] I would try not to show it. I'd try to
[628.5s] avoid the person.
[631.0s] And you, Terica?
[633.6s] Realistically, I would see it as
[636.0s] something strange for I would view it in
[639.0s] a way of why are you here? Because you
[641.0s] have destroyed so much and very very
[643.3s] judgmental.
[645.5s] But but the Christian thing to do is you
[648.8s] should forgive them and leave it to
[650.6s] God's hands. Yes. I think I would first
[653.9s] of all see it in my second point of view
[656.6s] would also be maybe they had a reason or
[659.4s] maybe they've been misunderstood. So I'd
[661.5s] try to see that point of view as well.
[664.9s] Amen. So yeah, that's that's basically
[667.5s] what we think and the answers that
[670.6s] they've given are very realistic ways um
[673.7s] of the human reaction to particular
[676.1s] activities to different happenings and
[678.7s] this is a scandal. The reaction to the
[681.0s] scandal is quite different to how people
[682.9s] would react to a good thing and it's
[685.3s] quite different to how other people
[686.6s] would react to maybe uh bad news like
[689.4s] death. So we want to see how the
[691.8s] Pharisees reacted to the news when they
[694.2s] heard the news that Jesus had actually
[696.7s] come and picked the tax collector
[698.9s] instead of everybody else. And during
[702.2s] these times um just to have a a small
[705.9s] synopsis during these times uh tax
[708.5s] collectors worked for the Romans and
[710.6s] they were really hated. So on top of
[713.5s] hating the tax collectors people felt
[715.8s] like they were liars. people felt like
[718.5s] they were the most sinful people. And
[720.8s] then there's this one trait that Christ
[723.9s] actually saw in Levi that made him to
[727.0s] pick Levi over all the Pharisees that
[729.4s] will make him pick somebody over all the
[731.2s] church elders over the church pastor.
[733.2s] And this person is not maybe meeting the
[735.8s] minimum standards that have been set by
[738.0s] the church. And in this instance, we're
[740.2s] talking about the Pharisees. So our
[742.3s] story today comes from the book of Luke
[744.6s] 5 27-39. Tera will take us through. But
[748.3s] before that just to
[751.6s] uh to give us a brief uh outlook on it
[755.8s] on what to on what to watch out as she's
[757.8s] reading. First we're watching out for
[759.6s] the man named Levi who's the key person
[761.4s] in our story and what he was doing. He
[763.5s] was a tax collector and how Jesus came
[765.8s] in and how the Pharisees reacted to it.
[768.0s] So Terica, you can read it for us. Okay.
[771.1s] So we will be in the book of Luke 5
[774.8s] 27-39. Love your enemies. But I say to
[778.2s] you who hear, love your enemies. Do good
[781.3s] to those who hate you. Bless those who
[783.4s] curse you and pray for those who
[785.4s] spitefully use you. To him who strikes
[788.2s] you on the one cheek, offer the other as
[791.5s] also. And from him who takes away your
[794.1s] clock, do not hold your tunic either.
[797.5s] Give to everyone who asks for of you.
[800.2s] and from him who takes away your goods,
[803.0s] do not take them back. And just as you
[805.4s] want men to do to you, you also do to
[808.2s] them likewise. But if you love those who
[810.4s] love you, what credit is that to you?
[813.4s] For even sinners love those who love
[816.2s] them. But if you love those who love
[818.8s] you, and if you do good to those who do
[821.7s] good to you, what credit is that for
[824.6s] you? For even sinners do the same. And
[827.7s] if you lend to those from whom you hope
[830.4s] to receive back, what credit is that to
[832.7s] you? For even sinners lend to sinners to
[835.3s] receive as much back. But love your
[837.4s] enemies. Do good and lend hoping for
[840.1s] nothing in return. And your reward will
[842.2s] be great, and you will be sons of the
[844.3s] most high, for he is kind to unthankful
[847.4s] and evil. Therefore, be merciful, just
[850.2s] as your father also is merciful. Judge
[854.1s] not, and you shall not be judged.
[856.5s] Condemn not and you shall not be
[858.4s] condemned. Forgive and you will be
[860.7s] forgiven. Give and it will be given to
[863.1s] you. Good measure pressed down, shaken
[866.2s] together, and running over will be put
[868.3s] into your
[869.6s] bosom. For the with the same measure
[872.7s] that you use, it will be measured back
[874.7s] to you. And he spoke a parable to them.
[878.0s] Can the blind lead the blind? Will they
[880.3s] not fall into the ditch? Amen. And I'd
[884.5s] like to point out to to a few key
[887.7s] factors before um Opio tells us uh uh
[891.8s] paraphrases the verses. I'd like to
[894.3s] point out to Luke 5 from 36. Um the
[898.7s] scripture is talking about a parable.
[900.4s] And the parable is the parable of the
[902.0s] new garment on an old one. And Jesus
[905.1s] says, "No one tears a patch from a new
[907.3s] garment and sew it on an old one." And
[910.4s] this is implying that his teachings
[912.2s] which are symbolized by the new garments
[914.5s] cannot simply be added to the old
[916.6s] righteous practices of the Pharisees and
[919.5s] other Jewish uh Jewish traditions which
[922.9s] is symbolized by the old garments. Now
[925.6s] when he talks about the new wine in old
[928.4s] wine skins, the parable in other
[931.7s] versions is saying that no one pours new
[933.8s] wine into old wine skins and the wine
[937.7s] skins were made of leather. So this
[940.9s] would stretch when wine is fermented and
[943.8s] if new wine which is still fermenting
[946.3s] was put into old
[948.8s] uh brittle wine skins they would burst
[951.3s] because of the overstretching you know
[953.4s] and this represented the idea that
[955.6s] Jesus's new covenant which involves uh
[958.3s] the holy spirit which involves grace and
[960.7s] mercy cannot be obtained within the old
[963.2s] ways of religious laws and rituals. That
[966.3s] was the part that we needed to
[967.5s] understand at the end of um uh the into
[970.6s] the story section. So Opio would give us
[972.7s] a brief summary of the into the story
[974.7s] section and lead us to the out of the
[976.6s] story where we would answer a few
[978.5s] questions about the story. Okay. Thank
[981.1s] you.
[982.3s] Um in the into the story section it
[986.6s] tells us that
[988.3s] uh Jesus called Levi
[992.0s] uh despised publican to be his disciple.
[995.5s] Despite his profess profession and
[998.2s] feeling of
[999.6s] unworthiness, Matthew had been touched
[1001.6s] by Jesus teachings. When Jesus simply
[1004.3s] said follow me, Matthew immediately left
[1007.0s] his lucrative business to follow him.
[1010.2s] Overjoyed, Matthew hosted a feast to
[1013.0s] introduce his former colleagues to
[1015.0s] Jesus. When the Pharisees heard it, it
[1018.8s] drew a lot of no the this drew criticism
[1023.0s] from the Pharisees who questioned Jesus'
[1025.7s] association with sinners. Jesus
[1029.3s] responded that he came to seek and save
[1032.2s] the
[1033.1s] lost like a physi a physician attending
[1037.2s] to the sick emphasizing his mission to
[1039.8s] bring light to those in darkness. Thank
[1042.1s] you. Amen. So
[1045.2s] uh what what Aaron is trying to say is
[1048.6s] that Jesus shows love to everyone even
[1051.5s] those societal rejects and he calls us
[1055.0s] to do the same because to look uh at
[1058.5s] people based on what they do is quite
[1061.6s] not Christian and it is not a grounds
[1064.1s] that Christ will do that on. So I'd like
[1066.5s] to pose a question to the panelists that
[1070.6s] what do you think Jesus meant when he
[1072.8s] said no one outputs a piece from a new
[1077.1s] garment and an old one which I've talked
[1078.9s] about otherwise the new makes a te makes
[1081.8s] a tear and also the piece that was taken
[1083.8s] out of the new does not match the old
[1086.5s] according to your perspective when you
[1088.4s] read that what comes to your head even
[1089.9s] if it is not the whole parable aspect of
[1093.1s] it how do you relate that to your life
[1095.6s] that you cannot take something old and
[1097.7s] place it on something new that you have
[1099.3s] to let the past be the past. So
[1101.3s] Albreight, what do you think? Okay, so
[1106.2s] um the parable itself, I believe it was
[1109.2s] referring to how Jesus
[1111.5s] was talking about how the message that
[1114.4s] he was teaching was different from the
[1116.1s] message that the religious teachers had
[1117.9s] been teaching. So they were not to mix
[1120.6s] the two because they were entirely two
[1122.4s] different things. So how I think I can
[1124.6s] apply that to my day-to-day life. I
[1127.5s] can't take old things
[1130.0s] like I can't take the teachings of my
[1134.3s] grandparents and apply them to modern
[1136.2s] day world. Not all of them at least
[1138.3s] because things have changed and times
[1140.3s] have passed, right?
[1143.6s] Yeah, that's quite true. And pip him. Do
[1146.8s] you think Jesus worried about what
[1148.4s] others might think of him befriending
[1150.6s] such unpopular people like tax
[1153.1s] collectors who are considered sinners
[1154.9s] during the times?
[1158.3s] No, not really. Because um Jesus, he
[1162.9s] didn't really care about what people
[1166.2s] thought about him. He just wanted to
[1170.7s] um pass his message to the people. And
[1174.5s] what was his message? erh to seek and
[1177.7s] save the lost. to seek and save the
[1179.8s] lost. Amen. Thank you so much for that.
[1183.0s] So um what we are trying to say is that
[1186.6s] in as much as we feel like uh some
[1190.2s] people do not meet the minimum standards
[1193.0s] to attain a certain thing. Mostly when
[1195.4s] it comes to uh scripture and script uh
[1198.2s] spiritual matters, we we tend to leave
[1202.2s] them behind and we tend to to think that
[1204.9s] they are not worthy to be in church. And
[1208.0s] sometimes you invite someone to church
[1210.6s] then the person is like
[1212.3s] um invited me to church but yet you are
[1215.3s] a wrongdoer. The things that you do do
[1217.2s] not actually reflect what you are
[1219.4s] telling me. You tell somebody come to
[1221.4s] church. Then tomorrow a Sabbath comes
[1225.1s] and you have gone for a birthday party.
[1227.7s] The person comes to church alone. So
[1229.4s] you're just sending them to church.
[1231.0s] They'll be like why are you doing this?
[1233.0s] And as we always say in the book of
[1235.0s] Neahmiah
[1236.7s] uh the cup bearer to the king was
[1239.6s] supposed to take the king's food or the
[1242.2s] king's uh meal before the king did it.
[1245.5s] This was because he was to
[1249.5s] um confirm to the king that there was no
[1251.7s] bad thing in it. Or rather in modern
[1253.7s] times somebody will be like have you put
[1255.3s] anything in my drink? Drink it first
[1257.3s] then I drink it. Why? Because they want
[1259.3s] to see you doing the thing so that they
[1261.1s] can trust that if you can do it then I
[1263.8s] can do it.
[1266.0s] So some people end up judging people.
[1269.4s] And have you have you ever met somebody
[1271.8s] then you're like um this is not somebody
[1275.1s] who's worthy? Has anyone of you met
[1277.4s] somebody and you're like this one has to
[1279.5s] be a sinner or you're just like this one
[1281.8s] has to be a poor this one has to be you
[1285.0s] know uh a a a prostitute in the streets.
[1288.3s] Have you ever met somebody and you're
[1289.5s] like no this one can't be a Christian?
[1292.5s] Has anyone of you encountered such an
[1294.5s] occasion? I have. Tell us about it.
[1298.8s] Um there are many scenarios where I
[1301.4s] think you'll just walk around the
[1302.8s] streets and you'll see someone in
[1304.3s] poverty then you'll automatically judge
[1306.7s] them for like maybe they committed a
[1309.0s] crime or maybe they did drugs and spent
[1311.2s] all that money and I think that's
[1313.0s] generally the perspective we have
[1314.5s] nowadays in our generation especially we
[1317.3s] are very judgmental so I think it's
[1319.2s] mostly in the way of we always judge a
[1320.7s] book by its cover but pimp pim have you
[1323.0s] ever had an experience as much
[1326.0s] um personally
[1328.9s] Sometimes I I look at someone, I see I
[1333.5s] feel like they're not a Christian, but
[1335.3s] then I know I shouldn't judge deep down.
[1340.6s] What about you, Aio?
[1343.2s] Um, see, another way we can look at
[1346.8s] someone is like one day I was walking
[1350.6s] and I see somebody's clothes.
[1353.6s] uh they're rugged and they reveal a lot.
[1356.8s] With that in my mind, I can think they
[1358.6s] are prostitute or they're
[1362.4s] poor. So the Bible tells us that we're
[1365.8s] not supposed to judge others, supposed
[1368.0s] to leave that to God. And yeah, that's
[1370.5s] what I think we should do. That's very
[1372.9s] true. Now, we've talked about it from
[1375.0s] this perspective. Let's imagine it from
[1377.4s] the other person's perspective, the
[1379.1s] other person's point of view and let's
[1381.2s] put ourselves um in Levi's shoes. Uh do
[1385.3s] you think Levi himself felt unworthy
[1388.4s] when Jesus said follow me? Like you know
[1391.7s] uh when when Jesus had been selecting
[1394.6s] disciples, he wasn't really choosing
[1397.3s] the top uh in the society, the rich the
[1400.9s] richest peoples, the kings, the church
[1404.3s] scribes. I mean he went to the
[1406.2s] fishermen, they felt unworthy. He came
[1408.4s] to Levi. Do you think he was feeling
[1409.9s] unworthy? Yes. Cuz in Ages chapter 28,
[1415.4s] it tells us that he had feelings of
[1419.9s] unworthiness. But despite that, he was
[1422.2s] touched by the teachings of Jesus. So
[1426.0s] when Jesus simply called him, when Jesus
[1429.4s] said, "Follow me," he immediately went
[1431.9s] to him. And yeah, and what is this thing
[1436.2s] that Jesus saw in Levi to just go to
[1438.5s] Levi and not a Pharisee, not another tax
[1441.7s] collectors? Cuz there were many tax
[1443.1s] collectors, some of whom even dined with
[1446.3s] Levi and Christ uh at Levi's uh own
[1450.2s] house. What was this theme, Albright,
[1452.9s] that you think Christ saw in Levi?
[1456.6s] There's a particular trait that we want
[1458.6s] to to unlock that Levi had. Um, I
[1462.4s] believe that Christ saw someone who was
[1465.1s] willing to change. Someone who was
[1467.1s] waiting for someone else to point them
[1469.8s] in the right direction. Someone who was
[1471.4s] willing to look past his past errors and
[1475.4s] think of him as someone who just needed
[1477.4s] forgiveness and acceptance.
[1482.2s] You know, he is a god of second chances.
[1484.0s] I'm sure he he saw Levi and he was like
[1487.4s] he could change. And it is true. He
[1489.5s] actually changed. And now to put
[1492.2s] ourselves
[1493.9s] uh in the clothes of the Pharisees or
[1497.1s] rather the people who are watching like
[1499.8s] now if uh Christ was to come and he
[1503.1s] picks the worst of the worst you know
[1505.6s] there's that person he could change then
[1507.9s] there's Christ then there's us who are
[1509.8s] watching now that's the Pharisees what
[1512.2s] do you
[1513.0s] think or rather why because we know they
[1515.5s] were angry why do you think the
[1516.6s] Pharisees were angry
[1518.8s] may
[1519.8s] answer. I think they were upset because
[1522.4s] they thought they were most holy and
[1525.6s] Jesus was picking one of the most judged
[1527.8s] people like tax collectors and people
[1530.0s] that were sort of sinners. But I think
[1534.6s] the most realistic verse was from the
[1538.5s] book of Psalms um chapter 139 verse 16.
[1542.9s] Your eyes saw my unfolded substance. in
[1545.4s] your book were written. Every one of
[1547.3s] them, the days that were formed for me,
[1549.7s] when as yet therefore was none of them,
[1553.6s] I think personally they were just angry
[1555.4s] because they were like, "You picked
[1557.5s] someone who was a sinner over the people
[1559.4s] that were most holy in their eyes."
[1562.6s] Yeah. True, true. And also um in 1st
[1565.0s] Samuel 16:7
[1567.0s] uh it says but the Lord said to Samuel
[1569.6s] do not look on his appearance or on the
[1571.9s] height of his nature but I have reject
[1574.8s] because I have rejected him for the Lord
[1577.1s] sees not a man sees man looks on the
[1579.9s] outward appearance but the Lord looks in
[1582.1s] the heart. The Lord is always going for
[1584.5s] in your uh whatever the content of your
[1587.0s] heart. You might be forced to do
[1589.7s] something. Of course, sometimes we do
[1591.8s] wrong things knowingly, but sometimes
[1593.8s] you are forced to do a particular job.
[1595.5s] You're forced to go to work on Sabbath.
[1597.3s] But there's a way you can counterattack
[1599.3s] that because of how you love Jesus and
[1602.0s] what is in your heart. And that is what
[1604.0s] Lord is looking for. He doesn't care
[1605.8s] about your physical appearance. He
[1607.6s] doesn't care about your status in uh the
[1610.0s] economical world. He doesn't care about
[1611.7s] your social class. It is what is in your
[1613.8s] heart. So speaking of that, Leng White
[1617.9s] in the testimonies for the church that
[1620.7s] is page 11 says that uh read for us in
[1624.6s] the further insight. When God's people
[1627.4s] are truly converted, when they realize
[1629.5s] the obligation resting on them to labor
[1632.0s] for those with within their reach, when
[1634.8s] they leave no means and tried to rescue
[1636.9s] sinners from the power of the enemy, the
[1638.9s] reproach will be removed from our
[1640.6s] churches. Amen.
[1643.4s] uh we usually allude our lessons to the
[1646.0s] desire of ages because in as much as we
[1649.2s] look at
[1650.2s] scripture there is a way other uh works
[1653.6s] of art from LG White or other writers
[1657.2s] connect us or rather give us a deeper
[1659.2s] understanding of what our lesson is
[1660.9s] talking about. So for the lesson today
[1664.1s] uh we were looking at desire of ages
[1666.2s] chapter 28 and it had a very good
[1668.8s] connection between our student lesson
[1671.1s] and our uh the spirit of prophecy. So
[1674.4s] saron would you take us through that the
[1676.8s] desire of ages? Yes.
[1680.5s] Um, the Desire of Ages was talking about
[1684.4s] Levi
[1685.6s] Matthew and it it said Levi Matthew was
[1689.2s] a despised
[1691.3s] publican and Jesus still called him to
[1694.3s] to be his disciple. Despite his
[1696.5s] profession and feeling of
[1698.1s] unworthiness, Matthew had been touched
[1700.2s] by Jesus's teachings. When Jesus simply
[1702.9s] said, "Follow me," Matthew immediately
[1705.0s] left his lucrative business to follow
[1707.0s] him.
[1708.7s] Overjoyed, Matthew hosted a feast to
[1711.0s] introduce his former colleagues to
[1712.8s] Jesus. This drew a lot of criticism from
[1716.3s] the Pharisees who questioned Jesus'
[1718.0s] association with sinners. Jesus
[1720.6s] responded that he came to call sinners
[1723.1s] to repentance like a physician attending
[1725.8s] to the sick emphasizing his mission to
[1728.9s] bring light to those in darkness. the
[1731.4s] chapter um it illustrates the trans the
[1734.4s] transformative power of Jesus call and
[1737.3s] his willingness to embrace outcasts
[1741.0s] highlighting that true disciplehip
[1744.4s] requires
[1746.3s] complete commitment.
[1749.3s] That's very true. Yeah, it's we can
[1752.4s] allude that to our scripture. uh
[1754.9s] scripture reading. It it is it is very
[1759.0s] clear that when Christ comes uh the
[1761.4s] second
[1762.4s] time, we all want to go with him. We all
[1765.6s] want to go back to heaven with him. If
[1767.7s] we if he comes during our times, we want
[1769.6s] to go. If he comes while we dead, we
[1771.1s] want to resurrect to be at the holy and
[1774.2s] to go up with him. And how do we do
[1776.3s] this? We do this by living a very
[1778.6s] righteous life and understanding that
[1781.2s] whenever we sin, he gives us a chance
[1783.9s] for forgiveness.
[1786.0s] Um Christ is a Christ of second uh
[1789.2s] chances. He gave uh Levi a second
[1792.1s] chance. No matter how much of a sinner
[1793.7s] he was, corrupt tax collectors. Uh
[1796.4s] everybody hated him. And during those
[1799.0s] times, tax collectors were were seen as
[1802.5s] traitors and nobody could accept them to
[1804.6s] their homes. They I mean they could come
[1806.5s] to someone's door then they knock and
[1808.6s] somebody locks the door instead. But
[1810.8s] then Christ saw that this is a person
[1813.1s] who could actually be changed. He
[1815.4s] forgave him because he decided to give
[1817.6s] his life to Christ. And there are many
[1819.4s] ways in which us as teenagers can give
[1821.7s] our lives to Christ. We can decide to be
[1823.8s] baptized. We can decide to confess. We
[1826.4s] can decide to be redeemed. We just have
[1828.5s] to find a way to access the kingdom. And
[1832.2s] we all have the key to the kingdom which
[1834.0s] is righteousness. We have to have to be
[1837.2s] righteous. And on top of
[1839.5s] that, the spirit of prophecy tells us
[1842.1s] that we have to spread the message to
[1844.4s] all the four corners of the world. But
[1846.2s] before that, the man of sin won't be
[1848.3s] identified and Christ will not come
[1850.1s] before that. And so back to our lesson,
[1853.9s] it teaches us that
[1856.7s] uh we our past does not really matter in
[1860.2s] whatever in uh predicting our future. Of
[1863.7s] course, there is the biblical
[1866.2s] understanding of past events to uh
[1869.3s] predict future occurrences like when
[1872.1s] Christ said when God said that he will
[1875.0s] give us a son through a Virgin Mary that
[1877.6s] happened promised us that he would die
[1879.8s] and resurrect die for our sins and that
[1882.2s] still happened and now he's promising us
[1884.6s] that he will come a second time and we
[1886.8s] believe as Christians that that will
[1888.6s] still happen but that will only happen
[1891.0s] if the things that we have talked about
[1892.6s] as the panel are put into
[1896.0s] action and connecting that to life is
[1900.1s] that every day of the week we have a
[1903.0s] scripture reading. Every day of the week
[1905.0s] we have a summarized wellput uh uh
[1909.3s] synopsis so that every day we can be
[1912.0s] able to come back to our cornerstone
[1913.4s] lesson and understand what is it is
[1915.5s] talking about. Some days have the spirit
[1917.4s] of prophecy. Some days have questions.
[1919.8s] Some days have the punchlines. Some days
[1921.7s] have scripture. We usually come back to
[1924.5s] the days from Sabbath to Friday. And
[1926.8s] that is what we want to look at as we
[1929.0s] finish our lesson for today. We want to
[1931.3s] connect this to life and see how
[1933.2s] scripture for every day of this week
[1935.8s] will be able to help us redeem ourselves
[1938.8s] to look out for salvation and to look
[1941.1s] out for the second coming.
[1943.5s] on Sabbath we will do John 3 John
[1949.1s] 6:37 and Pip will take us through
[1954.1s] that okay the church is one body with
[1958.9s] many members called from every nation
[1961.4s] kindred tongue and people in Christ we
[1964.9s] are a new creation
[1967.5s] distinction distinctions of race culture
[1971.7s] learning and nationality ity and
[1974.2s] difference and differences
[1976.4s] between high and low, rich and poor,
[1979.6s] male and female must not be divisive
[1983.3s] among us. We are all equal in Christ who
[1987.6s] by one spirit has bonded us into one
[1991.5s] fellowship with him and with one other
[1995.0s] one one another. We are to serve and be
[1997.8s] served without partially partiality or
[2002.2s] reservation. The body of Christ 7th day
[2005.7s] Adventist fundamental belief number 14.
[2010.2s] Jesus said all that the father gives me
[2013.8s] will come to me and whoever comes to me
[2016.5s] I will never cast
[2018.8s] out. Jesus sought out sinners and
[2022.2s] accepting and accepted them. He sought
[2025.6s] out people whom most of society hated.
[2029.1s] Instead of seeking to be at the home of
[2032.8s] the of a well-known or wellrespected
[2036.0s] Jewish leader, he desired to be the
[2039.0s] guest of a sinner, someone deemed an
[2042.4s] outcast in society, so that he might
[2045.5s] give that person the hope of salvation.
[2052.2s] Terica
[2053.9s] um can you name one way in which we can
[2058.4s] follow Jesus example in in accepting
[2062.5s] others?
[2064.6s] I think maybe we should never judge
[2067.0s] someone instantly. Maybe we should take
[2069.4s] time to know who they are before we even
[2071.4s] make assumptions. Amen. What about you,
[2074.7s] Aaron? Um, I think we
[2077.7s] can invite the people who don't know
[2080.3s] like to church. Like let's say you have
[2082.6s] a friend at home and they're not really
[2085.7s] Christian or they're Christian but they
[2087.8s] do come to church can invite them and
[2091.4s] they can learn where they're in church.
[2094.0s] That's a very nice point. That's very
[2095.9s] true. And you all right? Um I think you
[2099.8s] can help those in need and show kindness
[2103.6s] to everyone.
[2106.0s] Okay. So on Sunday we are reading from 2
[2108.2s] Chronicles
[2109.7s] 7:14. And what we are getting from it is
[2113.1s] that it is sort of an encouragement that
[2115.9s] whenever you feel unworthy of something
[2118.7s] or whenever you've tried something and
[2121.1s] done something that dis dishonors God or
[2124.3s] somebody else in return, there's always
[2126.7s] a chance for forgiveness. There's always
[2128.5s] a chance for second uh trials.
[2131.8s] There is mercy and grace that comes with
[2134.6s] a good Christian life, a life well-lived
[2137.1s] and a life that is lived faithfully. On
[2141.1s] Monday, we will uh we read from James
[2145.6s] 5:20. Uh Albright, you would read that
[2149.0s] one verse. James 5:20 as Aaron open
[2153.5s] opens John
[2155.4s] 10:1 and Tera open John 6:37.
[2164.2s] and it
[2166.2s] okay so James 5 verse 20
[2170.2s] says remember this whoever turns a
[2173.4s] sinner from the error of their ways will
[2175.5s] save them from death and cover over a m
[2178.2s] multitude of sins
[2180.7s] amen that is very clear and it's what we
[2183.0s] have talked about that our reputation
[2186.6s] should not be able to tell our future
[2188.5s] should not be able to tell what we do in
[2190.3s] future. We should be categorical about
[2192.8s] what we want with our Christian lives
[2194.6s] and we should have the understanding
[2196.1s] about what comes next after making a
[2198.6s] certain
[2199.5s] step. John 10:1
[2203.6s] uh John 10:1 says I am the good shepherd
[2207.0s] the good shepherd lays down his life for
[2209.0s] the sheep.
[2211.7s] Amen. Amen. And on Wednesday we talked
[2214.9s] about James 4:1 11-12 that rather than
[2218.9s] look on the outside of people, we must
[2221.1s] also try and see the inside. When you
[2223.6s] see somebody and you rush to judge,
[2225.8s] maybe have a session to talk to them
[2228.2s] about one or two things related to
[2230.2s] Christianity. Then from there you can be
[2232.1s] able to judge who they really are. And
[2234.9s] if they are not saved, you can bring
[2236.6s] them to salvation. And if they are
[2238.6s] saved, you can help them continue
[2241.3s] walking in salvation. Then on
[2244.3s] Thursday, we read first Samuel verse 6,
[2247.8s] chapter
[2248.8s] 16:7. And
[2250.6s] that in this day and image in modern
[2253.8s] times, it is very crucial that that we
[2258.7s] keep our image. In as much as Christ
[2260.7s] does not look at our image, sometimes we
[2263.8s] may end up being overjudged or rather
[2265.8s] overlooked and miss some of the
[2267.2s] opportunities that come our way. Like
[2270.2s] people look at you in such a way that
[2273.2s] your image is talked about everywhere
[2274.7s] because of the rise in social media,
[2276.4s] magazines, television. The moment you
[2278.8s] set up a bad stage, nobody wants to come
[2281.3s] back to you. But there's a way of which
[2282.9s] you can come back to that through prayer
[2285.5s] and forgiveness. But before you get to
[2287.8s] that stage, you should have a way to
[2289.8s] moderate yourself to know how to appear
[2291.8s] in public. You should understand
[2293.5s] scripture and how it relates to how to
[2296.0s] appear in public and how to be a good
[2299.4s] steward of Christ. Then John
[2308.6s] 6:37. Okay.
[2311.4s] All that the all that the Father gives
[2314.7s] me will come to me. And the one who
[2317.0s] comes to me, I will by no means cast
[2320.2s] out. For I have come down from heaven
[2323.0s] not to do my own will but the will of
[2325.3s] him who sent me.
[2327.8s] Amen. So that has been our lesson for
[2330.6s] today. And even as we finish the lesson,
[2334.0s] the key points that we want to walk out
[2336.0s] of this is that Christ does not look at
[2339.1s] your outer self. Christ is a Christ of
[2342.3s] second chances. He's a forgiving Lord.
[2344.8s] And in as much as we do wrong, we should
[2347.5s] know how to come back to it and
[2349.3s] apologize. We should learn how to be
[2351.4s] faithful. We should learn how to be we
[2353.4s] should be saved. And if not, we should
[2356.2s] learn how to deal with other people
[2359.0s] mostly when it comes to this social
[2360.6s] media era, this area of magazine, cyber
[2363.0s] bullying and all that. We thank you so
[2365.2s] much for joining us today in this lesson
[2367.8s] and may God bless you as we finish with
[2369.7s] a word of prayer from Pipim. I trust
[2371.8s] that all of you are well and let's meet
[2373.5s] next time. Okay, let's bow down for a
[2377.1s] word of prayer. Thank you God for this
[2380.0s] day. Thank you for the gift of life.
[2382.1s] Thank you for bringing us this far. And
[2384.5s] now as we close our lesson study, may
[2388.1s] you be with us. help us to put
[2390.3s] everything that we've learned into our
[2392.5s] our daily lives and protect us in
[2395.4s] everything we do. In Jesus name I pray.
[2398.1s] Amen. Amen.
