I I want to have the first things first. Thank the Lord for giving me an opportunity today to serve the church. I want to thank the pastorate, my senior pastor, pastor. Thank you for allowing me to be able to stand here. It has taken a while, but I know that when God has said it is the time, I have no option than to stand here and do the work. Um, today I am happy to let the church know that the journey that has led me this far, someone has been behind it. You know, sometimes we take some things for granted, but I want to tell you, I've never taken any step that God has given me in this life just for granted. And I want to thank my husband for just being there for me. You know, this these men, people say they are men, but I have a very different man in my house. I don't know about your house. I I hear the way the world is world is saying about men but I I tell you I have a different man in my house. This man of God has really felt me to be able to stand here. I just want him to stand up and say hi. You know men taking your wives to school and specifically doing the same thing it's not an easy thing that man has already done a good work God bless you I am looking forward that when Jesus will come someday we'll be in heaven together I don't know whether you'll be my neighbor but I want to be in heaven with you thank you thank you maybe pastor will be my neighbor but that is heaven that is heaven that is heaven that is heaven And uh we are blessed with two beautiful and handsome boy and girl. They are there. They are just saying mommy. That is what they know. So they are really praying for me. Uh may God bless you. Today uh we are sharing because this month is about drug awareness month. So today we are putting our minds together on our health issues. But that one we'll be able to do in the afternoon. But this morning, my mind has been drawn to know that sometimes my heart will be pained and my heart will be beating faster than it it should be. But we have sung a song that has told us that my heart be still and know that there is God in heaven. Even if you're going through the pains and turmoils of this world, there is somebody who will be able to bring the disappointments to the end and he'll be able to give us a life that we need to live at the end of the day. Hallelujah. And I know sometimes in this world when we go through issues and we are pain that we ask ourself, is God with us? Is God reigning still? Is he on the same throne that that he has been all the time? I'm here to remind you that our God is right there and is sitting at the same place is only waiting at the right time to restore everything to its original status. And that is my my main this morning, my aim this morning. And our sermon title is entitled, as you can to see it there, God's antidotes. Let's pray. Father Lord in heaven. Beautiful it is to behold the face of Jesus Christ. But sometimes we can able to miss it. Now I pray that as I stand on this place that the angels of heaven can able to guard and the Holy Spirit can able to go out and speak to your people. May I be humbled as you stand strong and speak to your people. Give them hope that at the end of the day we can be able to say for sure the Lord is reigning. May your will be done in Jesus name we pray. Our focus is in the book of uh Jeremiah. Jeremiah is one of the prophets that has been called many times a weeping prophet. And I was asking myself why the weeping. Jeremiah is known to be able to send a warning to the Israelites for them. They are declining their their spiritual standard from God. And when he was sending the warning, he is found griefing each and every time. And when he sits somewhere and comprehends of the love of God, this man says for sure God has a plan for these people. But people are running away from the Lord God Almighty of heaven. And Jeremiah was known all over by many people. And when they were taken to exile, people were saying, "Jeremiah, you have your own prophecies." People would even despise the prophecies of this man. But remember Jeremiah when he was born in chapter 1:5 of Jeremiah, the Bible says that before you were conceived, I knew about you. And meaning that you are set aside for the good work. Meaning as much as Jeremiah is weeping over the people's decline in love is doing the work that God has set him to be able to do. Therefore Jeremiah comes and talks and talks to these people. And when these people they were taken to captivity under the watch of the Lord God of heaven, the Israelites, they were a cherished nation of God. If you go back to the book of Deuteronomy, it will tell you that God knew that the Israelites they were they were nothing special. They had nothing special about apart from other people of the world. But God had only one intention and any one purpose that he wanted these people to have in where in their mind. And therefore the book of Deuteronomy says that you people remember and remember this one that I have I have given you time to rise up not because of anything but because I want you people to tell the people of the world there is only one true God to be worshiped. Hello. Yes. When we are church members in this church today, there is nothing that you are special than those people who are outside there. But God has elected you to be able to stand and tell the world that there is only one true God to be one to be worshiped. And therefore the nation of Israel walked from one step together with God. And sometimes when they and they went back, God will remind them, you remember my purpose with you people was to tell their people the way they supposed to live. But remember one day they told someone we are we are here but we want to live like the people of the world and we want kings. And therefore they were given kings and remember the nation of Israel that was one and they were walking together at some point they split to the north and to the south. And now things happened. I know you know the story. Things happened and people worshiped even other gods. People went away from God. The moment they drifted away from God, God was to let them suffer the consequences of their choice. Can I remind you my friends, anytime you make a decline from the love of God, God will let you suffer the consequences. For God will never force his love on us. He will able to give us the choice. And when we make the wrong choice because he has given us a map that we are supposed to follow, he will be able to let us rest on those the consequences that we have chosen. Therefore, the Israelites they chose and they walked away. But I am told in the book of Jeremiah 29, quickly let's go there. Jeremiah 29 in in the fourth verse it says thus sayith the Lord of hosts the God of Israel unto all that are carried away captives whom I have caused to be carried away from Jerusalem to Babylon. I want to I want to repeat that that last verse last line is saying whom I have caused to be carried away from Jerusalem to where to Babylon. Meaning it is God who allowed these people to be carried to captivity. Hello. Because they had gone away from the what? From the lamb of God. But Jeremiah is coming with this promise. He's saying as much as God has allowed you people to be carried to captivity. He's reminding them as you are in Babylon, do this. Build ye houses, dwell in them, plant gardens, and eat of their fruit. Hallelujah. Imagine God has seen you people walk away from him. But he's saying wherever you are make sure you are thriving well. You shall remind Christians we are in this world. We are not of this world but we are in the what? In the world we are supposed to live well. We are supposed to work extra hard to earn a living to continue living well be in good houses. Go to good schools have whatever the world wants you to have. But he says this, "Take ye wives and beget sons and daughters and take the wives for your sons and give your daughters to husbands that they may bear sons and daughters that that ye may be increased there and not be diminished." That's the word I was looking for. when we are living in the world as much as the world does not sometimes recognize us because we are not living like the people of the world but Jeremiah is telling these people as you live in Babylon make sure you are you you are felt your crowd is there your wives you you you people have children let your sons marry let your wives your your daughters get married be in a great number you never know sometimes it will be those great numbers that can able to do what? To push us. And he continues to say even pray for that nation where you are dwelling. You never know what God can able to do what to do about it. And he continues to tell them. And as he comes to verse 8, he says, "For thus say the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel, let not your prophets, your divers that be in the midst of you deceive you, neither hearken to your dreams, which ye because which ye cause to be dream." Now verse 11 comes here and he says because it's the Lord who has sent Jeremiah to tell their people the Israelites these words. He says for I know the thought that I think towards you say the Lord thoughts of peace and not of evil to give you an expected end. Do not live as if you do not understand where you're going. We have a journey. Yes. God says as we live in the alien land know where you are going and therefore God says I know the plans I know what I have for you continue living there as you continue upholding the standards of God I know that some point will come that I will restore you to the right place and God is happy about it and these people he tells them now you can call upon me and ye shall go and pray unto me and I will hearken to your voice hallelujah When we pray to God, even if we are in captivity, God has not let everything down, he's there for us. Just call upon him and he'll do what? He will hear. And he says, "And ye shall seek me and find me when ye shall search for me with all your heart." Hallelujah. You know sometimes we have Christians who are jokers in church. We just come and we say, you know, God, you understand we are living in this world. We can have this and that. I am here to remind you the Bible says when you seek the Lord God Almighty with all your heart as much as we're in captivity, God will hear that. And Jeremiah was in in this and he said now this is what the Lord has said. And as he drives them now to chapter 30 of Jeremiah, he comes with this prophecy and tells them continue trusting God. Continue pleading in the name of God for you'll be able to know that God will never cease to love you. Hallelujah. I love that God. Let me remind you one thing my friends. Our God is good to everybody. Hallelujah. But one thing you need to remember. There are people who are charmed by themselves. They love they they take pleasure in the things that they love. But let me tell you this. They will never see they will never see a charm of the beloved Christ in them for they do not know when I am sick what am I supposed to do but when you are sick and you need a doctor it is when you'll be able to remember and understand the importance of having a doctor around hallelujah so the love of God will be able to penetrate your mind and get inside there the moment you feel I have been separated from the love of God for a for a quite a time now I want to go back and Jeremiah reminds us this a story is told travelers were traveling and they they were traveling on a desert for some days they hungered they thirsted and as they were walking they are now very tired they were waiting for some something from somewhere but as they were walking on the desert. They met a bag and they were many. Everybody was running, scrambling for him to be able to get to be there fast, to be able to open the bag for them. They knew that the bag would be containing food for their what? For them to be able to eat. But hear this. As they went for the bag, everybody was was in hurry to be able to open the bag. They they when they opened the bag, it was a bag full of pearls. Hello. It was a bag full of what? Pearls. And they were disappointed. They were very disappointed. And they just poured out the PS consumptiously upon the desert sun. And they did not see the importance of the what? Of the pal. And even they complained for them what they wanted. It was what? food. Friend, let me remind you this. When men and women of God, they are hungering and thirsting after the things of this life, they will never see a meaning of Jesus Christ in their life. When men and women of God of this one, they have taken taken their thoughts and their minds are been taken to their cano appetites, cano joy, caro everything. Soros is is about the can of mind. They will never set their minds on Jesus Christ. And that's why the Israelites when they were being told to to be able to continue living in that land, they were like, "Uh-uh, we want things that can to excite us for a moment and they continued drifting from the will of God because their minds was set on the things of this world. Therefore, many times the price the price of Jesus Christ will miss in our hearts for we have considered the immediate things that will be able to bring us joy that can be able to last and go. We forget of the joy that is going to last forever and ever. And we are pain. We go through issues. You know when you are healthy you know when you are healthy you will never remember that there is something called the medicine but when you are sick you'll go for the what for the medicine for you want something to be able to come in and quit the issues that are happening in your life I am here to remind you this it is only the sick man who will go to Jesus and say for sure Jesus I need to listen from you Jeremiah 30:1 it says The word that came to Jeremiah from the Lord, saying, "Thus speaketh the Lord God of Israel, saying, write thee all the words that I have spoken unto thee in a book, for law, the days come, say the Lord, that I will bring again the captivity of my people Israel and Judah, say the Lord, I will cause them to return to to the land that I gave to their fathers, they shall possess it. Hallelujah. The Lord is saying that I will cause them to go back to the promise that I had given to them to their their forefathers. Remember our God is is is a god-fearing God. In the book of Exodus chapter 3:7, he says, "I have heard your sorrows. I have heard your issues from your taskmaster. Now I will come down. Not only to come down and set your issues. He says I will come down and give you a solution by doing what? I will deliver you and take you to the good land and you shall be there. By the way, chapter 3 verse 6 7 8 9 of Exodus says, I'll take you to a good large land that is flowing with honey and what? And milk. the land that God has promised us. He's saying, "I will cause these people from captivity to go back to where I promised them." My friend, the only person who could be able to listen to this word, it is somebody who has been pained and is feeling the need of going back home. Hallelujah. Of going back home. There are people in this world who have reached the climax of everything. They are seated and they are saying, "All is what? All is well." I am reminding you this morning that this world is not our home. We are going home. Jesus will come someday and take us home. Our disappointments will be turned to be something else. And God says, "I will take them back." And when he says that, he means that the people who are sick, they'll be able to sit down and hear the word of God. And verse four says, "And this are the words that the Lord spake concerning Israel and concerning Judah." Verse five, "For thus says the Lord, we have heard a voice of trembling, of fear, and not of peace." For people are just, you know, some people when they have heard this prophecy, they are gearing towards going home. Some people are like, "No, no, no, no, no. Where are you going? Are you sure there is deliverance after this? Yes. For God is saying, "Ask ye now, see whether a man doth travail with child. Wherefore do I see every man with his hands on his rins as a woman in what? In traine, and all faces are turned into peness." No. The people that were living in in in in Babylon when they heard Jeremiah tell the children of Israel that there is a time God is turning these things away and taking you back. They were like huh you are not so sure about it but God is is is is sure with his word and he says we are going back and he's like now I see the way people are what are travailing they are in pain people are are confused people are here they they do not know peace for they are going ahead the disease has eaten them they have been in pain for a long time but God needs to give them what peace and they want to go home my Sin can make a separation between us and God to the point even when he's speaking to us, we see it is something else. Sin can make a separation in us with God that when when when God is speaking something golly to us, we see it as an ungodly. It gives it gives paralysis to their conscience of men. And when men stand, they say that this one cannot happen. We have not seen God. let your people unto our hands and deliver you back. He's not going to do that. Friends, God is the only antidote to any grievous sin in your heart. He can change things. Even when you are not sure, even when you want to doubt it, God can able to stand because he says that day when it comes, it will come with that people be confused. There is that uh uh people are fearing and people are like it is it is it is not like something that we are so sure about it. But it is terrible to feel sin without feeling the what the burden of Jesus Christ. You are just seeing and saying no no no no no God let us he he decided to let us go into captivity. Yes because of our sin some diseases are eating us for we have gone against the ways of God. Some days ago I was attending to a cancer patient somewhere and he told me these words. Edna, I am not so sure that God is still loving and I'm not so sure God can heal. Why would God allow such a calamity to come in this into this world? But the Bible says for those who have forsaken me, I will let them go to captivity. Hello. Yes. If you have forsaken God, God can able to do what? To let you go. The disease is going to come unto you. The sin will be able to eat you here, eat it, eat you. And you will never have time even to be able to do what? To stand and know. But remember, the day of the deliverance of God will surely come. Hallelujah. The day that God will sweep even the old system that are affecting us will surely come and people will be amazed. People will be running up and about asking how is it then? How did God do this? God, you can never equal God with man. There is no integrity that people have that can able to be equal to God. God is God and that is it. The things that is he's going to do, he will do them. And therefore, he continues to say something quickly. It says, "But they, but they," verse n, "but they shall s the Lord their God, and David their king, whom I will raise up to them." Verse 10. Therefore, fear thou not, oh my servant Jacob, said the Lord, neither be dismayed, oh Israel, for lo, I will save thee from afar. Hello. I will save thee from afar and thy seed from the land of their captivity. And Jacob shall return and shall be in rest and and be quiet and none shall make him afraid. Hallelujah. God is the only antid antidote to these things. When you feel that the pain is too much, some people will think that you are almost giving pass because you are you are wailing and and and you are feeling pain. God is saying do not be dismayed as the world is crying for lack of medicine to treat these diseases. God is saying do not be dismayed. Hallelujah. I am the only solution. Why are you people worried? He says I will I I I will be able to save you out of this. And that's why in the book of Isaiah 41:E10 it says, "Do not be dismayed. For I will hold you with my own righteous hand." Hallelujah. The hand of power will lead you out. For if you know you are not sufficient to yourself, you look unto God himself. And therefore, you know, sometimes we we look around and we see sometimes sin has made a a barrier between us and God and we think that God cannot able to do it. Don't be dismayed. Just ask of God. Even if you rest in the same disease you you you've been you've been you've been sick of, God knows your ultimate goal. And therefore, he says, "Come and see and hear what the Lord is going to do." Verse 12 he says for thus say the Lord thy bliss is incurable thy wound is grievous. The disease that we are going to encounter the things that are going to affect us. Hello. The things that are we are going to be through they are not going to be cured. Know sometimes I sit back and and ask with these things that we are going through is God watching? Yes. Are we going to be through out of this? Yes. But he's saying these things are and are going in and the wound is grievous. I want verse 13. There is none to plead thy cause that thou mayest be bound up. Thou has no healing medicine. Now listen and listen good friends. We have no way we can save ourselves from our sins. No way. Unless we go to John 3:16 and say, "For God so loved the world, there is no one who can come and cure our diseases." But he says it is easier to heal a body that has been set on the eyes of Jesus Christ. Hallelujah. There is a way we can be cured. But he says if you are looking for medicines, if you are looking for anything to cure you, you will never be able to get it. He says no human hand can be able to bind up the wounds that people of this world are suffering. No one, no human, no human hand. And remember we have the skills but Jeremiah is reminding us no human skill, no human in intellect can be able to come down and tell us the solution to the things that we are going through. So where do we run to? Where do we go? We are looking to Jesus. He says no human, no human what? No human interact, no skill from this world can deeply touch the pain and the complaints and the disappointments the people of God are going through. And that's why when they were in Babylon, they were asking, "Ah, Jeremiah, calm down. What are you saying? That the Lord is taking you back to the land of your fathers?" No way. how the way you are. But God has a way. No politics, no science and no education, nothing can be able to stand and prove to be able to help us out of the things that we are going through. You know there are coalitions in this world that are working against so many things. But I remember when corona came people were racing and saying you know now prophecies pro is fulfilled we are soon going home but soon the corona thing died okay and we are back to normal things are back to normal and we never know what is coming ahead my friend there is only hope in Jesus Christ these things that we are running to and saying oh which country can be able to give us an antidote to what to corona an antidote to cancer an antidote. An antidote to something. There is no antidote anywhere apart from God in heaven. So if you want to be healed, go back to where to God. Go and ask for forgiveness of your sin. Go make your rights easy with who? With God and walk in those paths and God himself can able to forgive us because the things that we are going through, they are grave. They are they are not going to be what? To be cured. And God says we will not we will not have any medicine that can be able to heal these diseases. He says even our lovers verse 14 even the nations the people of the nation they are coming looking to the church and they are asking hey church members what do you have for us today? And we are maring with them and saying the prophecy is being fulfilled from when? And some of us we say it but the Lord is saying even those friends of yours even the other nation be coming and asking the people of God what do you have for us and they be able to say you people even your God has let you down. You know sometimes we look so desperate until the world is like hey even you people you trust in God. Are you sure that you trust in God? Yeah, we are disappointed but you still continue trusting in the Lord. We say no no no we are not even so sure about this God. It is because we want to make sure that we want to to continue appalling to our own hope. The only hope is who is Jesus Christ. Let me quickly tell you something that friends, we will die for our own negligence. For the Lord has said, I am here. If you want to be out of sin, I'm here. If you want to be healed of cancer and other things, I'm here. And us, we do not want to seek the what? The face of the Lord. Why? We want to put our hope for the forsaken things. We want to put our hope on the seasonal things that will come and go. We want to be like those tremors who said we do not want this pulse but we want what food. We want something temporal but God has given us pulse for eternity and we are just there. He's saying my friends put your hope in Jesus Christ. He will never forsake you. The diseases that have befallen us, it is due to our disobedience. It is because we've been given the message and we say, "No, you know, I worked so hard. I was poor and now today I must be able to eat." Sometimes you come to church and say, you know, those times when we were out there, we used to do this and that and you have not forgotten them. God is saying for those things and come to him, he'll be able to do something. Do you know what many of times we in when we are in this church there is something that is sweet to our ears the marriage bells that is something that keeps us we we are so happy when we hear there is somebody who is getting married this one is marrying the other one but let me tell you this friends there is a music in the book of Jeremiah that is sweeter than the marriage bells hallelujah it is sweeter than the marriage bells because him who allowed us to go to captivity is coming again to be able to take us out of captivity. Hallelujah. Let's read the book of Osiah before we come back. Hosea chapter 6 verse 1 and 2 and 3. Hosea is saying you know the story of but I'm borrowing these words that are very strong to my heart. He says come let us return to the Lord. Hallelujah. For he has torn he will heal us. He has smitten and he will bind us up. Come, let us do what? Go back. Meaning, let us repent and go back to God. For he has good plans for his people. Hallelujah. He continues to save us too. After two days will he revive us. In the third day, he will raise us up and we shall be we shall live in his sight. Hallelujah. Verse three, then shall we know if we follow on on to know the Lord. His going forth is prepared as the morning and he shall come unto us as the rain as the latter and the former rain unto the earth. Hallelujah. We know we are going through issues because we have decline spiritually. But God is saying come, I'll be able to revive you. Hallelujah. God is going to give us a way back home. He's going to restore us. Is going the antidote of the things that are causing pain in us. And he says for this music that is sweeter than the marriage bells is inviting us to our memory text which says for I will restore verse 14 sorry verse 17 for I will restore health unto thee. I will heal thee of thy wounds, say the Lord, because thou because they called thee an outcast, saying, This is Zion, whom no man seeketh after. Friends, we are going back. But as as Christ is initiating the process, may we know what is happening. I was looking at this verse and I got some interest on one or two words that I want us to be able to crown with. God is saying I will restore. Restore can be translated also as rise up. It can be also ascend up. I was looking at it was Babylon down the valleys that these people when they were given restoration now they were supposed to ascend to the mountains of God and say for sure we are going home. Hallelujah. God will restore it back to us. And he's saying as you ascend to the home that I've prepared for you, as you go in and get what God has blessed us with, he's saying I will take away all the diseases that are affecting your life. Hallelujah. God is really serious about what about us and he's saying it is not you who is going to do it. It is God is the initiator of the what? of the process is inviting us and saying let's go. This is an ongoing process. He's going to do it again and again. When we accept we want to go back, God is saying I will restore. I will restore health unto you and I will heal. Heal is repairing. Making sure you have cured. You have thoroughly made something that was out of shape to come back to shape. Other Bible translators have said he's going to grow new flesh in your body. Hallelujah. He's going to give you a new way. And as saying he's going to give us the heart of what? Flesh. That we can be able to take the one and leave the one and move. And we will never get to understand how God did it, but God will be able to to do it. You remember when God is doing these things, people are just watching and saying why is this the God this is what your God can able to do because at some point you are feeling rejected and dejected and you are feeling that no God is not here and that's why he's saying they call you outcast even your God cannot be able to save you our God is the only antidote to these things that we call is coming is going to do it for him He has a way that is going to make us move. And that's why verse 18 is saying, "Thus say the Lord, behold, I will bring again the captivity of Jacob, stand and have merc on his dwelling place, and the city shall be building upon her own hip, and the palace shall remain after the manner there." Or friends, it is God who is going to repair. It is God who is going to restore and make sure that we will be able to rise up again. Sometimes you you you you get there you are very sick and you ask ah am I going to make it and you find that you have you you have made it is it you not you it is God for God is going to restore and sister white says these words in the book great great controversy chapter 36 that is the it says about the time of Jacob's trouble he says the time h the time had the time that God had with his people was manifested in his power to be able to save them. And he says, she says God will not want his people to server because of his name to not to server his name not to be reproached by the h by the hidden. What will he do? He will rise up and deliver his people and for those who would wait for him patiently, he will make them to rise never to go back again. Hallelujah. Yes. And you know God is very go the way God does his things when he comes to you he'll be able to take you move you and you move to the point you feel that now this the place I'm supposed to be. It is God who is the subject of the things that are happening in this world. He's going to do something. He's going to restore us. He's going to move us. He is doing that work not once not not thrice but he's continuing to do the work. Why? He has the restoration power. Hallelujah. Friends, there is no diagnosis. There is no diagnosis that is beyond God's power. That is beyond God's power to reverse. There is nothing that people can be able to say in this world that can God cannot able to reverse. Just trust in God. And remember when he has said I will do it, God himself do what? He'll do it. So I come to the end. I met this cancer patient. He told me I am going to die but I just want to hear some few words from you. And as we were conversing said God is going God going to forgive me because back in his mind he's saying it is my negligence. It is me who has led to this thing. I said yes God will restore you as much as you feel the pain today God will restore it and that's why I will invite you to sing with me this song the chistas that once you turn your eyes upon Jesus the moment you feel that you are down and you turn your eyes upon Jesus God himself will turn things for you. Hallelujah. He'll be able to make things right again for you. You know, sometimes you you are questioning yourself and you're saying, "I'm going to die." Yes, you'll be able to die. Yes. But you'll be able to sleep at the hands of Jesus Christ. Hallelujah. You turn your eyes for for in him you can able to have the anti dot of the things that are paining you, the disappointments, the things that are pulling you down. and one moment and one morning you shall be able to be taken back to the ways that God wanted you to be and be in the land of the your forefathers that God promised you to be. And may God bless you.

[27.5s] We may be going through issues in life.
[30.8s] You might be going through heartaches
[33.0s] and pains. But for sure Jesus will come
[37.0s] someday. I love I love that assurance
[39.6s] choir. God bless you. Thank you. Thank
[41.7s] you. That was a a good music.
[45.6s] I I want to have the first things first.
[50.0s] Thank the Lord for giving me an
[51.4s] opportunity today to serve the church. I
[54.4s] want to thank the pastorate, my senior
[57.8s] pastor, pastor. Thank you for allowing
[60.0s] me to be able to stand here. It has
[61.9s] taken a while, but I know that when God
[64.1s] has said it is the time, I have no
[66.2s] option than to stand here and do the
[68.8s] work. Um,
[71.6s] today I am happy to let the church
[75.6s] know that the journey that has led me
[80.0s] this far, someone has been behind it.
[83.8s] You know, sometimes we take some things
[86.6s] for
[87.7s] granted, but I want to tell you, I've
[90.7s] never taken any step that God has given
[92.9s] me in this life just for granted. And I
[95.8s] want to thank my husband for just being
[98.8s] there for me. You know, this these men,
[101.8s] people say they are men, but I have a
[104.6s] very different man in my house. I don't
[106.6s] know about your house.
[109.5s] I I hear the way the world is world is
[112.5s] saying about men but I I tell you I have
[115.4s] a different man in my house. This man of
[118.5s] God has really felt me to be able to
[121.2s] stand here. I just want him to stand up
[124.3s] and say
[128.6s] hi. You know men taking your wives to
[133.8s] school and specifically doing the same
[136.9s] thing it's not an easy thing that man
[139.5s] has already done a good work God bless
[141.4s] you I am looking forward that when Jesus
[144.2s] will come someday we'll be in heaven
[146.6s] together I don't know whether you'll be
[148.6s] my neighbor but I want to be in heaven
[150.4s] with
[151.6s] you thank you thank you maybe pastor
[155.1s] will be my neighbor but that is heaven
[157.0s] that is heaven that is heaven that is
[159.1s] heaven And uh we are blessed with two
[162.3s] beautiful and handsome boy and girl.
[166.0s] They are there. They are just saying
[168.6s] mommy. That is what they know. So they
[171.8s] are really praying for me. Uh may God
[174.5s] bless you. Today
[177.8s] uh we are sharing because this month is
[181.2s] about drug awareness month. So today we
[185.5s] are putting our minds together on our
[187.8s] health issues.
[189.4s] But that one we'll be able to do in the
[191.3s] afternoon. But this morning, my mind has
[195.7s] been drawn to know that sometimes my
[200.4s] heart will be pained and my heart will
[203.8s] be beating faster than it it should be.
[206.6s] But we have sung a song that has told us
[209.8s] that my heart be still and know that
[215.6s] there is God in heaven. Even if you're
[218.6s] going through the pains and turmoils of
[220.9s] this world, there is somebody who will
[223.6s] be able to bring the disappointments to
[226.2s] the end and he'll be able to give us a
[229.0s] life that we need to live at the end of
[231.7s] the day. Hallelujah. And I know
[234.5s] sometimes in this world when we go
[237.1s] through issues and we are pain that we
[239.8s] ask ourself, is God with us? Is God
[244.6s] reigning still? Is he on the same throne
[247.4s] that that he has been all the time? I'm
[250.1s] here to remind you that our God is right
[253.5s] there and is sitting at the same place
[256.7s] is only waiting at the right time to
[259.6s] restore everything to its original
[261.6s] status. And that is my my main this
[264.2s] morning, my aim this morning. And our
[266.9s] sermon title is entitled, as you can to
[269.5s] see it there, God's antidotes. Let's
[272.6s] pray.
[274.5s] Father Lord in
[276.4s] heaven. Beautiful it is to behold the
[279.0s] face of Jesus
[280.3s] Christ. But sometimes we can able to
[282.7s] miss it. Now I pray that as I stand on
[286.3s] this place that the angels of heaven can
[289.4s] able to guard and the Holy Spirit can
[291.9s] able to go out and speak to your people.
[294.6s] May I be humbled as you stand strong and
[297.4s] speak to your people. Give them hope
[299.4s] that at the end of the day we can be
[301.4s] able to say for sure the Lord is
[304.3s] reigning. May your will be done in Jesus
[306.7s] name we
[307.7s] pray. Our focus is in the book of uh
[312.1s] Jeremiah.
[313.6s] Jeremiah is one of the prophets that has
[317.2s] been called many times a weeping
[319.5s] prophet. And I was asking myself why the
[323.1s] weeping. Jeremiah is known to be able to
[327.4s] send a warning to the Israelites for
[330.8s] them. They are declining their their
[334.0s] spiritual standard from God. And when he
[337.0s] was sending the warning, he is found
[339.8s] griefing each and every time. And when
[342.5s] he sits somewhere and comprehends of the
[345.4s] love of God, this man says for sure God
[348.6s] has a plan for these people. But people
[351.3s] are running away from the Lord God
[353.6s] Almighty of heaven. And Jeremiah was
[356.5s] known all over by many people. And when
[358.9s] they were taken to exile, people were
[361.2s] saying, "Jeremiah, you have your own
[363.2s] prophecies." People would even despise
[365.4s] the prophecies of this man. But remember
[368.3s] Jeremiah when he was born in chapter 1:5
[371.5s] of Jeremiah, the Bible says that before
[374.8s] you were conceived, I knew about you.
[377.3s] And meaning that you are set aside for
[380.4s] the good work. Meaning as much as
[383.4s] Jeremiah is weeping over the people's
[386.1s] decline in love is doing the work that
[388.9s] God has set him to be able to do.
[391.4s] Therefore Jeremiah comes and talks and
[393.9s] talks to these people. And when these
[396.0s] people they were taken to captivity
[398.2s] under the watch of the Lord God of
[400.4s] heaven, the Israelites, they were a
[403.3s] cherished nation of God. If you go back
[405.5s] to the book of Deuteronomy, it will tell
[407.4s] you that God knew that the Israelites
[411.7s] they were they were nothing special.
[413.8s] They had nothing special about apart
[416.5s] from other people of the world. But God
[418.7s] had only one intention and any one
[421.1s] purpose that he wanted these people to
[423.4s] have in where in their mind. And
[425.2s] therefore the book of Deuteronomy says
[427.0s] that you people remember and remember
[429.5s] this one that I have I have given you
[432.6s] time to rise up not because of anything
[435.7s] but because I want you people to tell
[438.2s] the people of the world there is only
[440.2s] one true God to be worshiped. Hello.
[443.5s] Yes. When we are church members in this
[446.1s] church today, there is nothing that you
[448.6s] are special than those people who are
[449.8s] outside there. But God has elected you
[452.8s] to be able to stand and tell the world
[455.3s] that there is only one true God to be
[457.4s] one to be worshiped. And therefore the
[459.8s] nation of Israel walked from one step
[462.7s] together with God. And sometimes when
[465.4s] they and they went back, God will remind
[468.2s] them, you remember my purpose with you
[470.9s] people was to tell their people the way
[473.5s] they supposed to live. But remember one
[475.7s] day they told someone we are we are here
[480.2s] but we want to live like the people of
[482.1s] the world and we want kings. And
[484.4s] therefore they were given kings and
[486.5s] remember the nation of Israel that was
[489.4s] one and they were walking together at
[491.8s] some point they split to the north and
[493.7s] to the south. And now things happened. I
[496.8s] know you know the story. Things happened
[498.6s] and people worshiped even other gods.
[501.6s] People went away from God. The moment
[504.2s] they drifted away from God, God was to
[506.9s] let them suffer the consequences of
[509.8s] their
[510.7s] choice. Can I remind you my friends,
[513.9s] anytime you make a decline from the love
[516.8s] of God, God will let you suffer the
[519.8s] consequences. For God will never force
[522.9s] his love on us. He will able to give us
[525.3s] the choice. And when we make the wrong
[527.6s] choice because he has given us a map
[529.8s] that we are supposed to follow, he will
[531.6s] be able to let us rest on those the
[533.2s] consequences that we have chosen.
[534.7s] Therefore, the Israelites they chose and
[536.6s] they walked away. But I am told in the
[539.4s] book of Jeremiah 29, quickly let's go
[541.2s] there. Jeremiah 29 in in the fourth
[544.5s] verse it says thus sayith the Lord of
[546.9s] hosts the God of Israel unto all that
[550.0s] are carried away captives whom I have
[553.0s] caused to be carried away from Jerusalem
[556.2s] to Babylon. I want to I want to repeat
[559.0s] that that last verse last line is saying
[561.8s] whom I have caused to be carried away
[565.0s] from Jerusalem to where to Babylon.
[567.9s] Meaning it is God who allowed these
[571.2s] people to be carried to captivity.
[573.6s] Hello. Because they had gone away from
[576.0s] the what? From the lamb of God. But
[578.3s] Jeremiah is coming with this promise.
[580.7s] He's saying as much as God has allowed
[583.6s] you people to be carried to captivity.
[585.3s] He's reminding them as you are in
[587.9s] Babylon, do this. Build ye houses, dwell
[591.7s] in them, plant gardens, and eat of their
[595.1s] fruit. Hallelujah. Imagine God has seen
[598.5s] you people walk away from him. But he's
[601.3s] saying wherever you are make sure you
[604.1s] are thriving well. You shall remind
[607.0s] Christians we are in this world. We are
[609.6s] not of this world but we are in the
[611.2s] what? In the world we are supposed to
[613.5s] live well. We are supposed to work extra
[616.2s] hard to earn a living to continue living
[618.7s] well be in good houses. Go to good
[621.0s] schools have whatever the world wants
[623.6s] you to have. But he says this, "Take ye
[626.7s] wives and beget sons and daughters and
[629.1s] take the wives for your sons and give
[631.4s] your daughters to husbands that they may
[633.8s] bear sons and daughters that that ye may
[636.6s] be increased there and not be
[640.3s] diminished." That's the word I was
[641.8s] looking for. when we are living in the
[644.6s] world as much as the world does not
[647.6s] sometimes recognize us because we are
[650.2s] not living like the people of the world
[651.8s] but Jeremiah is telling these people as
[654.5s] you live in Babylon make sure you are
[657.6s] you you are felt your crowd is there
[660.3s] your wives you you you people have
[662.6s] children let your sons marry let your
[665.0s] wives your your daughters get married be
[667.9s] in a great number you never know
[670.2s] sometimes it will be those great numbers
[672.2s] that can able to do what? To push us.
[675.2s] And he continues to say even pray for
[678.2s] that nation where you are dwelling. You
[679.9s] never know what God can able to do what
[681.5s] to do about it. And he continues to tell
[683.9s] them. And as he comes to verse 8, he
[685.8s] says, "For thus say the Lord of hosts,
[688.1s] the God of Israel, let not your
[691.2s] prophets, your divers that be in the
[693.9s] midst of you deceive you, neither
[696.3s] hearken to your dreams, which ye because
[699.8s] which ye cause to be dream." Now verse
[703.7s] 11 comes here and he says because it's
[707.4s] the Lord who has sent Jeremiah to tell
[710.2s] their people the Israelites these words.
[712.2s] He says for I know the thought that I
[715.5s] think towards you say the Lord thoughts
[718.5s] of peace and not of evil to give you an
[723.5s] expected
[726.0s] end. Do not live as if you do not
[728.9s] understand where you're going. We have a
[730.6s] journey. Yes. God says as we live in the
[733.3s] alien land know where you are going and
[735.6s] therefore God says I know the plans I
[738.7s] know what I have for you continue living
[741.4s] there as you continue upholding the
[743.4s] standards of God I know that some point
[746.6s] will come that I will restore you to the
[749.6s] right place and God is happy about it
[752.5s] and these people he tells them now you
[754.7s] can call upon me and ye shall go and
[757.4s] pray unto me and I will hearken to your
[760.4s] voice hallelujah
[761.7s] When we pray to God, even if we are in
[764.2s] captivity, God has not let everything
[767.8s] down, he's there for us. Just call upon
[770.6s] him and he'll do what? He will hear. And
[773.4s] he says, "And ye shall seek me and find
[776.6s] me when ye shall search for me with all
[780.8s] your heart." Hallelujah. You know
[782.9s] sometimes we have Christians who are
[785.3s] jokers in church. We just come and we
[787.4s] say, you know, God, you understand we
[789.1s] are living in this world. We can have
[790.7s] this and that. I am here to remind you
[793.1s] the Bible says when you seek the Lord
[796.0s] God Almighty with all your heart as much
[798.9s] as we're in captivity, God will hear
[801.3s] that. And Jeremiah was in in this and he
[805.3s] said now this is what the Lord has said.
[807.2s] And as he drives them now to chapter 30
[810.1s] of Jeremiah, he comes with this prophecy
[812.7s] and tells them continue trusting God.
[814.9s] Continue pleading in the name of God for
[817.4s] you'll be able to know that God will
[820.2s] never cease to love you. Hallelujah. I
[822.9s] love that God. Let me remind you one
[824.8s] thing my friends. Our God is good to
[827.9s] everybody. Hallelujah. But one thing you
[830.1s] need to remember. There are people who
[832.4s] are charmed by themselves. They love
[835.1s] they they take pleasure in the things
[837.0s] that they love. But let me tell you
[838.9s] this. They will never see they will
[842.2s] never see a charm of the beloved Christ
[845.1s] in them for they do not know when I am
[848.5s] sick what am I supposed to do but when
[850.6s] you are sick and you need a doctor it is
[853.0s] when you'll be able to remember and
[855.2s] understand the importance of having a
[857.1s] doctor around hallelujah so the love of
[859.7s] God will be able to penetrate your mind
[863.5s] and get inside there the moment you feel
[866.8s] I have been separated from the love of
[869.0s] God for a for a quite a time now I want
[871.9s] to go
[873.7s] back and Jeremiah reminds us
[878.3s] this a story is
[880.7s] told travelers were traveling and they
[884.6s] they were traveling on a desert for some
[888.1s] days they hungered they thirsted and as
[892.0s] they were walking they are now very
[893.7s] tired they were waiting for some
[896.3s] something from somewhere but as they
[898.7s] were walking on the desert. They met a
[902.2s] bag and they were many. Everybody was
[905.2s] running, scrambling for him to be able
[907.3s] to get to be there fast, to be able to
[909.2s] open the bag for them. They knew that
[912.0s] the bag would be containing food for
[914.6s] their what? For them to be able to eat.
[916.8s] But hear this. As they went for the bag,
[920.2s] everybody was was in hurry to be able to
[923.0s] open the bag. They they when they opened
[925.5s] the bag, it was a bag full of pearls.
[928.9s] Hello. It was a bag full of what?
[931.1s] Pearls. And they were
[934.0s] disappointed. They were very
[936.1s] disappointed. And they just poured out
[940.0s] the PS consumptiously upon the desert
[943.2s] sun. And they did not see the importance
[946.5s] of the what? Of the pal. And even they
[949.4s] complained for them what they wanted. It
[952.4s] was what? food. Friend, let me remind
[954.9s] you this. When men and women of God,
[958.3s] they are hungering and thirsting after
[961.2s] the things of this life, they will never
[964.6s] see a meaning of Jesus Christ in their
[968.0s] life. When men and women of God of this
[971.7s] one, they have taken taken their
[974.1s] thoughts and their minds are been taken
[977.0s] to their cano appetites, cano joy, caro
[980.7s] everything. Soros is is about the can of
[983.1s] mind. They will never set their minds on
[986.5s] Jesus Christ. And that's why the
[988.8s] Israelites when they were being told to
[991.3s] to be able to continue living in that
[992.8s] land, they were like, "Uh-uh, we want
[994.6s] things that can to excite us for a
[996.8s] moment and they continued drifting from
[1000.0s] the will of
[1002.1s] God because their
[1005.5s] minds was set on the things of this
[1008.5s] world.
[1010.4s] Therefore, many times the price the
[1014.9s] price of Jesus Christ will miss in our
[1017.8s] hearts for we have considered the
[1020.3s] immediate things that will be able to
[1023.4s] bring us joy that can be able to last
[1026.1s] and go. We forget of the joy that is
[1029.5s] going to last forever and ever. And we
[1032.9s] are pain. We go through issues. You know
[1036.4s] when you are healthy you know when you
[1038.3s] are healthy you will never remember that
[1041.3s] there is something called the medicine
[1043.0s] but when you are sick you'll go for the
[1045.0s] what for the medicine for you want
[1047.4s] something to be able to come in and quit
[1051.0s] the issues that are happening in your
[1052.5s] life I am here to remind you this it is
[1055.0s] only the sick man who will go to Jesus
[1057.7s] and say for sure Jesus I need to listen
[1060.5s] from
[1061.3s] you Jeremiah 30:1 it says
[1066.5s] The word that came to Jeremiah from the
[1070.0s] Lord, saying, "Thus speaketh the Lord
[1072.7s] God of Israel, saying, write thee all
[1076.2s] the words that I have spoken unto thee
[1078.5s] in a book, for law, the days come, say
[1082.6s] the Lord, that I will bring again the
[1086.2s] captivity of my people Israel and Judah,
[1090.2s] say the Lord, I will cause them to
[1093.0s] return to to the land that I gave to
[1096.3s] their fathers, they shall possess it.
[1099.6s] Hallelujah. The Lord is saying that I
[1102.7s] will cause them to go back to the
[1105.6s] promise that I had given to them to
[1107.9s] their their forefathers. Remember our
[1111.6s] God is is is a god-fearing God. In the
[1114.6s] book of Exodus chapter 3:7, he says, "I
[1118.1s] have heard your sorrows. I have heard
[1120.4s] your issues from your taskmaster. Now I
[1123.4s] will come down. Not only to come down
[1126.2s] and set your issues. He says I will come
[1129.5s] down and give you a solution by doing
[1132.5s] what? I will deliver you and take you to
[1135.8s] the good
[1138.3s] land and you shall be there. By the way,
[1141.4s] chapter 3 verse 6 7 8 9 of Exodus says,
[1145.0s] I'll take you to a good large land that
[1147.5s] is flowing with honey and what? And
[1150.3s] milk. the land that God has promised us.
[1152.5s] He's saying, "I will cause these people
[1155.0s] from captivity to go back to where I
[1157.7s] promised them." My friend, the only
[1160.4s] person who could be able to listen to
[1163.0s] this word, it is somebody who has been
[1165.8s] pained and is feeling the need of going
[1168.6s] back home. Hallelujah. Of going back
[1170.6s] home. There are people in this world who
[1173.4s] have reached the climax of everything.
[1176.1s] They are seated and they are saying,
[1177.8s] "All is what? All is well." I am
[1180.3s] reminding you this morning that this
[1182.7s] world is not our home. We are going
[1186.9s] home. Jesus will come someday and take
[1189.8s] us home. Our disappointments will be
[1192.6s] turned to be something else. And God
[1195.2s] says, "I will take them back." And when
[1197.8s] he says that, he means that the people
[1200.2s] who are sick, they'll be able to sit
[1202.0s] down and hear the word of God. And verse
[1205.0s] four says, "And this are the words that
[1207.5s] the Lord spake concerning Israel and
[1210.2s] concerning Judah." Verse five, "For thus
[1212.8s] says the
[1214.2s] Lord, we have heard a voice of
[1218.7s] trembling, of fear, and not of
[1222.0s] peace." For people are just, you know,
[1225.3s] some people when they have heard this
[1226.6s] prophecy, they are gearing towards going
[1228.8s] home. Some people are like, "No, no, no,
[1231.0s] no, no. Where are you going? Are you
[1232.8s] sure there is deliverance after this?
[1234.8s] Yes. For God is saying, "Ask ye now, see
[1239.0s] whether a man doth travail with child.
[1242.6s] Wherefore do I see every man with his
[1245.4s] hands on his rins as a woman in what? In
[1248.5s] traine, and all faces are turned into
[1252.0s] peness." No.
[1256.5s] The people that were living in in in in
[1258.9s] Babylon when they heard Jeremiah tell
[1261.9s] the children of Israel that there is a
[1264.0s] time God is turning these things away
[1266.1s] and taking you back. They were like huh
[1268.3s] you are not so sure about it but God is
[1271.0s] is is is sure with his word and he says
[1273.2s] we are going back and he's like now I
[1275.7s] see the way people are what are
[1277.7s] travailing they are in pain people are
[1280.6s] are confused people are here they they
[1283.2s] do not know peace for they are going
[1286.2s] ahead the disease has eaten them they
[1289.0s] have been in pain for a long time but
[1291.3s] God needs to give them what peace and
[1293.8s] they want to go home my
[1296.9s] Sin can make a separation between us and
[1299.8s] God to the point even when he's speaking
[1302.1s] to us, we see it is something else. Sin
[1305.3s] can make a separation in us with God
[1307.8s] that when when when God is speaking
[1310.2s] something golly to us, we see it as an
[1312.7s] ungodly. It gives it gives paralysis to
[1315.8s] their conscience of men. And when men
[1318.1s] stand, they say that this one cannot
[1320.7s] happen. We have not seen God. let your
[1323.7s] people unto our hands and deliver you
[1325.8s] back. He's not going to do
[1328.0s] that.
[1331.0s] Friends,
[1332.5s] God is the only
[1334.9s] antidote to any grievous sin in your
[1339.0s] heart. He can change things. Even when
[1342.8s] you are not sure, even when you want to
[1345.2s] doubt it, God can able to stand because
[1347.4s] he says that day when it comes, it will
[1351.1s] come with that people be confused. There
[1353.8s] is that uh uh people are fearing and
[1357.3s] people are like it is it is it is not
[1359.3s] like something that we are so sure about
[1361.0s] it. But it is terrible to feel sin
[1364.2s] without feeling the what the burden of
[1366.0s] Jesus Christ. You are just seeing and
[1367.7s] saying no no no no no God let us he he
[1370.5s] decided to let us go into captivity. Yes
[1373.1s] because of our sin some diseases are
[1376.3s] eating us for we have gone against the
[1379.8s] ways of
[1381.4s] God. Some days ago I was attending to a
[1385.6s] cancer patient somewhere and he told me
[1388.3s] these words. Edna, I am not so sure that
[1393.1s] God is still
[1394.5s] loving and I'm not so sure God can
[1398.0s] heal. Why would God allow such a
[1400.9s] calamity to come in this into this
[1403.2s] world? But the Bible says for those who
[1407.2s] have forsaken me, I will let them go to
[1411.1s] captivity. Hello. Yes. If you have
[1414.6s] forsaken God, God can able to do what?
[1416.7s] To let you go. The disease is going to
[1419.8s] come unto you. The sin will be able to
[1422.0s] eat you here, eat it, eat you. And you
[1424.6s] will never have time even to be able to
[1426.6s] do what? To stand and know. But
[1429.2s] remember, the day of the deliverance of
[1432.6s] God will surely come. Hallelujah. The
[1436.6s] day that God will sweep even the old
[1440.1s] system that are affecting us will surely
[1442.6s] come and people will be amazed. People
[1445.4s] will be running up and about asking how
[1448.3s] is it then? How did God do this? God,
[1451.4s] you can never equal God with man. There
[1454.2s] is no integrity that people have that
[1457.0s] can able to be equal to God. God is God
[1459.5s] and that is it. The things that is he's
[1462.1s] going to do, he will do them. And
[1463.9s] therefore, he continues to say something
[1465.9s] quickly. It says, "But they, but they,"
[1470.2s] verse n, "but they shall s the Lord
[1472.9s] their God, and David their king, whom I
[1476.8s] will raise up to them." Verse 10.
[1479.8s] Therefore, fear thou not, oh my servant
[1483.8s] Jacob, said the Lord, neither be
[1485.9s] dismayed, oh Israel, for lo, I will save
[1490.1s] thee from afar. Hello. I will save thee
[1493.5s] from afar and thy seed from the land of
[1496.5s] their captivity. And Jacob shall return
[1499.5s] and shall be in rest and and be quiet
[1502.9s] and none shall make him afraid.
[1507.2s] Hallelujah. God is the only antid
[1510.5s] antidote to these things. When you feel
[1513.2s] that the pain is too much, some people
[1515.8s] will think that you are almost giving
[1518.2s] pass because you are you are wailing and
[1520.6s] and and you are feeling pain. God is
[1523.0s] saying do not be dismayed as the world
[1526.6s] is crying for lack of medicine to treat
[1529.9s] these diseases. God is saying do not be
[1533.0s] dismayed. Hallelujah. I am the only
[1535.4s] solution. Why are you people worried? He
[1537.4s] says I will I I I will be able to save
[1540.2s] you out of this. And that's why in the
[1542.5s] book of Isaiah 41:E10 it says, "Do not
[1545.8s] be dismayed. For I will hold you with my
[1549.8s] own righteous hand." Hallelujah. The
[1552.6s] hand of power will lead you out. For if
[1555.7s] you know you are not sufficient to
[1558.2s] yourself, you look unto God himself. And
[1562.0s] therefore, you know, sometimes we we
[1565.2s] look around and we see sometimes sin has
[1568.8s] made a a barrier between us and God and
[1571.4s] we think that God cannot able to do it.
[1573.3s] Don't be dismayed. Just ask of God. Even
[1576.0s] if you rest in the same disease you you
[1578.9s] you've been you've been you've been sick
[1580.4s] of, God knows your ultimate goal. And
[1583.1s] therefore, he says, "Come and see and
[1586.4s] hear what the Lord is going to do."
[1588.0s] Verse 12 he says for thus say the Lord
[1591.1s] thy bliss is incurable thy wound is
[1596.0s] grievous. The disease that we are going
[1599.2s] to encounter the things that are going
[1601.4s] to affect us. Hello. The things that are
[1605.1s] we are going to be through they are not
[1608.1s] going to be
[1610.5s] cured. Know sometimes I sit back and and
[1613.6s] ask with these things that we are going
[1615.5s] through is God watching? Yes. Are we
[1619.0s] going to be through out of this? Yes.
[1621.2s] But he's saying these things are and are
[1624.3s] going in and the wound is grievous. I
[1627.7s] want verse 13. There is none to plead
[1630.6s] thy cause that thou mayest be bound up.
[1634.3s] Thou has no healing medicine. Now listen
[1638.0s] and listen good friends. We have no way
[1642.6s] we can save ourselves from our sins. No
[1645.6s] way. Unless we go to John 3:16 and say,
[1649.9s] "For God so loved the world, there is no
[1652.6s] one who can come and cure our diseases."
[1655.8s] But he says it is easier to heal a body
[1659.6s] that has been set on the eyes of Jesus
[1662.6s] Christ. Hallelujah. There is a way we
[1665.0s] can be cured. But he says if you are
[1667.5s] looking for medicines, if you are
[1669.4s] looking for anything to cure you, you
[1671.8s] will never be able to get it. He
[1674.7s] says no human hand can be able to bind
[1678.6s] up the wounds that people of this world
[1681.9s] are suffering. No one, no human, no
[1684.6s] human hand. And remember we have the
[1687.1s] skills but Jeremiah is reminding us no
[1691.1s] human skill, no human in intellect can
[1696.6s] be able to come down and tell us the
[1699.4s] solution to the things that we are going
[1701.0s] through. So where do we run to? Where do
[1704.4s] we go? We are looking to Jesus. He says
[1708.8s] no human, no human what? No human
[1711.4s] interact, no skill from this world can
[1714.5s] deeply touch the pain and the complaints
[1718.2s] and the disappointments the people of
[1720.2s] God are going through. And that's why
[1722.1s] when they were in Babylon, they were
[1723.5s] asking, "Ah, Jeremiah, calm down. What
[1726.2s] are you saying? That the Lord is taking
[1728.0s] you back to the land of your fathers?"
[1729.8s] No way. how the way you are. But God has
[1733.4s] a way. No politics, no science and no
[1738.1s] education, nothing can be able to stand
[1741.9s] and prove to be able to help us out of
[1744.5s] the things that we are going through.
[1746.9s] You
[1748.2s] know there are coalitions in this world
[1751.0s] that are working against so many things.
[1753.8s] But I remember when corona came people
[1757.0s] were racing and saying you know now
[1759.2s] prophecies pro is fulfilled we are soon
[1761.8s] going home but soon the corona thing
[1764.1s] died okay and we are back to normal
[1766.9s] things are back to normal and we never
[1768.8s] know what is coming ahead my friend
[1771.4s] there is only hope in Jesus Christ these
[1774.5s] things that we are running to and saying
[1777.0s] oh which country can be able to give us
[1779.0s] an antidote to what to corona an
[1781.7s] antidote to cancer an antidote. An
[1784.1s] antidote to something. There is no
[1786.9s] antidote anywhere apart from God in
[1790.5s] heaven. So if you want to be healed, go
[1793.1s] back to where to God. Go and ask for
[1795.8s] forgiveness of your sin. Go make your
[1798.1s] rights easy with who? With God and walk
[1800.9s] in those paths and God himself can able
[1803.2s] to forgive us because the things that we
[1805.0s] are going through, they are grave. They
[1807.1s] are they are not going to be what? To be
[1809.4s] cured. And God says we will not we will
[1812.6s] not have any medicine that can be able
[1814.6s] to heal these diseases. He says even our
[1818.0s] lovers verse 14 even the nations the
[1821.1s] people of the nation they are coming
[1823.3s] looking to the church and they are
[1825.2s] asking hey church members what do you
[1828.1s] have for us today? And we are maring
[1830.6s] with them and saying the prophecy is
[1832.7s] being fulfilled from
[1834.9s] when? And some of us we say it but the
[1838.4s] Lord is saying even those friends of
[1841.1s] yours even the other nation be coming
[1843.7s] and asking the people of God what do you
[1847.0s] have for us and they be able to say you
[1849.4s] people even your God has let you down.
[1853.9s] You know sometimes we look so desperate
[1857.0s] until the world is like hey even you
[1859.0s] people you trust in God. Are you sure
[1861.0s] that you trust in God? Yeah, we are
[1863.7s] disappointed but you still continue
[1865.4s] trusting in the Lord. We say no no no we
[1867.4s] are not even so sure about this God. It
[1869.4s] is because we want to make sure that we
[1873.0s] want to to continue appalling to our own
[1875.9s] hope. The only hope is who is Jesus
[1878.8s] Christ.
[1881.2s] Let me quickly tell you something that
[1884.6s] friends, we will die for our own
[1890.0s] negligence. For the Lord has said, I am
[1892.8s] here. If you want to be out of sin, I'm
[1895.5s] here. If you want to be healed of cancer
[1897.4s] and other things, I'm here. And us, we
[1899.7s] do not want to seek the what? The face
[1901.4s] of the Lord. Why? We want to put our
[1904.5s] hope for the forsaken things. We want to
[1907.4s] put our hope on the seasonal things that
[1910.3s] will come and go. We want to be like
[1912.6s] those tremors who said we do not want
[1915.3s] this pulse but we want what food. We
[1918.2s] want something temporal but God has
[1921.0s] given us pulse for eternity and we are
[1924.5s] just
[1925.2s] there. He's
[1927.3s] saying my friends put your hope in Jesus
[1931.2s] Christ. He will never forsake you. The
[1933.8s] diseases that have befallen us, it is
[1936.6s] due to our disobedience. It is because
[1939.4s] we've been given the message and we say,
[1941.3s] "No, you know, I worked so hard. I was
[1944.6s] poor and now today I must be able to
[1947.0s] eat." Sometimes you come to church and
[1948.9s] say, you know, those times when we were
[1950.6s] out there, we used to do this and that
[1952.4s] and you have not forgotten them. God is
[1955.0s] saying for those things and come to him,
[1958.7s] he'll be able to do something.
[1961.1s] Do you know what many of times we in
[1964.2s] when we are in this church there is
[1966.6s] something that is sweet to our
[1969.1s] ears the marriage bells that is
[1973.0s] something that keeps us we we are so
[1975.3s] happy when we hear there is somebody who
[1977.2s] is getting married this one is marrying
[1979.0s] the other one but let me tell you this
[1980.6s] friends there is a music in the book of
[1983.5s] Jeremiah that is sweeter than the
[1985.8s] marriage bells hallelujah it is sweeter
[1988.5s] than the marriage bells because him who
[1991.5s] allowed us to go to captivity is coming
[1994.5s] again to be able to take us out of
[1996.4s] captivity. Hallelujah. Let's read the
[1998.2s] book of Osiah before we come back. Hosea
[2000.4s] chapter 6 verse 1 and 2 and 3. Hosea is
[2003.1s] saying you know the story of but I'm
[2004.7s] borrowing these words that are very
[2006.6s] strong to my heart. He says come let us
[2009.7s] return to the Lord. Hallelujah. For he
[2013.3s] has torn he will heal us. He has smitten
[2017.1s] and he will bind us up. Come, let us do
[2020.4s] what? Go back. Meaning, let us repent
[2023.4s] and go back to God. For he has good
[2026.0s] plans for his people. Hallelujah. He
[2028.3s] continues to save us too. After two days
[2031.2s] will he revive us. In the third day, he
[2034.3s] will raise us up and we shall be we
[2037.4s] shall live in his sight. Hallelujah.
[2039.5s] Verse three, then shall we know if we
[2044.0s] follow on on to know the Lord. His going
[2047.8s] forth is prepared as the morning and he
[2051.7s] shall come unto us as the rain as the
[2055.1s] latter and the former rain unto the
[2057.3s] earth. Hallelujah. We know we are going
[2060.4s] through issues because we have decline
[2063.0s] spiritually. But God is saying come,
[2066.0s] I'll be able to revive you. Hallelujah.
[2068.0s] God is going to give us a way back home.
[2070.6s] He's going to restore
[2072.6s] us. Is going the antidote of the things
[2077.1s] that are causing pain in
[2079.9s] us. And he
[2082.3s] says for this music that is sweeter than
[2086.4s] the marriage bells is inviting us to our
[2090.2s] memory text which says for I will
[2093.8s] restore verse 14 sorry verse 17 for I
[2097.0s] will restore health unto thee. I will
[2100.6s] heal thee of thy wounds, say the Lord,
[2103.5s] because thou because they called thee an
[2107.1s] outcast, saying, This is Zion, whom no
[2111.2s] man seeketh
[2113.1s] after.
[2117.0s] Friends, we are going back.
[2121.3s] But
[2122.4s] as as Christ is initiating the process,
[2127.7s] may we know what is happening. I was
[2130.7s] looking at this verse and I got some
[2133.2s] interest on one or two words that I want
[2135.2s] us to be able to crown with. God is
[2137.8s] saying I will
[2143.2s] restore. Restore can be translated also
[2146.8s] as rise up. It can be also
[2152.3s] ascend up. I was looking at it was
[2155.4s] Babylon down the valleys that these
[2158.2s] people when they were given restoration
[2161.1s] now they were supposed to ascend to the
[2163.2s] mountains of God and say for sure we are
[2166.2s] going home. Hallelujah. God will restore
[2169.3s] it back to us. And he's saying as you
[2172.7s] ascend to the home that I've prepared
[2175.6s] for you, as you go in and get what God
[2179.4s] has blessed us with, he's saying I will
[2181.9s] take away all the diseases that are
[2185.2s] affecting your life.
[2186.9s] Hallelujah. God is really serious about
[2190.2s] what about us and he's saying it is not
[2193.4s] you who is going to do it. It is God is
[2196.0s] the initiator of the what? of the
[2198.0s] process is inviting us and saying let's
[2201.0s] go. This is an ongoing process. He's
[2204.3s] going to do it again and again. When we
[2207.0s] accept we want to go back, God is saying
[2210.0s] I will restore. I will restore health
[2213.3s] unto you and I will
[2216.6s] heal. Heal is
[2219.7s] repairing. Making sure you have cured.
[2222.7s] You have thoroughly made something that
[2225.3s] was out of shape to come back to shape.
[2228.1s] Other Bible translators have said he's
[2230.5s] going to grow new flesh in your body.
[2233.4s] Hallelujah. He's going to give you a new
[2236.0s] way. And as saying he's going to give us
[2238.3s] the heart of what? Flesh. That we can be
[2240.9s] able to take the one and leave the one
[2243.3s] and move. And we will never get to
[2245.8s] understand how God did it, but God will
[2248.4s] be able to to do it. You remember when
[2251.7s] God is doing these things, people are
[2253.6s] just watching and saying why is this the
[2255.7s] God this is what your God can able to do
[2258.0s] because at some point you are feeling
[2260.4s] rejected and dejected and you are
[2262.6s] feeling that no God is not here and
[2264.6s] that's why he's saying they call you
[2266.2s] outcast even your God cannot be able to
[2269.3s] save you our God is the only antidote to
[2273.3s] these things that we
[2275.2s] call is coming is going to do it for him
[2279.4s] He has a way that is going to make us
[2281.7s] move. And that's why verse 18 is saying,
[2283.6s] "Thus say the Lord, behold, I will bring
[2287.0s] again the captivity of Jacob, stand and
[2289.4s] have merc on his dwelling place, and the
[2291.9s] city shall be building upon her own hip,
[2296.2s] and the palace shall remain after the
[2298.7s] manner there." Or friends, it is God who
[2302.0s] is going to repair. It is God who is
[2304.2s] going to restore and make sure that we
[2306.2s] will be able to rise up again. Sometimes
[2308.6s] you you you you get there you are very
[2310.9s] sick and you ask ah am I going to make
[2313.4s] it and you find that you have you you
[2314.8s] have made it is it you not you it is God
[2317.6s] for God is going to
[2319.4s] restore and sister white says these
[2321.8s] words in the book great great
[2324.0s] controversy chapter 36 that is the it
[2328.0s] says about the time of Jacob's trouble
[2329.9s] he says the time h the time had the time
[2336.1s] that God had with his people was
[2338.7s] manifested in his power to be able to
[2341.4s] save them. And he says, she says God
[2344.5s] will not want his people to server
[2347.3s] because of his name to not to server his
[2350.5s] name not to be reproached by the h by
[2352.8s] the hidden. What will he do? He will
[2355.5s] rise up and deliver his people and for
[2359.1s] those who would wait for him patiently,
[2361.8s] he will make them to rise never to go
[2365.2s] back again. Hallelujah. Yes. And you
[2368.5s] know God is very go the way God does his
[2371.0s] things when he comes to you he'll be
[2373.0s] able to take you move you and you move
[2375.5s] to the point you feel that now this the
[2377.6s] place I'm supposed to be. It is God who
[2380.3s] is the subject of the things that are
[2382.2s] happening in this world. He's going to
[2384.0s] do something. He's going to restore us.
[2386.8s] He's going to move us. He is doing that
[2389.4s] work not once not not thrice but he's
[2393.1s] continuing to do the work. Why? He has
[2396.0s] the restoration power. Hallelujah.
[2399.4s] Friends, there is no
[2401.7s] diagnosis. There is no diagnosis that is
[2405.0s] beyond God's power. That is beyond God's
[2408.2s] power to reverse. There is nothing that
[2410.1s] people can be able to say in this world
[2411.7s] that can God cannot able to reverse.
[2413.8s] Just trust in God. And remember when he
[2416.2s] has said I will do it, God himself do
[2418.6s] what? He'll do it.
[2421.0s] So I come to the
[2424.1s] end. I met this cancer patient. He told
[2428.0s] me I am going to die but I just want to
[2432.4s] hear some few words from you. And as we
[2435.6s] were conversing
[2437.8s] said God is going God going to forgive
[2441.4s] me because back in his mind he's saying
[2444.2s] it is my negligence. It is me who has
[2447.3s] led to this thing. I said
[2451.0s] yes God will restore
[2454.9s] you as much as you feel the pain today
[2458.7s] God will restore it and that's why I
[2463.7s] will invite you to sing with me this
[2466.0s] song the chistas that once you turn your
[2469.1s] eyes upon Jesus the moment you feel that
[2472.8s] you are down and you turn your eyes upon
[2475.7s] Jesus God himself
[2478.5s] will turn things for you. Hallelujah.
[2481.5s] He'll be able to make things right again
[2483.4s] for you. You know, sometimes you you are
[2485.3s] questioning yourself and you're saying,
[2486.6s] "I'm going to die." Yes, you'll be able
[2489.0s] to die. Yes. But you'll be able to sleep
[2491.3s] at the hands of Jesus Christ.
[2492.7s] Hallelujah. You turn your eyes for for
[2496.5s] in him you can able to have the anti dot
[2499.7s] of the things that are paining you, the
[2502.3s] disappointments, the things that are
[2504.1s] pulling you down. and one moment and one
[2507.0s] morning you shall be able to be taken
[2510.0s] back to the ways that God wanted you to
[2512.7s] be and be in the land of the your
[2515.1s] forefathers that God promised you to be.
[2517.1s] And may God bless you.
