FULL TRANSCRIPT:
Hi, my name is Howie. I'm going to be reading the mission. The title is scary first day. Do you remember your first day of school? Was it scary? Were you nervous? What can you do when you're scared or nervous? Shimsham was a missionary kid who was scared and nervous on her first day of school in Korat, Thailand. She had been homeschooled for first grade, but now mom said she was a grown-up girl and should be she was a grown-up girl and she should study with other boys and girls in the missionary adventist school. Mom was a missionary who taught fifth grade at the school so she wouldn't be too far away if Shimshim needed help. Mom saw that Shimshim was anxious and she reminded her that God was always nearby if she needed help. God will always be your friend. Mom said he will always be there for you when you need him. Shimshim was glad for the reminder, but she still felt scared and nervous. She felt wiggly all over as she put on her school uniform for the first time. She liked the white and blue uniform. She felt shy and she was glad that all the children at the missionary school wore the same white and blue uniform. That way, she wouldn't stand out. After breakfast, Shim Shim went to the school. The first the first thing that she learned was that no one wears shoes into the school building. Shoes carried out and the new school building which was built with the help of the 13th Sabbath offering was very clean. So all the kids who took off their shoes and so all the kids took off their shoes and put them in a cupboard. At recess time, the At recess time, the children put on their shoes to go and play on the playground. Then, when recess ended, they clapped their shoes together to get rid of the dust and put them back into the cupboard until school was over. Shim Shim slipped off her shoes and put them into the cupboard. Then, she joined the other children walking into their classrooms. She walked slowly towards the second grade classroom. She felt scared and nervous as she neared the door. Before opening it, she prayed to God. Dear God, she said, please help me be kind so I can be a nice girl in class. Amen. Inside the classroom, the teacher called Shimshim to the front. Shimshim was a new student and she needed to meet her classmates. Even though Shimshim knew God had heard her prayer, she felt nervous as she went up front. Her fingers trembled. "What's your name?" the teacher said. "My name is Shimshim," Shimshim said. She smiled and waved to the other children in class. "This is Shimshim," the teacher said. "Hello." All the children exclaimed together. Shimshim liked the greeting, but she felt a little scared and a little nervous. What would happen next? The morning hours passed quickly as Shimshim studied grammar, English, and geography. She likes playing outside for PE. By lunchtime, Shimshim felt like she had been studying at the school for a whole year. She was no longer scared. She no longer felt nervous. The other children were nice and she had many new friends. God answered her prayer and Shimshim was super super happy. Even missionary kids get scared and nervous sometimes. While Shimshim's parents are 7th Day Adventists, many children at the Seventh Day Adventist International School in Thailand come from families who haven't heard about God. When they get scared and nervous, they they don't know what they can do and they can that they can pray to him. Part of our previous 13th Sabbath offering went to this school to help more kids learn about God. Your 13th Sabbath offering this quarter will also help children learn about God. We're going to sing from the hymn 590. Trust and obey. When we walk with the Lord in the light of his word, what a glory he sheds on our way while we do his good will. He abides with us still and with all who will trust and oy trust and oy for there's no other way to be happy in Jesus but to trust and oy. Not a shadow can rise. Not a cloud in the skies, but his smile quickly drives it away. Not a doubt, nor a fear, nor a sign, nor a tear can abide what we trust and oy. Trust and oy for there's no other way to be happy in Jesus but to trust and oy not a burden we bear not a sorrow we share but a toil he doth richly repay. Not a grave nor a loss. Not a frown or a cross, but is blessed if we trust and oy, trust and oy. For there's no other way to be happy in Jesus, but to trust and oy. But we never can prove the delights of his love until all on the altar we lay. For the favor he shows and the joy he bestows are for them who will trust and oy. trust and oy for there's no other way to be happy in Jesus but to trust and oy then in fellowship sweet we will sit at his feet or we'll walk by his side in the way what he says we will do where he says we will go never fear Truly trust and oy. Trust and oy for there's no other way to be happy in Jesus but to trust and oy. Welcome to this uh lesson seven restored at church. It's an amazing amazing amazing lesson that we have today. But before we go into the lesson, I'll welcome Odongo to guide us with a word of prayer. Let's bow our heads for a word of prayer. Dear Jesus, we thank you for this day. We thank you for the gift of life. Thank you for bringing us here today even as we are about to dive into your word. May you please bless us, guide us and protect us. Help us to remember everything that are to be taught in Jesus name we pray. Amen. Amen. Before we start, uh what comes into your minds when we hear about uh restored at church? Uh what comes into my mind is that um you are once um broken. Um you aren't in one piece, but going to church um made you whole again. Amen. Amen. But Dongo, uh in my view, it's more or less the same thing. It's when uh you are lost in a way, then you go to church and Jesus brings you back to him. Amen. What I think, what comes to my mind when you say restored at church, it means like when I go to church, when I'm a sinner, I come out when I am I am forgiven and I'm cleansed. Amen. Howie uh what comes to my mind is that you might be like deep into sin like you've done terrible things but when you come back to church you leave while you're saved. Amen. Amen. It's so amazing the answers that you have given they um they are all correct and uh going into the into the lesson it takes us back into the uh 7th day Adventist beliefs um number eight uh which talks about uh the great controversy uh it's one of the things that happened uh in heaven um Jesus like someone that you have shown the way and then turns to go against your will Um going into the lesson we have uh restored in church. In this story, we're going to look at um the the the work that our Jesus um did um the center of his ministry and even me ask like we all know u this city it's one of the greatest cities uh ke like what comes into your mind what do you know about it uh what I know about capam is that it was Jesus's almost primary place to start his ministry so he could reach diverse people and uh spread the word of God. Amen. Blessing. Um uh Capen is where Jesus um went into um a state of teaching. It was different from the rest. And so um in this place he could um he knew he could um make people come to him by what he was supposed to do then. Amen. And what I know about Capenam is where Jesus cast out an unclean spirit. It's where Jesus had like one of his most powerful teachings. Amen. One of the things uh that we know about this city of Kipanom, it was it was like at the center of um the center of like um the ministry of Jesus Christ. Apart from that, it was like a highway of the uh from Damascus uh to Jerusalem and Egypt. So it was a big city whereby like all people used to pass so that can be able to meet at the center of it like to to share the word of God. So this city of uh Kipanam was at the center of u um the savior's ministry being uh at the highway from Damascus to Jerusalem and Egypt and to the Mediterranean Sea. It was a great a great a great um place for the ministry of God um to take place and also it's a place whereby used to meet all kinds of people the rich the poor when they were like moving from one place to a to another at this point I'll welcome Har to take us uh through the what do you think uh section what do you think look up the following passages exodus 22:18 and it says, "You shall not permit a sorcerer to live." Uh, can someone look up Leviticus 19 26? You shall not eat anything with the blood, nor shall you practice divination or soothsaying? And can someone read Leviticus 20:6? And the person who turns to mediums and familiar spirits to prostitute himself with them, I will set my face against that person and cut him off from his people. Deuteronomy 18 verse 9-14. And it says, when you come into the land which the Lord your God is giving you, you shall not learn to follow the abomination of those nations. There shall not be found among you anyone who makes his son or his daughter pass through the fire. One who practices witchcraft or a soothsayer or one who is or one who interprets or a sorcerer or one who conjurs spells or a medium or spirits or one who calls upon the dead. For all who do this are an abomination to the Lord. Because of these abominations, the Lord your God drives them out before you. You shall be blameless before the Lord your God. For these nations which you will disposess, listen to the soothsayers and divers. But as for you, the Lord your God has not appointed such for you. Isaiah 8 verse 19. And when they say to you, "Seek those who are mediums and wizards, who whisper and m, should not a people seek their God? Should they seek the dead on behalf of the living?" All of these all of these texts speak against spiritualism in some form. Why do you think that the warning prohibiting involvement in these things was given over and over? Uh the reason why it's repeated is because uh in the one of the commandments it says thou shalt not worship any other god but me. So anything that's outside of that is considered an abomination to the lord. Um it is also written that um this uh this spiritualism will come and um it will divert the focus of the people from God to worldly stuff. um stuff that won't help them and um in the end it will end up destroying them. Amen. I think it was repeated so many times because maybe they were practicing spiritualism and and they did not listen to the warnings. Amen. Amen. Basically all these things like um what is uh is written in the Bible everything was written to us uh to be followers of Christ and when you look at um his teachings he used to teach people used to draw people nearer to to the kingdom of God and uh and taking these things um things like um the things that he say like you should not take you are like to believe that's why when you look at his ministry Um in the desire of ages of chapter 26 it talks about him like the powerful message he used to give unto people and people used to listen to him because of these things that he used to tell them. He did not like do something to pretend in the eyes of people but he used to hit them with the truth. That's why all these all these people they used to to follow him. They loved him so much to a point whereby like they used like to ask like where is he? where you see because of the things that he used to give. So all these things that they have been given unto us we have like to follow them what the word says they were not written like to scare us but to draw us closer and closer to God. Now I welcome a blessing to take us uh through the Monday part. Um can I get someone to read John 14 11-13? John 14 11-13 and it says, "Believe me that I am in the Father and the Father in me, or else believe me for the sake of the works themselves. Most assuredly I say to you, he who believes in me, the works that I do, he will do also, and greater works than these he will do because I go to my father. and whatever you ask in my name that I will do that the father may be glorified in the son. Um do we have access to the same power that Jesus manifested um to the with the demon? If so, why are so many prayers um seemingly not answered? Uh there's this verse that says if you ask in my name and it's according to the father's will he will answer it. So there are these prayers that god says yes no and wait but actually it's yes and no. Yes is wait a bit. So uh if you ask in the proper the proper way and it's according to God's will he will answer it. Is there anything we can do to lay claim that to that supernatural power? We can pray to God to ask for that power. It's it's it's also if I may add to what Odonga said, it's something like we can get it from God. It's also like it's a a gift given uh from God. It's not something like any person can just access my belief, but it's something that it's a godly given thing. If you believe in him, you will get it. But the only way you can get it is by believing in his teachings and following his word. You can be able to get it. Uh at this point, we'll move on to the Tuesday part that will be taken by. Could someone read John 8:31 and 32? And it says, "Then Jesus said to those Jews who believed in him. If you abide in my word, you you are my disciples indeed, and you shall know the truth, and the truth shall make you free." Amen. Read this week's flashlight. Note how Ellen White points out that it was in the Savior's presence that the darkness was penetrated with light. The flashlight summarized, "The mind of this wretched sufferer has been darkened by Satan. But in the savior's presence, a ray of light has pierce the gloom." How can we practice being in God's presence? We can practice being in God's presence by talking to him, like praying every day, reading the Bible, and growing closer to him. That way, you'll be in his presence. How will that help us resist temptation? Um if you submit to God and um he's you're closer to him um and you resist the devil uh he will flee from you. So you'll have lesser um lesser cases of temptation. Amen. Also to add to that uh in the book John 8:31-32 it's self-explanatory saying if you abide in my word you are my disciples indeed. So all we need to do is study the Bible and uh follow God's word. So how does someone live in the presence of Jesus? Uh if I can add on what uh you guys have said uh the only the only way like we can stay in the presence of the lord uh uh it's through by uh reading the word that's number one and then keeping his commandments you know these commandments they were not given unto us to just uh look at them but they were given unto us so that we can obey them we observe them if we observe them then it will be easier for us to to have even power to rule over things um that seems to be u somehow hard for us cuz through uh God's presence we can be able to move mountains. Yeah. Because his disciples did. We are his disciples at this present times. So whatever they did, we have the power to do it. And the only way we can be able to do it is by going unto the into our knees and also following uh his teachings. Yeah. Amen. U blessings uh you can take us through the Wednesday part. Um so Wednesday is practically the punchlines. So I'll ask someone to read Leviticus 19:31. Leviticus 19:31. And it says, "Give no regard to mediums and familiar spirits. Do not seek after them to be defiled by them. I am the Lord your God." Um what main point um do you get from that verse? That we should only ask God for help and not other spirits and witches. Yes. I will summarize Ephesians chapter 6 verse 13 to 18. Um it's practically talks about putting on the full armor of God um in to enable us to withstand any evil that comes our way. So um what I took from that is um that when you have the full armor of God, when God is around you um you'll be able to stand your ground against any evil that will come your way. So, can someone recite for me James 4:7? And it says, "Submit to God, resist the devil, and he will flee from you." Amen. Can I get someone to read First Peter 5:8 and 9 and it says, "Be sober, be vigilant, because your adversary, the devil, walks around like a roaring lion, seeking whom he may devour. Resist him steadfast in the faith knowing that the same sufferings are experienced by your brotherhood in the world. Amen. So we'll take the main points that we got from these punchlines and make our own verse. So what I came up with was do not turn to mediums or speak seek spirits. Um for I am the Lord your God. Therefore, put on the full armor of God so that when the day of evil comes, you may be able to withstand your you may be able to stand your ground. So then submit yourself to God. Resist the devil and he will flee from you. And be alert and of sober mind, for the devil pros around like a roaring lion getting ready to devour. Getting ready to devour. Amen. Did anyone come up with um any main points to make their own verse? If I can add something uh looking at uh God's ministry in uh um one of the things that he did um when the the woman the person the spirits came it's like he rebuked the spirits through um the power the holy spirit that work in him the the the spirits like they they flew away the people were asking like who is this man even like the spirits like the evil spirits obey him And at this point uh if I may say like people never knew like who he was. That's why they were asking like who is this man? Even the spirit like obey him. Um we can do all these things if we only believe like we have the power and everything to do all these things in our various uh workplaces school especially for us for those people in school. You can make your you can be your own man. You can be your own like you can make your own empire by what you have what you have read that God can do this. Yeah. And then draw people. You can draw your classmates into the presence of the Lord. The way you carry yourself. Yeah. You can just be a minister. Do it without fear. Like the way you say like you came up with your own words. You can make these words and say like I'm going to impact the lives of people. in school because God did it. Who am I to do it and he gave me like I have the power and everything to do all these things. So I would like like to encourage like all of us like whatever god did we can be able to to do it as well. Uh I welcome to take us through the Thursday part. Okay. So for Thursday I want to ask us to read the keys. First of all I'll ask start with the questions. How does the devil try to gain access to my heart? He tempts us using the things we like. What is the best strategy to resist his advances? You can now read the key text which is Philippians 4:8. And it says, "Finally, brethren, whatever things are true, whatever things are noble, whatever things are just, whatever things are pure, whatever things are lovely, whatever things are of good report, if there's any virtue, and if there's anything praiseworthy, meditate on these things." Amen. So that verse is self-explanatory saying whatever things are true, just, pure, lovely, all those good things, think on them and uh just to emulate Jesus's character through compassion in action, demonstrating authority over evil by praying and uh the priority of God's kingdom and the significance of personal connection with God. So all we need to do is like this verse says focus on everything that is of good report, true, lovely, all of those things. Yeah. Amen. Are we Do you have something to add on that? Um when he asked what is the best strategy to resist his advances? I think it's like if you stand firm in your faith, it'll be very easy for you to resist the temptations. Amen. Amen. uh if we look at chapter uh during the ministry of uh Jesus Christ when he was uh tempted actually when he was taken to the wilderness like to be to be tempted most of his answers he used to refer like it's written it's written like man shall not live by bread alone you see those are the things like used to refer to so it's one of the things like if you look at even we as Christians we as the followers of Christ. Sometimes you can get something and then you feel like hey I prayed for this thing but then again like I have it and then one thing we forget it's like whatever like God whatever we pray to God the devil can just bring a counterfeit of what we prayed for. What will help us to know like this is a counterfeit of what I prayed for? It's that spirit of discernment like the way you pray and the Holy Spirit it's in you and this it um reminds us of the the the the importance of prayer in our lives. The importance of reading the word of God in the walk of salvation to to us we Christians because you cannot grow in faith if you don't read one the word number two if you don't read uh if you don't pray. These two they work like hand in hand. So if the devil comes it will not be easier for you to give in because you know like you're that kind of a person who spends most time in prayer. You read the word of God and you know the spirit will be able to guide you and like no this is not from God but this is from from the devil. Your heart everything will just direct you. Amen. Amen. So at this point I will welcome uh h how to take us through the Sabbath part. All humanity is now involved in great controversies between Christ and Satan regarding the character of God, his law and his sovereignity through the universe. Satan lead led Adam and Eve into sin. This human sin resulted in distortion of the image of God in humanity. This world became the arena of the universal conflict out of which the God of love will ultimately be vindicted to assist the his people in the controversy. Christ sends the Holy Spirit and the loyal angels to guide, protect and sustain them in the way of salvation. looking at the Sabbath part uh one of the things we we see here or one of the things like we capture it's the great controversy and that's fundamental belief number eight at this point this that struggle between Christianity and then evil things the devil is fighting to win souls unto his kingdom at the same time the most high God is fighting for our lives to we believers that's the the the controversy that we have at this point in this world. They start war. Now the question comes in like on who side are you going to feel safe? Are you going to feel safe in the hands of the Lord or you're going to feel safe in the hands of Satan? It's a question like we should ask ourselves because God is really fighting and God has given us that free will. You choose. You cannot just come and stand in front of you and say like I'm going to gain you if you don't follow me. No, they start free will unto us. The same same teachings used to give people. They're the same same teachings that we have here right now. It's a personal decision that we have to make. Uh at this point I'll just ask everyone to do a to have just a a parting shot of of of the lesson starting by. So from this lesson I've learned how to resist temptations and how to differentiate between the word of God and what the devil says. Amen. From this lesson I have learned that God is our refuge and strength. From this lesson, I've learned that we need to look to God and uh do not and not to conform to the ways of this world or be transformed by the power of the Holy Spirit. Um from this lesson, um I've learned that no matter how big your request sounds, as long as you believe and submit yourself to God, um he will be there for you. Amen. uh when we look at um the great controversy this one thing that um I loved I loved about um this lesson he talks about u this a place he talked about uh the Sabbath during the Sabbath many people crowds of people used to gather in the synagogues to to hear about uh the teachings of God to a point whereby other people used uh to go back because they could not find a days to stand and u it tells us one thing. It reminds us one thing the Sabbath it was sanctified by God. It is a holy name a holy a holy day for us to worship him. We can hear a lot of people talks talk about the Sabbath about Sunday talk about Friday wherever but we only know one day that was sanctified by God and it was blessed. That's why you hear during creation everything that was that he created used to say like it's good it's good it's good but the Sabbath it was blessed and sanctified people used to come to listen to him to listen to what he had to say because they believed in his teachings and one thing I asked myself is like do I have these qualities that I can draw people closer and closer to God and to the presence of the of the Lord. It's a question like I would like like every person to ask to ask him him or herself about uh this lesson. What do I have to do to win souls unto the presence of the Lord in school, in church, in the market places? What do I have to do to win souls unto the kingdom of the Lord? Your age doesn't matter but the message that you have to give that's what matters most. That's why you can see these people they use they were like who is this person? It's because they believed in his teachings. They love these teachings. We have those things in us. We have those qualities. We have the Holy Spirit. What we have to do is to believe in ourselves that we can win souls unto the kingdom of the Lord. At this point, I'll ask um Pendle to pray for us as we conclude uh the lesson. Let's pray. Our kind and loving father, thankful this day, thank for the gift of life. Lord, from the lessons you have learned from this lesson restored at church, help us to apply the lessons in Jesus name I pray. Amen. Amen. 

==================================================

TIMESTAMPED TRANSCRIPT:
[0.2s] Hi, my name is Howie. I'm going to be
[2.2s] reading the mission. The title is scary
[4.7s] first day. Do you remember your first
[7.5s] day of school? Was it scary? Were you
[11.4s] nervous? What can you do when you're
[13.5s] scared or nervous? Shimsham was a
[16.1s] missionary kid who was scared and
[18.2s] nervous on her first day of school in
[21.5s] Korat, Thailand. She had been
[24.0s] homeschooled for first grade, but now
[26.3s] mom said she was a grown-up girl and
[28.8s] should be she was a grown-up girl and
[31.6s] she should study with other boys and
[33.4s] girls in the missionary adventist
[36.8s] school. Mom was a missionary who taught
[39.7s] fifth grade at the school so she
[42.5s] wouldn't be too far away if Shimshim
[44.3s] needed help. Mom saw that Shimshim was
[47.6s] anxious and she reminded her that God
[50.2s] was always nearby if she needed help.
[53.1s] God will always be your friend. Mom said
[56.4s] he will always be there for you when you
[58.1s] need him. Shimshim was glad for the
[61.4s] reminder, but she still felt scared and
[65.3s] nervous. She felt wiggly all over as she
[68.0s] put on her school uniform for the first
[69.7s] time. She liked the white and blue
[72.0s] uniform. She felt shy and she was glad
[74.9s] that all the children at the missionary
[76.6s] school wore the same white and blue
[78.6s] uniform. That way, she wouldn't stand
[81.1s] out.
[82.4s] After breakfast, Shim Shim went to the
[84.9s] school. The first the first thing that
[87.8s] she learned was that no one wears shoes
[90.3s] into the school building. Shoes carried
[92.9s] out and the new school building which
[95.8s] was built with the help of the 13th
[97.6s] Sabbath offering was very clean. So all
[100.9s] the kids who took off their shoes and so
[103.3s] all the kids took off their shoes and
[105.4s] put them in a cupboard. At recess time,
[108.5s] the At recess time, the children put on
[111.0s] their shoes to go and play on the
[112.4s] playground. Then, when recess ended,
[114.8s] they clapped their shoes together to get
[116.5s] rid of the dust and put them back into
[118.0s] the cupboard until school was over. Shim
[121.0s] Shim slipped off her shoes and put them
[123.3s] into the cupboard. Then, she joined the
[125.4s] other children walking into their
[127.1s] classrooms. She walked slowly towards
[129.4s] the second grade classroom. She felt
[131.8s] scared and nervous as she neared the
[134.4s] door. Before opening it, she prayed to
[141.5s] God. Dear God, she said, please help me
[145.2s] be kind so I can be a nice girl in
[147.3s] class. Amen. Inside the classroom, the
[150.3s] teacher called Shimshim to the
[152.2s] front. Shimshim was a new student and
[155.4s] she needed to meet her
[157.4s] classmates. Even though Shimshim knew
[159.8s] God had heard her prayer, she felt
[161.9s] nervous as she went up front. Her
[164.8s] fingers trembled. "What's your name?"
[167.2s] the teacher said. "My name is Shimshim,"
[170.4s] Shimshim said. She smiled and waved to
[172.7s] the other children in class. "This is
[174.6s] Shimshim," the teacher said.
[176.7s] "Hello." All the children exclaimed
[179.0s] together. Shimshim liked the greeting,
[181.2s] but she felt a little scared and a
[183.0s] little nervous. What would happen
[185.6s] next? The morning hours passed quickly
[188.3s] as Shimshim studied grammar, English,
[190.7s] and geography. She likes playing outside
[193.4s] for PE. By lunchtime, Shimshim felt like
[197.3s] she had been studying at the school for
[199.1s] a whole year. She was no longer
[202.1s] scared. She no longer felt nervous. The
[205.6s] other children were nice and she had
[208.6s] many new friends. God answered her
[211.4s] prayer and Shimshim was super super
[213.5s] happy. Even missionary kids get scared
[216.6s] and nervous sometimes. While Shimshim's
[219.0s] parents are 7th Day Adventists, many
[221.1s] children at the Seventh Day Adventist
[223.4s] International School in Thailand come
[225.9s] from families who haven't heard about
[227.8s] God. When they get scared and nervous,
[230.6s] they they don't know what they can do
[233.4s] and they can that they can pray to him.
[235.8s] Part of our previous 13th Sabbath
[237.5s] offering went to this school to help
[239.6s] more kids learn about God. Your 13th
[242.5s] Sabbath offering this quarter will also
[244.6s] help children learn about
[246.6s] God. We're going to sing from the hymn
[249.3s] 590. Trust and
[253.0s] obey. When we walk with the Lord in the
[258.4s] light of his word, what a glory he sheds
[264.2s] on our way while we do his good will. He
[269.9s] abides with us still and with all who
[274.2s] will trust and
[276.9s] oy trust and oy for there's no other way
[283.8s] to be happy in
[286.5s] Jesus but to trust and oy.
[292.3s] Not a shadow can rise. Not a cloud in
[297.1s] the skies, but his smile quickly drives
[301.4s] it away. Not a doubt, nor a fear, nor a
[307.1s] sign, nor a tear can abide what we trust
[312.3s] and oy.

[320.9s] be happy in Jesus but to trust and
[326.4s] oy not a burden we bear not a sorrow we
[332.6s] share but a toil he doth richly
[337.2s] repay. Not a grave nor a loss. Not a
[341.8s] frown or a cross, but is blessed if we
[346.6s] trust and
[348.5s] oy, trust and oy. For there's no other
[354.1s] way to be happy in Jesus, but to trust
[359.4s] and
[361.6s] oy. But we never can prove the delights
[366.6s] of his love until all on the altar we

[376.9s] he bestows are for them who will trust

[420.8s] way to be happy in Jesus but to trust
[425.9s] and oy.
[428.8s] Welcome to this uh lesson seven restored
[433.2s] at church. It's an amazing amazing
[435.8s] amazing lesson that we have today. But
[438.4s] before we go into the lesson, I'll
[440.3s] welcome Odongo to guide us with a word
[443.4s] of prayer. Let's bow our heads for a
[445.8s] word of prayer. Dear Jesus, we thank you
[448.1s] for this day. We thank you for the gift
[449.4s] of life. Thank you for bringing us here
[451.0s] today even as we are about to dive into
[453.7s] your word. May you please bless us,
[455.6s] guide us and protect us. Help us to
[457.4s] remember everything that are to be
[459.0s] taught in Jesus name we pray. Amen.
[462.4s] Amen.
[463.9s] Before we start, uh what comes into your
[467.3s] minds when we hear about uh restored at
[470.2s] church? Uh what comes into my mind is
[473.0s] that um you are once um broken. Um you
[477.8s] aren't in one piece, but going to church
[482.4s] um made you whole again. Amen. Amen. But
[487.3s] Dongo,
[488.8s] uh in my view, it's more or less the
[491.4s] same thing. It's when uh you are lost in
[495.0s] a way, then you go to church and Jesus
[498.7s] brings you back to him. Amen.
[502.4s] What I think, what comes to my mind when
[505.7s] you say restored at church, it means
[508.4s] like when I go to church, when I'm a
[511.1s] sinner, I come out when I am I am
[514.7s] forgiven and I'm cleansed. Amen. Howie
[519.2s] uh what comes to my mind is that you
[522.9s] might be like deep into sin like you've
[526.1s] done terrible things but when you come
[528.1s] back to church you leave while you're
[530.3s] saved. Amen. Amen. It's so amazing the
[533.7s] answers that you have given they um they
[535.8s] are all correct and uh going into the
[538.4s] into the lesson it takes us back into
[540.6s] the uh 7th day Adventist beliefs um
[544.6s] number eight uh which talks about uh the
[547.1s] great controversy uh it's one of the
[549.8s] things that happened uh in heaven um
[554.6s] Jesus like someone that you have shown
[557.3s] the way and then turns to go against
[559.9s] your will Um going into the lesson we
[563.5s] have uh restored in church. In this
[565.9s] story, we're going to look at um the the
[568.2s] the work that our Jesus um did um the
[572.5s] center of his ministry and even me ask
[576.2s] like we all know u this city it's one of
[579.9s] the greatest cities uh ke like what
[582.9s] comes into your mind what do you know
[584.6s] about it
[587.3s] uh what I know about capam is that it
[590.3s] was Jesus's almost
[593.2s] primary place to start his ministry so
[597.4s] he could reach diverse people and uh
[599.7s] spread the word of God. Amen. Blessing.
[603.8s] Um uh Capen is where Jesus um went into
[611.0s] um a state of teaching. It was different
[614.7s] from the rest. And so um in this place
[618.7s] he could um he knew he could um make
[623.3s] people come to him by what he was
[625.6s] supposed to do then. Amen. And what I
[630.2s] know about Capenam is where Jesus cast
[633.3s] out an unclean spirit.
[637.4s] It's where Jesus had like one of his
[641.0s] most powerful teachings. Amen. One of
[644.2s] the things uh that we know about this
[646.9s] city of Kipanom, it was it was like at
[649.8s] the center of um the center of like um
[654.2s] the ministry of Jesus Christ. Apart from
[656.5s] that, it was like a highway of the uh
[659.4s] from Damascus uh to Jerusalem and Egypt.
[663.0s] So it was a big city whereby like all
[665.6s] people used to pass so that can be able
[668.9s] to meet at the center of it like to to
[671.4s] share the word of God. So this city of
[674.5s] uh Kipanam was at the center of
[677.8s] u um the savior's ministry being uh at
[681.9s] the highway from Damascus to Jerusalem
[684.4s] and Egypt and to the Mediterranean Sea.
[687.1s] It was a great a great a great um place
[691.4s] for the ministry of God um to take place
[694.9s] and also it's a place whereby used to
[697.0s] meet all kinds of people the rich the
[699.8s] poor when they were like moving from one
[703.1s] place to a to another at this point I'll
[706.2s] welcome Har to take us uh through the
[709.2s] what do you think uh section
[712.6s] what do you think look up the following
[715.5s] passages exodus
[717.4s] 22:18
[719.0s] and it says, "You shall not permit a
[721.6s] sorcerer to live." Uh, can someone look
[724.9s] up Leviticus 19 26? You shall not eat
[729.0s] anything with the blood, nor shall you
[731.3s] practice divination or soothsaying? And
[734.3s] can someone read Leviticus 20:6? And the
[737.6s] person who turns to mediums and familiar
[740.9s] spirits to prostitute himself with them,
[743.5s] I will set my face against that person
[745.8s] and cut him off from his people.
[748.7s] Deuteronomy 18 verse 9-14. And it says,
[753.0s] when you come into the land which the
[755.0s] Lord your God is giving you, you shall
[758.5s] not learn to follow the abomination of
[760.9s] those nations. There shall not be found
[764.1s] among you anyone who makes his son or
[767.5s] his daughter pass through the fire. One
[770.1s] who practices witchcraft or a
[773.6s] soothsayer or one who is or one who
[778.1s] interprets or a
[780.1s] sorcerer or one who conjurs spells or a
[784.5s] medium or
[786.5s] spirits or one who calls upon the dead.
[790.9s] For all who do this are an abomination
[793.7s] to the
[794.8s] Lord. Because of these abominations, the
[798.2s] Lord your God drives them out before
[801.2s] you. You shall be blameless before the
[803.8s] Lord your God. For these nations which
[807.2s] you will disposess, listen to the
[811.2s] soothsayers and divers. But as for you,
[814.4s] the Lord your God has not appointed such
[818.4s] for you.
[820.7s] Isaiah 8 verse 19. And when they say to
[824.3s] you, "Seek those who are mediums and
[826.4s] wizards, who whisper and m, should not a
[830.2s] people seek their God? Should they seek
[832.8s] the dead on behalf of the
[836.0s] living?" All of these all of these texts
[838.8s] speak against spiritualism in some form.
[841.6s] Why do you think that the warning
[843.0s] prohibiting involvement in these things
[845.3s] was given over and over? Uh the reason
[847.4s] why it's repeated is because uh in the
[850.5s] one of the commandments it says thou
[853.0s] shalt not worship any other god but me.
[855.4s] So anything that's outside of that is
[858.6s] considered an abomination to the lord.
[860.7s] Um it is also written that um this uh
[865.0s] this
[865.9s] spiritualism will come and
[870.1s] um it will divert the focus of the
[872.4s] people from God to worldly stuff. um
[877.0s] stuff that won't help them and
[880.6s] um in the end it will end up destroying
[882.7s] them. Amen.
[885.6s] I think it was repeated so many times
[888.7s] because maybe they were practicing
[891.5s] spiritualism and and they did not listen
[894.5s] to the warnings. Amen. Amen.
[898.2s] Basically all these things like um what
[901.3s] is uh is written in the Bible everything
[903.5s] was written to us uh to be followers of
[906.6s] Christ and when you look at um his
[909.4s] teachings he used to teach people used
[911.4s] to draw people nearer to to the kingdom
[913.8s] of God and uh and taking these things um
[919.0s] things like um the things that he say
[920.7s] like you should not take you are like to
[923.7s] believe that's why when you look at his
[926.0s] ministry Um in the desire of ages of
[930.0s] chapter 26 it talks about him like the
[932.7s] powerful message he used to give unto
[934.7s] people and people used to listen to him
[937.5s] because of these things that he used to
[939.0s] tell them. He did not like do something
[941.4s] to pretend in the eyes of people but he
[944.0s] used to hit them with the truth. That's
[946.6s] why all these all these people they used
[949.8s] to to follow him. They loved him so much
[952.6s] to a point whereby like they used like
[954.8s] to ask like where is he? where you see
[957.0s] because of the things that he used to
[959.2s] give. So all these things that they have
[961.0s] been given unto us we have like to
[964.8s] follow them what the word says they were
[967.8s] not written like to scare us but to draw
[970.6s] us closer and closer to God. Now I
[974.2s] welcome a blessing to take us uh through
[976.2s] the Monday part. Um can I get someone to
[979.0s] read John 14 11-13?
[983.1s] John 14 11-13 and it says, "Believe me
[987.8s] that I am in the Father and the Father
[989.5s] in me, or else believe me for the sake
[991.9s] of the works themselves. Most assuredly
[994.9s] I say to you, he who believes in me, the
[997.9s] works that I do, he will do also, and
[1000.4s] greater works than these he will do
[1002.5s] because I go to my father. and whatever
[1005.2s] you ask in my name that I will do that
[1007.9s] the father may be glorified in the son.
[1012.6s] Um do we have access to the same power
[1015.1s] that Jesus manifested um to the with the
[1018.9s] demon? If so, why are so many prayers um
[1023.9s] seemingly not answered? Uh there's this
[1026.8s] verse that says if you ask in my name
[1030.2s] and it's according to the father's will
[1032.7s] he will answer it. So there are these
[1036.3s] prayers that god says yes no and wait
[1039.8s] but actually it's yes and no. Yes is
[1043.2s] wait a bit. So uh if you ask in the
[1047.8s] proper the proper way and it's according
[1050.3s] to God's will he will answer it.
[1053.3s] Is there anything we can do to lay claim
[1055.7s] that to that supernatural power? We can
[1059.3s] pray to God to ask for that power. It's
[1062.0s] it's it's also if I may add to what
[1064.3s] Odonga said, it's something like we can
[1067.6s] get it from God. It's also like it's a a
[1070.7s] gift given uh from God. It's not
[1073.5s] something like any person can just
[1075.3s] access my belief, but it's something
[1077.6s] that it's a godly given thing. If you
[1080.3s] believe in
[1083.1s] him, you will get it. But the only way
[1086.8s] you can get it is by believing in his
[1089.5s] teachings and following his word. You
[1092.1s] can be able to get it. Uh at this point,
[1095.0s] we'll move on to the Tuesday part that
[1097.3s] will be taken by.
[1100.7s] Could someone read John 8:31 and 32? And
[1105.1s] it says, "Then Jesus said to those Jews
[1107.9s] who believed in him. If you abide in my
[1110.7s] word, you you are my disciples indeed,
[1114.6s] and you shall know the truth, and the
[1116.6s] truth shall make you free." Amen. Read
[1120.1s] this week's flashlight. Note how Ellen
[1122.7s] White points out that it was in the
[1124.4s] Savior's presence that the darkness was
[1126.8s] penetrated with light. The flashlight
[1129.7s] summarized, "The mind of this wretched
[1132.2s] sufferer has been darkened by Satan. But
[1134.5s] in the savior's presence, a ray of light
[1137.0s] has pierce the gloom." How can we
[1139.8s] practice being in God's presence? We can
[1142.1s] practice being in God's presence
[1144.4s] by talking to him, like praying every
[1147.0s] day, reading the Bible, and growing
[1149.4s] closer to him. That way, you'll be in
[1150.8s] his presence.
[1152.7s] How will that help us resist temptation?
[1157.1s] Um if you submit to God and um he's
[1161.7s] you're closer to him um and you resist
[1165.4s] the devil uh he will flee from you. So
[1168.5s] you'll have lesser
[1170.9s] um lesser cases of temptation.
[1175.3s] Amen.
[1176.7s] Also to add to that uh in the book John
[1180.1s] 8:31-32 it's self-explanatory saying if
[1183.4s] you abide in my word you are my
[1185.2s] disciples indeed. So all we need to do
[1187.3s] is study the Bible and uh follow God's
[1190.5s] word. So how does someone live in the
[1193.5s] presence of Jesus?
[1195.7s] Uh if I can add on what uh you guys have
[1198.1s] said uh the only the only way like we
[1200.4s] can stay in the presence of the lord uh
[1203.6s] uh it's through by uh reading the word
[1207.1s] that's number one and then keeping his
[1209.8s] commandments you know these commandments
[1212.1s] they were not given unto us to just uh
[1214.8s] look at them but they were given unto us
[1217.0s] so that we can obey them we observe them
[1220.2s] if we observe them then it will be
[1222.2s] easier for us to to have even power to
[1227.2s] rule over things um that seems to be u
[1231.5s] somehow hard for us
[1235.3s] cuz through
[1238.0s] uh God's presence we can be able to move
[1241.7s] mountains. Yeah. Because his disciples
[1245.7s] did. We are his disciples at this
[1248.2s] present times. So whatever they did, we
[1251.0s] have the power to do it. And the only
[1253.2s] way we can be able to do it is by going
[1255.4s] unto the into our knees and also
[1258.0s] following uh his
[1260.3s] teachings. Yeah. Amen. U blessings uh
[1264.9s] you can take us through the Wednesday
[1266.7s] part. Um so Wednesday is practically the
[1271.7s] punchlines. So I'll ask someone to read
[1275.4s] Leviticus 19:31.
[1278.1s] Leviticus 19:31. And it says, "Give no
[1282.0s] regard to mediums and familiar spirits.
[1284.6s] Do not seek after them to be defiled by
[1287.5s] them. I am the Lord your God."
[1290.5s] Um what main point um do you get from
[1294.2s] that verse?
[1296.8s] That we should only ask God for help and
[1299.4s] not other spirits and witches. Yes. I
[1305.3s] will summarize Ephesians chapter 6 verse
[1308.5s] 13 to 18. Um it's practically talks
[1312.4s] about putting on the full armor of God
[1315.6s] um in to enable us to withstand any evil
[1318.7s] that comes our way. So um what I took
[1322.7s] from that is um that when you have the
[1326.1s] full armor of God, when God is around
[1328.9s] you um you'll be able to stand your
[1331.4s] ground against any evil that will come
[1333.7s] your way.
[1335.0s] So, can someone recite for me James 4:7?
[1339.6s] And it says, "Submit to God, resist the
[1342.4s] devil, and he will flee from you." Amen.
[1345.4s] Can I get someone to read First Peter
[1348.8s] 5:8 and 9 and it says, "Be sober, be
[1353.4s] vigilant, because your adversary, the
[1355.5s] devil, walks around like a roaring lion,
[1358.0s] seeking whom he may devour. Resist him
[1361.1s] steadfast in the faith knowing that the
[1363.4s] same sufferings are experienced by your
[1365.8s] brotherhood in the world. Amen. So we'll
[1369.3s] take the main points that we got from
[1371.4s] these punchlines and make our own verse.
[1375.5s] So what I came up with was do not turn
[1378.7s] to mediums or speak seek spirits. Um for
[1382.8s] I am the Lord your God. Therefore, put
[1385.4s] on the full armor of God so that when
[1387.5s] the day of evil comes, you may be able
[1389.9s] to withstand your you may be able to
[1392.6s] stand your ground. So then submit
[1395.8s] yourself to God. Resist the devil and he
[1398.6s] will flee from you. And be alert and of
[1401.4s] sober mind, for the devil pros around
[1405.5s] like a roaring lion getting ready to
[1409.9s] devour. Getting ready to devour. Amen.
[1413.0s] Did anyone come up with um any main
[1416.9s] points to make their own verse?
[1420.6s] If I can add something uh looking at uh
[1423.4s] God's ministry in
[1425.3s] uh um one of the things that he did um
[1428.6s] when the the woman the person the
[1431.4s] spirits came it's like he rebuked the
[1433.8s] spirits through um the power the holy
[1437.2s] spirit that work in him the the the
[1440.0s] spirits like they they flew away the
[1442.7s] people were asking like who is this man
[1445.3s] even like the spirits like the evil
[1447.3s] spirits obey him And at this point uh if
[1451.5s] I may say like people never knew like
[1453.5s] who he was. That's why they were asking
[1456.4s] like who is this man? Even the spirit
[1459.0s] like obey
[1460.2s] him. Um we can do all these things if we
[1464.1s] only believe like we have the power and
[1466.6s] everything to do all these
[1468.2s] things in our various uh workplaces
[1471.5s] school especially for us for those
[1473.8s] people in school. You can make your you
[1476.2s] can be your own man. You can be your own
[1478.9s] like you can make your own empire by
[1481.8s] what you have what you have read that
[1484.5s] God can do this. Yeah. And then draw
[1487.3s] people. You can draw your classmates
[1489.3s] into the presence of the Lord. The way
[1491.4s] you carry yourself. Yeah. You can just
[1494.2s] be a minister. Do it without fear. Like
[1497.8s] the way you say like you came up with
[1499.4s] your own
[1501.4s] words. You can make these words and say
[1504.3s] like I'm going to impact the lives of
[1506.2s] people.
[1507.5s] in school because God did it. Who am I
[1511.1s] to do it and he gave me like I have the
[1513.6s] power and everything to do all these
[1515.1s] things. So I would like like to
[1516.9s] encourage like all of us like whatever
[1518.9s] god did we can be able to to do it as
[1521.9s] well. Uh I welcome to take us through
[1525.8s] the Thursday part.
[1528.3s] Okay. So for Thursday I want to ask us
[1530.9s] to read the keys. First of all I'll ask
[1533.3s] start with the questions. How does the
[1535.7s] devil try to gain access to my heart? He
[1538.0s] tempts us using the things we like. What
[1541.3s] is the best strategy to resist his
[1543.2s] advances? You can now read the key text
[1547.0s] which is Philippians 4:8. And it says,
[1550.0s] "Finally, brethren, whatever things are
[1553.2s] true, whatever things are noble,
[1555.8s] whatever things are just, whatever
[1558.7s] things are pure, whatever things are
[1561.2s] lovely, whatever things are of good
[1563.4s] report, if there's any virtue, and if
[1566.3s] there's anything
[1568.0s] praiseworthy, meditate on these things."
[1570.9s] Amen. So that verse is self-explanatory
[1573.8s] saying whatever things are true, just,
[1576.2s] pure, lovely, all those good things,
[1579.0s] think on them and uh just to emulate
[1582.1s] Jesus's character through compassion in
[1585.0s] action, demonstrating authority over
[1587.6s] evil by praying and uh the priority of
[1591.8s] God's kingdom and the significance of
[1594.8s] personal connection with God. So all we
[1597.4s] need to do is like this verse says focus
[1600.4s] on everything that is of good report,
[1602.7s] true, lovely, all of those things. Yeah.
[1606.4s] Amen.
[1608.1s] Are we Do you have something to add on
[1609.7s] that? Um when he asked what is the best
[1613.1s] strategy to resist his advances? I think
[1615.8s] it's like if you stand firm in your
[1617.5s] faith, it'll be very easy for you to
[1620.8s] resist the temptations.
[1623.0s] Amen. Amen. uh if we look at chapter uh
[1626.3s] during the ministry of uh Jesus Christ
[1629.2s] when he was uh tempted actually when he
[1632.7s] was taken to the wilderness like to be
[1634.6s] to be tempted most of his answers he
[1637.4s] used to refer like it's
[1639.9s] written it's written like man shall not
[1642.6s] live by bread alone you see those are
[1645.2s] the things like used to refer to so it's
[1647.5s] one of the things like if you look at
[1649.4s] even we as Christians we as the
[1652.6s] followers of Christ. Sometimes you can
[1654.6s] get something and then you feel like hey
[1657.6s] I prayed for this thing but then again
[1659.4s] like I have it and then one thing we
[1661.7s] forget it's like whatever like God
[1664.9s] whatever we pray to God the devil can
[1667.4s] just bring a counterfeit of what we
[1669.8s] prayed for. What will help us to know
[1673.0s] like this is a counterfeit of what I
[1675.0s] prayed for? It's that spirit of
[1677.5s] discernment like the way you pray and
[1679.7s] the Holy Spirit it's in you and this it
[1683.8s] um reminds us of the the the
[1687.6s] the importance of prayer in our lives.
[1690.6s] The importance of reading the word of
[1692.3s] God in the walk of salvation to to us we
[1695.9s] Christians because you cannot grow in
[1698.6s] faith if you don't read one the word
[1700.9s] number two if you don't read uh if you
[1703.9s] don't pray. These two they work like
[1707.0s] hand in hand. So if the devil comes it
[1711.0s] will not be easier for you to give in
[1712.8s] because you know like you're that kind
[1715.0s] of a person who spends most time in
[1717.2s] prayer. You read the word of God and you
[1719.4s] know the spirit will be able to guide
[1721.6s] you and like no this is not from God but
[1724.8s] this is from from the devil. Your heart
[1728.0s] everything will just direct you. Amen.
[1730.8s] Amen. So at this point I will welcome uh
[1733.9s] h how to take us through the Sabbath
[1736.6s] part.
[1738.2s] All humanity is now involved in great
[1740.4s] controversies between Christ and Satan
[1742.8s] regarding the character of God, his law
[1745.0s] and his sovereignity through the
[1746.4s] universe. Satan lead led Adam and Eve
[1749.8s] into sin. This human sin resulted in
[1753.0s] distortion of the image of God in
[1755.3s] humanity. This world became the arena of
[1758.2s] the universal conflict out of which the
[1761.2s] God of love will ultimately be
[1766.1s] vindicted to assist the his people in
[1769.5s] the controversy. Christ sends the Holy
[1772.0s] Spirit and the loyal angels to guide,
[1774.3s] protect and sustain them in the way of
[1777.7s] salvation. looking at the Sabbath part
[1780.2s] uh one of the things we we see here or
[1783.0s] one of the things like we capture it's
[1785.3s] the great controversy and that's
[1787.4s] fundamental belief number
[1790.1s] eight at this point this that struggle
[1793.9s] between Christianity and then evil
[1796.1s] things the devil is fighting to win
[1798.7s] souls unto his kingdom at the same time
[1801.4s] the most high God is fighting for our
[1803.7s] lives to we believers that's the the the
[1807.0s] controversy that we have at this point
[1808.7s] in this world. They start
[1811.8s] war. Now the question comes in like on
[1815.2s] who side are you going to feel safe? Are
[1818.6s] you going to feel safe in the hands of
[1820.4s] the Lord or you're going to feel safe in
[1822.9s] the hands of Satan? It's a question like
[1825.4s] we should ask ourselves because God is
[1828.9s] really fighting and God has given us
[1831.4s] that free will. You choose. You cannot
[1834.7s] just come and stand in front of you and
[1836.9s] say like I'm going to gain you if you
[1838.9s] don't follow me. No, they start free
[1842.1s] will unto us. The same same teachings
[1845.6s] used to give people. They're the same
[1847.8s] same teachings that we have here right
[1851.0s] now. It's a personal decision that we
[1853.4s] have to make. Uh at this point I'll just
[1856.2s] ask everyone to do a to have just a a
[1858.9s] parting shot of of of the lesson
[1861.3s] starting by.
[1864.6s] So from this lesson I've learned how to
[1867.6s] resist
[1868.6s] temptations and how to differentiate
[1871.2s] between the word of God and what the
[1873.6s] devil says. Amen.
[1876.8s] From this lesson I have learned that God
[1880.0s] is our refuge and strength.
[1883.4s] From this lesson, I've learned that we
[1885.4s] need to look to God and uh do not and
[1889.0s] not to conform to the ways of this world
[1891.4s] or be transformed by the power of the
[1893.4s] Holy Spirit.
[1895.8s] Um from this lesson, um I've learned
[1898.7s] that no matter how big your request
[1903.5s] sounds, as long as you believe and
[1905.9s] submit yourself to God, um he will be
[1909.0s] there for you. Amen.
[1911.9s] uh when we look at um the great
[1914.7s] controversy this one thing that um I
[1917.7s] loved I loved about um this lesson he
[1921.1s] talks about u this a place he talked
[1923.8s] about uh the Sabbath during the Sabbath
[1926.6s] many people crowds of people used to
[1928.9s] gather in the synagogues to to hear
[1932.7s] about uh the teachings of God to a point
[1935.4s] whereby other people used uh to go back
[1938.9s] because they could not find a days to
[1941.3s] stand and u it tells us one thing. It
[1944.4s] reminds us one
[1945.9s] thing the
[1947.7s] Sabbath it was sanctified by
[1951.3s] God. It is a holy name a holy a holy day
[1954.7s] for us to worship him. We can hear a lot
[1957.8s] of people talks talk about the Sabbath
[1960.9s] about Sunday talk about Friday wherever
[1963.0s] but we only know one day that was
[1965.4s] sanctified by God and it was blessed.
[1968.2s] That's why you hear during creation
[1971.3s] everything that was that he created used
[1974.1s] to say like it's good it's good it's
[1976.4s] good but the Sabbath it was blessed and
[1979.4s] sanctified people used to come to listen
[1983.5s] to him to listen to what he had to say
[1985.7s] because they believed in his teachings
[1988.2s] and one thing I asked myself is like do
[1991.8s] I have these qualities that I can draw
[1994.4s] people closer and closer to God and to
[1996.8s] the presence of the of the Lord. It's a
[1999.8s] question like I would like like every
[2001.8s] person to ask to ask him him or herself
[2005.8s] about uh this lesson. What do I have to
[2008.8s] do to win souls unto the presence of the
[2011.5s] Lord in school, in church, in the market
[2015.3s] places? What do I have to do to win
[2018.2s] souls unto the kingdom of the Lord? Your
[2021.0s] age doesn't matter but the message that
[2024.9s] you have to give that's what matters
[2027.4s] most. That's why you can see these
[2029.5s] people they use they were like who is
[2031.7s] this person? It's because they believed
[2033.8s] in his teachings. They love these
[2036.1s] teachings. We
[2038.4s] have those things in us. We have those
[2041.4s] qualities. We have the Holy Spirit. What
[2043.8s] we have to do is to believe in ourselves
[2045.8s] that we can win souls unto the kingdom
[2047.8s] of the Lord. At this point, I'll ask um
[2051.5s] Pendle to pray for us as we conclude uh
[2054.6s] the lesson.
[2056.6s] Let's pray. Our kind and loving father,
[2059.0s] thankful this day, thank for the gift of
[2061.0s] life. Lord, from the lessons you have
[2063.6s] learned from this lesson restored at
[2066.6s] church, help us to apply the lessons in
[2070.8s] Jesus name I pray. Amen. Amen.
