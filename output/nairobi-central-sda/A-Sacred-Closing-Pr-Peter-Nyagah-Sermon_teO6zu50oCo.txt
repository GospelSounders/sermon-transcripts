very special Sabbath when we are celebrating the last Holy Communion for this year and of course the second last Sabbath for this year when we look back we see how the Lord has lend us and today we come to celebrate to thank him for the many things he has done to us all the way my savior lanss me now today's message is entitled a sacred closing a sacred closing reflecting on the table of Grace the sacrament closing reflecting on the table of Grace I don't know what came to your mind when you saw this subject but I want to speak on it today and guided by the text of 1 Corinthians chapter 11 verse number 12 uh 23 down to 26 as it has been brought to us the Bible says for I have received of the Lord that which also I delivered unto you that the Lord Jesus the same night in which he was betrayed took bread and when he had given thanks he broke it and said take eat this is my body which is broken for you this do in remembrance of me after the same manner also he he took the cup when he had sted saying this cup is the New Testament in my blood this do ye as of as you drink it in remembrance of me that is King James version but I love the new King James version there are some parts of the new King James version that I think I will be laying emphasis on allow me to read in the new King James version for I received from the Lord that which I also deliver un to you that the Lord Jesus on the same night in which he was betrayed took bread and when he had given thanks he broke it and said take it this is my body which is broken for you do this in remembrance of me in the same manner he also took the cup after supper saying this cup is the New Covenant in my blood this do as often as you drink it in remembrance of me for as often as you eat this bread and drink this cup you proclaim the Lord's death till he comes friends as We Gather here today on this Holy Communion which is the final Holy Communion of this year we are reminded of the sacredness of this act what a way of ending the year when we are taken back into the thoughts of a sacred occasion when we can use it in closing the year it is a time to post reflect and realign our hearts with God's purposes this is not just a ritual we see here today it is a spiritual checkpoint a moment to look back with gratitude look inward with humility and look forward with Hope come with me friends as I speak on these three pillars of this message look back with gratitude look inward with humility and look forward with hope you see Jesus says this is my body that is broken for you this is my blood that is poured for you do this in remembrance of me as you gather together look back on the calvary and see the sacrifice look back on the calvary and see the blood flow look back on the calvary and see as a river in pain look back on the calvary and see where your Hope come from As We Gather here today friends this is a time for us to do a check in our lives and to see whether we can appreciate the sacrifice and what that sacrifice are doing in our lives and so I begin by saying look back with gratitude what is gratitude gratitude is the intentional Act of recognizing and appreciating the blessings the grace and the mercy of God in your life that is gratitude you look back and check in your life and see the evidence of God's blessings in your life the evidence of God's grace in your life and the evidence of God's mercy in your life and you can say God I P to say thank you for you have taken me through this year and I want to just take your thought briefly how this here began and how it has been like to most of us here and I want to imagine that there is here the life here as been like a vast and vagade Wilderness where we all began in this year the terrain was an even filled with Jagged rocks Steep clipes and deep valleys the year began with a sunrise of hope we all gathered here we and testimonies to give we and hope we made resolution we and such great conviction that they shall be well well but as the days unfolded and months unfolded the path became more challenging to most of us and I want to see this Wilderness of this year in one corner of this Wilderness a family struggles you know to cross a baren desert their faces were from Financial hand ships builds pile up like The Towering Dunes unfolding in every single moment of their life and every step forward FS like Sinking Deep into the sand nearby in this Wilderness a single parent is climbing a steep Rocky Mountain the weight of responsibilities on her raising children alone managing work alone and fighting loness in this life this is how some family have been through this year it feels like a he a backpack a pressure that weighs them down down down to the ground but showing this Wilderness forther long a young person walks through a dense shy Forest this is a forest of doubt and ananti where dreams seemed to disappear like the fent echo they sech for purpose but the Trees of anxiety overwhelmed them the fear blocked the way the Horizon cannot shine this is what it has been like to somebody today as I speak to you yet still in the wildness of this life there's one year in another corner of this wildness someone stands in a storm B by Winds of grief and loss the rain of Jesus has socked their soul and the Thunder of unanswered questions echoes in the heart each lightning flashing illuminate the absence of of loved one and making the pain feel more fresh every single day not far away a group of individuals tched through the pain and the M swamp of their life their feet is stuck in the MERS of sickness or chronic pain every step is a struggle and they long for a day where the pain shall cease but every single day through hospitals and in prayer their pain lingers more that is what has been to some of us yet many more have been the valley of broken relationships The Echoes of harsh words and misunderstandings in the family the vibrating the canons of the walls and the brid to reconciliation seem to break and break and shatter every single attempt and now we pause and say we look back with gratitude what in my life that is today I can p and say I'm thank you God for my experience has been pain my experience has been lost what is there in my life in this year for me to thank the Lord for I don't know who I'm talking to today but I want to imagine this is all the experience has been like to most of us today but all me to speak to us friends and let you know yes even in the situation we find ourself in we can look back with gratitude can somebody say Amen we can still look back with gratitude because gratitude isn't about ignoring difficulties or pretending life is perfect it is about choosing to see God's goodness even in the midst of our challenges you know gratitude and not just a mere thank you it is a pure of the heart that say even in my pain the Lord is good even I walk through the valley of the Shad of death the Lord is with me in my pain he is very there with me I can choose to thank the Lord today even though I've walked through the pain of life because I hear Paul saying in first 5:18 in everything give thanks for this is the will of God in Christ Jesus for you God God expect you to praise him while you're on the mountain and while you're in the valley God expect you to praise him while you in church and while you in the hospital God expect you to praise him because praising him is not based on what he has given you is based on what he is doing for you for eternity this morning I'm just talking about a sa closing you see friends the Bible tell me that there is something special about the struggles that we go through gratitude in her times is not deny of reality it is faith in action it declar that God is too good even when circumstances are not did I hear the man of God say the book of Lamentations 3:22 through 23 through the Lord's mercies we are not consumed because his compassionate fail not they are new every morning great is your faithfulness can I have a goodness out here Great Is Thy Faithfulness God has been faithful through our pain through our hardship through our mountains through our valleys we have a reason today to pre and to thank the Lord for the time he has given us through this year from January to this day of this year God has provided for us friends think of the many ways God has met your needs this here materially emotionally spiritually just as provided manner for children in the wilderness God has met you with his manner in your Wilderness if you have not seen him providing it's because you do not know him God has always been there to provide for you God has been there in your life to protect you reflect and imagine of the many dangers seen and unseen from which God has delivered you from throughout this year men have died men have perished but you are still alive today because God protected you through all he says in the Book of Psalms chapter 31 vers number 11 I shall command my angel to watch over you God has been intentional in leading you throughout this year yes we can pause today and say thank you God for through it all we have seen your presence you see friends there is power in gratitude because gratitude has a way of Shifting our Focus from our problems to the problem solve somebody with me when you shift your focus when you learn how to praise the Lord in your life for what he is doing you see focusing on your problems and You Begin focusing on the Promises of God this morning I can tell you for sure there are enough things the Lord has done for you and for us and we can pause and say Jesus we thank you for the sacrifice gr to direct our attention to what God has done changing our perspective instead of focusing on problem we see the blessings David says in Psalm 103 verse number two bless the Lord oh my soul and forget not all his benefit a sa closing is a moment for you to reflect on the grace of God that has worked with you throughout this year and the Holy Communion friends is a message of Hope is a message of Grace when we focus on God's faithfulness we are reminded that no matter what lies ahead the same God who has walked us through this year will continue with us even in the next coming year we are providing for this morning through the emblems here to know that the one who was able to give his life as a Ramson for our sins yes so committed to taking us to Eternity this is a message of Grace as we close here on this table of Grace let our gratitude deepen our faith and renew our trust in God every trial that we have experienced this year has taught us something about God's character and his ability to sustain us through we can say with job though he slay me yet will I hope in him let me speak to somebody this morning and let you know friends the challenges we faced this year have not been in vain the challenge of fa this year has not been in vain sometimes friends let me tell you this that the things that hurt you most teach you most there is a purpose in every pain there is a pick in every Valley the things to go through have a lesson in your life because there is a lesson in every loss and in every trial there's a treasure you need to look at your life in the length of grace of God and you will be overwhelmed at how God has been in your life every challenge is a chapter in your story through the valley flows Victory yes we can post today and look back with gratitude is somebody with me this morning yes you see the Bible says though the Fig May the Fig Tree may not blossom no fruit be on on the vines though the labor of the olive May Fail and the fuse you no food though the flock may be cut off from the fold and there be no her in the stares yet I will rejoice in the Lord I will joy in God of my salvation we have every reason to look back today with gratitude and thank the Lord this table is not just a place of memory it is a place of restoration not a mere ceremony but an encounter with Grace the struggles of this year are real and heavy but here as you sit today and looking at his emblems and Shing on the stable of Grace Grace or way grief peace silences fear and hope ignites a faith as we partake today the holy emem here we remember that Jesus walked this same Wilderness that we walking and says be of good cheer in the world shall have tribulations I have overcome the world for you we can pause look back with gratitude and say thank you God for this here number two as we close the year with gratitude as we look back with gratitude we need to look inward with humility look inward humility you see in verse number 28 Paul says but let a man examine himself and so let him eat of the bread and drink of the cup let every man examine himself so the Holy Communion is not about remembering what the Lord has done for us it's also about examining ourselves is a thing that is working at the present moment looking inward with humility you see friends communion calls for you and me to pause and take an honest look at our hearts before approaching this long table humility that Jesus displayed on the cross dying for us is what the Bible anticipate you today as you sit and share with these emblems that the mind which was in Jesus may also be in you that you may look deep in your life and see whether there are struggles that you may need to surrender them to Jesus today is a moment of humility because humility is not weakness it is a strength under control it reflect the character of Jesus and opens doors to deeper intimacy with God we are inviting today as we close this year we close this year looking inward in our lives and seeing how does it look like are we walking with the Lord this is a time for self-reflection and repentance God has worked with you throughout the year many things you have done but have you lived your faith in the way God has pleased there is a moment for you to introspect to look into your life and to see are there certain things of done in your life this year that are not good before the Lord you may need to surrender them today on this step of Grace and tell the Lord I've been struggling throughout the year but God I'm looking in one myself today I can see portions of dirty portions of weaknesses Jesus I want to surrender them to you I want to let you know today before us here this table is inviting all Sinners you can bring a struggle you can bring a challenge because on this today Jesus is still cleaning people through his blood you can come to him this is a time when we invited to align with the Holiness of God true humility friends begins when we dare to look Inward and see ourselves as gone sees us broken but yet beloved of God Humanity the lens that helps us see our flows see them clearly I also see God's mercy even more vividly Grace isn't a back plan or backup plan Grace is the master plan that leads you to Eternity this is what God is speaking to you as you see the table today here that yes I don't know it has not been easy for you I I don't know I know you have walked a that path I know you're guilty of your own sin but my grace is sufficient come to me for the cleansing today as we look Inward and examine ourself if you find areas where you're ashamed of their life if you find Corners in your life that you're ashamed of revealing them before people if you find some Corners in your life that makes you regret for what you have I want to remind you if Grace and a voice it will say I see your flows and I am not leaving I see your flows and I'm not leaving I know your challenge but I'm not about to leave you you know Paul says in the Book of Romans chapter 5 vers number 20 but where sin abounded Grace aboundant much more Grace today is shouting if a voice to say I see your flow but I am not leaving I see your weaknesses but I'm not leaving I see your doubts but I'm not leing I see your fears but I'm not leaving I see your failures but I'm not leaving I see your shame but I'm not leaving I see your struggles I see your Brokenness I see your insecurity but I am not leaving I see your regret I'm not leing I see your Rebellion I am not leing I see your mess I see your emptiness but I I'm not living I'm here to change your mess into a beautiful message to attract people for eternity yes friends as we close this year the Holy Communion reminds us not only to look back with the Gratitude but also to look inward with humility attracting the grace of God God knows every deal of your life every detail of your story every flow every mistake and and still he chooses to love you so don't run away from me this's the moment for you from January to today December 21st I know are many sins you have committed but do not run away from me because Grace does not repel Grace attracts come to me you know Psalm 32 vers number 1 through2 blessed is he who is He Who trans oppression Is Forgiven who sin is covered blessing is the man to whom the Lord does not impute iniquity and in whose Spirit there is no deceit can somebody say Amen this day before we close the year the Lord is willing to forgive your sin the Lord is willing to cleanse you from your dirting lord is willing to give you a new beginning the Lord is only if you will look Inward and see and expose your weaknesses before him says come unto me you are heavly Laden and I shall give you rest come unto him this is a moment of introspecting or self examination test yourself to see as whether you are in the Fai number three as we look at the sacr closing reflecting on the table of Grace we look back with gratitude we look inward with humility but also I see Paul communicating something very important here that the Holy Communion is not just about remembering do this in Rememberance of me the Holy Communion is not just about remembering we're just looking back with gratitude it is not about self-examination we are looking inward with humility it is also about anticipating anticipating looking forward with h so we look backward with gratitudes we look inward with humility but also we look forward with h you see it says in 1 Corinthians 11 vers number 26 for as often as you eat this bread and drink this cup you proclaim the Lord's death till he comes till he comes as often as you eat this bread and drink this cup you proclaim the Lord's death till he comes no no wait a minute the Holy Communion is actually a declaration of Hope hm is the Declaration of hope that I am coming I am coming in this Holy Communion passage there is a passage there is a promise of the second coming of Christ he says I may delay but as you partake every quarter remind yourself that I am coming have something not just to look back for gratitude not just to examine yourself but also anticipate that I'm coming to take you away from the trouble this world the holy communion is a moment of anticipation he says till I come John 14 ver number three Jesus said I will come again and receive you to myself that where I am there you may be also and it says do this in remembrance of me keep breaking the bread keep sheding the cup because as you do this you Proclaim my death too I come there is a Day Jesus has set to come for you and for me that is the day Jesus has promised to come to take us away from the world of pain and tears and sickness and groom a day is coming and we are reminded every single moment when we come before the emblems here we cannot forget we have a day Jesus is coming the fresh comes it's not just about waiting for the future it's also about how we live in the present and invite us to embrace the tension between the now and the not yet our life grounded in today's reality well feared by the hope of the Christ second return till he comes reminds us that this is not the end there is a glorious future till he comes is a reminder for you that your story is not over Jesus is still working for you that you who may become better and better till he comes is a reminder that the story is not yet over your chapter is not yet over God is still writing your story can somebody say Amen don't give up don't give up till he comes never give up keep waiting upon Him fixing your eyes on him who is the other and the finish of your faith till he comes keep your faith alive and burning till he comes reminds us that Jesus has a de with the Saint can somebody say Amen till he comes is a reminder that our suffering is temporary the trials of today cannot compare to the glory that will will be revealed when Jesus comes till he comes is a future that shapes the present the hope of Christ return motivate us to live differently today with eternal values shaping our priorities and choices that we may walk with the Lord till he comes is a hope in Christ's second return Jesus himself promised in John Chapter 14 verse 2 and 3 I go to prepare place for you is somebody with me this morning I go to prepare a place for you and if I go and prepare a place for you I will come again and receive you to myself so that where I am you also may be the Holy Communion is a moment to connect us to this hope of the second appearing of our Lord Jesus Christ the Holy Communion is a moment for us to remember that we are not just a people who are busy looking backwards but are people who are supposed to fix their eyes onto Jesus soon the sky will part and your master shall come but till he comes we are reminded that today we have a heaven to win that to shine that we may walk our salvation with fear and the trembling we may walk with the Lord to he comes it's an invitation to live expectantly instead of being weighed down by life burdens we look forward with joy in a world that is filled with pain and Sanity and Brokenness communion reminds of the victory Christ has already won for the church the bread that we're going to break today represent Christ broken body assuring you today that he understands our suffering he understands your pain he understands your tears he understand your situation the cup symbolizing his shed blood reminding you his graceous sufficient you can come for our cleansing today we are not only looking back with the Gratitude not just looking inone with humility but we are exitting to know we have a hope one day when the pain shall be no more one day when the tears shall be no more we will forever live with Jesus a place of no endless Joy yes friends today I just came to let you know we are closing the year but to me this this one is a sacred closing I feel the presence of God in the church I feel the presence of God in our lives and we have every reason to pae and say thank you God for what you have done but I consider that the suffering of this present time not worthy to compare with the glory which shall be revealed in us till he comes is a called to leave in Hope prepare with joy and proclaim the good news until Jesus time I don't know what is your situation today I don't know where you are in your Christian life I don't know how you chose to close your here but I wish today you may choose to close your here with the hope of looking forward till he comes because Sur he comes is a call to live with eternity in mind to live with eternity in view Jesus spoke of a future you know in Matthew chap 26: number 29 Jesus said but I said to you I will not drink of this fruit of the vine from now on until that day when I drink e a new with you in my father's Kingdom Jesus himself took us through the Holy Communion and gave us the Assurance of a better life that is coming he says I will do this again with you never again here on Earth but in my father's Kingdom till he comes invites you to live with eternity in your mind the Lord supper points the marriage supper of the lamb as we find in the Book of Revelation 19 ver number9 a celebration of Eternal fellowship with Christ and his people and this morning this ho communion reminds us that the ultimate home is not here nor inab Central Church not here in Kenya or anywhere in the world our outmate home is what we need to anticipate that is eternal life there's anticipation shapes how we live focusing on Eternal values rather than the temporal concerns do not be distracted listen to me child of God do not be distracted there are many things that have been fashioned to distract you from focusing and fixing your eyes on Jesus do not be distracted keep your eye on Jesus Remember the story of Peter he was safe as his eye was on Jesus but the moment that his eye was removed from Jesus and began looking at the storms and the winds in the sea he began thinking keep your eye on Jesus the author and the finisher of our faith till he comes is not just about waiting for the future it's about living today with that hope of the second coming of Christ and I dare tell you today keep your faith alive keep your bur burning keep yourself alert because the days are evil till he comes keep yourself before the Lord and he comes we will walk by faith not by sight till he comes love one another with a deep love of God no matter what they are doing to you keep loving them anyhow until he comes hold fast to the confession of your faith not waving not being toss here and there remain standfast in your faith till he comes stand firm and face every trial knowing that he is with you in every trial till he comes let your light shine in the darkness till he comes Ser K humility till he comes worship Him With A Heart full of Thanksgiving because he has done a lot for you today friends I pray for you as you look at the emblems here the body and the blood of Jesus we reminding these three things is a moment to look back with gratitude I want to challenge you is a time for you to look back and see how the Lord has been gracious in your life perhaps even think of even giving a Thanksgiving offering to God tell him God I thank you some of us been in hospital some of us we have lost loved ones some of us we have gone through a lot of ugly situations but yet we can afford a smile because God's grace gives us strength you have a reason to thank the Lord you can pause and say thank you God today you can look in and see you are not perfect you're are struggling I know you love God but you're not perfect do not despise yourself do not give up keep on pushing on keep on waiting upon the Lord keep on crying and pleading with the Lord keep on repenting and repenting God will never get tired of your tears as you repent keep on telling him how weak you are because he is strong for you and keep on looking forward with a hope because soon Jesus is coming and as we see here today we are reminded him saying I will not eat with you again here but I will eat with you in my father's Kingdom I don't know how many of us today anticipate a Holy Communion in heaven when Jesus will be the senior pastor serving us telling us the story of redemption showing us how he fought our battles showing us the films of all deployed angels to come to a rescue I don't know how many of you today are anticipating the moment you will be found there sitting around that table listening to Jesus looking at him face to face looking at his cous and saying Jesus you aure all this because of me and tell you yes because I knew of yourself you could not help it I had to die that my righteousness may become your righteousness today I don't know who I'm talking to but we can come before the Lord as you close this ear and say thank you Lord this to us is a sacred closing we are worshiping you and saying thank you God if you are here there's something you need to surrender to the Lord you have not been able to appreciate God for what he has done you have been taking life just likely because you're just waking and going about your business but today you want to pause and look back and say thank you God by the way God I see all these things has taken your hand you have a chance today to thank the Lord let God see your heart and thankfulness that is in your heart choose to offer a sacrifice an offering of thank you to the Lord but also pay attention to your life because you still have a journey to walk the Lord is

[129.1s] of 1 Corinthians chapter 11 verse number
[133.5s] 12 uh 23 down to
[135.8s] 26 as it has been brought to
[141.4s] us the Bible says for I have received of
[146.7s] the Lord that which also I delivered
[149.2s] unto you
[151.1s] that the Lord Jesus the same night in
[153.6s] which he was
[155.1s] betrayed took
[157.9s] bread and when he had given
[160.9s] thanks he broke it and said

[188.3s] my
[189.0s] blood this do ye as of as you drink it

[202.2s] the new King James
[204.2s] version there are some parts of the new
[206.4s] King James version that I think I will
[208.4s] be laying emphasis on allow me to read
[210.2s] in the new King James version for I
[212.7s] received from the Lord that which I also
[215.0s] deliver un to you that the Lord Jesus on
[218.8s] the same night in which he was betrayed
[222.1s] took bread and when he had given thanks

[244.1s] this do as often as you drink it in
[247.2s] remembrance of me for as often as you
[251.6s] eat this bread and drink this cup you
[255.5s] proclaim the Lord's death till he
[262.8s] comes friends as We Gather here today on
[266.1s] this Holy Communion which is the final
[269.0s] Holy Communion
[270.4s] of this year we are reminded of the
[274.7s] sacredness of this
[277.5s] act what a way of ending the year when
[281.6s] we are taken back into the thoughts of a
[284.1s] sacred occasion when we can use it in
[288.4s] closing the
[290.5s] year it is a time to post
[293.8s] reflect and realign our hearts with
[297.3s] God's purposes this is not just a ritual
[300.7s] we see here today it is a spiritual
[303.7s] checkpoint a moment to look back with
[307.4s] gratitude look inward with humility and
[310.9s] look forward with
[312.8s] Hope come with me friends as I speak on
[315.9s] these three pillars of this message look
[318.6s] back with gratitude look inward with
[321.3s] humility and look forward with
[325.1s] hope you see Jesus
[327.7s] says this is my
[330.4s] body that is broken for you this is my
[335.0s] blood that is poured for you do this in
[339.6s] remembrance of me as you gather together
[343.6s] look back on the calvary and see the
[346.9s] sacrifice look back on the calvary and
[349.9s] see the blood flow look back on the
[352.4s] calvary and see as a river in pain look
[356.0s] back on the calvary and see where your
[358.3s] Hope come from
[360.2s] As We Gather here today
[361.9s] friends this is a time for us to do a
[365.4s] check in our lives and to see whether we
[367.9s] can appreciate the sacrifice and what
[370.4s] that sacrifice are doing in our lives
[372.7s] and so I begin by saying look back with
[377.2s] gratitude what is gratitude gratitude is
[381.2s] the intentional Act of recognizing and
[385.6s] appreciating the blessings the grace and
[390.0s] the mercy of God in your life that is
[394.8s] gratitude you look back and check in
[397.6s] your life and see the evidence of God's
[400.7s] blessings in your life the evidence of
[402.8s] God's grace in your life and the
[404.6s] evidence of God's mercy in your life and
[407.5s] you can say God I P to say thank you for
[411.2s] you have taken me through this year and
[414.3s] I want to just take your thought
[417.1s] briefly how this here began
[420.4s] and how it has been like to most of us
[423.5s] here and I want to imagine that there is
[426.4s] here the life here as been like a vast
[429.2s] and vagade Wilderness where we all began
[433.2s] in this year the terrain was an even
[436.1s] filled with Jagged rocks Steep clipes
[439.3s] and deep valleys the year began with a
[443.1s] sunrise of hope we all gathered here we
[446.0s] and testimonies to give we and hope we
[448.7s] made resolution we and such great
[451.4s] conviction that they shall be
[455.0s] well
[457.6s] well but as the days
[460.7s] unfolded and months
[463.0s] unfolded the path became more
[466.7s] challenging to most of us and I want to
[469.7s] see this Wilderness of this year in one
[472.4s] corner of this Wilderness a family
[475.1s] struggles you know to cross a baren
[479.0s] desert
[480.0s] their faces were from Financial hand
[482.4s] ships builds pile up like The Towering
[485.7s] Dunes unfolding in every single moment
[489.2s] of their life and every step forward FS
[492.0s] like Sinking Deep into the sand nearby
[495.6s] in this
[496.8s] Wilderness a single parent is climbing a
[500.0s] steep Rocky Mountain the weight of
[503.0s] responsibilities on her raising children
[505.4s] alone managing work alone and fighting
[508.4s] loness in this life
[510.1s] this is how some family have been
[512.2s] through this year it feels like a he a
[516.4s] backpack a pressure that weighs them
[520.8s] down down down to the ground but showing
[524.8s] this Wilderness forther long a young
[527.5s] person walks through a dense shy Forest
[531.4s] this is a forest of doubt and ananti
[534.5s] where dreams seemed to disappear like
[537.4s] the fent echo they sech for
[541.2s] purpose but the Trees of anxiety
[543.7s] overwhelmed them the fear blocked the
[546.6s] way the Horizon cannot
[549.2s] shine this is what it has been like to
[552.5s] somebody today as I speak to you yet
[555.6s] still in the wildness of this life
[557.2s] there's one year in another corner of
[559.5s] this wildness someone stands in a storm
[563.0s] B by Winds of grief and loss the rain of
[567.0s] Jesus has socked their soul and the
[570.1s] Thunder of unanswered questions echoes
[572.8s] in the heart each lightning flashing
[576.0s] illuminate the absence of of loved one
[579.7s] and making the pain feel more fresh
[582.2s] every single day not far away a group of
[586.0s] individuals tched through the pain and
[588.7s] the M swamp of their life their feet is
[591.1s] stuck in the MERS of sickness or chronic
[594.0s] pain every step is a struggle and they
[597.6s] long for a day where the pain shall
[599.9s] cease but every single day through
[602.6s] hospitals and in prayer their pain
[604.8s] lingers
[607.1s] more that is what has been to some of
[610.2s] us yet many more have been the valley of
[614.4s] broken relationships The Echoes of harsh
[616.8s] words and misunderstandings in the
[618.8s] family the vibrating the canons of the
[621.4s] walls and the brid to reconciliation
[624.5s] seem to break and break and shatter
[627.3s] every single attempt and now we pause
[630.2s] and say we look back with gratitude what
[634.4s] in my life that is today I can p and say
[638.2s] I'm thank you God for my experience has
[640.8s] been pain my experience has been lost
[643.2s] what is there in my life in this year
[645.6s] for me to thank the Lord for I don't
[647.2s] know who I'm talking to today but I want
[649.8s] to imagine this is all the experience
[652.2s] has been like to most of us today but
[655.0s] all me to speak to us friends and let
[656.5s] you know yes even in the situation we
[659.6s] find ourself in we can look back with
[664.1s] gratitude can somebody say Amen we can
[666.8s] still look back with gratitude because
[669.6s] gratitude isn't about ignoring
[671.9s] difficulties or pretending life is
[674.1s] perfect it is about choosing to see
[677.3s] God's goodness even in the midst of our
[681.4s] challenges you know gratitude and not
[684.2s] just a mere thank you it is a pure of
[687.6s] the heart that say even in my pain the
[691.6s] Lord is good even I walk through the
[694.3s] valley of the Shad of death the Lord is
[696.8s] with me in my pain he is very there with
[699.8s] me I can choose to thank the Lord today
[702.8s] even though I've walked through the pain
[705.2s] of life because I hear Paul saying in
[707.9s] first 5:18 in
[711.2s] everything give thanks for this is the
[714.6s] will of God in Christ Jesus for you God
[719.3s] God expect you to praise him while
[721.5s] you're on the mountain and while you're
[723.1s] in the valley God expect you to praise
[725.2s] him while you in church and while you in
[727.3s] the hospital God expect you to praise
[729.5s] him because praising him is not based on
[732.7s] what he has given you is based on what
[735.2s] he is doing for you for
[737.6s] eternity this
[739.4s] morning I'm just talking about a sa
[744.9s] closing you see
[747.5s] friends the Bible tell
[751.1s] me
[754.2s] that there is something special about
[757.4s] the struggles that we go
[761.5s] through gratitude in her
[765.5s] times is not deny of
[768.6s] reality it is faith in action it declar
[772.9s] that God is too good even when
[775.4s] circumstances are not did I hear the man
[778.6s] of God say the book of Lamentations 3:22
[781.7s] through 23 through the Lord's mercies we
[784.9s] are not consumed because his
[788.1s] compassionate fail not they are new
[793.0s] every morning great is your faithfulness
[796.0s] can I have a goodness out here Great Is
[799.1s] Thy Faithfulness God has been faithful
[803.3s] through our pain through our hardship
[806.0s] through our mountains through our
[807.7s] valleys we have a reason today to pre
[811.0s] and to thank the Lord for the time he
[813.2s] has given us through this year from
[815.3s] January to this day of this
[818.8s] year God has provided for us friends
[822.2s] think of the many ways God has met your
[824.6s] needs this here materially emotionally
[828.4s] spiritually just as provided manner for
[831.7s] children in the wilderness God has met
[834.4s] you with his manner in your Wilderness
[837.2s] if you have not seen him providing it's
[839.2s] because you do not know him God has
[842.5s] always been there to provide for you God
[845.8s] has been there in your life to protect
[848.1s] you reflect and imagine of the many
[851.4s] dangers seen and unseen from which God
[854.9s] has delivered you from throughout this
[856.6s] year men have died men have perished but
[860.0s] you are still alive today because God
[864.2s] protected you through all he says in the
[866.7s] Book of Psalms chapter 31 vers number 11
[869.2s] I shall command my angel to watch over
[871.9s] you God has been intentional in leading
[875.4s] you throughout this year yes we can
[877.7s] pause today and say thank you
[880.4s] God for through it all we have seen your
[885.2s] presence you see friends there is power
[888.6s] in gratitude because gratitude has a way
[892.2s] of Shifting our Focus from our problems
[895.3s] to the problem solve somebody with me
[897.5s] when you shift your focus when you learn
[900.0s] how to praise the Lord in your life for
[902.7s] what he is doing you see focusing on
[905.1s] your problems and You Begin focusing on
[907.4s] the Promises of God this morning I can
[911.0s] tell you for sure there are enough
[913.6s] things the Lord has done for you and for
[916.6s] us and we can pause and say Jesus we
[920.6s] thank you for the sacrifice gr to direct
[923.6s] our attention to what God has done
[925.8s] changing our perspective instead of
[928.0s] focusing on problem we see the
[931.2s] blessings David says in Psalm 103 verse
[933.9s] number two bless the Lord oh my soul and
[938.2s] forget not all his
[941.9s] benefit a sa closing is a moment for you
[945.9s] to reflect on the grace of God that has
[948.6s] worked with you throughout this year and
[951.5s] the Holy Communion friends is a message
[953.8s] of Hope is a message of Grace when we
[957.5s] focus on God's faithfulness we are
[959.4s] reminded that no matter what lies ahead
[963.1s] the same God who has walked us through
[966.2s] this year will continue with us even in
[969.4s] the next coming year we are providing
[972.3s] for this morning through the emblems
[974.7s] here to know that the one who was able
[977.6s] to give his life as a Ramson for our
[979.8s] sins yes so committed to taking us to
[983.4s] Eternity this is a message of Grace as
[986.8s] we close here on this table of Grace let
[990.8s] our gratitude deepen our faith and renew
[993.6s] our trust in
[995.3s] God every
[997.5s] trial that we have experienced this year
[1000.8s] has taught us something about God's
[1003.2s] character and his ability to sustain us
[1007.2s] through we can say with job though he
[1010.1s] slay me yet will I hope in him let me
[1014.0s] speak to somebody this morning and let
[1015.1s] you know friends the challenges we faced
[1018.4s] this year
[1019.7s] have not been in vain the challenge of
[1023.7s] fa this year has not been in vain
[1027.0s] sometimes friends let me tell you this
[1029.1s] that the things that hurt you most teach
[1032.1s] you most there is a purpose in every
[1034.7s] pain there is a pick in every Valley the
[1038.1s] things to go through have a lesson in
[1040.7s] your life because there is a lesson in
[1043.0s] every loss and in every trial there's a
[1046.0s] treasure you need to look at your life
[1049.4s] in the length of grace of God and you
[1052.2s] will be overwhelmed at how God has been
[1055.4s] in your life every challenge is a
[1057.9s] chapter in your story through the valley
[1061.8s] flows Victory yes we can post today and
[1065.9s] look back with gratitude is somebody
[1068.4s] with me this morning yes you see the
[1070.8s] Bible
[1072.6s] says though the Fig May the Fig Tree may
[1075.4s] not
[1076.6s] blossom no fruit be on on the
[1079.8s] vines though the labor of the olive May
[1084.1s] Fail and the fuse you no food though the
[1088.4s] flock may be cut off from the fold and
[1092.3s] there be no her in the stares yet I will
[1096.3s] rejoice in the Lord I will joy in God of
[1100.9s] my
[1101.8s] salvation we have every reason to look
[1106.1s] back today with gratitude and thank the
[1108.9s] Lord this table is not just a place of
[1112.3s] memory it is a place of restoration not
[1115.7s] a mere ceremony but an encounter with
[1119.2s] Grace the struggles of this year are
[1122.0s] real and heavy but here as you sit today
[1125.8s] and looking at his emblems and Shing on
[1127.9s] the stable of Grace Grace or way grief
[1132.2s] peace silences fear and hope ignites a
[1135.5s] faith as we partake today the holy emem
[1138.9s] here we remember that Jesus walked this
[1142.3s] same Wilderness that we walking and says
[1145.0s] be of good cheer in the world shall have
[1147.6s] tribulations I have overcome the world
[1149.5s] for you we can pause look back with
[1152.4s] gratitude and say thank you God for this
[1154.9s] here number
[1156.7s] two as we close the year with
[1161.6s] gratitude as we look back with
[1164.7s] gratitude we need to look inward with
[1168.2s] humility
[1170.1s] look inward humility you see in verse
[1173.0s] number 28 Paul
[1175.3s] says but let a man examine
[1178.8s] himself and so let him eat of the bread
[1183.3s] and drink of the
[1185.2s] cup let every man examine
[1188.6s] himself so the Holy Communion is not
[1192.8s] about
[1194.2s] remembering what the Lord has done for
[1196.3s] us it's also about examining
[1200.5s] ourselves is a thing that is working at
[1204.0s] the present moment looking inward with
[1207.0s] humility you see
[1209.0s] friends communion calls
[1211.6s] for you and me to pause and take an
[1215.8s] honest look at our hearts before
[1220.4s] approaching this long table humility
[1223.8s] that Jesus displayed on the cross dying
[1226.1s] for us is what the Bible anticipate you
[1230.3s] today as you sit and share with these
[1233.2s] emblems that the mind which was in Jesus
[1236.0s] may also be in you that you may look
[1238.9s] deep in your life and see whether there
[1241.1s] are struggles that you may need to
[1242.8s] surrender them to Jesus today is a
[1245.4s] moment of humility because humility is
[1248.0s] not weakness it is a strength under
[1250.0s] control it reflect the character of
[1252.4s] Jesus and opens doors to deeper intimacy
[1256.4s] with God we are inviting today as we
[1259.4s] close this year we close this year
[1262.9s] looking inward in our lives and seeing
[1266.2s] how does it look like are we walking
[1268.8s] with the Lord this is a time for
[1271.8s] self-reflection and repentance God has
[1274.6s] worked with you throughout the year many
[1276.5s] things you have done but have you lived
[1279.1s] your faith in the way God has pleased
[1282.5s] there is a moment for you to introspect
[1285.0s] to look into your life and to see are
[1287.4s] there certain things of done in your
[1289.0s] life this year that are not good before
[1290.9s] the Lord you may need to surrender them
[1293.4s] today on this step of Grace and tell the
[1296.4s] Lord I've been struggling throughout the
[1298.3s] year but God I'm looking in one myself
[1300.8s] today I can see portions of dirty
[1303.6s] portions of weaknesses Jesus I want to
[1306.4s] surrender them to you I want to let you

[1580.1s] three as we look at the sacr
[1585.4s] closing reflecting on the table of Grace
[1592.4s] we look back with
[1597.2s] gratitude we look inward with
[1603.3s] humility but
[1606.2s] also I see Paul communicating something
[1608.9s] very important here that the Holy
[1611.7s] Communion is not just about
[1616.0s] remembering do this in Rememberance of
[1618.1s] me
[1618.9s] the Holy Communion is not just about
[1620.2s] remembering we're just looking back with
[1622.3s] gratitude it is not about
[1625.0s] self-examination we are looking inward
[1627.3s] with humility it is also about
[1630.5s] anticipating
[1632.1s] anticipating looking forward with h so
[1636.1s] we look backward with gratitudes we look
[1638.4s] inward with humility but also we look
[1640.7s] forward with h you see it says in 1
[1643.4s] Corinthians 11 vers number 26 for as
[1646.1s] often as you eat this bread and drink
[1649.1s] this cup you proclaim the Lord's death
[1653.2s] till he comes till he comes as often as
[1660.3s] you eat this bread and drink this cup
[1664.2s] you proclaim the Lord's death till he
[1668.7s] comes no no wait a minute the Holy
[1672.9s] Communion is actually a declaration of

[1695.8s] that I am coming have something not just
[1699.0s] to look back for gratitude not just to

[1705.8s] away from the trouble this world the
[1707.8s] holy communion is a moment of
[1710.7s] anticipation he says till I come John 14
[1715.7s] ver number three Jesus said I will come
[1718.2s] again and receive you to myself that
[1720.9s] where I am there you may be also and it
[1726.8s] says do this in remembrance of me keep
