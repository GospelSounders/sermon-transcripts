FULL TRANSCRIPT:
welcome once again to our book review of the book true Revival in case you don't know about it and you're watching it for the first time this is a book written by Ellen gght and you can find it on the link on the screen or you can pause the video and scan the QR code that we have put up so this is a book that you can get to actually follow with us and what we doing in this panel is waiting your appetite to read the book not reading for you the book otherwise you'd be spending hours here on set so even as you follow this book review with us we'd like you to confirm the points that we are sharing go and read the book for yourself and learn and be encouraged by the Nuggets that you get because the end goal is for you to be truly revived and not just a superficial experience I'd like my panelist on my left to introduce himself for the session today yeah good morning everyone good afternoon depending on where you're watching from my name is Steven muga welcome thank you Steve and on my right good morning good evening depending on where you're watching us from my name is Opa thank you and my name is nikio I'm the moderator for today and these are wonderful deacons who serving here at Nairobi Central SDA church so before we begin i' just like to say a quick prayer and I'd like uh brother to take it away so let's pray our kind and loving Father in Heaven thank you for guiding us and even as we cover chapter 8 titled it's still a fight I pray that you may teach us how to fight in the right way we ask this in Jesus name amen amen amen amen amen ah chapter 8 is still a fight uh the introduction of the the title is uh what sin has done the the the devastating outcome of sin into our lives and uh we have been told here that more clearly than we do we need to understand the issues at stake in the great conflict in which we are engaged we need to understand more fully the value of the truths of the word of God and the danger of allowing our minds to be diverted from them by The Great Deceiver and when we talk about it's still a fight uh it's still a fight from what I think after you have been saved there's no time for you to say now now I'm saved now I'm satisfied I know we have talked about satisfaction in our previous week you can't sit down and say now I'm saved there still a fight because in fact the devil you remember when Christ was accused of mingling with Sinners and he say that uh a person who who is whole a person who is healthy is not in need of a doctor other than the one who is who is sick the same thing applies to the devil those people who have rejected the prings of the Holy Spirit those are on the devil's side but those who have accepted the call of the Holy Spirit and confessed that Christ Jes is their lord and savior those are the targets of the Devil Himself now so here we seeing that you'll never have peace the way the world will want you to to give peace and that's why Jesus said that the peace I give you my peace I give you not as the world give you meaning that you'll go through Temptations you'll go through persecutions but you still have you'll still enjoy peace and uh from from from from the the the the book of uh 1 Corinthians 15 verse 31 he says I protest by your by your rejoicing which I have in Christ Jesus our lord I Die daily this is Paul talking now he's saying that he his will and his desires every day conflicted with Duty and the will of God remember Paul says that uh that which I'm supposed to do that I don't and that which that I'm not supposed to do that I do so this conflict this fight that we talking about we realize that is not even fight against the enemies or enemy real or perceived out there first that fight is in you now because the flesh the flesh the fight between the Flesh and the spirit is so so strong that it's you living in a constant conflict and uh how do we fight this uh fight there's a there's a verse that there's a title that talks about there's a science to it and then it says that there's a science of Christianity to be mastered a science as much deeper broader higher than any human science as the heavens are as the heavens are higher than the earth the mind is to be disciplined educated trained for we are to be to do service for God in ways that are not in harmony with inbo inclination because human nature the Fallen human nature we always inclined towards sins so it's a constant reminder every day we die daily so that we surrender to Christ now that when we die to self now Christ even as we you see us living is Christ who what who is living in in in in in us and um just to collect your views from this chapter uh there's a there's there are some very pertinent question that have been uh brought here it takes perseverance brother Nick what kind of perseverance are we talking about here when it talks in relation to the title that uh it's still a fight when I think about it the work of character building is not the work of a day it's not a month it's not a week it's actually something that you do for a life for a life which actually means that if you want to get to heaven then you have to persevere as you've read in 1 Corinthians 15:31 I died daily now when I think of death that's a painful thing imagine if you have to go through death if you're hearing your relative is every other day you'll be like w what is this I have to persevere so that's what it actually means to be a Christian you're in a lifelong struggle to the point that if you just let a day go then you may find that you lose your way to Jesus think I like the example where the parents of Jesus left him alone in the temple and they had to take 3 days to get him back now I believe that's the same case we stop persevering might be harder to get back to Jesus than when he came at first so it's something that we need to do daily and sin also has its chains on us yeah you'll find out soon this habit is not good you leave it then you go to another and that's the reason why we're coming to church every week people say the church is a hospital not because you're suffering from the same disease every day but because the disease is changing every day and you find a different diagnosis and is also pruning working so that you look more like the vine that we spoke about in the past chapter so I believe that's why we need to persever thank you the Bible says that uh it's better to go to the house of morning than to the house of feast because if when you go to the house of morning you realize it's it's it's so much aware you become aware that uh death is real and when you talk about death being real dying daily brother Steve do you know when you're going to die and now that's question tied to now the aspect of time how much time do we have for us to repent and to be right with Jesus Christ amen amen I think how would I pick it I pick it you know when you wake up in the morning you have 24 hours M okay that's that's that's the quarter that we have been given God would have given us 72 hours in a day or he would have given us 1 hour but there's a reason why he gave us 24 hours so that we are able to manage our time within that 24 hours it does not mean that we have all the time in our hand it also does not mean that we have little time now in terms of time brother Niko has just mentioned that you know we must persevere MH this perseverance calls us for a daily renewal of our relationship with Christ daily why do we renew our daily um life with Christ how why is it daily it's daily because we know not the hour MH yeah you could wake up in the morning and time is spent and that's why we are called upon to renew our faith in Christ every day to repent of our sins every single day and you know the time could be we could be here and and we don't see each other tomorrow Revelation 22:11 says that um you know let the unjust remain unjust let the righteous still remain righteous and let the holy still remain holy why because the probation could end any time I mean we know not the hour not even the angels know when the probation window will close but the prophet but at least the Bible has given us has revealed to us certain prophecies that we are within the period of Probation and time is n time is just about to end so if we do not know then we are safer if we renew our life to Christ every day we are safer knowing that we don't have time that 24 hours quarter that we've been given let us not be comfortable saying that we have time we don't have time so that that is what I would say with no time to lose yeah thank you very much brother Steve for that quite elaborate illustration let's talk about constant dependence of Christ we we know we know about Apostle Paul he was highly intelligent he was knowledge he was well schooled and I remember uh reading the books of Acts of apostle uh he was giving us a narration of how he encountered the Brethren and there's a places there are places where he went and he said that he found very intelligent people and he said he marched them where where where they gave him wisdom he gave them wisdom where they gave him knowledge he gave them knowledge one for a day he countered but he came to realize that there was not actually conversion it was just a discourse then again when he realized that the next station he went to he took his mission he said I care for nothing else but what Christ crucified so here we are being told that never depend on yourself don't be self-sufficient we have we have talked about Peter in our previous discussion not be self-sufficient always plugged in into the vine you are the branch and then the challenges of sing the plucking the branch and joining the the black attach and Detachment and attachment and Detachment thank you so I think this is a it's a it's a it's it's it's very enlightening that uh when we constantly depend on Christ the only time now we can be grounded yes so brother n yes please take us through truth and trivia because we know these are things that we encountered every day in our spiritual journey yes I'd say that one of the laws we should use in the Bible to determine what is truth and what is something that is trivia is by looking in Deuteronomy 29:29 MH the Bible says M the things that are revealed belong to us and to our children but the things that are not revealed Bel to God Amen there are many times where we might come up with theories about so many things and we want to find out what is truth what is this thing that is here you're looking for a startling Theory to come and present to people but the truth is you should go only to the things that are revealed for example if you ask me ask me who is God's father and who is his mother I tell you I don't know because it but if we start going to look in different books sometimes want to add books into the Canon of scripture and claim that this is the only book you can find that Source then we we'll get into a problem yes so even our acquaintance and our knowledge of facts and other things that we know in the Bible as important is not of any use if we are not truly revived in our heart because there are some things that even if you know you'll perish for example I just give one the Bible says in First Corinthians 13 that though I speak with the tongues of men of angels though I have the gift of Prophecy though I give everything to charity and I have not love I am not which means that's a truth that doesn't nourish the soul am it's prophecy without profit it doesn't help any so I think that's where truth and trivia matters we study what is truth to help us oh yeah thank you thank you very much I think Christ even before he left he had already equipped us he said is it's important that he lives now so that the Holy Spirit may come down to help us and remember also when he was sending out the disciples he explicitly explained to them the kind of challenges they going to face in clear black and white there's nothing that was masked that those the disciples will maybe go out to the mission field and then be like oh no I wasn't prepared he prepared them so Christ has prepared us that we are going to face persecution because only we have professed him as our Lord and and savior so let's keep the fight on but be guided by the word of God brother Nik please maybe I don't have much to say we said quite a bit in this panel please join us next week for chapter 9 which is safeguarding the new experience we are slowly trudging to the end of the book but we are still praying that you're reading with us not just listening to us yeah remember I'd like you to say the word of God says not the panelists here say Amen not I heard about it but I don't know where it is it's actually what is in the book so please get yourself a copy of this book run a link and even put the QR code for you to scan post the video and scan that QR code and get a copy of this thank you for joining us today and I'd like to invite my brother Steve to give us a closing prayer and next week we'll be covering safe guing the new experience please pray for us Steve thank you let us pray Our Father who are in heaven thank you so much for reminding us that the fight is still on that our walk with Christ is not something that we should consider um that we have time Lord thank you for reminding us that we do not have time that we live our life for today that Lord we confess our sins daily that Lord we die to self daily Lord so that when you're coming near or when you're coming when your return comes Lord we shall not be found wanting because if we do not prepare if we do not consider that time is at hand then Lord we risk finding ourselves wanted so we pray that Lord you renew us daily we pray that you make us alert and focused and alive to the fact to the fact that we do not have time be with us Lord even as we persevere may your Holy Spirit give us strength and power to walk this life of Faith until next week we thank you and we praise you for it is in Jesus name we pray amen amen amen amen

[10.2s] Ellen gght and you can find it on the
[12.7s] link on the screen or you can pause the
[15.5s] video and scan the QR code that we have
[17.9s] put up so this is a book that you can
[20.4s] get to actually follow with us and what
[22.9s] we doing in this panel is waiting your
[25.5s] appetite to read the book not reading
[28.1s] for you the book otherwise you'd be
[30.0s] spending hours here on set so even as
[33.8s] you follow this book review with us we'd
[36.3s] like you to confirm the points that we
[38.1s] are sharing go and read the book for
[40.1s] yourself and learn and be encouraged by
[43.7s] the Nuggets that you get because the end
[46.3s] goal is for you to be truly revived and
[48.8s] not just a superficial experience I'd
[52.0s] like my panelist on my left to introduce
[54.4s] himself for the session today yeah good
[56.9s] morning everyone good afternoon
[58.5s] depending on where you're watching from
[60.0s] my name is Steven muga welcome thank you
[62.6s] Steve and on my right good morning good
[65.6s] evening depending on where you're
[67.1s] watching us from my name is
[69.5s] Opa thank you and my name is nikio I'm
[72.3s] the moderator for today and these are
[74.3s] wonderful deacons who serving here at
[76.8s] Nairobi Central SDA church so before we
[80.7s] begin i' just like to say a quick prayer
[83.6s] and I'd like uh brother to take it away
[87.3s] so let's pray our kind and loving Father
[90.3s] in Heaven thank you for guiding us and
[93.1s] even as we cover chapter 8 titled it's
[95.6s] still a fight I pray that you may teach
[98.4s] us how to fight in the right way we ask
[101.6s] this in Jesus name amen amen amen amen
[106.0s] amen ah chapter 8 is still a fight uh
[110.1s] the introduction of the the title is uh
[113.7s] what sin has
[116.7s] done
[118.6s] the the the
[120.4s] devastating outcome of sin into our
[123.3s] lives and uh we have been told here that
[127.4s] more clearly than we do we need to
[130.2s] understand the issues at stake in the
[132.6s] great conflict in which we are engaged
[136.1s] we need to understand more fully the
[138.2s] value of the truths of the word of God
[142.8s] and the danger of allowing our minds to
[144.9s] be diverted from them by The Great
[148.7s] Deceiver and when we talk
[151.7s] about it's still a
[154.4s] fight uh it's still a fight from what I
[157.4s] think after you have been
[160.1s] saved there's no time for you to say now
[163.2s] now I'm saved now I'm
[165.6s] satisfied I know we have talked about
[167.6s] satisfaction in our previous week you
[170.4s] can't sit down and say now I'm
[174.4s] saved there still a fight because in
[176.9s] fact the devil you remember when Christ
[179.9s] was accused of mingling with Sinners and
[183.3s] he say that uh a person who who is whole
[186.6s] a person who is healthy is not in need
[188.6s] of a doctor other than the one who is
[193.1s] who is sick the same thing applies to
[196.3s] the devil those people who have rejected
[200.1s] the prings of the Holy Spirit those are
[202.7s] on the devil's side but those who have
[205.8s] accepted the call of the Holy Spirit and
[208.2s] confessed that Christ Jes is their lord
[210.6s] and savior those are the targets of the
[213.2s] Devil Himself now so here we seeing that
[215.8s] you'll never have peace the way the
[218.3s] world will want you to to give peace and
[220.6s] that's why Jesus said that the peace I
[223.1s] give you my peace I give you not as the
[225.2s] world give you meaning that you'll go
[227.6s] through Temptations you'll go through
[229.9s] persecutions but you still have you'll
[233.0s] still enjoy peace and
[236.4s] uh from from from from the the the the
[240.8s] book of
[243.1s] uh 1 Corinthians 15 verse 31 he says I
[248.8s] protest by your by your rejoicing which
[252.6s] I have in Christ Jesus our lord I Die
[257.0s] daily this is Paul talking now he's
[260.6s] saying that he his will and his desires
[263.8s] every day conflicted with Duty and the
[267.0s] will of
[268.1s] God remember Paul says that uh that
[272.2s] which I'm supposed to do that I don't
[276.2s] and that which that I'm not supposed to
[277.8s] do that I do so this conflict this fight
[281.4s] that we talking about we realize that is
[283.3s] not even fight against the enemies or
[286.8s] enemy real or perceived out there first
[289.2s] that fight is in you now because the
[293.5s] flesh the flesh the fight between the
[296.0s] Flesh and the spirit is so so strong
[298.7s] that it's you living in a constant
[301.8s] conflict and uh how do we fight this uh
[305.4s] fight there's a there's a verse that
[307.7s] there's a title that talks about there's
[309.8s] a science to it and then it says that
[312.2s] there's a science of Christianity to be
[315.0s] mastered a science as much deeper
[317.8s] broader higher than any human science as
[321.0s] the heavens are as the heavens are
[324.4s] higher than the earth the mind is to be
[327.5s] disciplined educated trained
[330.2s] for we are to be to do service for God
[333.4s] in ways that are not in harmony with
[336.5s] inbo inclination because human nature
[340.8s] the Fallen human nature we always
[342.4s] inclined towards sins so it's a constant
[346.2s] reminder every day we die daily so that
[348.9s] we surrender to Christ now that when we
[352.0s] die to self now Christ even as we you
[355.5s] see us living is Christ who what who is
[358.6s] living in in in in in us and um just to
[364.3s] collect your views from this
[367.4s] chapter uh there's a there's there are
[371.0s] some very pertinent question that have
[373.3s] been uh brought here it takes
[376.8s] perseverance brother Nick what kind of
[379.5s] perseverance are we talking about here
[381.7s] when it talks in relation to the title
[384.1s] that uh it's still a
[386.7s] fight when I think about it
[390.5s] the work of character building is not
[393.0s] the work of a day it's not a month it's
[396.4s] not a week it's actually something that
[398.6s] you do for a life for a life which
[401.0s] actually means that if you want to get
[404.6s] to heaven then you have to persevere as
[407.7s] you've read in 1 Corinthians
[410.1s] 15:31 I died daily now when I think of
[413.8s] death that's a painful thing imagine if
[416.6s] you have to go through death if you're
[418.3s] hearing your relative is
[420.2s] every other day you'll be like w what is
[423.3s] this I have to persevere so that's what
[425.7s] it actually means to be a Christian
[428.5s] you're in a lifelong struggle to the
[431.0s] point that if you just let a day go then
[434.6s] you may find that you lose your way to
[437.8s] Jesus think I like the example where the
[440.9s] parents of Jesus left him alone in the
[442.9s] temple and they had to take 3 days to
[446.0s] get him back now I believe that's the
[448.7s] same case we stop persevering might be
[452.0s] harder to get back to Jesus than when he
[453.9s] came at first so it's something that we
[456.7s] need to do daily and sin also has its
[460.6s] chains on us yeah you'll find out soon
[463.9s] this habit is not good you leave it then
[466.8s] you go to another and that's the reason
[469.0s] why we're coming to church every week
[472.5s] people say the church is a hospital not
[474.7s] because you're suffering from the same
[476.2s] disease every day but because the
[478.5s] disease is changing every day and you
[480.8s] find a different diagnosis and is also
[483.6s] pruning working so that you look more
[485.7s] like the vine that we spoke about in the
[488.3s] past chapter so I believe that's why we
[490.4s] need to persever thank you the Bible
[492.6s] says that uh it's better to go to the
[494.9s] house of morning than to the house of
[497.4s] feast because if when you go to the
[499.8s] house of morning you realize it's it's
[503.0s] it's so much aware you become aware that
[506.6s] uh death is real and when you talk about
[510.7s] death being real dying daily brother
[514.1s] Steve do you know when you're going to
[517.0s] die and now that's question tied to now
[521.6s] the aspect of time how much time do we
[524.7s] have for us to repent and to be right
[527.6s] with Jesus Christ amen
[530.8s] amen I think how would I pick it I pick
[534.6s] it you know when you wake up in the
[537.0s] morning you have 24 hours M okay that's
[541.4s] that's that's the quarter that we have
[542.9s] been given God would have given us 72
[545.2s] hours in a day or he would have given us
[547.5s] 1 hour but there's a reason why he gave
[549.8s] us 24 hours so that we are able to
[552.6s] manage our time within that 24 hours it
[555.7s] does not mean that we have all the time
[557.4s] in our hand it also does not mean that
[559.7s] we have little
[561.7s] time now in terms of time brother Niko
[565.3s] has just mentioned that you know we must
[568.4s] persevere MH this perseverance calls us
[571.0s] for a daily renewal of our relationship
[573.8s] with Christ daily why do we renew our
[576.1s] daily um life with Christ how why is it
[579.9s] daily it's daily because we know not the
[582.1s] hour MH yeah you could wake up in the
[584.7s] morning and time is spent and that's why
[587.0s] we are called upon to renew our faith in
[589.6s] Christ every day to repent of our sins
[592.5s] every single day and you know the time
[595.1s] could be we could be here and and we
[597.2s] don't see each other tomorrow Revelation
[599.8s] 22:11 says that um you know let the
[604.2s] unjust remain unjust let the righteous
[608.0s] still remain righteous and let the holy
[610.6s] still remain holy why because the
[613.7s] probation could end any time I mean we
[617.4s] know not the hour not even the angels
[619.2s] know when the probation window will
[621.2s] close but the prophet but at least the
[623.7s] Bible has given us has revealed to us
[626.2s] certain prophecies that we are within
[629.0s] the period of Probation and time is n
[632.0s] time is just about to end so if we do
[634.6s] not know then we are safer if we renew
[637.6s] our life to Christ every day we are
[639.4s] safer knowing that we don't have time
[641.8s] that 24 hours quarter that we've been
[643.7s] given let us not be comfortable saying
[646.4s] that we have time we don't have time so
[649.0s] that that is what I would say with no
[651.2s] time to lose yeah thank you very much
[654.2s] brother Steve for that
[656.4s] quite elaborate illustration
[660.6s] let's talk about constant
[662.4s] dependence of Christ we we know we know
[665.8s] about Apostle Paul he was highly
[669.1s] intelligent he was knowledge he was well
[671.7s] schooled and I remember uh reading the
[674.7s] books of Acts of
[676.7s] apostle uh he was giving us a narration
[679.4s] of how he encountered the Brethren and
[682.4s] there's a places there are places where
[683.9s] he went and he said that he found very
[686.4s] intelligent people and he said he
[688.7s] marched them where where where they gave
[691.6s] him wisdom he gave them wisdom where
[693.6s] they gave him knowledge he gave them
[696.4s] knowledge one for a day he countered but
[699.8s] he came to realize that there was not
[701.8s] actually
[703.0s] conversion it was just a
[705.4s] discourse then again when he realized
[707.9s] that the next station he went to he took
[710.8s] his mission he said I care for nothing
[712.6s] else but what Christ crucified so here
[715.8s] we are being told that never depend on
[719.4s] yourself don't be self-sufficient we
[720.8s] have we have talked about Peter in our
[722.7s] previous discussion not be
[725.7s] self-sufficient always plugged in into
[728.0s] the vine you are the branch and then the
[731.2s] challenges
[732.5s] of sing the plucking the branch and
[735.4s] joining the the black attach and
[737.6s] Detachment and attachment and Detachment
[739.4s] thank you so I think this is a it's a
[742.4s] it's a it's it's it's very enlightening
[744.7s] that
[745.9s] uh when we constantly depend on Christ
[749.5s] the only time now we can be grounded yes
[753.2s] so brother n yes please take us through
[756.8s] truth and trivia because we know these
[759.5s] are things that we encountered every day
[761.7s] in our spiritual journey
[765.7s] yes I'd say that one of the laws we
[768.7s] should use in the Bible to determine
[770.8s] what is truth and what is something that
[773.4s] is trivia is by looking in Deuteronomy
[776.7s] 29:29 MH the Bible says M the things
[780.1s] that are revealed belong to us and to
[783.3s] our children but the things that are not
[786.0s] revealed Bel to God Amen there are many
[789.1s] times where we might come up with
[790.7s] theories about so many things and we
[793.2s] want to find out what is truth what is
[795.3s] this thing that is here you're looking
[797.5s] for a startling Theory to come and
[799.4s] present to people but the truth is you
[802.1s] should go only to the things that are
[804.2s] revealed for example if you ask me ask
[807.0s] me who is God's father and who is his
[808.8s] mother I tell you I don't know because
[812.1s] it but if we start going to look in
[814.7s] different books sometimes want to add
[816.8s] books into the Canon of scripture and
[819.0s] claim that this is the only book you can
[821.0s] find that Source then we we'll get into
[823.6s] a problem yes so even our acquaintance
[827.3s] and our knowledge of facts and other
[830.5s] things that we know in the Bible as
[833.3s] important is not of any use if we are
[836.6s] not truly revived in our heart because
[839.7s] there are some things that even if you
[841.7s] know you'll perish for example I just
[844.3s] give one the Bible says in First
[846.8s] Corinthians 13 that though I speak with
[849.0s] the tongues of men of angels though I
[851.1s] have the gift of Prophecy though I give
[854.5s] everything to charity and I have not
[857.2s] love I am not which means that's a truth
[860.1s] that doesn't nourish the soul am it's
[862.5s] prophecy without profit it doesn't help
[865.3s] any so I think that's where truth and
[867.6s] trivia matters we study what is truth to
[870.7s] help us oh yeah thank you thank you very
[872.9s] much I think Christ even before he left
[875.9s] he had already equipped us he said is
[879.5s] it's important that he lives now so that
[881.6s] the Holy Spirit may come down to help us
[884.7s] and remember also when he was sending
[888.2s] out the disciples he explicitly
[891.3s] explained to them the kind of challenges
[893.7s] they going to face in clear black and
[896.7s] white there's nothing that was masked
[899.4s] that those the disciples will maybe go
[901.8s] out to the mission field and then be
[903.7s] like oh no I wasn't prepared he prepared
[905.9s] them so Christ has prepared us that we
[908.7s] are going to face persecution because
[911.5s] only we have professed him as our Lord
[914.2s] and and savior so let's keep the fight
[917.0s] on but be guided by the word of God
[920.7s] brother Nik
[922.2s] please maybe I don't have much to say we
[925.4s] said quite a bit in this panel please
[928.2s] join us next week for chapter 9 which is
[931.4s] safeguarding the new experience we are
[934.8s] slowly trudging to the end of the book
[937.8s] but we are still praying that you're
[939.2s] reading with us not just listening to us
[942.3s] yeah remember I'd like you to say the
[944.3s] word of God says not the panelists here
[947.5s] say Amen not I heard about it but I
[950.0s] don't know where it is it's actually
[951.8s] what is in the book so please get
[953.8s] yourself a copy of this book run a link

[961.0s] get a copy of this thank you for joining
[964.1s] us today and I'd like to invite my
[966.7s] brother Steve to give us a closing
[968.9s] prayer and next week we'll be covering
[971.4s] safe guing the new experience please
[974.0s] pray for us Steve thank you let us pray
[976.3s] Our Father who are in heaven thank you
[978.1s] so much for reminding us that the fight
[980.8s] is still on that our walk with Christ is
[984.2s] not something that we should consider um
[988.0s] that we have time
[989.7s] Lord thank you for reminding us that we
[991.6s] do not have time that we live our life
[994.2s] for today that Lord we confess our sins
[997.2s] daily that Lord we die to self daily
[1000.1s] Lord so that when you're coming near or
[1002.0s] when you're coming when your return
[1004.1s] comes Lord we shall not be found wanting
[1007.0s] because if we do not prepare if we do
[1009.8s] not consider that time is at hand then
[1012.3s] Lord we risk finding ourselves wanted so
[1015.6s] we pray that Lord you renew us daily we
[1018.3s] pray that you make us alert and focused
[1021.7s] and alive to the fact to the fact that
[1024.1s] we do not have time be with us Lord even
[1026.7s] as we persevere may your Holy Spirit
[1029.0s] give us strength and power to walk this
[1031.7s] life of Faith until next week we thank
[1034.5s] you and we praise you for it is in Jesus
[1036.5s] name we pray amen amen amen amen
