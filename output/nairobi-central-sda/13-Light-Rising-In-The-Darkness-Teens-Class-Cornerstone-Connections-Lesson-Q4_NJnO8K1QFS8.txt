mother and four friends in the seventh from the Seventh Day Adventist Church in bethl it was 9:00 in the morning and they planned to arrive 3 hours later in the village of Yukon kusom win Delta but things did not go as to plan only after 30 minutes the boat stuck on a sandb in the middle of an enormous river matrona and the others did everything that they could to get the boat and stuck from The Sandbar they got out of the boat and they standing and standing on The Sandbar they tried to push it back into the water the boat remained stuck they tried to pull the boat into the water they got back into the boat and swayed back back and forth hoping to Shake The Boat Boat loose from the sbba the boat remained stuck it was like then they were going to remain in a timely Island and they could get it off an hour passed matrona and The Others sung same songs surrounded by the huge River no one could hear them for miles and miles so they sung songs like it is time and Over the Sea and at the top of their lungs when matron got tired of singing she took selfies and photos of the boat and their surroundings with Mother's cell phone 2 hours passed matona started to feel hungry she and the

firewood jelly firew jelly is made from Pink from Pink firewood flowers and has unusual flavor it is sweet and sour flowery and fruity it tast it tastes like it tastes like kind of mixture of strawberries and a apricots after eating matrona began to feel are little discouraged the group had received special permission from the local Alaska native authorities to give the the children's program at the Village Meeting House it had been long and unaccompanied process but now they were stuck on the sunbar and were going nowhere it went through it went through it all that now we can't go

the woman said that she could still do the Children's Program they arve at 5:00 p.m. after that the children will be busy doing something else by now 3 hours had passed since the tide was coming in the boat Broke Free from the sunbar and moved again matrona listened as the grownups talked more about what would happen next it took two two more hours to travel to the little village matrona wondered if it was worth it the grownups said they are willing to go let's see what happens one said it's worth trying the both the boat leave arrived the village exactly at 5:00 p.m. matrona and the

name is Eugene I'll allow my panel to introduce themselves from my far left uh my name is Richard muger uh my name is barabara Ching my name is Valerie precious my name is Gideon wonderful today we have a very exciting and interesting lesson um the title is light rising in the darkness before we begin allow me to say a prayer Our Father and our God as we dive into your word Lord we ask for your blessing we pray that we may decrease as you increase and that you may put your words on our lips and in our hearts and that we may leave refreshed and strengthened and that you may grant us your rest even now in Jesus name amen amen all right to begin I'd like to ask um Barbara to read our key text from The Book of Ezekiel chapter 20 verse 20 uh the key text says keep my Sabbath holy that they may be a signed between us that you will know that I am the Lord your God Amen I wonder do you have um a secret handshake with anyone something that just you and the person know about a sign between you and them maybe not an handshake but a greeting a greeting yeah yeah a greeting maybe a name that they call you but no one else calls you right or an inside joke that you and this person get and whenever the joke comes up you're the only two people in the room laughing so the the Sabbath is similar in in that way it is a sign between us and God that when we rest on Sabbath we are saying something about our relationship with God um barabra maybe you could read the flashlight as well um the Sabbath was not for Israel merely but for the world it had been made known to men in Eden and like the other precepts of the dialog it is of imperishable obligation of that law of which the fourth Commandment forms apart Christ declares till Heaven and Earth pass one jolt of one title shall in um no is pass from the law so long as the heavens and the Earth endure the Sabbath will continue as a sign of the Creator's power and when Eden shall Bloom on Earth again God's holy rest day will be honored by all beneath the sun thank you Barbara let's go into the what do you think section Gideon will take us through so in the what do you think section we are asked to circle the correct answers so there are a set of questions or statements that we need to approve um based on the verses given aside so the first one is the Sabbath is the memorial of creation um is the Sabbath a memorial of creation what do you guys think vow um I think it is a memorial of creation as after God created the world he set aside a day of rest so it reminds us of God's creation yeah amen maybe we can move to the second one so the second one the Sabbath is a symbol of deliverance from bondage and sin the Sabbath is a symbol of deliverance from bondage and sin so maybe we could read Deuteronomy 5:15 Deuteronomy 5:15 says and remember that you were as slave in the land of Egypt and the Lord your God brought you out of the brought you out from there by a mighty hand and an and by an outstretched arm therefore the Lord your God commanded you to keep the Sabbath day so that's a direct answer where God says that you should remember on that day that the Lord brought the Israelites from the land of Egypt so he delivered them from bondage so the Sabbath is a symbol of deliverance from bondage and sin on to the third one the Sabbath is a sign of a relationship with God who sanctifies us the Sabbath is a sign of a relationship with God who sanctifies us Exodus 31:3 maybe someone can read Exodus 31:3 whoever gets there first um and it says say to Israelites you must observe my sabbaths this will be a sign between me and you you for the generations to come so you may know that I am the Lord who makes you holy amen the next one is the Sabbath is a sign of our faithfulness to God and obedience to his law Revelation 14:12 could you read Revelation 14:12 Revelations 14:12 it says here is the patience of the Saints here are they that keep the Commandments of God and the faith of Jesus Amen so yes the statement is right that the Sabbath is a sign of our faithfulness to God and obedience to his law so the Sabbath is a day of delightful communion with God and one another amen Leviticus 23:3 Richard you could read uh the one in Leviticus Leviticus 23:3 and it says six days shall work be done but the seventh day is a Sabbath of solemn rest and a and a holy convocation you shall do no work on it it is the Sabbath of the Lord in all your dwellings amen and the last the second last one the Sabbath is a symbol of resting in Christ it is according to Hebrews 4:9 and the last one is the Sabbath will be the will be God's day of worship for eternity in the new earth Isaiah 66:23 amen let's go right into the story um it's fairly long so I think we'll split how we read it maybe Richard you could kick us off with Isaiah 56 verse 1-6 and 7 so Isaiah 56 verse 1-6 and 7 it says th says the Lord keep Justice and do righteousness for my salvation is about to come and my righteousness to be revealed blessed is the man who does this and the son of man who lays hold on it who keeps from defiling the Sabbath and keeps his hands from doing any evil verse six says also the son of the Foreigner who joins themselves to the Lord to serve him and to love the name of the Lord to be his servants everyone who keeps from defiling the Sabbath and holds fast my Covenant even them I will bring to my Holy Mountain and make them in my house and make them joyful In My House of Prayer their burnt offering and their sacrifices will be accepted on my Altar for my house shall be called a house of prayer for all nations amen Barbara could you read Isaiah 58:2 to4 uh Isaiah 58:12 it says and they that shall be of thee shall build the old west places Thou shalt raise up the foundation of many generation and thou shalt be called the repairer of the bridge the restorer of paths to dwell in if thou turns away thy fruit from the Sabbath from doing the pleasures on my Hol day and call the Sabbath a delight the holy day H uh and call the Sabbath a delight the holy of the Lord honorable and shall honor him not doing thine own ways nor finding thine own pleasure nor speaking thine own words then shall thou Delight shall thou Delight thyself in the Lord and I will cause thee to ride upon the high places of the earth and feed and feed thee with the heritage of Jacob thy father for the mouth of the Lord hath spoken it amen thou um read Isaiah 60:1 to3 for us and it says arise sh for your light has come and the glory of the Lord Rises upon you see Darkness covers the earth and thick darkness is over the people but the Lord Rises upon you and His Glory Appears over you Nations will come to your light and Kings to the brightness of your Dawn amen lastly let's have Gideon read Isaiah 66: 22 and 23 Isaiah 66:22 for as the new heavens and the new Earth Earth which I will make shall remain before me says the Lord so shall your descendants and your name remain 23 and it shall come to pass that from one new moon to another and from one Sabbath to another All Flesh shall come to worship before me wow all right so the story has highlighted some themes mostly about the Sabbath that when you keep it you're blessed that it's Universal for all people to keep and that will'll keep it even in the new Earth right it's like a universal holiday I know in our world we have holidays that we celebrate and they are like a taste of what the Sabbath will be like when we finally go to Glory now let's go to the out of the story Val will take us through the questions we have seven questions let's see if we can get some answers um okay the first question according to Isaiah 56 1 and 2 how does God honor the person who maintains Justice does what is right and observes the Sabbath you can open Isaiah 56 1 and two it says that say the Lord keep judgment and do justice for the Salvation is near to come and my righteous Ness to be revealed blessed is the man that doest this and the son of man that layeth hold on it that keepeth the Sabbath from polluting it and keepeth his hands from Destro doing any evil amen so God has promised a blessing for those who keep his Sabbath whenever you rest it is a picture of Allowing God to work on your behalf do you guys remember the story of Jacob when he was running away from home and at bethl he fell asleep and uh the heavens opened remember the story what did he do just before he saw the Angels ascending and descending he picked a rock laid his head on it and rested do you guys think that's a picture of us resting in Christ the Rock of Ages the Cornerstone it is isn't it whenever you rest in Christ you allow God to work on your behalf and it's an amazing blessing to have the King of Kings working for you and for your good all right the next question what is God's promise to the foreigners who choose to follow him and observe the sabbath as God's holy day of rest Gideon what do you think um God promises that they will also have room in his in his house and um he equalizes the gift he he promises a greater gift for those who are outside go God's kingdom and actually keep the Sabbath rather than that rather than the isra Israelites who actually know the what is required of them and keep it faithful hallelujah amen how does Isaiah summarize the work of Reform that God's people have to accomplish Isaiah 58:12 um and it says your people will rebuild the ancient runs and will raise up the age-old foundations you will be called repairer of broken worlds and restorer of streets with the dwellings amen so so we live in a time that is um in in desperate need of leaders and people who can repair restore many aspects of our society that have fallen could you highlight any parts of society that you think need to be repaired or remade and what would you do to repair those aspect of life and Society Barbara um I think the part of the society that needs to be prepared I mean to be breed and repaired is the fact that we have a corruption in our country a great amount of it and now it's like it's very common and people don't even hide it anymore not like before and I think the way of preparing it is educating people on how to stop it and even quoting Bible verses for them that show that corruption is wrong yeah okay what do you guys think about um um I agree with her with a problem sorry to cut you off rard but let me let me let you speak and then I'll add I think since you said the society and also the community around us I think also maybe our Unity is something that should be touched on since everyone is always wanting to be on their own and thinking that problems can be solved their own but I think it's better to be United than to be apart so I think maybe that's also something that can go into prayer cuz uh for the community some of them is just guidance they need since they don't understand what's the purp of unity and how it may build them up so I think Unity is also an aspect that should so we have division we have corruption anymore um I think being self-centered like everyone wants something for thems that they don't consider what the other person will feel or how it will affect others so the aspect of being self-centered yeah all right we see in our story that God not only promises to bless those who keep the Sabbath but those who maintain Justice and do what is right in fact if you really want to keep your Sabbath well use the day as you rest to help someone in need quite often we see people go to hospital during the Sabbath isn't it to help the and preach to the sick remember when teens class went to a certain Hospital can anyone remember the name uh we went to a hospital to ministered to some old people who had some uh health issues anyone remember the name is it B I don't remember Babi is close but it's not Babi okay it's uh close to uh Valley Arcade in lavendon chomo you guys remember when we went to chomo maybe you guys went to bagad and I wasn't there actually well yeah it's possible if you guys went but yeah the Sabbath can be used to do Deeds of kindness because as Barbara and Richard have said we have a lot of corruption and Division in our society um fourth question what are the secrets of finding delight and joy in a relationship with God on his Sabbath Isaiah 58 13 and 14 and it says if you keep your feet from breaking the Sabbath and from doing as you please on my holy day and if you call the Sabbath a delight and the Lord's holy day honorable and if you honor it by not going your own way and not doing as you please or speaking Idol words then you will find your joy in the Lord and I will cause you to ride on the heights of the land and to Feast on the inheritance of your father the mouth of the Lord has spoken amen guys this is a very deep question um Delight cannot be man manufactured isn't it can you manufacture Delight can you force yourself to like someone have you tried before did it work it is always better when it's natural isn't it but one thing I can tell you about you and I we are not naturally people who Delight in Godly things the Bible says all have sinned and fallen short of the glory of God David when he fell and sinned with bad Sheba writes in Psalm 51 behold I was born in sin and shaped in iniquity so when you come into this world you come crooked you come with original sin it is God who intervenes in your life and gives you a new heart that loves what he loves and hates what he hates and I would add to the solution that Barbara gave of since we have corruption all we need to do is educate do you think that would work do we have corrupt educated people do they exist people who are corrupt in spite of Education what do you think I think on educate it's not educate academically it's educate like show them what is wrong with corruption how it affects others and the result of it so now they're educated on the area of corruption like it's wrong you can do this other like do other good things to get something you want other than corruption yeah okay anyone else who has something to say I think I can also add that we need to show them that the problem Rises not from only you doing it but people collect ctively doing it um if I take a bribe today and someone else takes a bribes takes a bribe tomorrow the problem won't be that I took a bribe though that is still a problem but it only amounts to a bigger problem when many of us do it so what do you think um I mean sorry but uh come to think of it it needs to be a personal effort an individual initiative that everyone needs to take to make sure that this stops when you stop uh when you stop taking bribes or giving bribes the person beside you will also not give bribes they they can't keep they can't give it to you so they won't try to give it to another person so stopping it yourself can go a long way into stopping it in a broad-based aspect yeah you know the the interesting thing guys is we keep coming back to that uh root idea that since we are the problem we can't fix the problem the whole Bible narrative is based on the idea that Humanity keeps trying to fix something they can't fix because Humanity itself is Tainted by what they're trying to fix remember when they fell in the garden and um they sowed fig leaves for themselves to hide did God come and say you guys look good in those Fe leaves man it works we can keep them was that his idea when he came and found them in fig leaves his reaction was to cover them well isn't it so anything we try to do to fix our sin will always not address the root the root problem isn't that we commit corruption because we don't know the effects I've sinned before and I knew exactly what I was getting myself into all right the problem is to change our nature to desire not to sin but to do the right thing it is a nature change that we need maybe we can do one more and then go to the punch lines which one you guys think we should do five six or seven number seven okay what are ways we can learn to delight in God on the Sabbath knowing that we will continue to worship him for eternity in the new Earth is a verse Isaiah 6622 and 23 um it says as the new heavens and the new Earth that I will make will endure before me declares the Lord so will your name and descendants endure from one new moon to another and from one Sabbath to another all mankind will come and bow down before me says the Lord and they will go out and look upon the dead bodies of those who rebelled against me their womb will not die nor will their fire be quenched and they will be lost some to all mankind Richard then Barbara what do you guys think we can do to learn to delight in God on the Sabbath uh for me I think from my own perspective is giving cuz for me when I give like sometimes in the church plans that we'll go to a children's home or an elderly home just to visit fellowship with and give it brings some sort of delight that makes you feel like next time I come it will be better so that actually makes you stand firm in God cuz giving is also part of what we as Christians are brought up with because it makes us stand firm in the word of God Amen and in fact one cure to depression is service whenever you live a life of service you do not have um self Obsession and you can very easily come out of sadness that's a good answer Richard thank you um I'd go for personally reading and going deeply to knowing the word of God so that you can when you know more about him you will be more delighted to yes yes yeah and you will feel like you need his presence more and more day by day and you will even have peace in your life in your family and in everything that you do yes the more you know someone if they're are a wonderful person the more you like them isn't it and no one is as wonderful as God but let me try and debunk something that I know many young people think many young people think Heaven is like a 24-hour church service you know and no one wants to go for a 24-hour church service so what do you guys think heaven is like uh could start with Gideon and then Val what do you think heaven or Sabbath in the new Earth will be like um I tend to think that it will be a very enjoyable experience yeah cuz um you don't uh live a righteous life for however long someone has lived for you to go and you know just do the same thing you were doing there so our bodies will be renewed our we will we have a different nature other than this sinful nature we're living in day by day so heaven will be something else something you haven't seen Hallelujah I like how you said we have a different nature you know imagine just hanging out with the guys and with the girls without having you know sinful thoughts that's no longer a reality without having anxiety about how you look because you look awesome you know everything will be bumped up will be amazing isn't it I like that answer G how about you Val what do you think Sabbath in the the new Earth will be like um I think Sabbath in the new Earth would be us going to worship the Creator now face to face now that we can see him like he said our nature will be changed we our bodies will be changed yeah so we will just Fellowship together and enjoy the Sabbath we will we'll even get to know how important it is in our life at that point yeah we we will really enjoy the Sabbath yeah yeah amen uh how about you Richard what do you think summed it up because you know even God has promises for us in heaven like for example before when God went back for the first time he were told in the Bible that he went to prepare a place for us so I think when we get to heaven it will be more of God appreciating us for what we did in this earth than us so I think Heaven is just a wonderful amen Barbara lastly what do you think um I'd say that I'd want to quote what Gideon said about going our nature being changed and everything and us being so like you know all our sinful nature will be washed away and we will just be thinking about God and all that and all all our Focus will just be in him and no diversions of our Technologies and all that yeah yeah amen amen uh one thing I look forward to is trees and nature in the new Earth uh man of God once told me everything in heaven will be 10 times better right so if you like books you'll constantly be in the library you can imagine you know how vast that library is up there or whether they'll bring it down here who knows or if you like cats I don't personally like them but I hear they'll be 10 times better I'm waiting to see how they can be 10 times better if you like dogs if you like music everything will be bumped up to the extreme you know have you guys ever wondered why Adam and Eve didn't have kids in the garden before they fell isn't it interesting that they had kids after I personally think it's because they had better things to do like they had so many other interests that they never even thought about you know maybe we should have some kids they had so many distractions good distractions you know and that's the joy of the Sabbath we shouldn't see it as a yoke It's a Wonderful opportunity to rest with God and walk with God and learn more about him amen let's conclude with the punch lines since they they're four maybe each of us can read one so Richard can read the one uh that is in Genesis 2:1-3 then valon read Ezekiel 20:12 then um Gideon can read uh Luke 44-16 and Barbara will conclude with the final one Hebrews 13 and verse 8 so in Genesis 2:1 and 3 1 to 3 we are told thus the heavens and the Earth were complete in all the ver AR by the seventh day God had finished the work he had been doing so on the seventh day he rested from his work then God blessed the seventh day and made it holy because on it he rested from all the work of creation that he had done amen Ezekiel 20:12 says also I give them sabbaths as a sign between us so they would know that I the Lord made them holy amen Luke 4:14 to16 Jesus returned to Galilee in the power of the spirit and the news about him spread through the whole Countryside he was teaching in the Sy in the synagogues and everyone praised him he went to Nazareth where he had been brought up and on the Sabbath day he went to the synagogue and was as was his custom he stood up to read amen oh Hebrews 13:8 Jesus Christ is the same yesterday and today and forever amen amen do you guys have any parting shorts before we close with a prayer Val will pray for us but anything you'd like to say or ask as we conclude this wonderful lesson end quarter this is the final um lesson I think maybe from what I've picked generally is that the Sabbath is a delight just God set it aside knowing that after set it aside we will all be delighted in it and I think for all of us it makes us feel at home even as we come to church we uh in Matthew 11:28 we are told that come to me all who are we and he Len and I will give you rest so I think even each time we come to church just stay with the Lord and before we enter just leave our abidance to him and so for me the Sabbath is a delight Hallelujah anyone else also um in Matthew 12:12 we are told that uh it is lawful to do good on the Sabbath and also in Mark 2:27 we're told that the Sabbath was made for man and not man for the Sabbath amen so it is a chance to reconnect with God and reconnect with others it is not a day when you're not supposed to do it's not a day to kill the fun of if you've been having fun the whole week you have oh my God it's Sabbath I have to stop having fun and good to church you should make Church you should make uh the Sabbath a delightful experience for yourself and um maybe we can pick from the further Insight uh where in the Desire of Ages page 289 we're told to all who receive the Sabbath as a sign of Christ's creative and redeeming power it will be it will be a delight seeing Christ in it they will Delight themselves in him the Sabbath points them to the works of creation as an Evidence of his mighty power of redemption amen so in the Sabbath we should see the image of Christ and Delight in um following his precepts and what he's set down for us amen amen guys yeah the Sabbath was pointing to Christ in fact the whole Old Testament points to him anyone else I find Sabbath a gift as much as it is a day of worship it's like a day of like the way God created it um made the day holy from all the rest like you can work for six days but gets the seventh day for rest the rest was for us yeah so I find it a gift M to us you've worked for six days now you can rest as you worship that's good yeah yeah that's wonderful actually I've never seen it that way all right Val close for us with a prayer right let's pray thank you Lord for this wonderful day thank you for your spirit being with us and guiding us thank you for the wonderful lesson thank you for that we have learned that the Sabbath is a day of worship it is a gift and it's not a burden thank you for the gift of the Sabbath and as about to part may your spirit part with us in Jesus name I pray and believe amen amen

[530.7s] lovely panel with me my name is Eugene
[533.7s] I'll allow my panel to introduce
[535.6s] themselves from my far left uh my name
[538.6s] is Richard muger
[540.8s] uh my name is barabara Ching my name is
[543.4s] Valerie precious my name is Gideon
[546.8s] wonderful today we have a very exciting
[549.8s] and interesting
[551.2s] lesson um the title is light rising in
[555.6s] the darkness before we begin allow me to
[559.6s] say a
[561.6s] prayer Our Father and our
[564.2s] God as we dive into your word Lord we
[567.2s] ask for your blessing
[569.8s] we pray that we may decrease as you
[572.3s] increase and that you may put your words
[575.4s] on our lips and in our hearts and that
[579.2s] we may leave refreshed and
[582.5s] strengthened and that you may grant us
[584.7s] your rest even now in Jesus name amen
[589.1s] amen all right to
[591.4s] begin I'd like to
[594.3s] ask um Barbara to read our key text
[599.5s] from The Book of Ezekiel chapter 20
[602.4s] verse
[603.3s] 20 uh the key text says keep my Sabbath
[607.0s] holy that they may be a signed between
[609.7s] us that you will know that I am the Lord
[612.3s] your God Amen I wonder do you have um a
[618.3s] secret handshake with anyone something
[621.2s] that just you and the person know about
[624.2s] a sign between you and them
[632.9s] maybe not an handshake but a greeting a
[635.7s] greeting yeah yeah a greeting maybe a
[638.2s] name that they call you but no one else
[640.6s] calls you right or an inside joke that
[645.0s] you and this person get and whenever the
[648.2s] joke comes up you're the only two people
[650.5s] in the room laughing so the the Sabbath
[654.2s] is similar in in that way it is a sign
[657.2s] between us and God that when we rest on
[660.3s] Sabbath we are saying something about
[662.3s] our relationship with God um barabra
[666.2s] maybe you could read the flashlight as
[668.4s] well um the Sabbath was not for Israel
[672.5s] merely but for the world it had been
[675.6s] made known to men in Eden and like the
[678.5s] other precepts of the dialog it is of
[682.9s] imperishable
[684.4s] obligation of that law of which the
[687.3s] fourth Commandment forms apart Christ
[690.9s] declares till Heaven and Earth pass one
[694.3s] jolt of one title shall
[698.0s] in um no is pass from the law so long as
[703.1s] the heavens and the Earth endure the
[705.3s] Sabbath will continue as a sign of the
[707.6s] Creator's power and when Eden shall
[710.0s] Bloom on Earth again God's holy rest day
[713.9s] will be honored by all beneath the sun
[717.1s] thank you Barbara let's go into the what
[719.5s] do you think section Gideon will take us
[724.2s] through so in the what do you think
[726.9s] section we are asked to circle the
[728.6s] correct answers so there are a set of
[732.0s] questions or statements that we need to
[735.0s] approve um based on the verses given
[737.9s] aside so the first one is the Sabbath is
[740.6s] the memorial of
[742.5s] creation um is the Sabbath a memorial of
[747.1s] creation what do you guys think
[752.4s] vow um I think it is a memorial of
[756.3s] creation as after God created the world
[759.6s] he set aside a day of rest so it reminds
[763.8s] us of God's creation yeah
[768.1s] amen maybe we can move to the second one
[771.3s] so the second one the Sabbath is a
[773.9s] symbol of deliverance from bondage and
[777.3s] sin the Sabbath is a symbol of
[779.6s] deliverance from bondage and sin so
[782.6s] maybe we could read Deuteronomy
[797.8s] 5:15 Deuteronomy 5:15 says and remember
[801.5s] that you were as slave in the land of
[804.0s] Egypt and the Lord your God brought you
[806.6s] out of the brought you out from there by
[810.3s] a mighty hand and an and by an
[812.5s] outstretched arm therefore the Lord your
[815.1s] God commanded you to keep the Sabbath
[817.8s] day so that's a direct answer where God
[822.4s] says that you should remember on that
[824.6s] day that the Lord brought the Israelites
[827.2s] from the land of Egypt so he delivered
[830.2s] them from bondage so the Sabbath is a
[833.5s] symbol of deliverance from bondage and
[837.8s] sin on to the third
[840.3s] one the Sabbath is a sign of a
[842.4s] relationship with God who sanctifies
[845.5s] us the Sabbath is a sign of a
[847.9s] relationship with God who sanctifies us
[850.6s] Exodus
[852.4s] 31:3 maybe someone can read Exodus
[858.0s] 31:3 whoever gets there
[860.6s] first um and it says say to Israelites
[865.4s] you must observe my sabbaths this will
[867.4s] be a sign between me and you you for the
[870.0s] generations to come so you may know that
[872.5s] I am the Lord who makes you
[876.8s] holy
[879.0s] amen the next one is the Sabbath is a
[883.4s] sign of our faithfulness to God and
[885.7s] obedience to his
[889.6s] law Revelation 14:12 could you read
[893.5s] Revelation 14:12
[905.2s] Revelations 14:12 it says here is the
[909.0s] patience of the Saints here are they
[912.5s] that keep the Commandments of God and
[914.8s] the faith of Jesus
[917.7s] Amen so yes the statement is right that
[921.1s] the Sabbath is a sign of our
[924.6s] faithfulness to God and obedience to his
[926.6s] law so the Sabbath is a day of
[929.2s] delightful communion with God and one
[931.9s] another
[934.9s] amen Leviticus
[941.0s] 23:3 Richard you could read uh the one
[943.8s] in
[952.1s] Leviticus Leviticus 23:3 and it says six
[956.4s] days shall work be done but the seventh
[958.8s] day is a Sabbath of solemn rest and a
[961.8s] and a holy convocation you shall do no
[964.9s] work on it it is the Sabbath of the Lord
[967.4s] in all your dwellings
[970.4s] amen and the last the second last one
[973.8s] the Sabbath is a symbol of resting in
[976.4s] Christ it is according to Hebrews 4:9
[981.3s] and the last one is the Sabbath will be
[983.4s] the will be God's day of worship for
[985.2s] eternity in the new earth Isaiah 66:23
[990.2s] amen let's go right into the story um
[994.2s] it's fairly long so I think we'll split
[997.0s] how we read it maybe Richard you could
[999.6s] kick us off with Isaiah 56 verse 1-6 and
[1005.2s] 7 so Isaiah 56 verse 1-6 and 7 it says
[1012.7s] th says the Lord keep Justice and do
[1015.4s] righteousness for my salvation is about
[1018.0s] to come and my righteousness to be
[1020.6s] revealed blessed is the man who does
[1023.4s] this and the son of man who lays hold on
[1026.4s] it who keeps from defiling the Sabbath
[1029.8s] and keeps his hands from doing any
[1032.0s] evil verse six says also the son of the
[1035.8s] Foreigner who joins themselves to the
[1038.1s] Lord to serve him and to love the name
[1040.9s] of the Lord to be his servants everyone
[1043.3s] who keeps from defiling the Sabbath and
[1045.8s] holds fast my Covenant even them I will
[1049.4s] bring to my Holy Mountain and make them
[1052.4s] in my house and make them joyful In My
[1054.7s] House of Prayer their burnt offering and
[1057.2s] their sacrifices will be accepted on my
[1059.6s] Altar for my house shall be called a
[1062.1s] house of prayer for all nations amen
[1065.2s] Barbara could you read Isaiah
[1068.0s] 58:2
[1069.6s] to4 uh Isaiah
[1071.9s] 58:12 it says and they that shall be of
[1076.4s] thee shall build the old west places
[1079.6s] Thou shalt raise up the foundation of
[1081.8s] many generation and thou shalt be called
[1084.6s] the repairer of the bridge the restorer
[1087.0s] of paths to dwell in if thou turns away
[1090.4s] thy fruit from the Sabbath from doing
[1092.8s] the pleasures on my Hol day and call the
[1095.8s] Sabbath a delight the holy day H uh and
[1100.1s] call the Sabbath a delight the holy of
[1102.3s] the Lord honorable and shall honor him
[1105.3s] not doing thine own ways nor finding
[1107.8s] thine own pleasure nor speaking thine
[1110.3s] own words then shall thou Delight shall
[1114.1s] thou Delight thyself in the Lord and I
[1117.1s] will cause thee to ride upon the high
[1119.3s] places of the earth and feed and feed
[1123.6s] thee with the heritage of Jacob thy
[1126.0s] father for the mouth of the Lord hath
[1128.0s] spoken it amen thou um read Isaiah 60:1
[1134.2s] to3 for us and it says arise sh for your
[1139.4s] light has come and the glory of the Lord
[1142.0s] Rises upon you see Darkness covers the
[1145.2s] earth and thick darkness is over the
[1147.4s] people but the Lord Rises upon you and
[1150.3s] His Glory Appears over you Nations will
[1153.0s] come to your light and Kings to the
[1155.4s] brightness of your Dawn amen lastly
[1158.5s] let's have Gideon read Isaiah 66: 22 and
[1162.8s] 23 Isaiah
[1165.4s] 66:22 for as the new heavens and the new
[1168.5s] Earth Earth which I will make shall
[1170.5s] remain before me says the Lord so shall
[1173.8s] your descendants and your name remain 23
[1177.3s] and it shall come to pass that from one
[1179.2s] new moon to another and from one Sabbath
[1181.8s] to another All Flesh shall come to
[1185.2s] worship before
[1187.3s] me wow all right so the story has
[1191.6s] highlighted some themes mostly about the
[1194.3s] Sabbath that when you keep it you're
[1196.6s] blessed that it's Universal for all
[1199.0s] people to keep and that will'll keep it
[1201.5s] even in the new Earth right it's like a
[1205.2s] universal holiday I know in our world we
[1208.7s] have holidays that we
[1210.5s] celebrate and they are like a taste of
[1214.1s] what the Sabbath will be like when we
[1216.4s] finally go to Glory now let's go to the
[1219.1s] out of the story Val will take us
[1220.6s] through the
[1221.9s] questions we have seven questions let's
[1224.5s] see if we can get some answers
[1230.3s] um okay the first question according to
[1233.8s] Isaiah 56 1 and 2 how does God honor the
[1238.2s] person who maintains Justice does what
[1240.8s] is right and observes the Sabbath you
[1244.1s] can open Isaiah 56 1 and
[1250.2s] two it says that say the Lord keep
[1253.8s] judgment and do justice for the
[1256.0s] Salvation is near to come and my
[1258.2s] righteous Ness to be revealed blessed is
[1260.9s] the man that doest this and the son of
[1264.2s] man that layeth hold on it that keepeth
[1267.4s] the Sabbath from polluting it and
[1269.7s] keepeth his hands from Destro doing any
[1273.1s] evil amen so God has promised a blessing
[1276.8s] for those who keep his Sabbath whenever
[1278.8s] you rest it is a picture of Allowing God
[1281.9s] to work on your behalf do you guys
[1284.8s] remember the story of Jacob when he was
[1287.1s] running away from home
[1289.3s] and at bethl he fell asleep and uh the
[1294.0s] heavens opened remember the
[1296.6s] story what did he do just before he saw
[1299.3s] the Angels ascending and
[1302.9s] descending he picked a
[1305.1s] rock laid his head on it and
[1309.0s] rested do you guys think that's a
[1310.9s] picture of us resting in Christ the Rock
[1313.6s] of Ages the
[1315.1s] Cornerstone it is isn't it whenever you
[1318.0s] rest in Christ you allow God to work on
[1322.6s] your behalf and it's an amazing blessing
[1325.8s] to have the King of Kings working for
[1328.3s] you and for your
[1331.5s] good all right the next question what is
[1334.8s] God's promise to the foreigners who
[1337.2s] choose to follow him and observe the
[1339.6s] sabbath as God's holy day of rest Gideon
[1343.4s] what do you
[1345.3s] think um God promises that they will
[1349.1s] also have room in his in his
[1352.4s] house and um he equalizes the gift he he
[1357.5s] promises a greater gift for those who
[1360.5s] are outside go God's kingdom and
[1362.8s] actually keep the Sabbath rather than
[1364.7s] that rather than the isra Israelites who
[1367.8s] actually know the what is required of
[1371.1s] them and keep it faithful
[1376.1s] hallelujah amen how does Isaiah
[1379.4s] summarize the work of Reform that God's
[1382.4s] people have to accomplish Isaiah
[1386.2s] 58:12
[1389.3s] um and it says your people will rebuild
[1392.9s] the ancient runs and will raise up the
[1395.5s] age-old foundations you will be called
[1398.5s] repairer of broken worlds and restorer
[1401.5s] of streets with the
[1405.5s] dwellings
[1407.2s] amen so so we live in a time
[1411.7s] that is um in in desperate need of
[1417.5s] leaders and people who can repair
[1421.4s] restore many aspects of our society that
[1425.0s] have
[1425.8s] fallen could you highlight
[1428.2s] any parts of society that you think need
[1431.0s] to be repaired or
[1433.9s] remade and what would you do to repair
[1437.6s] those
[1439.2s] aspect of life and Society
[1442.2s] Barbara um I think the part of the
[1446.5s] society that needs to be prepared I mean
[1449.4s] to be breed and repaired is the fact
[1452.8s] that we have a corruption in our country
[1457.4s] a great amount of it and now it's like
[1460.8s] it's very common and people don't even
[1463.0s] hide it anymore not like before and I
[1466.5s] think the way of preparing it is
[1469.7s] educating people on how to stop it and
[1476.1s] even quoting Bible verses for them that
[1479.8s] show that corruption is wrong yeah okay
[1483.1s] what do you guys think about
[1486.3s] um um I agree with her with a problem
[1490.2s] sorry to cut you off rard but let me let
[1494.3s] me let you speak and then I'll add I
[1496.3s] think since you said the society and
[1498.5s] also the community around us I think
[1501.5s] also maybe our Unity is something that
[1504.3s] should be touched on since everyone is
[1507.1s] always wanting to be on their own and
[1508.9s] thinking that problems can be solved
[1510.8s] their own but I think it's better to be
[1512.4s] United than to be apart so I think maybe
[1516.3s] that's also something that can go into
[1518.6s] prayer
[1520.4s] cuz uh for the community some of them is
[1524.2s] just guidance they need since they don't
[1527.4s] understand what's the purp of unity and
[1529.5s] how it may build them up so I think
[1532.0s] Unity is also an aspect that
[1534.6s] should so we have division we have
[1537.1s] corruption anymore um I think being
[1540.9s] self-centered like everyone wants
[1543.1s] something for thems that they don't
[1545.9s] consider what the other person will feel
[1548.4s] or how it will affect others so the
[1551.8s] aspect of being self-centered yeah all
[1554.0s] right we see in our story that God not
[1557.2s] only promises to bless those who keep
[1559.2s] the Sabbath but those who maintain
[1561.9s] Justice and do what is right in fact if
[1566.3s] you really want to keep your Sabbath
[1568.8s] well use the day as you rest to help
[1572.7s] someone in
[1573.7s] need quite often we see people go to
[1576.4s] hospital during the Sabbath isn't it to
[1579.2s] help the and preach to the sick remember
[1581.7s] when teens class went to a certain
[1583.8s] Hospital can anyone remember the
[1585.8s] name uh we went to a hospital to
[1588.3s] ministered to some old people who had
[1591.1s] some uh health issues anyone remember
[1594.2s] the name is it B I don't remember Babi
[1596.8s] is close but it's not Babi okay it's uh
[1600.8s] close to uh Valley Arcade in lavendon
[1605.1s] chomo you guys remember when we went to
[1608.0s] chomo maybe you guys went to bagad and I
[1610.5s] wasn't there actually well yeah it's
[1613.4s] possible if you guys went but yeah the
[1615.9s] Sabbath can be used to do Deeds of
[1619.1s] kindness because as Barbara and Richard
[1622.8s] have said we have a lot of corruption
[1625.6s] and Division in our
[1632.5s] society um fourth question what are the
[1635.7s] secrets of finding delight and joy in a
[1638.8s] relationship with God on his Sabbath
[1641.1s] Isaiah 58 13 and 14 and it says if you
[1646.1s] keep your feet from breaking the Sabbath
[1648.2s] and from doing as you please on my holy
[1650.1s] day and if you call the Sabbath a
[1652.2s] delight and the Lord's holy day
[1654.1s] honorable and if you honor it by not
[1657.3s] going your own way and not doing as you
[1659.5s] please or speaking Idol words then you
[1662.5s] will find your joy in the Lord and I
[1664.6s] will cause you to ride on the heights of
[1666.6s] the land and to Feast on the inheritance
[1669.2s] of your father the mouth of the Lord has
[1671.3s] spoken amen guys this is a very deep
[1675.5s] question um Delight cannot be man
[1679.6s] manufactured isn't it can you
[1682.6s] manufacture Delight can you force
[1684.6s] yourself to like
[1686.0s] someone have you tried before did it
[1688.9s] work it is always better when it's
[1691.9s] natural isn't it but one thing I can
[1694.7s] tell you about you and I we are not
[1697.2s] naturally people who Delight in Godly
[1699.7s] things the Bible says all have sinned
[1702.3s] and fallen short of the glory of God
[1705.3s] David when he fell and sinned with bad
[1707.7s] Sheba writes in Psalm 51 behold I was
[1711.7s] born in sin and shaped in iniquity so
[1715.9s] when you come into this world you come
[1718.0s] crooked you come with original
[1721.5s] sin it is God who intervenes in your
[1725.4s] life and gives you a new heart that
[1728.8s] loves what he loves and hates what he
[1733.1s] hates and I would add to the solution
[1736.5s] that Barbara gave
[1738.8s] of since we have corruption all we need
[1741.6s] to do is
[1742.9s] educate do you think that would
[1746.9s] work do we have corrupt educated
[1752.3s] people do they exist people who are
[1755.5s] corrupt in spite
[1757.0s] of Education what do you think I think
[1760.9s] on educate it's not educate academically
[1764.2s] it's educate like show them what is
[1767.2s] wrong with corruption how it affects
[1770.2s] others and the result of it so now
[1773.1s] they're educated on the area of
[1775.7s] corruption like it's wrong you can do
[1780.0s] this other like do other good things to
[1782.7s] get something you want other than
[1785.2s] corruption yeah okay anyone else who has
[1789.2s] something to say I think I can also add
[1792.3s] that we need to show them that the
[1794.5s] problem Rises not from only you doing it
[1797.4s] but people collect ctively doing it um
[1799.9s] if I take a bribe today and someone else
[1802.4s] takes a bribes takes a bribe tomorrow
[1805.2s] the problem won't be that I took a bribe
[1807.4s] though that is still a problem but it
[1809.8s] only amounts to a bigger problem when
[1812.3s] many of us do it so what do you think um
[1815.6s] I mean sorry but uh come to think of it
[1820.6s] it needs to be a personal effort an
[1822.6s] individual initiative that everyone
[1824.3s] needs to take to make sure that this
[1827.1s] stops when you stop uh when you stop
[1829.9s] taking bribes or giving bribes the
[1832.2s] person beside you will also not give
[1834.5s] bribes they they can't keep they can't
[1836.6s] give it to you so they won't try to give
[1838.6s] it to another person so stopping it
[1841.0s] yourself can go a long way into stopping
[1844.8s] it in a broad-based aspect yeah you know
[1848.8s] the the interesting thing guys is we
[1851.1s] keep coming back to that uh root
[1854.8s] idea that since we are the problem
[1859.5s] we can't fix the
[1861.1s] problem the whole Bible narrative is
[1863.6s] based on the idea that Humanity keeps
[1866.3s] trying to fix something they can't fix
[1870.0s] because Humanity itself is Tainted by
[1873.5s] what they're trying to fix remember when
[1875.6s] they fell in the
[1877.2s] garden and um they sowed fig leaves for
[1880.9s] themselves to hide did God come and say
[1884.0s] you guys look good in those Fe leaves
[1886.4s] man it works we can keep them was that
[1889.4s] his idea when he came and found them in
[1892.5s] fig leaves his reaction was to cover
[1895.4s] them well isn't it so anything we try to
[1898.4s] do to fix our sin will always not
[1901.7s] address the root the root problem isn't
[1904.4s] that we commit corruption because we
[1906.0s] don't know the
[1907.2s] effects I've sinned before and I knew
[1909.6s] exactly what I was getting myself into
[1912.4s] all right the problem is to change our
[1914.8s] nature to desire not to sin but to do
[1917.6s] the right thing it is a nature change
[1920.7s] that we need maybe we can do one more
[1924.4s] and then go to the punch lines which one
[1926.4s] you guys think we should do five six or
[1932.2s] seven number seven okay what are ways we
[1936.6s] can learn to delight in God on the
[1938.8s] Sabbath knowing that we will continue to
[1941.2s] worship him for eternity in the new
[1943.3s] Earth is a verse Isaiah 6622 and 23
[1950.4s] um it says as the new heavens and the
[1953.6s] new Earth that I will make will endure
[1955.8s] before me declares the Lord so will your
[1958.6s] name and descendants endure from one new
[1961.5s] moon to another and from one Sabbath to
[1963.9s] another all mankind will come and bow
[1967.0s] down before me says the Lord and they
[1969.6s] will go out and look upon the dead
[1971.9s] bodies of those who rebelled against me
[1974.5s] their womb will not die nor will their
[1976.5s] fire be quenched and they will be lost
[1979.4s] some to all
[1981.4s] mankind Richard then Barbara what do you
[1983.9s] guys think we can do to learn to delight
[1987.6s] in God on the
[1989.3s] Sabbath uh for me I think from my own
[1991.8s] perspective is giving cuz for me when I
[1996.4s] give like sometimes in the church plans
[1999.0s] that we'll go to a children's home or an
[2001.0s] elderly home just to visit fellowship
[2003.0s] with and give it brings some sort of
[2005.6s] delight that makes you feel like next
[2008.0s] time I come it will be better so that
[2011.0s] actually makes you stand firm in God cuz
[2014.8s] giving is also part of what we as
[2017.9s] Christians are brought up with because
[2020.4s] it makes us stand firm in the word of
[2022.0s] God Amen and in fact one cure to
[2025.4s] depression is
[2027.4s] service whenever you live a life of
[2030.0s] service you do not
[2032.3s] have um self Obsession and you can very
[2036.2s] easily come out of sadness that's a good
[2038.8s] answer Richard thank you um I'd go for
[2043.6s] personally reading and going deeply to
[2047.0s] knowing the word of God so that you can
[2050.4s] when you know more about him you will be
[2052.9s] more delighted to yes yes yeah and you
[2057.3s] will feel like you need his presence
[2059.3s] more and more day by day and you will
[2061.4s] even have peace in your life in your
[2063.5s] family and in everything that you do yes
[2066.3s] the more you know someone if they're are
[2069.0s] a wonderful person the more you like
[2070.7s] them isn't it and no one is as wonderful
[2073.4s] as God but let me try and debunk
[2076.3s] something that I know many young people
[2078.4s] think many young people think Heaven is
[2083.0s] like a 24-hour church service you know
[2085.5s] and no one wants to go for a 24-hour
[2088.2s] church service so what do you guys think
[2090.1s] heaven is like uh could start with
[2093.0s] Gideon and then Val what do you think
[2094.8s] heaven or Sabbath in the new Earth will
[2097.1s] be like
[2099.6s] um I tend to think that it will be a
[2102.0s] very enjoyable experience yeah cuz
[2106.4s] um you don't uh live a righteous life
[2110.6s] for however long someone has lived for
[2113.8s] you to go and you know just do the same
[2116.4s] thing you were doing there so our bodies
[2119.4s] will be renewed our we will we have a
[2122.8s] different nature other than this sinful
[2124.8s] nature we're living in day by day so
[2129.0s] heaven will be something else something
[2131.4s] you haven't seen Hallelujah I like how
[2134.5s] you said we have a different nature you
[2137.7s] know imagine just hanging out with the
[2139.4s] guys and with the girls without having
[2142.2s] you know sinful thoughts that's no
[2144.4s] longer a reality without having anxiety
[2147.7s] about how you look because you look
[2149.4s] awesome you know everything will be
[2151.3s] bumped up will be amazing isn't it I
[2154.1s] like that answer G how about you Val
[2156.0s] what do you think Sabbath in the the new
[2157.9s] Earth will be
[2160.2s] like um I think Sabbath in the new Earth
[2164.0s] would be us going to worship the Creator
[2167.2s] now face to face now that we can see him
[2170.4s] like he said our nature will be changed
[2172.2s] we our bodies will be changed yeah so we
[2175.8s] will just Fellowship together and enjoy
[2178.3s] the Sabbath we will we'll even get to
[2180.5s] know how important it is in our life at
[2183.5s] that point yeah we we will really enjoy
[2186.8s] the Sabbath yeah yeah
[2190.2s] amen uh how about you Richard what do
[2194.0s] you
[2196.2s] think summed it up because you know even
[2200.1s] God has promises for us in heaven like
[2203.7s] for example before when God went back
[2206.7s] for the first time he were told in the
[2209.1s] Bible that he went to prepare a place
[2211.1s] for us so I think when we get to heaven
[2212.9s] it will be more
[2214.6s] of God appreciating us for what we did
[2217.8s] in this earth than
[2220.1s] us so I think Heaven is just a
[2223.8s] wonderful amen Barbara lastly what do
[2226.5s] you think um I'd say that I'd want to
[2230.5s] quote what Gideon said about going our
[2234.5s] nature being changed and everything and
[2237.3s] us being so like you know all our sinful
[2241.7s] nature will be washed away and we will
[2244.5s] just be thinking about God and all that
[2248.4s] and all all our Focus will just be in
[2251.7s] him and no diversions of our
[2254.4s] Technologies and all that yeah yeah amen
[2258.5s] amen uh one thing I look forward to is
[2262.6s] trees and nature in the new Earth uh man
[2266.7s] of God once told me everything in heaven
[2268.8s] will be 10 times better right so if you
[2271.3s] like books you'll constantly be in the
[2274.0s] library you can imagine you know how
[2276.9s] vast that library is up there or whether
[2279.9s] they'll bring it down here who knows or
[2281.9s] if you like cats I don't personally like
[2284.5s] them but I hear they'll be 10 times
[2286.2s] better I'm waiting to see how they can
[2288.4s] be 10 times better if you like dogs if
[2291.1s] you like music everything will be bumped
[2293.3s] up to the extreme you know have you guys
[2297.0s] ever wondered why Adam and Eve didn't
[2298.9s] have kids in the garden before they fell
[2301.8s] isn't it interesting that they had kids
[2304.2s] after I personally think it's because
[2306.6s] they had better things to do like they
[2308.2s] had so many other interests that they
[2310.7s] never even thought about you know maybe
[2312.6s] we should have some kids they had so
[2315.5s] many distractions good distractions you
[2317.8s] know and that's the joy of the Sabbath
[2320.7s] we shouldn't see it as a yoke It's a
[2322.6s] Wonderful opportunity to rest with God
[2326.0s] and walk with God and learn more about
[2328.0s] him amen let's conclude with the punch
[2330.6s] lines since they they're four maybe each
[2333.2s] of us can read one so Richard can read
[2335.7s] the one uh that is in Genesis
[2340.6s] 2:1-3 then valon read Ezekiel
[2344.8s] 20:12 then um Gideon can read uh Luke
[2350.9s] 44-16 and Barbara will conclude with the
[2353.2s] final one Hebrews 13 and verse
[2357.8s] 8 so in Genesis 2:1 and 3 1 to 3 we are
[2363.6s] told thus the heavens and the Earth were
[2366.9s] complete in all the ver AR by the
[2369.8s] seventh day God had finished the work he
[2372.2s] had been doing so on the seventh day he
[2374.6s] rested from his work then God blessed
[2377.1s] the seventh day and made it holy because
[2380.4s] on it he rested from all the work of
[2383.2s] creation that he had done
[2386.5s] amen Ezekiel 20:12 says also I give them
[2391.0s] sabbaths as a sign between us so they
[2393.4s] would know that I the Lord made them
[2395.9s] holy amen
[2398.3s] Luke 4:14 to16 Jesus returned to Galilee
[2402.6s] in the power of the spirit and the news
[2404.4s] about him spread through the whole
[2405.9s] Countryside he was teaching in the Sy in
[2408.6s] the synagogues and everyone praised him
[2411.2s] he went to Nazareth where he had been
[2413.4s] brought up and on the Sabbath day he
[2415.2s] went to the synagogue and was as was his
[2417.8s] custom he stood up to read amen oh
[2421.3s] Hebrews
[2422.7s] 13:8 Jesus Christ is the same yesterday
[2425.8s] and today and forever
[2428.8s] amen amen do you guys have any parting
[2432.5s] shorts before we close with a prayer Val
[2435.5s] will pray for us but anything you'd like
[2438.1s] to say or ask as we conclude this
[2441.4s] wonderful lesson end quarter this is the
[2444.3s] final um lesson I think maybe from what
[2449.8s] I've picked generally is
[2451.8s] that the Sabbath is a delight just God
[2456.0s] set it aside knowing that after set it
[2458.4s] aside we will all be delighted in it and
[2461.4s] I think for all of us it makes us feel
[2465.1s] at home even as we come to church
[2468.5s] we uh in Matthew 11:28 we are told that
[2472.3s] come to me all who are we and he Len and
[2475.1s] I will give you rest so I think even
[2477.1s] each time we come to church just stay
[2479.6s] with the Lord and before we enter just
[2481.6s] leave our abidance to him and so for me
[2484.2s] the Sabbath is a delight Hallelujah
[2488.1s] anyone else also um in Matthew 12:12 we
[2492.3s] are told that uh it is lawful to do good
[2494.9s] on the Sabbath and also in Mark 2:27
[2497.9s] we're told that the Sabbath was made for
[2499.5s] man and not man for the Sabbath amen so
[2502.8s] it is a chance to reconnect with God and
[2506.0s] reconnect with others it is not a day
[2508.8s] when you're not supposed to do it's not
[2510.7s] a day to kill the fun of if you've been
[2513.4s] having fun the whole week you have oh my
[2515.5s] God it's Sabbath I have to stop having
[2517.5s] fun and good to church you should make
[2519.4s] Church you should make uh the Sabbath a
[2521.9s] delightful experience for yourself and
[2525.0s] um maybe we can pick from the further
[2527.2s] Insight uh where in the Desire of Ages
[2530.5s] page 289 we're told to all who receive
[2533.9s] the Sabbath as a sign of Christ's
[2535.8s] creative and redeeming power it will be
[2539.5s] it will be a delight seeing Christ in it
[2542.3s] they will Delight themselves in him the
[2544.6s] Sabbath points them to the works of
[2546.4s] creation as an Evidence of his mighty
[2548.9s] power of redemption amen so in the
[2551.5s] Sabbath we should see the image of
[2553.6s] Christ and Delight in um following his
[2557.8s] precepts and what he's set down for us
[2560.9s] amen amen guys yeah the Sabbath was
[2564.0s] pointing to Christ in fact the whole Old
[2566.6s] Testament points to him anyone else I
[2571.2s] find Sabbath a gift as much as it is a
[2574.3s] day of worship it's like a day of like
[2578.8s] the way God created it um made the day
[2582.3s] holy from all the rest like you can work
[2584.9s] for six days but gets the seventh day
[2587.5s] for rest the rest was for us yeah so I
[2591.0s] find it a gift M to us you've worked for
[2594.8s] six days now you can rest as you worship
[2598.6s] that's good yeah yeah that's wonderful
[2600.9s] actually I've never seen it that way all
[2602.9s] right Val close for us with a prayer
[2605.7s] right let's pray
[2607.8s] thank you Lord for this wonderful day
[2609.6s] thank you for your spirit being with us
[2611.8s] and guiding us thank you for the
[2613.6s] wonderful lesson thank you for that we
[2615.7s] have learned that the Sabbath is a day
[2618.0s] of worship it is a gift and it's not a
[2620.4s] burden thank you for the gift of the
[2622.8s] Sabbath and as about to part may your
[2625.0s] spirit part with us in Jesus name I pray
[2627.4s] and believe amen amen
