we worship you Lord we pray that Lord you may pound to US your word in Jesus name we pray amen it is a good time and a good day that uh the Lord has seen it good that we come before him to praise him and I thank you for coming to Worship the Lord and also taking your time to sit down that you may be able to hear from me uh I know that you could have had several options where to worship today but you chose to worship this morning in this church even those who are online you could have chosen to worship from various platforms all over the world but you chose to worship with us I pray that God may be able to bless each one of us it is a day that uh several of us are not with us the teens are in cast the Pathfinders are camping out women Ministry are in narok and they are saying that they really finding it very nourishing continue to pray for them and they have sent greetings to you all they are all doing well I want to just to welcome you because today we have a big team we have been having sessions of prayers since Wednesday we have been having a series from The Book of Psalms from Psalm 23 the best psalm for many people and our theme has been Christ the shepherd Christ is the shepherd and I welcome all of you today and today our topic is a table from the shepherd a table from the shepherd and we can read from verse one the Lord is my shepherd I shall not want he makes me lie down in Green Pastures he leads me beside the Still Waters he restores my soul he leads me in the path of righteousness for his name sake yeah though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death I will fear no evil for you are with me you are R and your staff they confort me verse 5 you prepare a table before for me in the presence of my enemies you anoint my head with oil my cup runs over surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life and I will dwell in the house of the Lord forever may God bless the reading Psalm 23 is written by it is noted to us that it is written by King David and just a few things that I may want to let you know also that King David was a Shepherd for a long time an experienced one a skilled Shepherd and very skilled poet he sung many songs and this man was a king of Israel and a king was known to be a Shepherd now a king is making himself to be a sheep and calling the Lord to be a shepherd He reigned as a king from [Music] the year 1010 BC 1010 1,10 BC to the year 970 BC that is 40 Years of rain this song is a song of experience a most likely he wrote this King this this poem when he was a king but the latter part of his King Kingdom of his rulership so he has seen it all he has seen how he has fought throughout the time and realizes that all this while it was the Lord that was leading me through so the only thing that I can equate god with is a Shepherd so in this Psalm we have two characters by the way the Lord and the pist two characters from verse 1 to 3 the Lord who is the subject is a third party he says he is my shepherd third party third person but when he comes to verse four he changes when things get dark and the party becomes the second party though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death I will fear no evil for thou art with me now God is the second person you are with me all the challenges now he's directing to God I will not fear because you are with me this poem of experience is loved by many because we may be conf comfortable when you are a sheep but you are confident that even though you don't know where the pasture is the shepherd will know even though you may not know how to fight highers and lions the shepherd will know so he is saying even though things may be difficult no problem thou art with me and I wanted also to tell you that in this Psalm there are two metaphors metaphors a metaphor I don't want to to explain I may Define wrongly but you will just get it from its meaning one first metaphor is the Lord is my shepherd equating the Lord with the shepherd and we dealt with that for the last 3 days wday up to yesterday the second metaphor is is in verse five and six where the pist is bringing the host and his guest the host and his guest that is the second metaphor that we find in Psalm 23 Psalm 23 here David tells us you prepare a table before me in the presence of my enemies I love the way David is saying it he is telling God that God after seeing you I have seen how you do things and one thing that I confirm to you that you decide you plan the term prepare means that it is something plant the table is Not an Accident God has has planned for a table to be set before the guest so God has a plan for the table and the psalmist is saying my Lord I understand that you have plans for me and therefore I confirm that this table that is before me it is not just out of the blue but it is something that was destined to be there so the table is specifically prepared to be there and on that table there was not just things thrown here and there things were arranged in order not just few items of food that was placed on it it was a banquet Bounty things that were was on the table and the pist is seeing this and he says that Lord when I look at the table that you set before me you know for someone to set a table before you it means you are honored you are great this thing is planned for you and uh the ssist look at that and he glad he's saying oh how is Lord the Lord can come and even when I am in the wilderness where I am finding a lot of challenges my Lord comes and prepares a table before me even when there is no food he comes to prepare a table before me and then it it seems to be overwhelming thing to the sist but in the second line it says in the presence of my enemies meaning that the ship is not just very free remember we were talking about the Sheep being in a valley no way to cross to this side and to this side and it is deep in the night and it is blinding Darkness but the Sheep must go through the darkness meaning there is a there are a lot of challenges there may be threats from enemies wild animals but the psalmist is saying I will fear none of those threats because you are with me I will not fear so here is saying even with the presence of the challenges the afflictions that the sheep of the Lord go through God will still set a table in their presence now what I am bringing from this thing is this that in this place David might be facing a lot of enemies who are fighting him as a king and he saying that even though I am facing a lot of challenges people who are fighting me people who are challenging me but God has not left me alone he has not left me alone he has planned a table before me and it is a banquet something Bountiful before me and without any fear the table is set in the presence of the enemies but they will not eat they will not eat in a hurry nothing nothing is done in a hurry nothing is out of place nothing is out of order nothing is in a mess why because the shepherd is in control thy rod and thy staff they confort me when I look at his road and I know he's having a staff I am comforted so this person can set the table and in the presence of the enemies and without any fear we will not even eat the food in hurry we will take our time to eat by the way I have never been a soldier but I I tend to believe that Maybe soldiers when they are camping not the normal camps but when they are camping where they are at War and some they always carry some food and they want to eat that food in the forest where they hiding anytime ready for the enemy to attack they would be eating in a hurry eating in a hurry but where my Lord provides the table this banquet will never be eaten in a hurry we will be comfortable to eat the banquet which the shepherd is providing I always love this statement in good news so I can jump to good news and then I come back the one who read the them text read good news and I loved it it is saying you prepare a banquet for me where all my enemies can see me you didn't hear you prepare a banquet for me I I don't understand well the banquet do you know what a banquet is do you understand what a banquet is something great something tasty variety he prepares a banquet before me but not just anywhere he makes sure that that thing is eaten where enemies can be able to see me and then he says you welcome me as an honored guest Christ is welcoming me to that table as an honored guest meaning that the Lord will make me a great guest in his holy presence therefore I am a great person before the Lord you are a great person before the Lord and the Lord wants to welcome you as an honored guest in his presence by the way do not look at your sins and despise yourself the shepherd wants you to come back to him that he may give you the best of welcome that he wants to give his guest he welcomes you as an honored guest you prepare a table before me in the presence of my enemies you anoint my head with oil and my cup runs over this sist is saying that uh oh Lord I have been going through challenges in life and I as I have been talking about this thing throughout the week I have been saying that each person in this world is going through a challenge that he cannot be able to help out challenges in this world are many challenges are many afflictions are countless no one is not having pain pain of sick nness pain of lack of money pain of lack of a good place of work pain of business that is not just picking up pain of a family that is crumbling down pain of a family that is having no peace the psalmist understand the pain of the Sheep and he realizes that no one can fix this pain except the shepherd and therefore that is the reason why David is saying amidst all the pain you will not leave me without something to eat you you set a table before me and that table you are setting before me it is a table that you have planned to give me even when I am surrounded with enemies even when I am surrounded with afflictions even when I am surrounded with threats that I can't avoid you always prepare something to confort me thy rod and thy staff they confort me so he's saying in that you make me the choicest you anoint me with oil meaning that you choose me you choose me you you make me the best of what you want and then not only that then you bless me my cup is filled not only filled but runs over amid all those challenges I only need to carry my cup so well so that the Lord may fill it with blessings and with those blessings they will run over by the way they will spill over to your friends your friends will be blessed because you have a shepherd who is filling your cup I want to refer you to a certain book then we come back to Psalm 23 but it is still Psalm 78 it is written by Assaf when you look at Psalm 78 we'll uh read a few verses starting from verse 12 but as we open I am inviting you to understand that when David is talking about Psalm 23 something that could be in his mind is how how God took care of the children of Israel when they were coming from Egypt to the promised land the Lord took care of them as a Shepherd when they are in the wilderness and he took care of them until he settled them in Canaan and that is what Assaf is telling us in Psalm 78:1 12 is saying Psalm 78:2 is saying we will read a couple of verses there let's first read 12 and 13 marvelous things he did in the sight of their fathers in the land of Egypt in the field of Zan he divided the sea and caused them to pass through and he made the water stand up like a heap we pause there the only thing that I wanted you to get from there is that the pist here is saying God did marvelous things in the sight of the children of Israel marvelous things in order for them to see that he is taking care of them marvelous things God have done God has done God has done marvelous things in your sight just for you to see that he can do Miracles and is a shepherd of your life sometimes you look at the darkness around you and you think the shepherd is away the same chapter 78:8 we jump and it says Psalm 78:8 and it says and they tested God in their heart by asking for food of their fancy they tested God in their hearts by asking for food of their fancy verse 19 and they spoke against God and they said come God prepare a table in the wilderness my understanding of this question that can God prepare a table in the wilderness is telling me if you have ever gone to dry places food is very scarce where there is a lot of scarcity can God be able to give something that is tangible can God be able to provide for our needs when we feel that there is no way out when we feel that there is no option they spoke against God testing God can he prepare food in the wilderness can he set a table in the wilderness our title of the sermon is saying a table from the shepherd can he prepare a table before me this time there is something I need and it is a distant far very far from my vision can I get such thing so they asking can he can God prepare a table in the wilderness then they say in verse 20 behold they struck the rock so that the waters crashed out and the streams overflowed but can he provide can he provide bread also can he provide meat for his people by the way God has given you some things but some are still lacking can he provide those also and those lacking seemingly might be very difficult to get can he provide that one also verse 23 verse 23 yet he had commanded the clouds above and opened the doors of Heaven had rained down mana on them to eat and given them the Bread of Heaven God decided to open the heavens he red down the Mana and he brought to them the Bread of Heaven so verse 25 in is saying he gave them Manner and that manner he gave them verse 25 is saying man ate Angels food by the way they despised the manner but the manner that they were despising was Angel's food man did eat Angel's food I love it when it is again said in Revelation Chapter 2 verse1 17 God is promising the people who will come to him that those who will come I will give them some of the Hidden manner I have hidden some for you those who will trust me those who will wait upon me I have hidden some of the manner for you God has set a table for us those who will overcome a table is set before us those who will overcome those who will believe I will give some of the Hidden manner that is revelation 2:17 Psalm 23 verse 5 and 6 you prepare a table before me in the presence of my enemies you anoint my head with oil my cup runs over the psalmist is saying in all this my Lord my shepherd wants me to lie down in Green Pastures he want me to have rest beside the Still Waters therefore he sets a table before me and he invites me as an honored guest that is what David has found out therefore he says in verse 6 that surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life and I will dwell in the house of the Lord forever the beginning of that verse which is verse 6 David is saying surely goodness and mercy meaning that David has seen a lot of kind actions that God can do and then he adds another word goodness and mercy the term that is translated there as Mercy is a great Hebrew word a great Hebrew word uh it is a covenantal word covenantal word it is a word called H said H said I'm pronouncing H said h e s e d that powerful Hebrew word has no English equivalent by the way in my vernacular it has no equivalent still I don't know about yours surely it might not have this great Hebrew word is a word that means that God is having a deep love deep love that pushes him to do actions same time apart from love it is a kind of word that is talking about Good kindness great kindness that we cannot be able to express and of mercy so it has many facets that we may not have just in one word most translators in the Bible have translated it as loving kindness unfailing love mercy and they look at what might what the speaker might be referring to and then they they will translate give an English word that they think would be equivalent to what the speaker is having in mind because there's no one word that we can use to translate this covenantal word when you talk about a covenantal word it means a word that is bringing a relationship between God and his people that God is making a covenant with his children amidst all the challenges God has taken you as his child he will do his goodness he will provide his Mercy he will take you out of your sins and he would want to set a table before you on Earth and not a table before you on Earth only but even a table before you in the Heavenly Realms so he saying when a meal is prepared this meal when somebody invites you to a table it means that there is a mutual understanding you want to have and and this Mutual loyalty can grow up to be a covenant between you so the Lord is inviting me for a covenant with him that I may have a covenant with him no wonder David is saying the old thing that I have seen the old picture that I have seen surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life it is a covenant that he has made with me he will take care of me he will protect me all the days of my life enemies will be around me afflictions will be with me but my shepherd will surround me all the days of my life sometimes I will feel that there are a lot of challenges but I will not be afraid for he is with me the greatest thing is his holy presence he will be with me so David is saying surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life not some days all the days of my life but do you know those who believe in Christ will never die is what I'm saying biblical those who believe in Christ will never die in another part he said even though they die I will rest them up so surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life and I will dwell in the house of the Lord forever meaning that Ellen White sees a vision her first Vision you can get this in early writings her first vision and uh he sees the picture of heaven and a welcome that is given to the Saints when we Ascend on high and Adam stand before all of us taller than all of us and he's going to meet our savior our savior is taller than Adam then the Savior opens his arms that he may be able to come and fall onto his bosom but Adam can never fall on the bosom of the savior he seeing that what he did to humanity is very bad so he falls on his knees before the savior he falls at the knees of the Savior then our savior grasp him up and welcomes him and tells him welcome to the home of the saved then he takes him round round to look at all the fruits that he missed from the Garden of Eden when he was he was burnished out then he welcomes us to a silvery table the table was very extensive very long having all types of fruits on it a table that our Shepherd has prepared before us and he welcomes us and tells us eat the Covenant that he has made with us and when I look at that it reminds me to what Christ said to his disciples at the Last Supper after the last Last Supper he tells the disciples what did he say he said I will never drink from the fruit fruit of this Vine again till we drink it a new in the Kingdom of Heaven God is planning to bring good things to the life of his children he is a Shepherd who doesn't want any of us to be left out accept the Salvation from the savior Christ is the shepherd all other Shepherds may try their best but they are false Shepherds Christ is the chap Shepherd I welcome you to thank the Lord for whatever thing he has ever done in your life we are finishing this year and you might have been complaining about Darkness Darkness each and every time but the psalmist is saying even though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death I will fear no evil for thou art with me thy Ro and thy staff they comfort me and you do that after knowing that amidst all that Darkness all those afflictions all those challenges the Lord is willing to take care of you that is why the shepherd is going with you deep into the Wilderness deep into the blinding darkness that he may be able to save you a Shepherd would even lose his life for the Sheep Christ will go to any extent that you may be able to sit with him at the table he wants you to have a mutual understanding with him we will be having a season a season of prayer and if you can be able to write something you are thanking the Lord that he has done to you something this we this year tell him Lord thank you tell him Lord you are my shepherd you can be writing a note we will put them and we will pray for these boxes when we will be singing our last song which is 132 in kisu you can be bringing the prayer requests those who are up there there is a box up there even in the afternoon I welcome you we will still talk about Christ the shepherd I welcome you that you may be able to ask God there is still some Darkness tell God that there is Darkness here but I am sure you are going to set a table before me

[145.0s] sessions of
[147.0s] prayers since Wednesday
[150.0s] we have been having a
[152.4s] series
[154.4s] from The Book of
[156.6s] Psalms from Psalm
[160.3s] 23 the best psalm for many
[164.1s] people and our theme has been Christ the
[170.3s] shepherd
[172.0s] Christ is the
[174.4s] shepherd and I welcome all of you today
[178.6s] and today our topic
[181.2s] is a
[183.3s] table from the shepherd a table from the
[191.9s] shepherd
[193.7s] and we can read from verse
[198.6s] one the Lord is my shepherd I shall not
[201.7s] want he makes me lie down in Green
[204.9s] Pastures he leads me beside the Still
[208.8s] Waters he restores my soul he leads me
[213.9s] in the path of righteousness for his
[217.6s] name sake yeah though I walk through the
[222.0s] valley of the shadow of death I will
[224.8s] fear no
[226.5s] evil for you are with me you are R and
[231.8s] your staff they confort
[234.5s] me verse
[236.5s] 5 you prepare a table before for me in
[240.9s] the presence of my
[243.1s] enemies you anoint my head with
[248.2s] oil my cup runs
[252.0s] over surely goodness and
[256.7s] mercy shall follow me all the days of my
[261.4s] life and I will dwell in the house of
[265.8s] the Lord
[267.9s] forever may God bless the
[270.7s] reading Psalm
[273.4s] 23 is written by it is noted to us that
[277.7s] it is written by King
[279.8s] David and just a few things that I may
[283.2s] want to let you know
[286.0s] also that King
[290.0s] David was a
[292.3s] Shepherd for a long time an experienced
[295.6s] one a skilled
[298.1s] Shepherd and very skilled poet he sung
[302.0s] many
[303.1s] songs and this man
[305.7s] was a king of
[308.2s] Israel and a king was known to be a
[311.6s] Shepherd now a king is making himself to
[315.4s] be a sheep and calling the Lord to be a
[323.5s] shepherd He reigned as a
[328.1s] king from
[329.8s] [Music]
[331.0s] the
[332.6s] year 1010 BC 1010 1,10 BC to the year
[340.7s] 970 BC that is 40 Years of
[344.5s] rain this song is a song of
[349.0s] experience a most likely he wrote this
[352.6s] King this this poem when he was a king
[357.6s] but the latter part of his King Kingdom
[360.7s] of his rulership so he has seen it all
[363.8s] he has seen how he has fought throughout
[366.8s] the time and realizes that all this
[370.9s] while it was the Lord that was leading
[373.8s] me through so the only thing that I can
[376.3s] equate god with is a
[379.2s] Shepherd so in this Psalm we have two
[383.4s] characters by the
[385.0s] way the
[387.2s] Lord and the
[390.4s] pist two characters from verse 1 to 3
[395.5s] the Lord who is the subject is a third
[399.5s] party he says he is my
[403.8s] shepherd third party third person but
[407.7s] when he comes to verse four he changes
[410.9s] when things get dark and the party
[414.0s] becomes the second
[416.3s] party though I walk through the valley
[419.8s] of the shadow of death I will fear no
[424.0s] evil for thou art with me now God is the
[430.1s] second person you are with me all the
[433.7s] challenges now he's directing to God I
[437.3s] will not fear because you are with
[441.3s] me this poem of experience is loved by
[445.8s] many because we may be conf
[450.3s] comfortable when you are a
[453.4s] sheep but you are
[457.3s] confident that even though you don't
[459.9s] know where the pasture is the shepherd
[463.9s] will
[465.1s] know even though you may not know how to
[469.4s] fight highers and
[472.5s] lions the shepherd will
[475.4s] know so he is saying even though things
[479.0s] may be difficult no problem thou art
[483.5s] with
[484.8s] me and I wanted also to tell you that in
[488.0s] this
[488.8s] Psalm there are two
[492.4s] metaphors
[495.1s] metaphors a metaphor I don't want to to
[499.3s] explain I may Define wrongly but you
[501.8s] will just get it from its
[504.2s] meaning one first metaphor is the Lord
[508.4s] is my shepherd equating the Lord with
[511.9s] the
[513.0s] shepherd and we dealt with that for the
[516.2s] last 3 days wday up to
[519.6s] yesterday the second metaphor
[523.5s] is is in verse five and
[527.2s] six
[529.4s] where the
[531.3s] pist is
[533.7s] bringing the host and his
[538.2s] guest the host and his guest that is the
[543.6s] second metaphor that we find in Psalm
[549.8s] 23 Psalm
[552.6s] 23 here David tells
[555.5s] us you prepare a table before
[560.0s] me in the presence of my
[565.4s] enemies
[567.6s] I love the way David is saying it he is
[572.2s] telling God that God after seeing
[576.2s] you I have seen how you do
[580.1s] things and one thing that I confirm to
[584.4s] you that you
[587.7s] decide you plan the term prepare means
[592.4s] that it is something plant the table is
[595.6s] Not an Accident
[598.1s] God has has planned for a table to be
[603.6s] set before the
[605.8s] guest so God has a plan for the table
[610.5s] and the psalmist is
[613.2s] saying my Lord I understand that you
[616.9s] have plans for me and therefore I
[622.1s] confirm that this table that is before
[624.4s] me it is not just out of the blue but it
[628.4s] is something that was destined to be
[631.5s] there so the table is specifically
[636.4s] prepared to be there
[640.1s] and on that table there was not just
[644.2s] things thrown here and
[645.9s] there things were arranged in order not
[650.2s] just few items of food that was placed
[653.5s] on it it was a
[656.2s] banquet Bounty things that were was on
[660.0s] the
[660.8s] table and the pist is seeing this and he
[665.0s] says that Lord when I look at the table
[668.1s] that you set before me you know for
[671.6s] someone to set a table before you it
[674.8s] means you are
[676.9s] honored you are
[679.2s] great this thing is planned for
[683.5s] you and
[685.7s] uh the ssist look at that and he glad
[691.0s] he's saying oh how is
[693.4s] Lord the Lord can come
[696.7s] and even when I am in the wilderness
[700.4s] where I am finding a lot of challenges
[704.2s] my Lord comes and prepares a table
[708.4s] before me even when there is no food he
[712.1s] comes to prepare a table before
[715.7s] me and
[718.0s] then it it seems to be overwhelming
[721.2s] thing to the sist but in the second
[724.8s] line it says in the
[728.6s] presence of my
[731.1s] enemies
[733.6s] meaning that the ship is not just very
[738.4s] free remember we were talking about the
[742.1s] Sheep being in a valley no way to cross
[745.6s] to this side and to this side and it is
[749.2s] deep in the night and it is blinding
[753.6s] Darkness but the Sheep must go through
[756.6s] the
[757.7s] darkness meaning there is a there are a
[760.8s] lot of
[762.1s] challenges there may be threats from
[766.4s] enemies wild
[768.7s] animals but the psalmist is saying I
[772.0s] will fear none of those threats because
[775.7s] you are with me I will not fear so here
[778.8s] is
[780.6s] saying even with the presence of the
[784.4s] challenges the
[786.2s] afflictions that the sheep of the Lord
[789.6s] go
[792.6s] through God will still set a table in
[797.1s] their
[798.4s] presence
[801.6s] now what I am bringing from this thing
[804.5s] is
[805.9s] this that
[810.1s] in this
[812.2s] place David might be facing a lot of
[815.6s] enemies who are fighting
[818.7s] him as a
[821.9s] king and he saying that even though I am
[826.2s] facing a lot of challenges people who
[828.8s] are fighting me people who are
[830.9s] challenging
[833.0s] me but God has not left me
[836.7s] alone he has not left me
[841.2s] alone he has planned a table before me
[846.0s] and it is a banquet something Bountiful
[848.8s] before
[850.1s] me and without any
[854.4s] fear the table is set in the presence of
[857.6s] the
[862.0s] enemies but they will not eat they will
[865.5s] not eat in a
[867.7s] hurry nothing nothing is done in a
[871.6s] hurry nothing is out of
[875.1s] place nothing is out of order nothing is
[880.5s] in a
[881.5s] mess why because the shepherd is in
[886.1s] control thy rod and thy
[889.5s] staff they confort me when I look at his
[893.4s] road and I know he's having a
[896.6s] staff I am comforted so this person can
[901.8s] set the
[903.7s] table and in the presence of the
[907.9s] enemies and without any fear we will not
[913.0s] even eat the food in
[915.3s] hurry we will take our time to eat by
[918.9s] the way I have never been a soldier but
[920.9s] I I tend to believe that Maybe soldiers
[924.1s] when they are camping not the normal
[926.2s] camps but when they are camping where
[928.0s] they are at
[930.0s] War
[932.4s] and
[935.0s] some they always carry some food and
[938.4s] they want to eat that food in the forest
[941.0s] where they hiding anytime ready for the
[944.0s] enemy to attack they would be eating in
[946.4s] a hurry eating in a
[948.1s] hurry but where my Lord provides the
[952.3s] table this banquet will never be eaten
[956.2s] in a
[957.3s] hurry we will be comfortable to eat the
[962.0s] banquet which the shepherd is
[967.3s] providing I always love this statement
[971.5s] in good
[973.0s] news so I can jump to good news and then
[976.3s] I come
[980.1s] back the one who read the them text read
[984.2s] good news and I loved
[986.1s] it it is saying
[989.4s] you prepare a banquet for
[993.6s] me where all my enemies can see
[998.1s] me you didn't
[1001.7s] hear you prepare a banquet for
[1006.0s] me I I don't understand well the banquet
[1009.2s] do you know what a banquet
[1010.8s] is do you understand what a banquet is
[1014.8s] something great something tasty variety
[1020.9s] he prepares a banquet before me but not
[1024.9s] just anywhere he makes sure that that
[1028.4s] thing is eaten where enemies can be able
[1032.0s] to see
[1035.4s] me and then he says you welcome me as an
[1041.4s] honored
[1042.8s] guest Christ is welcoming me to that
[1047.2s] table as an honored guest meaning that
[1052.4s] the Lord will make me a great guest in
[1055.6s] his holy
[1057.3s] presence
[1060.2s] therefore I am a great person before the
[1063.9s] Lord you are a great person before the
[1067.6s] Lord and the Lord wants to welcome you
[1071.5s] as an honored guest in his presence by
[1075.6s] the way do not look at your sins and
[1078.3s] despise
[1079.5s] yourself the shepherd wants you to come
[1082.7s] back to him that he may give you the
[1087.5s] best of welcome that he wants to give
[1090.4s] his guest he welcomes you as an honored
[1097.0s] guest you prepare a table before me in
[1100.3s] the presence of my
[1102.7s] enemies you anoint my head with oil
[1109.3s] and my cup
[1112.2s] runs
[1115.0s] over this sist is
[1118.1s] saying that
[1121.2s] uh oh
[1125.4s] Lord I have been going through
[1128.0s] challenges in
[1130.3s] life and I as I have been talking about
[1133.4s] this thing throughout the
[1135.0s] week
[1136.7s] I have been saying
[1139.6s] that each person in this world is going
[1143.2s] through a challenge that he cannot be
[1145.7s] able to help
[1148.2s] out challenges in this world are
[1153.2s] many challenges are many afflictions are
[1161.5s] countless no one is not having
[1166.1s] pain pain of sick
[1169.7s] nness pain of lack of
[1173.2s] money pain of lack of a good place of
[1177.4s] work pain of business that is
[1181.7s] not just picking
[1185.8s] up pain of a family that is crumbling
[1190.1s] down pain of a family that is having no
[1194.4s] peace the psalmist understand the pain
[1198.1s] of the Sheep
[1201.4s] and he realizes that no one can fix this
[1206.0s] pain except the
[1209.6s] shepherd and therefore that is the
[1212.1s] reason
[1213.7s] why David is
[1218.4s] saying amidst all the
[1221.8s] pain you will not leave
[1224.7s] me without something to eat you you set
[1229.3s] a table before
[1231.1s] me and that table you are setting before
[1236.4s] me it is a table that you have planned
[1239.8s] to give
[1240.8s] me even when I am surrounded with
[1245.1s] enemies even when I am surrounded with
[1248.8s] afflictions even when I am surrounded
[1252.5s] with threats that I can't avoid
[1259.0s] you always prepare something to confort
[1262.3s] me thy rod and thy staff they confort
[1267.5s] me so he's
[1269.8s] saying in that you make me the
[1274.1s] choicest you anoint me with oil meaning
[1277.4s] that you choose me you choose me you you
[1280.8s] make me the best of what you
[1283.9s] want and then not only that then you
[1287.4s] bless me
[1289.6s] my cup is
[1291.1s] filled not only filled but runs over
[1296.2s] amid all those challenges I only need to
[1299.3s] carry my cup so well so that the Lord
[1302.5s] may fill it with
[1304.6s] blessings and with those
[1307.4s] blessings they will run over by the way
[1311.0s] they will spill over to your friends
[1314.0s] your friends will be blessed because you
[1317.0s] have a shepherd
[1319.3s] who is filling your
[1321.8s] cup I want to refer you to a certain
[1325.1s] book then we come back to Psalm
[1327.4s] 23 but it is still Psalm
[1331.5s] 78 it is written by Assaf when you look
[1340.1s] at Psalm 78 we'll uh read a few verses
[1345.3s] starting from verse 12 but as we open
[1349.9s] I am inviting you to understand that
[1353.7s] when David is talking about Psalm 23
[1356.7s] something that could be in his mind is
[1359.9s] how how God took care of the children of
[1364.2s] Israel when they were coming from Egypt
[1367.7s] to the promised
[1369.1s] land the Lord took care of them as a
[1372.2s] Shepherd when they are in the
[1375.2s] wilderness and he took care of them
[1377.8s] until he settled them in
[1380.7s] Canaan and that is what Assaf is telling
[1384.0s] us in Psalm 78:1 12 is
[1388.0s] saying Psalm
[1389.9s] 78:2 is saying we will read a couple of
[1393.8s] verses
[1395.8s] there let's first read 12 and 13
[1398.5s] marvelous things he did in the
[1402.2s] sight of their
[1404.7s] fathers in the land of Egypt in the
[1408.6s] field of Zan he divided the sea and
[1412.8s] caused them to pass through and he made
[1415.8s] the water stand up like a
[1418.8s] heap we pause there the only thing that
[1421.4s] I wanted you to get from there is that
[1423.7s] the pist here is
[1425.3s] saying God did
[1428.8s] marvelous things in the sight of the
[1431.6s] children of
[1433.1s] Israel marvelous
[1435.7s] things in order for them to see that he
[1438.8s] is taking care of
[1441.0s] them marvelous things God have done God
[1445.6s] has done God has done marvelous things
[1449.0s] in your sight just for you to see that
[1452.7s] he can do Miracles and is a shepherd of
[1456.0s] your
[1457.6s] life sometimes you look at the darkness
[1460.8s] around you and you think the shepherd is
[1466.1s] away the same chapter
[1468.9s] 78:8 we jump and it says Psalm
[1474.2s] 78:8 and it says and they tested God in
[1478.9s] their heart by asking for food of their
[1484.5s] fancy they tested God in their
[1488.8s] hearts by asking for food of their fancy
[1493.2s] verse 19 and they spoke against God and
[1497.1s] they said come God prepare a table in
[1500.3s] the
[1503.8s] wilderness my
[1506.4s] understanding of this question that can
[1509.0s] God prepare a table in the
[1510.9s] wilderness is telling
[1513.5s] me if you have ever gone to dry places
[1517.4s] food is very
[1519.9s] scarce where there is a lot of
[1523.5s] scarcity can God be able to give
[1526.6s] something that is tangible
[1529.4s] can God be able to provide for our needs
[1532.5s] when we feel that there is no way
[1536.2s] out when we feel that there is no
[1541.2s] option they spoke against
[1544.5s] God testing God can he prepare food in
[1549.5s] the wilderness can he set a table in the
[1553.1s] wilderness our title of the sermon is
[1555.9s] saying a table from the
[1560.0s] shepherd can he prepare a table before
[1562.9s] me this
[1564.2s] time there is something I need and it is
[1567.8s] a distant
[1571.0s] far very far from my vision can I get
[1576.0s] such thing so they asking can he can God
[1580.1s] prepare a table in the wilderness then
[1583.0s] they say in verse 20 behold they struck
[1586.1s] the rock so that the waters crashed out
[1589.3s] and the streams
[1592.4s] overflowed
[1593.9s] but can he provide can he
[1598.0s] provide bread
[1601.4s] also can he provide meat for his
[1607.3s] people by the way God has given you some
[1610.4s] things but some are still
[1613.4s] lacking can he provide those
[1616.4s] also and those lacking
[1618.8s] seemingly might be very difficult to
[1622.1s] get can he provide that one
[1628.4s] also verse
[1632.2s] 23 verse
[1635.5s] 23 yet he had commanded the clouds above
[1640.6s] and opened the doors of
[1643.8s] Heaven had rained down mana on them to
[1648.2s] eat and given them the Bread of Heaven
[1653.8s] God decided to open the heavens he red
[1657.5s] down the
[1660.0s] Mana and he brought to them the Bread of
[1663.4s] Heaven so verse 25 in is saying he gave
[1667.7s] them Manner and that manner he gave them
[1670.9s] verse 25 is saying
[1673.6s] man ate Angels food
[1678.6s] by the way they despised the manner but
[1681.7s] the manner that they were
[1684.7s] despising was Angel's
[1687.2s] food man did
[1690.6s] eat Angel's
[1692.8s] food I love it
[1697.5s] when it is again said in Revelation
[1701.8s] Chapter 2 verse1 17 God is promising the
[1705.6s] people who will come to him
[1708.5s] that those who will
[1710.0s] come I will give them some of the Hidden
[1716.4s] manner I have hidden some for you those
[1720.9s] who will trust me those who will wait
[1724.2s] upon me I have hidden some of the manner
[1727.8s] for
[1728.5s] you God has set a table for us those who
[1732.8s] will overcome a table is set before us
[1736.7s] those who will overcome those who will
[1739.3s] believe I will give some of the Hidden
[1742.9s] manner that is revelation
[1749.8s] 2:17 Psalm 23 verse 5 and
[1755.9s] 6 you prepare a table before me in the
[1759.6s] presence of my
[1761.5s] enemies you anoint my head with
[1765.7s] oil my cup runs
[1769.2s] over the psalmist is saying in all this
[1774.8s] my Lord my shepherd wants me to lie down
[1780.0s] in Green
[1781.3s] Pastures he want me to have rest beside
[1786.3s] the Still
[1787.9s] Waters
[1789.5s] therefore he sets a table before
[1794.0s] me and he invites me
[1799.0s] as an honored
[1801.2s] guest that is what David has found
[1805.0s] out therefore he says in verse
[1808.5s] 6 that
[1811.3s] surely goodness and mercy shall follow
[1816.0s] me all the days of my
[1820.8s] life and I will dwell in the
[1826.0s] house of the Lord
[1829.6s] forever the beginning of that
[1832.2s] verse which is verse 6 David is
[1836.6s] saying
[1838.2s] surely goodness and
[1841.7s] mercy meaning
[1843.8s] that David has seen a lot
[1847.3s] of kind actions that God can
[1851.4s] do and then he adds another word
[1855.0s] goodness and mercy
[1858.4s] the term that is translated there as
[1864.0s] Mercy
[1866.2s] is a great Hebrew
[1868.8s] word a great Hebrew
[1872.3s] word uh it is a covenantal
[1876.4s] word covenantal
[1882.4s] word it is a word called H said H said
[1889.0s] I'm pronouncing H said h e s e
[1895.2s] d that powerful Hebrew word has
[1900.6s] no English
[1903.3s] equivalent by the way in my vernacular
[1906.2s] it has no equivalent still I don't know
[1909.1s] about yours surely it might not
[1915.0s] have this great Hebrew word
[1918.7s] is a word that means that God is having
[1922.1s] a deep love deep love that pushes him to
[1927.0s] do
[1930.3s] actions same time apart from
[1933.2s] love it is a kind of word that is
[1938.1s] talking about Good
[1940.6s] kindness great kindness that we cannot
[1943.7s] be able to
[1945.6s] express and
[1948.1s] of
[1949.9s] mercy so it has many facets that we may
[1954.5s] not have just in one word most
[1957.7s] translators in the Bible have translated
[1961.4s] it as loving
[1964.1s] kindness unfailing
[1966.8s] love
[1969.2s] mercy and they look at what might what
[1973.2s] the speaker might be referring to and
[1976.2s] then they they will translate give an
[1980.2s] English word that they think would be
[1982.5s] equivalent to what the speaker is having
[1984.2s] in mind because there's no one word that
[1986.7s] we can use to translate this covenantal
[1995.9s] word when you talk about a covenantal
[1998.9s] word it means a word that is bringing a
[2004.0s] relationship between God and his people
[2008.8s] that God is making a covenant with his
[2013.2s] children amidst all the challenges God
[2016.6s] has taken you as his child he will do
[2020.1s] his goodness he will provide his Mercy
[2023.6s] he will take you out of your sins and he
[2026.8s] would want to set a table before you on
[2029.9s] Earth and not a table before you on
[2032.7s] Earth
[2033.8s] only but even a table before you in the
[2038.3s] Heavenly
[2040.7s] Realms so he
[2043.4s] saying
[2045.9s] when a meal is
[2051.7s] prepared this
[2054.1s] meal when somebody invites you to a
[2059.2s] table it means that there is a mutual
[2063.2s] understanding you want to
[2066.6s] have and and this Mutual loyalty can
[2070.6s] grow up to be a covenant between you so
[2074.4s] the Lord is inviting me for a covenant
[2077.3s] with him that I may have a covenant with
[2080.3s] him no wonder David is saying the old
[2083.4s] thing that I have seen the old picture
[2085.7s] that I have seen surely goodness and
[2088.6s] mercy shall follow me all the days of my
[2092.2s] life it is a covenant that he has made
[2095.0s] with me he will take care of me he will
[2098.5s] protect me all the days of my life
[2102.4s] enemies will be around me afflictions
[2105.4s] will be with me but my
[2110.3s] shepherd will surround me all the days
[2114.7s] of my
[2115.9s] life sometimes I will feel that there
[2118.3s] are a lot of
[2119.7s] challenges but I will not be afraid for
[2124.5s] he is with
[2126.4s] me the greatest thing is his holy
[2129.7s] presence he will be with me so David is
[2133.2s] saying surely goodness and mercy shall
[2137.1s] follow me all the days of my life not
[2140.9s] some days all the days of my life but do
[2145.2s] you know those who believe in Christ
[2148.4s] will never
[2149.8s] die is what I'm saying biblical those
[2153.4s] who believe in Christ will never die
[2158.3s] in another part he said even
[2162.1s] though they
[2163.9s] die I will rest them up so surely
[2168.4s] goodness and mercy shall follow me all
[2172.3s] the days of my life and I will dwell in
[2176.8s] the house of the Lord forever
[2184.2s] meaning that
[2188.5s] Ellen White sees a vision her first
[2193.2s] Vision you can get this in early
[2196.0s] writings her first
[2198.8s] vision and
[2203.0s] uh he sees the picture of
[2206.8s] heaven and a welcome that is
[2210.8s] given to the
[2212.9s] Saints when we Ascend on high
[2218.5s] and
[2220.6s] Adam stand before all of us taller than
[2224.3s] all of
[2226.2s] us and he's going to meet our
[2229.6s] savior our savior is taller than
[2233.0s] Adam then the Savior opens his arms that
[2237.7s] he may be able to come and fall onto his
[2241.2s] bosom but Adam can never fall on the
[2244.4s] bosom of the savior he seeing that what
[2246.9s] he did to humanity is very bad so he
[2249.5s] falls on his knees before the savior he
[2253.0s] falls at the knees of the Savior then
[2256.2s] our savior grasp him up and welcomes him
[2260.4s] and tells him welcome to the home of the
[2264.3s] saved then he takes him round round to
[2268.0s] look at all the fruits that he missed
[2272.5s] from the Garden of Eden when he was he
[2275.1s] was burnished out
[2278.0s] then he welcomes us to a silvery
[2282.8s] table the table was very
[2287.0s] extensive very
[2288.9s] long having all types of fruits on it a
[2294.8s] table that our Shepherd has
[2298.7s] prepared before us and he welcomes us
[2303.8s] and tells us eat
[2308.9s] the Covenant that he has made with us
[2312.4s] and when I look at that it reminds me to
[2317.4s] what Christ said to his disciples at the
[2321.5s] Last Supper after the last Last Supper
[2325.6s] he tells the
[2329.2s] disciples what did he say he
[2332.7s] said I will never drink from the fruit
[2337.5s] fruit of this Vine again till we drink
[2342.4s] it a
[2343.5s] new in the Kingdom of
[2346.4s] Heaven God is planning to bring good
[2350.1s] things to the life of his
[2352.5s] children he is a Shepherd who doesn't
[2355.2s] want any of
[2357.0s] us to be left
[2359.7s] out accept the Salvation from the
[2365.3s] savior Christ is the
[2369.2s] shepherd all other Shepherds may try
[2372.5s] their best but they are false
[2375.2s] Shepherds Christ is the chap
[2378.4s] Shepherd I welcome you to thank the Lord
[2382.0s] for whatever thing he has ever done in
[2384.4s] your
[2385.4s] life we are finishing this
[2388.2s] year and you might have been complaining
[2391.2s] about Darkness
[2393.7s] Darkness each and every
