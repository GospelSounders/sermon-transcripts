If seven is sed where they must have a what? We must say the Bible the testimony says that we should or we must so we are at a point where we need to put this into practical that we must have as educated by the way when I was beginning my class that somebody who doesn't want to go to school I I'll be the first person to take him to the We are told that succeed where we must have gain principles which in develop the peace and network together is totally different from the popular education school different from this Now all these things are there for examples they are positioning the so we must have schools I was that was studies on Christian education you guys get that book I think it is page seven is most difficult right this is not a discouragement I have to understand this quotation This one is found that is difficult to practice what right.

No one is going to be forced to make. Hallelujah. compared to the last days in that as the strongest are like one by the truth by the truth will enter are the forms of that food with them soon. Hallelujah. We need to have we need to have a will to establish what schools I'll be playing with parents by the end of this presentation today because if going to be then we are going to establish our schools. So maybe with a but doesn't mean you see people being in that system will get the likes of they will be putting they will be changing the history but it does not mean air truth together too long have the customs and habits the longer will now have every idea that is false put away from teachers and the students now this one [Music] 28 28 God's purpose in giving the message to the world is to prepare people to stand true to him during the [Applause] Christ is doing Christ is doing that that mean our schools our [Applause] identific I'm interested on all these things but my point of interest so much is that we must have one schools do it together we must own schools so look at that every home should be hallelujah every I'm giving the solutions to education I'm giving the solutions to what education you need to [Music] understand realizing here that everyone from a church. Hallelujah. Do you know that the family is the basic unit of Hallelujah? The family are the same things that will be transformed by the church. Amen. Because church is made up. Let me use my mouth now. these things out. We are told that the family is the basic unit because the church is made of family. Are we together? The church is made of families. The is made of what? So every home should be a church. Now get that. That every in the home life should be a church. A beautiful symbol of the church of God in her in heaven. If parents realized their responsibility to their children, they will not under any circumstance circumstance go and pray at the at them. If parents are going to realize their what kinds are going to responsibility and I know somebody will be asking this people who are rejected by their parents solution. Amen. But parents who are living who has a knowledge of the message need to understand their what the responsibility. So we are told that every home should be a what? A judge. Next slide says for each church. Hallelujah. Every home should be a what? A church. For each what? Church. Now get the quote. The quotation says in all our churches and wherever there's a company of believers. Hallelujah. You see this this thing is narrowing down to personal responsibility part. Amen. Because if every home should be a a church and then if for each church in all our churches and wherever there's a company of what believer church school should be established man I wanted to bring it to a personal responsibility so that church members need to understand that the work of establishing a school begins with you personal know there's a problem today with the church that church members I don't know who they're waiting for I don't know they waiting for the leaders of organization I don't know who they are reaching for they cannot take it at personal what capacity that is why you cannot establish schools now the ones that have been established are paying because people does not take personal what capacity you realize that somebody will take a child but doesn't care anything but the child systemation is able to sacrifice everything and take money to that place so this thing should narrow down to a personal what responsibility Hallelujah. That in all our churches and wherever there is a company of believers, a church school should be established. And I know that there are challenges. Amen. For you to do this, you will require more courage and what? Unpaid. Amen. I know there are challenges even in this last days. I know how the government will be striving so much hard to interfere with this. But that does not make this truth and an air. Are we together? Challenges should not make sugar and and those people should be taught in the last days to know how to shape challenges and shape challenges to shape them. Amen. Are we together? So we are told that a church school should be established and this schools there should be teachers with the true missionary what spirit for the children are to be trained to become missionaries. It is essential that the teachers be educated to act their part instructing children of Sabbath keepers not only in the sciences but in the script scriptures. These schools established in different what localities. Hallelujah. Schools should be established in different localities. We need to have a school in next to this place. We have a school in Kisum. We have a school in Nan. We have a school in they should be established in different what localities and we are told that too this school localities and conducted by godbearing men and we women. Hallelujah. I am showing the qualifications of a teacher as the case demands should be upon the same principles as for the schools of the pro prophets. Hallelujah. Did you see the kind of knowledge that was from the school of prophets? It was a wisdom that exited the universities of United States. So if both people are going to have more courage and what fail then we are going to establish a schools where children will be given a wisdom that exist of the what the land are we together. It is only that people lack courage and what fame. Amen. Even with presenting this today, I laid if you going to pray for it. Amen. And I know most people are praying God will give them what they want. They want if they enter into reforms with what with heart, soul and we we are we together. this reform if you are still entertaining your word your decision and regret regretting but we need to pray that God may give us a humble what spirit and a heart and a will that will help us establish this re reforms so we are told that I say again establish that Establish schools for the children. Whenever there are churches where there are those who assembled to worship God, let there be what? Schools for the children. Hallelujah. Whenever there people who are assembled to do what? Hallelujah. Amen. Today we have churches people are assembling for worship but they cannot work on the young. The young will only meet somebody on a supper during the classes of lessons. Are you together? By the way, we are not going to help but we can we can be talking about movement but we know that uh what is the result of false? Yeah. recruits of false what is false education says to get at the root of the matter the young is separated as from popular education as the old is separated from false I'll read that on Friday it is in 081 that will make my lesson on Friday so I say again establish schools for the children wherever there are churches where there are those who assembled to worship let there be schools for their children. Work as if you were waking for your life to save children from being drowned in the polluting corrupting influence of their life. Are we together? If people would be encouraged, if people would be encouraged, the church in which they are members and establish small humble school buildings in which to do service for God, they will accommodate their own what? Children within their borders. Are we together? I'm reading this and somebody saying, "Is this possible?" Hallelujah. It is possible because God has said, "Amen." Yeah, that is possible because God has said, "Do you think God can give us such and God doesn't give us a solution?" Do you think this reform God will leave us just to No, it's only because we have not taken a step a step. That is why we have problems in the church. I know and I'm sure that when we shall enter upon this reforms with a willing heart, God will stand for us. Are we together? So we are told that if not more than six children. So look at that in localities where there's a church a school should be established. If there are no more no more than six children to attend, a teacher should be employed. Which should be employed? who will educate the children in the truths of the word of God which are so essential for this last word last days and which it is so important for them to do what to understand a great test is to doing what is coming it will be upon obedience or disobedience to the commandments of God so decision must be made a decision must be made now look at this that is that was churches Where the deceiver in churches we can have what schools but look at this also this one can also be done several churches unite unite. Hallelujah. Several churches to do what? Unite wherever there are few Sabbath schools you know I know in this information movements we are still beginning that is a church where people meet three are together three of them. So we are told that whenever they refuse what schools let the parents let who parents unite together in providing a place for de school where the children of various peoples can come together together. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Amen. And I know I will be asking a class question. this one I also need help but when we establish schools when we establish these schools I will be able to I'll answer I'll ask that question to the class because I need also help so these parents should come together and I know that even when somebody was yesterday because of the the message they are what we call the parents of the faith okay and therefore God has blessed you know that you have many children. Amen. Parents who are here parents by hand get to understand that you don't so many I'll be your first look at this. So we are told let them employ a Christian teacher who was a concentrated missionary who who as a concentrated missionary shall educate the children in such a way to get them to become missionaries themselves. Why? When it is the day for the night, what when no man can do what? We should have private schools in different localities to prepare our youth for our high what? Schools. Are we together? We should have what? Private schools. That is where my question comes. I have I've been struggling to know how this private school can be done. I'm going to ask that question to the class. Prepare an answer. We should private schools. Amen. I'm going very fast. Some we left out and this private schools the following are puppets to be studied schools because we say this look at this look at this that textbooks teachers method and break principles principles but God has given us everything everything is is in in is in his word is why amen. So after schools have been established teachers should be pro provided. Therefore the following should be established the following should be studied. I want somebody will be helping me reading this quotation. I don't know if you can open this open the place of Bible the place of Bible you can be in 124. I know you are wondering because I know your problem. you have a problem with your laptop but you can help help me read uh complaint 124 begin from page seven I'll be reading the following so one of the things this is the syllabus to be given in the true education school are we together the first is theible the bible paragraph one paragraph 7 it's page seven paragraph one or if it is not page seven paragraph one you just go there and see where the Bible is written as a course of studying. Then you read you will be reading few statements to explain because time my time is also running so much. Are you there? Number one. Number one it says it says what shall we teach? What shall we teach? What? Uh, homeschool. Home school. The BI uh number one. Number one, the Bible. The Bible. The Bible should be the child first textbook. The Bible should be the child's first textbook. From this book. From this book, parents are to give instruction. I want to get something. So, the first thing is the Bible. Just copy this and be explaining the following bhani that is al another course of study I'm going to explain while reading simple arithmetic accounting hallelujah simple arithmetic what accounting children needs to know simple arithmetical accounting nature physiology nature physiology history stroke prophecy history stroke prophecy the law the law children must be taught the law the law I'm going to explain that cooker children must know to cook amen same anatomy and physiology children must understand anatomy as what physiology physical geography physical geography hygiene must be music. I'm waiting for the phone. Somebody was telling me this phone. You need your phone. Not mine. Good. Let us see. Music literature. And in literature there's spelling, reading, and writing. And that one will deal with language. Those ones must directly just say it. I find it crazy. It is go to place of Bible education just go to what should be stud the schools and they're just lying there. We shall be reading each one the few steps we explain because even these things are also some of them are studied in popular education but you see this how we need to explain them to people so that people get to understand what they shall be teaching their children should also be taught missionary work should also be will tell you that in this school compound there should be a war. There should be a what? Amen. Where children learn to produce their own what? Hallelujah. So that that form parts of their that form parts part of their lessons. Let me read this to explain the glory. Interesting. So listen to this. I'm reading pamplet 124 page 15 paragraph 3 says the following words 124 page 15 paragraph 3 says this one I have to read no line of manual training is of more value than agriculture agriculture let the teacher call attention to what the Bible says about agriculture the study of let not only theory but what practical I return to simple methods I return to simple methods efforts will be appreciated by the children and you work in the garden and fail will be agree will be agreeable change from the way some routine of the abstract what lessons are we together after the lessons about even was teaching history and prophecy what she take next is now agree agriculture to hell that when people in class they need to relax Are you so compound there should be a hallelujah? Those who desiring to establish schools need to understand this. Every school compound must be a physiology should also be taught. I don't want to read all these things. I plan to read them and I plan to read something in the place of the Bible education but my time is running so much. I don't but I want us to see this 15 minutes. You know people ask questions let me read this the following I'm reading only this part of teachers then because my time is up others also somewhere I don't want to be somebody's time my last class I'll be able to analyze everything so we are told that I'm not now talking about teachers we have seen the topics to be studied in education we have seen that the schools must be established and we've seen the solution how to establish schools parents must have personal responsibility. If there are few school members somewhere, they can unite with others to establish a what? School. And I know it is possible because God has saved. Amen. So it has been the custom to encourage them. It has been the custom to encourage sending children to school when they were more babies needing a mother a mother's. Amen. That is what is happening today. Parents should be they all be teachers of their children until they have reached age what? 10 years 10 years. So first responsibility until 8 or 10 years. Do not send your little ones away to school to a mother should be careful how she trusts the modeling of the infant mind to other hands. Hallelujah. By the way, the mother has a great responsibility in teaching the child more than the the father. The father also has a great responsibility. But the mother's responsibilities have high. Do you know that is very very easy for a character to be transmitted from the mother to the child more than the are the angel went to who? Samson's mother. and is attracted how Samsung was to be educated. So the mothers mothers have a great responsibility. So parents ought to be the best teachers of their children until they have reached 8 or 10 years of age. So who's the best teacher to the child at younger age? Both best parents best but mother will have great responsibility. Okay. Okay. Let let me read this. Let me read this. But both of them has a great responsibility. Parents ought to be the best teachers of their children until they have reached 8 or 10 years of age. Their school room should be what? Open air and the flowers and back. Talk to me. Just talk to me. What is their school room? Somebody just read that aloud. What is their school room? Open air ams the treasures of nature. So we are told about something here. I'm coming back to that. But let me see the qualifications of teachers who are teach children in our schools. We are not a special talent be given to the education of the youth. The principles and habits of the teacher should be considered of greater importance than even is literally qualifications. What should be considered in a teacher? The principles and hies of the teachers. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. If you are going to establish a school, the first thing to look in the principles and not just teachers because they are teachers manipulation and knowledge in science to instruct. One may have what? sufficient educ education and knowledge in science to do what? To instruct but has it been orained that has tact and wisdom to deal with the human what might mind. Are we together? Those are qualifications. Those who are deciding to establish schools kindly write this. Let none feel that let none feel that having an ear honestness in religious matters is all that is essential in order to become when they need no less of piety. They also need a par knowledge of what? Science. Amen. So a knowledge of science must be the teachers must have and their habits and character must also be the good. They should also qualify to be dealing with minds. Amen. And in this last days we need wise teachers because people have so long been poverted by the educational system. If somebody comes self the teacher cannot deal with the mind you will be having a problem in that school that school and I know the problem I know that there people in teaching this God has placed them here. It is only that you have not recognized them or those abilities belong to somewhere else. The good news of God needs teachers who have a high moral qualities and can be trusted with education of others. Men who are of who are sound in the in the faith and have attacked and patient who walk with God and abstain from every appearance of what? Hallelujah. And abain from every appearance of what? If you take a teacher who cannot abstain from every appearance of you will have a problem in that school. Hallelujah. Amen. Amen. So teachers who must go to those schools must be a people who can be able to abstain from every appearance of all. I hope you are getting me. Who stand so closely connected with God and they can be channels of light in Christian world. Gentlemen, we cannot in this day apparel accept teachers because they have been in school two 3 4 by 4. Yes. Yes. The question we should decide whether they are qualified for their work should should be have they with all their acquisition acquisition of knowledge. sat and d beneath the serpent of the true truth as foren what treasure treasure are they partakers of the fruit of the tree of what life amen those are the qualification of teachers so I'm coming to the end of this because I have 10 minutes let me read this let me read this let me read this mix what means seventh day adventist Have plenty of what? Money. That is why it it is possible to establish a what? A school. Hallelujah. We have money. Amen. How many are seventh elementist? We have money. Hallelujah. You can deny that you don't have money. Amen. Seventh element have plenty of what? Money. But it does not belong to the what? Here's the problem. We have money but that money doesn't belong in the world. That is why we don't one school as we speak. But we have what? Money establish. We have money that can run gigs. But that money doesn't belong to the king. This is the trouble. There is a number among what they advent to give an impetus to this message to reach the one in the rest of this world generation. If only that money can belong to the church. There are enough possibilities. Amen. Amen. If we need text books, there are enough. Amen. If we need teachers, Hallelujah. There are enough talents. Amen. They are teachers. Even in this meeting, they are teachers who qualify teachers. There are enough village. All the supplies that are ever needed and all ever shall be needed. If only those faculties, those talents, those if only those facilities, this talent, those faculties shall belong to the what? The church. Hallelujah. This is where it's a problem. And I know as people will be looking, do you know today we have problem asking where this is the way for what? You have money but that your money doesn't belong to the church. The church. Hallelujah. We are taking money somewhere else. Amen. And we are told it is a question one day. If my money belongs to the what? The world. Do I belong to the the I was to meet those conditions but my time is up. If my talines my abilities are put into the work of the world as of the world and not into the work of the church as of the church then the question is worth considering. Do I belong to the church myself? Hallelujah. I want to stop that point. The reason why the church is failing to enter the reason why we still have way forward. We teach this truth and people are going this way is that we have plenty of money. We have plenty of means. We have abilities and we have talents. teachers I see a teacher looking at the world the world not to the Jones will ask you that if you are satisfied in the world you belong to the I know it is it is possible to end to do everything that the Lord is calling us to do what to do but only if we are going to belong to the church the church and parents If we are going to commit that our mind to the church then all these things we shall be able to do what? May God help us. Amen. May God help us to be church members in Jesus name. Amen. Allow me pray then I give time for questions. We thank you dear father in heaven for the solutions and everything are clearly defined in your word. The reason why this church has failed is that all the talents and abilities and faculties that are needed to establish suits today we have plenty of them but they belong the world. Dear Lord in heaven is our prayer. I know there's one parent in this meeting who is desiring to disconnect herself or himself with the world and to be a church man. Lord in heaven as you are helping your people by the end of this meeting. Help the parents in this congregation to be church members so that we might have enough facilities for this church to establish schools and run them. Help us dear Lord in heaven to make us there and help us to be your children. Forgive us for our wrongdoing and help us and walk with us in every step of life. This is my prayer by faith in the precious name of Jesus Christ. Amen. Uh I want I want to take very few questions. Let me assure you that we are going to use the time we are going to dedicate to Christians before the end of this meeting because I know when people waste time out somebody should be ending this should be ending

[1315.9s] will get the likes of they will be
[1319.4s] putting they will be changing the
[1321.4s] history but it does not mean air
[1327.9s] truth together too long have the customs
[1331.6s] and habits the longer will now have
[1335.8s] every idea that is false put away from
[1339.4s] teachers and the
[1342.3s] students now this one
[1345.3s] [Music]
[1347.2s] 28
[1349.6s] 28 God's purpose in giving the message
[1353.1s] to the world is to prepare people to
[1355.8s] stand true to him during the
[1360.2s] [Applause]
[1362.0s] Christ is
[1363.5s] doing Christ is
[1370.4s] doing that
[1379.8s] that
[1383.7s] mean our schools our
[1394.2s] [Applause]
[1396.0s] identific I'm interested on all these
[1398.6s] things but my point of interest so much
[1401.0s] is that we must have one schools do it
[1404.6s] together we
[1406.4s] must own schools so look at that every
[1410.3s] home should
[1411.5s] be hallelujah
[1414.5s] every I'm giving the solutions to
[1416.8s] education
[1418.5s] I'm giving the solutions to what
[1420.6s] education you need to
[1425.5s] [Music]
[1429.0s] understand
[1444.4s] realizing here that everyone
[1447.8s] from a church. Hallelujah. Do you know
[1452.9s] that the family is the basic unit
[1456.0s] of
[1459.1s] Hallelujah? The family are the same
[1461.4s] things that will be transformed by the
[1463.9s] church.
[1466.0s] Amen. Because church is made
[1470.4s] up. Let me use my mouth now. these
[1473.2s] things out. We are told that the family
[1477.4s] is the basic unit because the church is
[1479.9s] made of family. Are we together? The
[1482.6s] church is made of families. The is made
[1485.6s] of what? So every home should be a
[1489.0s] church. Now get that. That every in the
[1492.6s] home life should be a church. A
[1495.7s] beautiful symbol of the church of God in
[1498.7s] her in heaven. If parents realized their
[1502.4s] responsibility to their children, they
[1504.6s] will not under any
[1506.9s] circumstance circumstance go and pray at
[1510.6s] the at them. If parents are going to
[1513.0s] realize their
[1514.6s] what
[1516.4s] kinds are going to responsibility and I
[1520.9s] know somebody will be
[1522.5s] asking
[1524.1s] this people who are rejected by their
[1527.1s] parents solution. Amen.
[1529.9s] But parents who are living who has a
[1532.7s] knowledge of the message need to
[1534.7s] understand their what the
[1535.8s] responsibility. So we are told that
[1537.4s] every home should be a what? A judge.
[1541.5s] Next slide says for each
[1544.0s] church. Hallelujah. Every home should be
[1547.6s] a what? A church. For each what? Church.
[1551.8s] Now get the quote. The quotation says in
[1554.3s] all our churches and wherever there's a
[1556.5s] company of believers.
[1559.0s] Hallelujah. You see this this thing is
[1561.2s] narrowing down to personal
[1562.8s] responsibility part. Amen. Because if
[1565.4s] every home should be a a church and then
[1568.6s] if for each church in all our churches
[1570.6s] and wherever there's a company of what
[1572.6s] believer church school should be
[1575.8s] established man I wanted to bring it to
[1578.7s] a personal responsibility so that church
[1581.3s] members need to understand that the work
[1583.6s] of establishing a school begins with you
[1587.1s] personal know there's a problem today
[1589.0s] with the church that church members I
[1590.9s] don't know who they're waiting for I
[1592.9s] don't know they waiting for the leaders
[1594.2s] of organization I don't know who they
[1596.2s] are reaching for they cannot take it at
[1598.2s] personal what capacity that is why you
[1600.8s] cannot establish schools now the ones
[1603.4s] that have been established are paying
[1605.8s] because people does not take personal
[1607.8s] what capacity you realize that somebody
[1610.2s] will take a child but doesn't care
[1614.0s] anything but the child systemation is
[1617.4s] able to sacrifice everything and take
[1619.1s] money to that place so this thing should
[1621.6s] narrow down to a personal what
[1623.7s] responsibility
[1624.7s] Hallelujah. That in all our churches and
[1628.3s] wherever there is a company of
[1629.7s] believers, a church school should be
[1632.5s] established. And I know that there are
[1635.5s] challenges. Amen. For you to do this,
[1637.6s] you will require more courage and what?
[1639.4s] Unpaid. Amen. I know there are
[1641.8s] challenges even in this last days. I
[1643.4s] know how the government will be striving
[1645.1s] so much hard to interfere with this. But
[1647.3s] that does not make this truth and an
[1651.0s] air. Are we together? Challenges should
[1653.1s] not make sugar and and those people
[1655.8s] should be taught in the last days to
[1657.4s] know how to shape challenges and shape
[1660.1s] challenges to shape them. Amen. Are we
[1662.4s] together? So we are told that a church
[1664.4s] school should be established and this
[1666.2s] schools there should be teachers with
[1669.4s] the true missionary what spirit for the
[1672.3s] children are to be trained to become
[1674.6s] missionaries. It is essential that the
[1676.9s] teachers be educated to act their part
[1679.4s] instructing children of Sabbath keepers
[1682.0s] not only in the sciences but in the
[1685.0s] script scriptures. These schools
[1688.3s] established in different what
[1690.5s] localities. Hallelujah. Schools should
[1693.3s] be established in different localities.
[1695.9s] We need to have a school in next to this
[1698.5s] place. We have a school in Kisum. We
[1700.5s] have a school in Nan. We have a school
[1702.4s] in they should be established in
[1704.2s] different what localities and we are
[1707.2s] told that
[1708.8s] too this school localities and conducted
[1712.8s] by godbearing men and we women.
[1715.4s] Hallelujah. I am showing the
[1717.1s] qualifications of a
[1719.7s] teacher as the case demands should be
[1723.7s] upon the same principles as for the
[1725.8s] schools of the pro prophets. Hallelujah.
[1728.8s] Did you see the kind of knowledge that
[1730.4s] was from the school of prophets? It was
[1732.5s] a wisdom that exited the universities of
[1735.6s] United States. So if both people are
[1738.2s] going to have more courage and what fail
[1741.3s] then we are going to establish a schools
[1743.4s] where children will be given a wisdom
[1745.6s] that exist of the what the land are we
[1749.1s] together. It is only that people lack
[1751.3s] courage and what fame. Amen. Even with
[1755.0s] presenting this today, I
[1757.6s] laid if you going to pray for it. Amen.
[1762.2s] And I know most people are praying God
[1764.6s] will give them what they want. They want
[1767.0s] if they enter into reforms with
[1769.5s] what with heart, soul and we we are we
[1774.4s] together. this
[1778.4s] reform if you are still
[1789.3s] entertaining your word your decision and
[1791.8s] regret regretting but we need to pray
[1794.1s] that God may give us a humble what
[1796.1s] spirit and a heart and a will that will
[1798.2s] help us establish this re reforms so we
[1801.2s] are told that I say again establish that
[1804.6s] Establish schools for the children.
[1807.3s] Whenever there are churches where there
[1810.6s] are those who assembled to worship God,
[1812.8s] let there be what? Schools for
[1815.6s] the children. Hallelujah. Whenever there
[1820.0s] people who are assembled to do what?
[1823.0s] Hallelujah. Amen. Today we have churches
[1825.1s] people are assembling for worship but
[1826.5s] they cannot work on the young. The young
[1828.7s] will only meet somebody on a supper
[1832.0s] during the classes of
[1833.7s] lessons. Are you together? By the way,
[1836.7s] we are not going to help but we can we
[1839.9s] can be talking about movement but we
[1843.1s] know that
[1845.0s] uh what is the result of false?
[1852.9s] Yeah.
[1854.1s] recruits of false what is false
[1858.5s] education says to get at the root of the
[1861.4s] matter the young is separated as from
[1864.9s] popular education as the old is
[1866.9s] separated from
[1869.0s] false I'll read that on Friday it is in
[1872.2s] 081 that will make my lesson on Friday
[1874.7s] so I say again establish schools for the
[1876.7s] children wherever there are churches
[1879.1s] where there are those who assembled to
[1881.3s] worship let there be schools for their
[1883.4s] children. Work as if you were waking for
[1885.8s] your life to save children from being
[1888.5s] drowned in the polluting
[1891.2s] corrupting influence of their life. Are
[1894.2s] we together? If people would be
[1896.4s] encouraged, if people would be
[1898.4s] encouraged, the church in which they are
[1900.8s] members and establish small humble
[1903.3s] school buildings in which to do service
[1905.9s] for God, they will accommodate their own
[1908.3s] what? Children within their borders. Are
[1912.0s] we together? I'm reading this and
[1914.1s] somebody saying, "Is this
[1915.8s] possible?" Hallelujah. It is possible
[1918.6s] because God has said, "Amen." Yeah, that
[1923.0s] is possible because God has said, "Do
[1925.8s] you think God can give us such and God
[1928.3s] doesn't give us a solution?" Do you
[1930.5s] think this reform God will leave us just
[1933.5s] to No, it's only because we have not
[1936.2s] taken a step a step. That is why we have
[1938.4s] problems in the church. I know and I'm
[1941.6s] sure that when we shall enter upon this
[1943.8s] reforms with a willing heart, God will
[1946.9s] stand for us. Are we together? So we are
[1950.1s] told that if not more than six children.
[1952.3s] So look at
[1953.6s] that in localities where there's a
[1957.0s] church a school should be established.
[1959.7s] If there are no more no more than six
[1963.1s] children to attend, a teacher should be
[1967.4s] employed. Which should be employed? who
[1970.4s] will educate the children in the truths
[1972.4s] of the word of God which are so
[1975.0s] essential for this last word last days
[1977.8s] and which it is so important for them to
[1980.0s] do what to understand a great test is to
[1982.9s] doing what is coming it will be upon
[1985.8s] obedience or disobedience to the
[1988.6s] commandments of
[1989.7s] God so decision must be
[1992.4s] made a decision must be made now look at
[1996.5s] this that is that was churches Where the
[1999.9s] deceiver in churches we can have what
[2003.4s] schools but look at this also this one
[2006.0s] can also be done several churches unite
[2009.1s] unite. Hallelujah. Several churches to
[2011.8s] do what? Unite wherever there are few
[2015.0s] Sabbath schools you know I know in this
[2017.5s] information movements we are still
[2019.5s] beginning that is a church where people
[2022.2s] meet three are together three of them.
[2025.2s] So we are told that whenever they refuse
[2027.8s] what schools let the parents let who
[2032.9s] parents unite together in providing a
[2035.8s] place for
[2037.4s] de school where the children of various
[2040.5s] peoples can come together together.
[2043.0s] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Amen. And I know
[2045.9s] I will be asking a class question. this
[2047.8s] one I also need help but when we
[2049.7s] establish schools when we establish
[2051.7s] these schools I will be able to I'll
[2053.8s] answer I'll ask that question to the
[2055.4s] class because I need also help so these
[2058.7s] parents should come
[2060.3s] together and I know that even when
[2064.3s] somebody was
[2067.1s] yesterday because of the the message
[2071.0s] they are what we call the parents of the
[2073.7s] faith okay and therefore God has blessed
[2076.7s] you
[2079.7s] know that you have many children. Amen.
[2082.3s] Parents who are
[2088.0s] here parents by
[2091.6s] hand get to understand that you
[2096.4s] don't so many I'll be your
[2100.2s] first look at this. So we are told let
[2103.3s] them employ a Christian teacher who was
[2106.9s] a
[2108.0s] concentrated
[2109.6s] missionary who who as a concentrated
[2112.3s] missionary shall educate the children in
[2115.0s] such a way to get them to become
[2117.2s] missionaries themselves. Why? When it is
[2120.6s] the day for the night, what when no man
[2124.4s] can do what? We should have private
[2127.5s] schools in different localities to
[2130.6s] prepare our youth for our high what?
[2134.2s] Schools. Are we together? We should have
[2137.0s] what? Private schools. That is where my
[2139.8s] question comes. I have I've been
[2142.3s] struggling to know how this private
[2144.5s] school can be done. I'm going to ask
[2146.4s] that question to the class. Prepare an
[2148.1s] answer. We should private schools. Amen.
[2152.2s] I'm going very fast. Some we left out
[2154.7s] and this private schools the following
[2157.4s] are puppets to be
[2159.3s] studied
[2161.7s] schools because we say this look at this
[2165.7s] look at this that
[2173.7s] textbooks teachers method and break
[2176.7s] principles principles but God has given
[2179.0s] us everything everything is is in in is
[2181.8s] in his word
[2183.5s] is why amen. So after schools have been
[2186.3s] established teachers should be pro
[2188.5s] provided. Therefore the following should
[2191.0s] be established the following should be
[2193.3s] studied. I want somebody will be helping

[2563.4s] this. Every school compound must be a
[2567.4s] physiology should also be
[2569.6s] taught. I don't want to read all these
[2571.7s] things. I plan to read them and I plan
[2573.9s] to read something in the place of the
[2575.3s] Bible education but my time is running
[2576.9s] so much. I
[2578.4s] don't but I want us to see this 15
[2582.2s] minutes. You know people ask questions
[2584.4s] let me read this the following I'm
[2586.1s] reading only this part of teachers
[2588.6s] then because my time is up others also
[2592.4s] somewhere I don't want to be somebody's
[2595.1s] time my last class I'll be able to
[2597.3s] analyze everything so we are told that
[2599.4s] I'm not now talking about teachers we
[2601.6s] have seen the topics to be studied in
[2603.8s] education we have seen that the schools
[2606.1s] must be established and we've seen the
[2608.0s] solution how to establish schools
[2610.4s] parents must have personal
[2612.8s] responsibility. If there are few school
[2615.3s] members somewhere, they can unite with
[2617.1s] others to establish a what? School. And
[2619.9s] I know it is possible because God has
[2621.8s] saved. Amen. So it has been the custom
[2625.1s] to encourage them. It has been the
[2627.5s] custom to encourage sending children to
[2631.1s] school when they were
[2633.6s] more babies needing a mother a mother's.
[2637.6s] Amen. That is what is happening today.
[2639.9s] Parents should be they all be teachers
[2642.1s] of their children until they have
[2644.9s] reached age what? 10 years 10 years. So
[2649.9s] first
[2651.9s] responsibility until 8 or 10 years. Do
[2656.4s] not send your little ones away to school
[2659.1s] to
[2660.1s] a mother should be careful how she
[2664.2s] trusts the modeling of the infant mind
[2667.0s] to other hands. Hallelujah. By the way,
[2669.9s] the mother has a great responsibility in
[2673.2s] teaching the child more than the the
[2675.8s] father. The father also has a great
[2678.2s] responsibility. But the mother's
[2679.9s] responsibilities have high. Do you know
[2682.9s] that is very very easy for a character
[2685.8s] to be transmitted from the mother to the
[2688.1s] child more than the
[2691.2s] are the angel went to who? Samson's
[2694.9s] mother. and is attracted how Samsung was
[2698.2s] to be educated. So the mothers mothers
[2701.4s] have a great responsibility. So parents
[2703.5s] ought to be the best teachers of their
[2705.5s] children until they have reached 8 or 10
[2708.2s] years of age. So who's the best teacher
[2709.8s] to the child at younger age?
[2712.5s] Both best parents best but mother will
[2716.6s] have great
[2721.6s] responsibility.
[2723.5s] Okay. Okay.
[2726.1s] Let let me read this. Let me read this.
[2728.3s] But both of them has a great
[2737.0s] responsibility. Parents ought to be the
[2739.0s] best teachers of their children until
[2741.1s] they have reached 8 or 10 years of age.
[2744.2s] Their school room should be what? Open
[2748.2s] air and the flowers and back. Talk to
[2751.9s] me. Just talk to me.
[2754.8s] What is their school
[2757.2s] room? Somebody just read that aloud.
[2759.7s] What is their school
[2761.6s] room? Open air
[2766.4s] ams the treasures of nature. So we are
[2771.0s] told about something here. I'm coming
[2773.3s] back to that. But let me see the
[2774.5s] qualifications of teachers who are teach
[2778.1s] children in our schools. We are not a
[2780.6s] special talent be given to the education
[2783.5s] of the youth. The principles and habits
[2786.2s] of the teacher should be considered of
[2790.0s] greater importance than even is
[2793.9s] literally qualifications. What should be
[2796.8s] considered in a teacher? The principles
[2799.6s] and hies of the teachers. Hallelujah.
[2803.5s] Hallelujah.
[2804.9s] If you are going to establish a school,
[2806.4s] the first thing to look in the
[2808.1s] principles
[2810.1s] and not just teachers because they are
[2813.3s] teachers
[2826.7s] manipulation and knowledge in science to
[2828.9s] instruct. One may have what? sufficient
[2832.0s] educ education and knowledge in science
[2835.2s] to do what? To instruct but has it
[2839.2s] been orained that has tact and wisdom to
[2845.0s] deal with the human what might mind. Are
[2847.4s] we together? Those are qualifications.
[2849.6s] Those who are deciding to establish
[2851.0s] schools kindly write this. Let none feel
[2853.8s] that let none feel that having an ear
[2856.9s] honestness in religious matters is all
[2859.9s] that is essential in order to become
[2863.2s] when they need no less of piety. They
[2865.6s] also need a par knowledge of what?
[2868.3s] Science. Amen. So a knowledge of science
[2870.9s] must be the teachers must have and their
[2873.8s] habits and character must also be the
[2876.6s] good. They should also qualify to be
[2878.8s] dealing with minds. Amen. And in this
[2882.2s] last days we need wise teachers because
[2885.5s] people have so long been poverted by the
[2887.7s] educational system. If somebody comes
[2891.3s] self the teacher cannot deal with the
[2893.6s] mind you will be having a problem in
[2895.3s] that school that school
[2898.4s] and I know the problem I know that there
[2902.0s] people in teaching this God has placed
[2905.6s] them here. It is only that you have not
[2907.3s] recognized them or those abilities
[2909.7s] belong to somewhere else. The good news
[2911.5s] of God needs teachers who have a high
[2913.4s] moral qualities and can be trusted with
[2915.9s] education of others. Men who are of who
[2918.9s] are sound in the in the faith and have
[2921.4s] attacked and patient who walk with God
[2923.8s] and abstain from every appearance of
[2927.0s] what? Hallelujah. And abain from every
[2930.4s] appearance of what? If you take a
[2932.6s] teacher who cannot abstain from every
[2934.9s] appearance of you will have a problem in
[2936.9s] that school. Hallelujah.
[2939.6s] Amen. Amen. So teachers who must go to
[2942.1s] those schools must be a people who can
[2945.0s] be able to abstain from every appearance
[2946.9s] of all. I hope you are getting me. Who
[2949.7s] stand so closely connected with God and
[2952.8s] they can be channels of light in
[2955.3s] Christian world. Gentlemen, we cannot in
[2958.2s] this day apparel accept teachers because
[2959.9s] they have been in school two 3 4 by 4.
[2963.2s] Yes. Yes. The question we should decide
[2966.1s] whether they are qualified for their
[2967.6s] work should should be have they with all
[2971.8s] their acquisition
[2974.0s] acquisition of knowledge. sat and d
[2977.0s] beneath the serpent of the true truth as
[2979.4s] foren what treasure treasure are they
[2982.6s] partakers of the fruit of the tree of
[2985.7s] what life amen those are the
[2988.5s] qualification of teachers so I'm coming
[2990.7s] to the end of this because I have 10
[2992.6s] minutes let me read this let me read
[2996.3s] this let me read
[2998.9s] this
[3001.4s] mix what means seventh day adventist
[3005.8s] Have plenty of what? Money. That is why
[3009.1s] it it is possible to establish a what? A
[3012.4s] school. Hallelujah. We have money. Amen.
[3016.2s] How many are seventh
[3017.7s] elementist? We have money. Hallelujah.
[3021.8s] You can deny that you don't have money.
[3023.9s] Amen. Seventh element have plenty of
[3026.5s] what? Money. But it does not belong to
[3029.2s] the what? Here's the problem.
[3033.4s] We have money but that money doesn't
[3035.4s] belong in the world. That is why we
[3037.3s] don't one school as we speak. But we
[3039.8s] have what? Money establish. We have
[3042.9s] money that can run
[3045.0s] gigs. But that money doesn't belong to
[3047.7s] the king. This is the trouble. There is
[3051.0s] a number among what they
[3055.4s] advent to give an impetus to this
[3058.2s] message to reach the one in the rest of
[3061.0s] this world generation. If only that
[3063.5s] money can belong to the church. There
[3066.9s] are enough possibilities. Amen. Amen. If
[3069.9s] we need text books, there are enough.
[3071.9s] Amen. If we need
[3075.6s] teachers, Hallelujah. There are enough
[3079.2s] talents. Amen. They are teachers. Even
[3081.6s] in this meeting, they are teachers who
[3083.6s] qualify
[3085.2s] teachers. There are enough
[3088.4s] village. All the supplies that are ever
[3091.3s] needed and all ever shall be needed. If
[3094.6s] only those faculties, those talents,
[3096.3s] those if only those facilities, this
[3098.9s] talent, those faculties shall belong to
[3100.9s] the what? The church. Hallelujah. This
[3103.8s] is where it's a problem. And I know as
[3106.3s] people will be looking, do you know
[3107.9s] today we have
[3112.3s] problem asking where this is the way for
[3115.8s] what? You have money but that your money
[3117.9s] doesn't belong to the church. The
[3119.8s] church. Hallelujah. We are taking money
[3122.0s] somewhere else. Amen. And we are told it
[3126.0s] is a question one day. If my money
[3128.3s] belongs to the what? The world. Do I
[3131.0s] belong to the the I was to meet those
[3134.3s] conditions but my time is up. If my
[3136.8s] talines my abilities are put into the
[3139.3s] work of the world as of the world and
[3141.8s] not into the work of the church as of
[3143.8s] the church then the question is worth
[3146.1s] considering. Do I belong to the church
[3148.8s] myself? Hallelujah.
[3151.5s] I want to stop that point. The reason
[3154.6s] why the church is failing to enter the
[3158.6s] reason why we still have way forward. We
[3161.0s] teach this truth and people are going
[3162.5s] this way is that we have plenty of
[3165.5s] money. We have plenty of means. We have
[3168.9s] abilities and we have talents.
[3171.0s] teachers I see a teacher looking
[3177.7s] at the world the world not to
[3181.2s] the Jones will ask you that if you are
[3183.8s] satisfied in the world you belong to the
[3187.4s] I know it is it is possible to end to do
[3190.7s] everything that the Lord is calling us
[3192.8s] to do what to do but only if we are
[3196.2s] going to belong to the church the church
[3198.4s] and parents
[3200.1s] If we are going to commit that our mind
[3202.1s] to the church then all these things we
[3204.2s] shall be able to do what? May God help
[3206.6s] us. Amen. May God help us to be church
[3209.4s] members in Jesus name. Amen. Allow me
[3212.0s] pray then I give time for questions.
[3229.4s] We thank you dear father in
[3231.6s] heaven for the solutions and
[3234.6s] everything are clearly defined in your
[3238.5s] word. The reason why this church has
[3241.6s] failed is that all the talents and
[3244.9s] abilities and faculties that are needed
[3247.5s] to establish suits today we have plenty
[3250.8s] of them but they belong the
[3253.6s] world. Dear Lord in heaven is our
[3256.0s] prayer. I know there's one parent in
[3257.8s] this meeting who is desiring to
[3260.7s] disconnect herself or himself with the
[3263.6s] world and to be a church
[3266.3s] man. Lord in heaven as you are helping
[3268.9s] your people by the end of this meeting.
[3271.1s] Help the parents in this congregation to
[3272.9s] be church members so that we might have
[3275.0s] enough facilities for this church to
[3277.4s] establish schools and run them.
[3280.0s] Help us dear Lord in heaven to make us
[3281.9s] there and help us to be your children.
[3284.3s] Forgive us for our wrongdoing and help
[3286.1s] us and walk with us in every step of
[3288.0s] life. This is my prayer by faith in the
[3290.2s] precious name of Jesus Christ.
[3295.5s] Amen.
[3297.7s] Uh I
[3299.6s] want I want to take very few
[3302.4s] questions. Let me assure you that we are
[3305.2s] going to use the time we are going to
[3306.9s] dedicate to Christians before the end of
[3308.6s] this meeting because I know when people
[3311.2s] waste time
[3312.8s] out somebody should be ending
[3316.0s] this should be ending
