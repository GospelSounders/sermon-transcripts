FULL TRANSCRIPT:
Yes. And the spirit say Yes. Yes. And behold, behold and great beast came out of the sea. Four great beast. So you can see those beast. Four great beasts. Remember in our last lesson we saw what beast is. I'm not going to ask you a question because it's raining but we saw what a beast is peace is the kingdom led by kings and you told what she is see the multitude of people so these are four kingdoms coming where there's multitude of people highly populated place now there's something I want you to see tonight which I saw today on my way to road I saw it today and I thought that before we sleep I have to present please that you may also be able to know what good Friday is and who is being woripped this one Daniel for so long time ago now what I saw today is in this four beast this four beast the revelation 7 this is what I saw today but I want to begin that you may be able to follow the Bible and then you will be I'm going to compare notes with what I saw today. Now go to verse number three. The Bible says, "And four and four great beasts." Four great beasts. And four great beasts, yes, came up from the sea. Why don't you use a microphone? People sitting here, I sure that the microphone works. Thank you so much. are four great beasts. And the four great beasts, yes, came up from the sea. So these four beasts are coming out of the sea. Diver see the four beast. Yes. Diverse one from another. One from another. That means the first one came. Now after the first one has gone, the second one comes. And diverse means that they were not coming. They didn't come all of them at once. Now these four beasts which we read in the Bible that there are four kingdoms. You go to Daniel 7 verse 20. Would you read it with us? Verse 24. The Bible reads the Bible read. And the 10 horns out sorry he said the fourth news shall be the fourth kingdom upon earth. So that is these are kingdoms. Verse 17 is very clear more than that beasts. These great four beasts which are four which are four are four kings are four kings which shall rise out of the earth. So this beast represent what? Kings. Kingdoms and kingdoms are led by kings. So when you look at this beast, these are four kingdoms and the Bible says they are the kingdoms that will be there in this earth and then after them being there then this one will come to what an end to an end. How many are listening to me? Let me see if you are with me. Are you sure we are with me? We thank God. So look Daniel 7 has gone to the wine time. Now the chapter 7 is the same as I will not be following these things consequentially or sequentially but you can grasp this. Now listen that uh these are the four kingdoms they are working diverse meaning they will not work at the same time. When one cometh, when it comes to an end, another one followth. Like that, like that, like that. Now Daniel says, "They did not come at once, but they came diverse from each other." Hallelujah. Amen. Hallelujah church. Amen. Now these are the four kingdom. Now if you want to know where the world is, you go back to Daniel chapter 2 and Daniel chapter 7. And said we have been preaching these things but our churches don't understand that we never read last time on drugs because today many people learn that many people but this makes us and they are not getting the right treatment that they should come. Today I want us also coming like a lion organization lions eagle wings now with worry as I beheld many people who are suffering from I want to go very fast among many other now receiving this drugs and many people were worried that Kenyan faces HIV treatment crisis as only 6 months supply of ARV drugs remaining so many people have been worried that when there is no supply of these drugs what is the way forward or what is the solution we've learned that we have reached a time that we are going to They are the same. We see in Daniel chapter 2, Babylon is represented by gold. In Daniel chapter 7, Babylon is represented by what? Lion. Lion. So this is the first kingdom that never ruled the world that became the superpower. And all of you if you read the book of Daniel chapter one, you know that is Nebuchadnezzar that captured the people of God. and to Babylon. You know Jeremiah during his time is when these people were captured by God allowed because the people had opposed the s. So this is the first kingdom. You all know that lion is the king of the world the jungle. He is all powerful and it is said that it's powerful more than all animals. That is what is being known. So you all know in Daniel chapter 2 God is telling Nebuchadnezzar that you will be like God but you will come and go and another kingdom will follow you and the kingdom that will follow you will not be greater as you what are as you are. So that means Babylon was so much great. But the king of follow Babylon was not going to be great as what? How many are listening to me? That is why when you look at that Daniel chapter 2, you see the image there is gold and then followed by silver and then bronze and then iron. Then iron mixed with what? that it is shall be to down. Why? That after Babylon the economy will be going what? Down just as gold is the precious metal then followed by silver followed by bronze followed by iron. So that is how the economy will be depreciating. So there will be no appreciation as these kingdoms are working diverse from each other. The Bible says it will be what? Now if you read the book of the Bible Daniel in Revelation, then God's people cannot engage in politics. Number one, you cannot engage politics when somebody tells you that he will bring what you he bottom up. He will make the economy to be blew aart. Why? The Bible says after Babylon we will go to there which is silver and then we'll go to bronze and then we will go to iron that means economy will be what? So friends, let me tell you a vote of me will not be good. Even if you vote me, even if I leave preaching today and then you elect me to be a governor of this county, there's nothing I can do for you. Why? The Bible says that when the fourth kingdom will be working, it will be iron mixed with what? meaning the economy gone. I see people are quarreling. Our economy is bad. Our economy is bad. R is bad and people are being recruited into JC movements. The reason why you can join join JZ movement so that you may be able to fight for the economy is because you do not understand the Bible prophecies. Those who understand the Bible prophecy, he cannot be engaged in any movement. Why? because they know that the Bible is very clear that the kingdom if you wanted a good economy then you to live in the what in the Babylonian Empire and that is why those two of them who got Babylonian mind is going to the street to fight for the ina people are able to die personally my brother was killed and was buried fighting for the economy of this What is now bad but now is our economy good? Nothing. So those who have Babian minds will always fight for good economy. But those who are Christians indeed will not fight for the economy. Why? The Bible says that as we come from Babylon then the economy will be what? Depreciating like that toast was at least good. So if you wanted good economy maybe you would have lived in the time of what the departure and then during what this g at least it was bronze because in in Kenya year number one is being given gold medal number two silver medal number three bronze bronze and then number

TIMESTAMPED TRANSCRIPT:
[1.0s] Yes. And the spirit say Yes.
[6.2s] Yes. And behold,
[13.4s] behold and great beast came out of the
[16.5s] sea. Four great beast. So you can see
[18.7s] those beast. Four great beasts. Remember
[23.8s] in our last lesson we saw what beast
[28.1s] is. I'm not going to ask you a question
[30.8s] because it's raining but we saw what a
[33.9s] beast is peace is the kingdom led by
[37.2s] kings and you told what she is see the
[41.1s] multitude of people so these are four
[43.9s] kingdoms coming where there's multitude
[47.4s] of people highly
[49.3s] populated place now there's something I
[52.2s] want you to see tonight which I saw
[54.0s] today on my way to road I saw it today
[58.0s] and I thought that before we sleep I
[61.4s] have to present please that you may also
[63.8s] be able to know what good Friday is and
[67.0s] who is being
[68.3s] woripped this one Daniel for so long
[71.9s] time ago now what I saw today is in this
[75.3s] four
[76.5s] beast this four beast the revelation 7
[80.4s] this is what I saw today but I want to
[83.0s] begin that you may be able to follow the
[85.0s] Bible and then you will be I'm going to
[88.6s] compare notes with what I saw today. Now
[92.8s] go to verse number three. The Bible
[94.9s] says, "And four and four great beasts."
[98.0s] Four great beasts. And four great
[100.9s] beasts, yes, came up from the sea. Why
[103.5s] don't you use a
[105.9s] microphone? People sitting here, I sure
[108.9s] that the microphone
[113.9s] works. Thank you so much.
[119.5s] are four great beasts. And the four
[122.6s] great beasts, yes, came up from the sea.
[125.4s] So these four beasts are coming out of
[127.6s] the sea. Diver see the four beast.
[131.2s] Yes. Diverse one from another. One from
[135.0s] another. That means the first one came.
[139.3s] Now after the first one has gone, the
[141.3s] second one comes. And diverse means that
[145.1s] they were not coming. They didn't come
[147.5s] all of them at once. Now these four
[150.2s] beasts which we read in the Bible that
[153.1s] there are four kingdoms. You go to
[155.3s] Daniel 7 verse
[158.8s] 20. Would you read it with us? Verse 24.
[162.0s] The Bible reads the Bible read. And the
[164.0s] 10 horns
[166.0s] out sorry he said the fourth news shall
[170.4s] be the fourth kingdom upon earth. So
[172.6s] that is these are kingdoms. Verse 17 is
[175.8s] very clear more than that beasts. These
[179.0s] great four beasts which are four which
[181.8s] are four are four kings are four kings
[184.9s] which shall rise out of the earth. So
[187.5s] this beast represent what? Kings.
[191.2s] Kingdoms and kingdoms are led by kings.
[194.7s] So when you look at this beast, these
[197.8s] are four kingdoms and the Bible says
[202.1s] they are the kingdoms that will be there
[204.6s] in this earth and then after them being
[207.7s] there then this one will come to what an
[210.2s] end to an end. How many are listening to
[212.4s] me? Let me see if you are with me. Are
[215.0s] you sure we are with me? We thank God.
[218.2s] So look Daniel 7 has gone to the wine
[222.1s] time. Now the chapter 7 is the same as I
[225.4s] will not be following these things
[228.0s] consequentially or sequentially but you
[231.8s] can grasp this. Now listen that
[237.0s] uh these are the four kingdoms they are
[241.1s] working diverse meaning they will not
[243.8s] work at the same time. When one cometh,
[247.4s] when it comes to an end, another one
[249.6s] followth. Like that, like that, like
[252.4s] that. Now Daniel says, "They did not
[254.8s] come at once, but they came diverse from
[258.1s] each other." Hallelujah. Amen.
[261.3s] Hallelujah church. Amen. Now these are
[263.4s] the four kingdom. Now if you want to
[266.1s] know where the world is, you go back to
[269.2s] Daniel chapter 2 and Daniel chapter 7.
[273.6s] And said we have been preaching these
[275.5s] things
[277.1s] but our churches don't understand that
[279.8s] we never read last
[282.7s] time on drugs because today many people
[287.9s] learn that many
[289.5s] people but this makes us and they are
[292.3s] not getting the right treatment that
[295.5s] they should come.
[297.7s] Today I want us
[300.4s] also
[310.0s] coming like a lion
[314.6s] organization lions eagle wings now with
[319.2s] worry as I beheld many people who are
[322.6s] suffering from I want to go very
[325.6s] fast among many
[328.4s] other now receiving this drugs and many
[332.3s] people were worried
[334.8s] that Kenyan faces HIV treatment crisis
[338.1s] as only 6 months supply of ARV drugs
[341.7s] remaining so many people have been
[344.2s] worried that when there is no supply of
[347.1s] these drugs what is the way forward or
[350.5s] what is the solution we've learned that
[352.7s] we have reached a time that we are going
[355.0s] to They are the same. We see in Daniel
[359.0s] chapter 2, Babylon is represented
[362.0s] by gold. In Daniel chapter
[365.6s] 7, Babylon is represented by what? Lion.
[369.3s] Lion. So this is the first kingdom that
[372.2s] never ruled the world that became the
[375.2s] superpower. And all of you if you read
[378.4s] the book of Daniel chapter one, you know
[381.4s] that is
[382.4s] Nebuchadnezzar that captured the people
[385.0s] of God. and to Babylon. You know
[388.7s] Jeremiah during his time is when these
[391.8s] people were captured by God allowed
[396.1s] because the people had opposed the s. So
[398.6s] this is the first
[400.1s] kingdom. You all know that lion is the
[403.1s] king of the world the jungle. He is all
[406.9s] powerful and it is said that it's
[409.3s] powerful more than all animals. That is
[412.5s] what
[413.8s] is being known. So you all know in
[418.1s] Daniel chapter 2 God is telling
[422.6s] Nebuchadnezzar that you will be like
[426.4s] God but you will come and go and another
[430.9s] kingdom will follow you and the kingdom
[433.6s] that will follow you will not be greater
[436.6s] as you what are as you are. So that
[440.3s] means Babylon was so much
[442.9s] great. But the king of follow Babylon
[446.9s] was not going to be great as
[449.4s] what? How many are listening to me? That
[452.1s] is why when you look at that Daniel
[455.0s] chapter 2, you see the image there is
[457.6s] gold and then followed by silver and
[460.2s] then bronze and then iron. Then iron
[462.9s] mixed with what?
[465.2s] that it is shall be to down. Why? That
[468.6s] after Babylon the economy will be going
[471.8s] what? Down just as gold is the precious
[476.4s] metal then followed by silver followed
[479.5s] by bronze followed by iron. So that is
[482.6s] how the economy will be
[484.8s] depreciating. So there will be no
[486.9s] appreciation as these kingdoms are
[489.6s] working diverse from each other. The
[493.0s] Bible says it will be
[495.2s] what? Now if you read the book of the
[497.8s] Bible Daniel in Revelation, then God's
[500.6s] people cannot engage in politics. Number
[502.9s] one, you cannot engage politics when
[505.4s] somebody tells you that he will bring
[507.8s] what you he bottom up. He will make the
[513.0s] economy to be blew aart. Why? The Bible
[516.6s] says after Babylon we will go to there
[520.7s] which is silver and then we'll go to
[522.8s] bronze and then we will go to iron that
[525.8s] means economy will be what?
[532.0s] So friends, let me tell you a vote of me
[534.2s] will not be good. Even if you vote me,
[537.4s] even if I leave preaching today and then
[539.5s] you elect me to be a governor of this
[541.4s] county, there's nothing I can do for
[543.6s] you. Why? The Bible says that when the
[547.0s] fourth kingdom will be working, it will
[549.4s] be iron mixed with what?
[552.2s] meaning the economy gone.
[555.4s] I see people are quarreling. Our economy
[557.7s] is bad. Our economy is bad. R is bad and
[562.1s] people are being recruited into JC
[564.1s] movements. The reason why you can join
[566.9s] join JZ movement so that you may be able
[569.7s] to fight for the economy is because you
[572.1s] do not understand the Bible prophecies.
[575.2s] Those who understand the Bible prophecy,
[576.8s] he cannot be engaged in any movement.
[580.1s] Why? because they know that the Bible is
[583.3s] very clear that the kingdom if you
[586.6s] wanted a good economy then you to live
[588.5s] in the what in the Babylonian Empire and
[591.8s] that is why those two of them who got
[594.1s] Babylonian mind is going to the street
[597.4s] to fight for
[598.8s] the ina people are able to
[603.0s] die personally my brother was killed and
[606.6s] was buried fighting for the economy of
[610.2s] this What is now bad but now is our
[613.5s] economy good? Nothing. So those who have
[616.7s] Babian minds will always fight for good
[619.0s] economy. But those who are Christians
[621.9s] indeed will not fight for the economy.
[624.0s] Why? The Bible says that as we come from
[627.8s] Babylon then the economy will be what?
[630.7s] Depreciating like that
[634.8s] toast was at least good. So if you
[637.0s] wanted good economy maybe you would have
[639.0s] lived in the time of what the departure
[642.1s] and then during what this g at least it
[646.2s] was bronze because in in Kenya year
[648.7s] number one is being given gold medal
[651.0s] number two silver medal number three
[653.4s] bronze bronze and then number
