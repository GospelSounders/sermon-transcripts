Those who are in the times of Noah, they just make themselves in amusement and festives. Those who possess the influence and power were bent to keep the minds of the people. How many are attending parties party after party? How many have ever attended this class? You know people are fine. People are not talking. How many are attending? So these things were in the anti-olivian world. They were the things that make sure that only Noah was saved. Amen. The minds of the youth. How many youth were saved in such a time? How many youths? None. Why? Parties after and songs and amusement and dancing. The devil ensure that these things fill them up. And Noah when Noah was preaching I read something in Ages page 91 says that Noah invested all everything he had in the building of the ark. As he was building the ark he was pre but you know what the world gave back to Noah. They were saying that Noah is a deluded what? A deluded fanatic. Somebody has been just bewitched misled and what bewildered. Now in this in this our life today what is going to make us get lost is the amusement of the world. Amen. Going to excite youths to the places. Just read as you conclude. It says that read write that how many are seeing the same are being repeated in our day. Do you not see the same repeated in our day? While God's servants are giving the message that these things that the end of all things is at hand, the world is absorbing amusement and the pleaser seeking. There is a course of round excitement that causes amusement. Then the people are being prevented from being impressed by the truth. They were really doing according to the Lord's will. Young Sabbath keepers. A nice group here. Unbelievable. And who have yielded to the influence of the world alive that he might be the one. We'll have to be tested and what? So we must be tested and watches whether we are going to stand when the world is following the world or the church is trending back to what Egypt. Amen. While the youths are trending back to they must be tempted and be proved whether their minds are interested in music. They are charm with music or they want to be intelligent spies and what studios that are going to give the last message to this what just read I want you to go to the last thing I'm reading then I just stop continue it says the peril of the last days are upon us the trial is upon the young which they have not anticipated. The young must be brought into this distressing perplexity the genuiness. Amen. The truthfulness of their faith will be what? We are going to be tried and proved. How many find themselves dancing? They when they hear instrumental music just find yourself dancing without How many have ever How many this people in the grace? How many? Okay. You you are going to be tested. Amen. And approved and the genuiness of the genuiness will be read. It continue to says you know youths today profess to be looking for the son of man. Some of us are a bad example to unbelief. Read they have not been willing to give up the They are not been willing to give up the That is why even if I make a call, how many have songs in their phones that are not to the glory of God? We are not willing to give up the we just want to live as the world. Then we are going to preach. We are going to be cut off. Amen. We are going to lose eternity. By the way, L White says in messages to young people page 108.1 that death before dishonor is the motive of every I rather die than to than to sin. That should be our what? Continue reading. It says that it continued by saying they have not been willing to give up the world what is picnics united in the world in attending what is that eh or you you go and check on that they have been united enjoying them the world to attend what picnics X. Mhm. Uh-huh. Read. Uhhuh. They united with what? With the world. Mhm. Just pause. Let us conclude with this book. Jun says that it's better not to sing than to spend much time in singing songs that are not worthy to the glory of God. Amen. It is better to study than to sing. It is better to spend your mean in singing means in singing than in means in preaching than in singing. Testimony volume 1 page 676 paragraph 1 that is the last quote I'm reading says that but if you go and read you write evangelism page 5 11 write that you go and read for your own self 511.1 Ellen White says that singing should not take the hour of prayer and studying of the so if you are not a Bible student do not expect to sing songs that will glorify God. Amen. Much of your times should not be spent in singing, but you don't study. You will not have power over the amusement of the world. Amen. The Bible and the Bible alone is what is going to make us the world. Amen. Testimony volume 1 page 676 paragraph one says, I'm reading a case of this. This woman is called who? Anna Smith. Annie Smith. Yeah. Read read what is written there. I want to conclude. It says it says I that is Ellen White. I spoke to the large congregation. Before we went eastward, people neglected sister Mo. I saw of the duty of giving honor to whom it is due. It appeared to me that wisdom has so departed that they were not capable of appreciating the moral work. I told like I'm telling this church today that there were many among them they were they could they could find time to to mix to to meet. Uhhuh. Just read to meet and sing. They could find time to meet and sing and play their instrumental what? Music. They could give their money to the artist to to produce their photos. They could find money to give the artist to produce their what? photos to meet to sing just it continue by saying they should give money to their artist to multiply their likenesses and they could spend their money to attend public what public amusements they had nothing to give to the the work of what missionary just read it continue to says it continue to say it's Philadelphia and what do we know about they had nothing to give out to a worn out missionary who had embraced the present truth Philadelphia was a church where there was no rebuke and he has come to live with those of like faith I advised them to stop and consider what they were doing and proposed that they shut up their instrument of music. I told them to stop. They leave down their instrument of what? Of music. Music for 3 months for 3 months and take time to humble themsel before God in self-examination. So if you are going to spend time singing and amusement but we don't have money to give to the work what is the advice you stop we stop what selfexamination so music should not take part of prayer and studying of the bible amen amen says that much time should be spending studies more than because what the youth must must decide for himself reuke is to cut loose the world to do away with pleasant to talk about it. There's no and decide for eternity. Amen. We are not only going to follow the ways of the world that we are we are not going to fall again but we want to serve the Lord. So nice says that with one eye single to the glory of Christianity nowadays it's the glory of we wanted to be may God bless us in Jesus. Some place it's better. In our place it's medium and in some places really bad. So, um, is there a comment, a question? [Music] [Music] When you see how [Music] young because some of them cannot understand and some of them what they hear I listen to. Thank you. Is there another person? So let us just conclude as we pray. She drums bit we just include there is no wrong in use of instrumental music but that says that you need to exclude what drum beat there are instrumental music we can use like the h the trim rail the guitar etc but with the drummen Yes. [Music] What about the things we had like when we sing? That is the question. Like Who can answer that? Cuz you can answer that. I don't know how to answer this song, right? But it's I would say basically it's illegal to add your own stuff already used by permission. If you see it's written by you compose your own story. [Music] Thank you [Music] for creating distortion. So here is really [Music] Sir, let us just pray. God, pray with us as we pray. Will you kneel down as we pray? Holy and precious Lord oures. Thank [Music] you. The condition is going to be closed. It is going to prepare us for the mark of the beast before [Music] us. Thank you for having to stand before us. that the dancing of David. Pray God in heaven that let us excuse of the dancing of David to gratify our works and to put water and dancing in peace that deeply before you that they will help us to be righteous to have the best music that is to prepare us to receive that pray in heaven that if we still have rubbish in our hearts. The virgin still have music which is struggle to prepare for a pray that you give us power to our mayus. Amen. Uh So I had a pleasure to do that. I know what's about Huh? This one.

[463.7s] dancing? How many have those
[466.1s] things? Hey, I'm talking to people who

[480.9s] all there is
[485.0s] there is caring.
[490.2s] evil and what glee. Mhm. In all this
[498.6s] the youth follow the example of the

[503.0s] books placed in their hands for study.
[507.4s] These
[509.4s] evils just read these evils.
[513.7s] The greatest evil of it.
[520.7s] Repeat that.
[523.9s] Write that. That the greatest evil of
[526.6s] this amusement of today.
[530.6s] The greatest evil of this amusement all.
[539.4s] Permanent. It is what? What is
[545.3s] permanent? That is why today youths are
[548.6s] so awkward. Paragraph that follows says
[552.6s] paragraph number two. It says
[556.0s] that not the time the probation of the
[559.0s] earth is
[563.4s] closing. Those who are in the times of
[566.2s] Noah, they just make themselves in
[569.1s] amusement and festives.
[576.2s] Those who possess the influence and
[578.0s] power were bent to keep the minds of the
[581.8s] people. How many are attending parties
[585.0s] party after
[586.4s] party? How many have ever
[589.9s] attended this class? You know people are
[592.4s] fine. People are not
[594.8s] talking. How many are attending? So
[597.0s] these things were in the anti-olivian
[599.8s] world. They were the things that make
[601.5s] sure that only Noah was saved. Amen. The
[605.1s] minds of the youth. How many youth were
[606.8s] saved in such a
[609.2s] time? How many youths? None.
[613.6s] Why? Parties after and songs and
[617.4s] amusement and dancing. The devil ensure
[619.9s] that these things fill them up. And Noah
[623.0s] when Noah was
[624.2s] preaching I read something in Ages page
[627.2s] 91 says that Noah invested all
[630.0s] everything he had in the building of the
[631.8s] ark. As he was building the ark he was
[634.8s] pre but you know what the world gave
[637.6s] back to Noah. They were saying that Noah
[640.5s] is a deluded what? A deluded fanatic.
[644.8s] Somebody has been just bewitched misled
[648.6s] and what
[650.0s] bewildered. Now in this in this our life
[652.9s] today what is going to make
[655.2s] us get lost is the amusement of the
[658.1s] world. Amen. Going to excite youths to
[660.7s] the places. Just read as you conclude.
[662.9s] It says that
[669.1s] read write that how many are seeing the
[671.7s] same are being repeated in our
[674.6s] day. Do you not see the same repeated in
[677.6s] our day?
[682.6s] While God's servants are giving the
[684.2s] message that these things that the end
[686.5s] of all things is at
[689.2s] hand, the world is absorbing
[692.4s] amusement and the pleaser
[697.5s] seeking. There is a course of round
[700.6s] excitement that causes
[705.2s] amusement. Then the people are being
[707.7s] prevented from being impressed by the
[709.8s] truth.
[712.8s] They were really doing according to the
[715.4s] Lord's will. Young Sabbath keepers. A
[717.6s] nice group here. Unbelievable. And who
[720.2s] have yielded to the influence of the
[721.8s] world alive that he might be the one.
[724.4s] We'll have to be tested and what? So we
[727.9s] must be tested and watches whether we
[730.8s] are going to stand when the world is
[733.4s] following the world or the church is
[735.8s] trending back to what Egypt. Amen. While
[739.6s] the youths are trending back to they
[742.5s] must be tempted and be proved whether
[744.7s] their minds are interested in music.
[748.8s] They are charm with music or they want
[750.9s] to be intelligent spies and what studios
[755.5s] that are going to give the last message
[757.2s] to this
[758.3s] what just read I want you to go to the
[761.6s] last thing I'm reading then I just
[763.9s] stop continue it says
[768.1s] the peril of the last days are upon us
[775.0s] the trial is upon the young which they
[776.8s] have not anticipated.
[782.0s] The young must be brought into this
[784.9s] distressing perplexity
[790.1s] the genuiness. Amen. The truthfulness of
[793.5s] their faith will be what? We are going
[796.2s] to be tried and proved. How many find
[798.7s] themselves dancing? They when they hear
[800.8s] instrumental music just find yourself
[803.4s] dancing without How many have ever

[816.0s] you are going to be tested. Amen. And
[818.8s] approved and the genuiness of the
[821.0s] genuiness will be read. It continue to
[825.8s] says you know youths today profess to be
[829.0s] looking for the son of man.
[834.3s] Some of us are a bad example to
[837.5s] unbelief. Read

[844.1s] the They are not been willing to give up
[846.9s] the That is why even if I make a call,
[850.0s] how many have songs in their phones that
[853.1s] are not to the glory of God? We are not
[856.3s] willing to give up the we just want to
[859.3s] live as the world. Then we are going to
[861.9s] preach. We are going to be cut off.
[864.3s] Amen. We are going to lose
[866.8s] eternity. By the way, L White says in
[869.4s] messages to young people page
[872.2s] 108.1 that death before dishonor is the
[876.0s] motive of every I rather die than to
[880.4s] than to sin. That should be our
[884.4s] what? Continue reading. It says that it
[887.6s] continued by
[889.7s] saying they have not been willing to
[892.1s] give up the

[986.6s] and read for your own self 511.1 Ellen
[990.2s] White says that singing should not take
[992.8s] the hour of prayer and studying of
[995.7s] the so if you are not a Bible student do
[998.6s] not expect to sing songs that will
[1000.6s] glorify God.
[1002.0s] Amen. Much of your times should not be
[1004.5s] spent in singing, but you don't study.
[1007.8s] You will not have power over the
[1009.2s] amusement of the world.
[1010.7s] Amen. The Bible and the Bible alone is
[1015.0s] what is going to make us the world.
[1017.7s] Amen. Testimony volume 1 page 676
[1022.8s] paragraph one says,
[1027.4s] I'm reading a case of this. This woman
[1029.9s] is called
[1031.9s] who? Anna Smith.
[1035.0s] Annie Smith. Yeah. Read read what is
[1037.4s] written there. I want to conclude. It
[1038.9s] says it says
[1042.7s] I that is Ellen White. I spoke to the
[1044.7s] large congregation.
[1048.8s] Before we went eastward,
[1055.3s] people neglected sister Mo.
[1061.7s] I saw of the duty of giving
[1064.4s] honor to whom it is
[1070.1s] due. It appeared to me that wisdom has
[1072.8s] so departed
[1079.4s] that they were not capable of
[1081.0s] appreciating the moral
[1084.4s] work. I told like I'm telling this
[1087.5s] church
[1089.7s] today that there were
[1092.0s] many among
[1095.1s] them they were they could they could
[1098.0s] find time to
[1101.2s] to
[1103.0s] mix to to meet. Uhhuh.
[1106.9s] Just read
[1109.4s] to meet and sing.
[1114.8s] They could find time to meet and sing
[1116.9s] and play their instrumental what? Music.
[1123.0s] They could give their money to the
[1125.9s] artist
[1129.4s] to to produce their photos. They could
[1131.7s] find money to give the artist to produce
[1133.6s] their what? photos to meet to sing
[1139.4s] just it continue by saying
[1144.2s] they should give money to their
[1147.5s] artist to multiply their
[1153.1s] likenesses and they could spend their
[1155.5s] money to attend public what public
[1158.5s] amusements
[1163.6s] they had nothing to give to the the work
[1166.0s] of what
[1168.9s] missionary just read it continue to says
[1172.8s] it continue to say it's Philadelphia and
[1176.2s] what do we know about they had nothing
[1177.9s] to give out to a worn out missionary
[1182.3s] who had embraced the present truth
[1185.0s] Philadelphia was a church where there
[1187.0s] was no rebuke and he has come to live
[1190.6s] with those of like faith
[1195.4s] I advised them to stop and consider what
[1198.1s] they were doing and proposed that they
[1201.4s] shut up their instrument of music. I
[1204.0s] told them to stop. They leave down their
[1206.1s] instrument of what? Of music. Music for
[1209.0s] 3 months for 3 months and take time to
[1211.7s] humble themsel before God in
[1213.3s] self-examination. So if you are going to
[1215.5s] spend time singing and amusement but we
[1218.7s] don't have money to give to the
[1221.2s] work what is the
[1224.0s] advice you stop we stop what
[1226.8s] selfexamination so music should not take
[1229.4s] part of prayer and studying of the bible
[1232.6s] amen amen says that much time should be
[1235.4s] spending studies more than
[1239.4s] because what the youth must must decide
[1241.8s] for himself reuke is to cut loose the
[1245.4s] world to do away with pleasant to talk
[1248.3s] about it. There's no and decide for
[1250.1s] eternity. Amen. We are not only going to
[1252.6s] follow the ways of the world that we are
[1254.6s] we are not going to fall again but we
[1256.3s] want to serve the Lord. So nice says
[1258.9s] that with one eye single to the glory of
[1261.1s] Christianity nowadays it's the glory of
[1263.7s] we wanted to be may God bless us in
[1265.8s] Jesus. Some place it's
[1268.4s] better. In our place it's medium and in
[1271.8s] some places really bad. So, um, is there
[1276.6s] a comment,
[1278.5s] a question?
[1292.6s] [Music]
[1301.5s] [Music]
[1304.0s] When you see
[1306.9s] how
[1310.2s] [Music]
[1318.7s] young because some of them cannot
[1321.3s] understand and some of
[1322.9s] them what they hear I listen
[1327.1s] to. Thank
[1331.4s] you. Is there another
[1335.0s] person? So let us just conclude as we
[1337.6s] pray.
[1339.3s] She drums bit we just include there is
[1341.3s] no wrong in use of instrumental
[1343.3s] music but that says that you need to
[1347.0s] exclude what drum beat
[1351.0s] there are instrumental music we can use
[1352.9s] like the h the trim rail the guitar etc
[1356.4s] but with the drummen
[1361.3s] Yes.
[1373.4s] [Music]
[1380.2s] What about the things we had like when
[1382.6s] we sing? That is the question. Like
[1394.6s] Who can answer that? Cuz you can answer
[1397.8s] that. I don't know how to
[1414.1s] answer this song, right?
[1417.7s] But it's I would say basically it's
[1422.0s] illegal to add your own
[1425.7s] stuff
[1433.3s] already used by permission. If you
[1436.6s] see it's written
[1443.1s] by you compose your own story.

[1586.9s] us.
[1588.8s] that the dancing of David. Pray God in
[1592.5s] heaven that let us excuse of the dancing
[1595.7s] of David to gratify our works and to put
[1599.3s] water and dancing in peace that deeply
[1602.0s] before you that they will help us to be
[1603.7s] righteous to have the best music that is
