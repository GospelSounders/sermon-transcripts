Warm greetings to everyone. Today is another day that the Lord has brought and let us rejoice and be glad in it. This is young evangelist ministry. We are dedicated to to do the gospel work and take people to the old paths that were revealed in the word of God as it is written in the book of Jeremiah chapter 6 verse 16. as Ed promised the other day. Today I'm having a guest with me that is going to uh to make you know some of the things and just to remind you the Bible convention is ongoing and today is uh we we I can count it like uh the countdown because uh we just have one day to go then the Bible confession is going to come to an end. So today uh it's my pleasure to have a guest who is also one of the ministers in this convention that God ordained to minister unto the flock. The host is me Byron Oeno Onyango. So in a special way allow me to welcome my guest who is with me today and I know that uh you are going to be blessed with what we are going to discuss today and also the insight and the thoughtful uh sentiment that is going to give you today. So uh brotherishi thank you how are you? I'm fine. Uh we have uh our viewers who love the truth there some who are seeing us for the first time. I wish that you may send your greetings. you can introduce yourself and maybe we can proceed from that. Oh, thank you for that brother Byron for welcoming welcoming me to the young evangelist media. I greet all viewers in the name of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. Amen. Amen. So, uh I'm Evangelist Jeff. Jeff Muching was one of the guests that were ministering and to the delegates that were attended this convention in the topic of the true the teacher of truth only safe educator. I'm glad to be here with you and I thank God that the Lord has allowed us to reach this moment and uh we hope that as we coming to the end of this convention the objectives of the meeting are going to be met and all delegates will be going back our youth will be able to decide for himself. All right. All right. Thank you uh uh evangelist Jeff that is so powerful. So you've been handling uh the the class the uh the true educator. Mhm. The safe what? The teacher of truth. The safe only safe educator. Only safe educator. Yeah, that's the topic. So uh so far uh do you have a series that is still remaining or a topic that is still remaining that you need to handle maybe coming days? Yeah. uh we only have I only have one class remaining that class is tomorrow and I will be able to clarify everything and bring it to summary that the topic of tomorrow is that a youth must now decide for themselves. All right that is very powerful. So uh beloved we've been uh having that powerful topic and we came to the realization that uh this is the third angel's message and in rejecting this truth that God is giving to his church. It is like rejecting the entire message that Adventism have. Yeah, that is true that education was we realized that the birthight of reformation. We realize that the plan of redemption is the dem of the Bible. Education is redemption. And therefore, if someone rejects the education, such a person has rejected the whole Bible. Oh, so no one is going to go to heaven without being educated because heaven is a school. Oh, it is just promotion over the next class. That is so powerful. So the theme the central theme of the scripture is is redemption or salvation and we said that education and salvation is more or less the same. They are inseparable. You cannot separate education and redemption. In other words in the highest sense education and redemption are one. For as in education so is in redemption. So it means that the central theme of the scripture is education. That is that is in other words. So thank you. Thank you so much um um to Mishnik. I think that is very powerful and uh the viewers can actually get it in that deeper sense and I know that God is going to help us. Sure. So uh viewers what we are saying about education here we have series of studies that are presented in our playlist down there. You can actually get the link in our description. So just go and view all those uh presentations concerning education because it is that powerful one. So maybe uh um to Mr. Jeff. Yes. You can tell us maybe uh uh the response are you can you you can see from uh those whom you are handling in class what is are you seeing members and are understanding this message or it is what can you tell us? Thank you for that question but I know that uh when a meeting is made like this people should not just come to the meeting and go back home with an an empty mind and therefore as a teacher we need to be we need to understand or we need to engage all the delegates so that you be sure that whatever you are teaching or the whatever you are presenting must be understood by all the delegates and at the same time we know and understand that all things who are taken to the YouTube we are sure that the viewers who are going to view our channel will be able But for now that we had the series of studies that we had as well assure you that the delegates are able to understand and you see when you make a call and you see people make a step of of joining the to be prayed for it is very sure that those people are understanding what is being taught. Therefore in the classes of education I saw people getting to understand what redemption is because all of us we are deciding to be set to be saved. No one will not desire not to be saved to be saved because what we want is redemption. That's the central theme what is to be preached and therefore people must understand the plan of redemption and I saw that they were able to understand it. Oh all right thank you. Thank you uh evangelist Jeffnik. So uh our viewers I would like to inform you that this is just one of the speakers of this convention and uh he has played a key role uh by giving us the topic about the true education and I know that this is one of the subjects that is bringing contention among the reformers among the children even of the world. So uh I would wish that uh may God help us and uh if you want to learn more as I've said just go back to our the description down there I'm going I'm going to put a link that is going to direct you to all those series about education. Now to bring this to a close uh uh um to Mishi. Yes. Uh we have uh many people who are are still not having the depth understanding when it comes to education. So maybe what can you tell them where where did you get all these informations from so that their minds may be directed well to get the right understanding as you do? What can you tell them? Where is the where do we get all these truths from or where did you learn all these truths about education? Thank you for that. One of the thing that I will desire to tell the viewers that if we don't understand what education is in other words we cannot get you cannot be redeemed. In other words, you cannot be saved without education. And therefore it comes to a personal uh responsibility to everyone that everyone who desiring for eternal life must strive to understand the true science of what? Education. And therefore like we said as we beginning that the central theme of the Bible is educate education. One of our things that we need to understand that the Bible will always en line 10 human mind on every point of doctrine in everything because the book that is 2 Timothy 3:16 says that all things in the scriptures are there to train us so that we might be good people and therefore one of the sources of the truth that is going to sanctify the soul and lead to the perfect redemption are in the in the Bible that is why we are always being admonished that we need to study the Bible daily. Amen. And therefore, us being an Adventist, another source of our truth, we know as Adventist that our creed is the the Bible. We realize that God gave the church the gift of the spirit of what? Prophecy. And therefore, there's also another source of light that is the spirit of through prophecy. And we believe that the spirit of prophecy is manifested in the writings of Ellen Ellen White. And Ellen White is also speaking that let the dead speak, the dead speak. M says that the dead speak for people of God living in the last days we need to understand what the servant of God meaning because the dead cannot do what cannot speak and therefore she explains that can only speak through their what their writings and she says we need to study the writings of pioneers pioneers like Jones Stephankell log James White we need to study their work their work I tell that Stephan was explaining the book of Daniel chapter 4. You go to expl when he explains Daniel chapter 11, the whole theme of Daniel chapter 4 and Daniel chapter 11 is always that system of educ education and is trying to tell us that we need to have an education education that is higher than the even education the universities of the the world because that is the only education that is going to be accepted in heaven. Let me assure the viewers that the education can only be obtained in the schools of the pro the prophets prophets and therefore God is calling us to be men who are going to study the scriptures and the spirit of prophecy enlightening the truth in Jesus name. Oh thank you thank you to me. Uh there is this book that uh you've used so much written by someone like uh stherlands. Yeah. Uh what is the title of that book? The title of that book is uh studies on Christian education. studies on Christian education. Can you recommend it to the viewers because it is such a powerful book when it comes to education. Thank you for that. I'll recommend it to the viewers. Number one, we need to understand that Southerntherlands was a principle, a teacher in the Madison school. Madison school is a school that was established by the seventh adventist and therefore he explains and I let me just give them a brief overview of what is in the book. If you want to know the history of 1844, what happened to the remuneration of 1844, the best book to study is studies on Christian education by Netherlands. And therefore, children of God who are listening to me, what you need to understand that each one of us needs to get that book to study it deeply and therefore those things that happened to each movement happened unto them for our examples that we seventh day Adventists who are living in the last days need to understand our position as a people. spoken. Amen. Thank you. Thank you, Mishi. That is powerful. So, uh viewers, there is a book called studies on Christian education written by one who is speaking at a point of information that is southerntherlands. So, in the description go down there uh I've attached the link to the book and uh I know that it is going to be a great blessing. He was one of the principles in Madison school and we know that Madison school is the blueprint where we can find the blueprint of true education. So I I hope you are blessed and uh maybe uh um Tumishi. Yes. Uh maybe as we bring this to a close you can uh give us maybe your last remarks. uh you can give the viewers your last remark just just in a in a nutshell or in a in a short way so that uh the viewers can uh can actually know that uh uh the ministry is doing much and uh there are a lot of people that actually they don't understand these truths. So what can you maybe as you give your close remarks what can you tell us? What I can tell the viewers is that uh now as never before we need to understand the two science of education. If we fail to understand this we shall not have a place in the kingdom of god of of god. Therefore let's try let's get connected to the ministry through our media so that we need to we we we understand the true science of education and that is eternal life. All right. Amen. Thank you. So uh thank you so much for uh watching up to this far and uh I know it has been a blessing. It has been uh an insightful discussion and we still ask for your support. uh those who love the truth, we still ask of your support because uh the other day we were having a brother from SIA and uh he really wish that the truth to reach the home and you saw that one of the truth that he rejoiced in is the true education. The other day we are also also having a sister called Jalenza from Karungu. She also rejoiced in the message of the true education. So it means that youths are accepting this message. The parents are accepting this message and also uh the children and therefore we we really uh request your support so that we may uh uh make this truth now to be realistic by establishing our own institutions by establishing our own vocational trainings through your supports. God's work needs people that needs people that are going to join forces in these last days to bring support to the cause of God. Otherwise, may God bless you all. I know you are going to respond positively when the duty is going to call. Thank you and may God bless you. M

[118.9s] young evangelist media. I greet all
[122.3s] viewers in the name of our Lord and
[124.2s] Savior Jesus Christ. Amen. Amen. So, uh
[127.2s] I'm Evangelist Jeff. Jeff Muching was
[130.8s] one of the guests that were ministering
[133.6s] and to the delegates that were attended
[135.9s] this convention in the topic of the true
[139.3s] the teacher of truth only safe educator.
[142.6s] I'm glad to be here with you and I thank
[144.7s] God that the Lord has allowed us to
[146.2s] reach this moment and uh we hope that as
[149.1s] we coming to the end of this convention
[151.2s] the objectives of the meeting are going
[153.1s] to be met and all delegates will be
[154.9s] going back our youth will be able to
[156.7s] decide for himself. All right. All
[159.0s] right. Thank you uh uh evangelist Jeff
[162.2s] that is so powerful. So you've been
[165.1s] handling uh the the class the uh the
[169.4s] true educator. Mhm. The safe what? The
[172.6s] teacher of truth. The safe only safe
[174.8s] educator. Only safe educator. Yeah,
[177.0s] that's the topic. So uh so far uh do you
[180.6s] have a series that is still remaining or
[182.7s] a topic that is still remaining that you
[184.7s] need to handle maybe coming days? Yeah.
[187.4s] uh we only have I only have one class
[189.4s] remaining that class is tomorrow and I
[192.4s] will be able to clarify everything and
[194.2s] bring it to summary that the topic of
[196.9s] tomorrow is that a youth must now decide
[198.7s] for themselves. All right that is very
[201.0s] powerful. So uh beloved we've been uh
[204.6s] having that powerful topic and we came
[207.4s] to the realization that uh this is the
[210.5s] third angel's message and in rejecting
[214.3s] this truth that God is giving to his
[216.7s] church. It is like rejecting the entire
[220.2s] message that Adventism have. Yeah, that
[222.4s] is true that education was we realized
[226.2s] that the birthight of reformation. We
[228.6s] realize that the plan of redemption is
[230.5s] the dem of the Bible. Education is
[233.4s] redemption. And therefore, if someone
[235.1s] rejects the education, such a person has
[238.0s] rejected the whole Bible. Oh, so no one
[241.3s] is going to go to heaven without being
[243.2s] educated because heaven is a school. Oh,
[245.4s] it is just promotion over the next
[247.7s] class. That is so powerful. So the theme
[250.2s] the central theme of the scripture is is
[254.7s] redemption or salvation and we said that
[258.3s] education and salvation is more or less
[261.1s] the same. They are inseparable. You
[263.3s] cannot separate education and
[266.2s] redemption. In other words in the
[268.1s] highest sense education and redemption
[270.6s] are one. For as in education so is in
[273.8s] redemption. So it means that the central
[276.5s] theme of the scripture is education.
[278.7s] That is that is in other words. So thank
[280.6s] you. Thank you so much um um to Mishnik.
[283.4s] I think that is very powerful and uh the
[286.5s] viewers can actually get it in that
[289.0s] deeper sense and I know that God is
[291.1s] going to help us. Sure. So uh viewers
[293.8s] what we are saying about education here
[296.6s] we have series of studies that are
[299.3s] presented in our playlist down there.
[302.0s] You can actually get the link in our
[304.4s] description. So just go and view all
[307.8s] those uh presentations concerning
[310.1s] education because it is that powerful
[313.3s] one. So maybe uh um to Mr. Jeff. Yes.
[316.7s] You can tell us maybe uh uh the response
[321.0s] are you can you you can see from uh
[323.6s] those whom you are handling in class
[325.4s] what is are you seeing members and are
[328.6s] understanding this message or it is what
[331.8s] can you tell us? Thank you for that
[333.4s] question but I know that uh when a
[335.8s] meeting is made like this people should
[337.8s] not just come to the meeting and go back
[339.5s] home with an an empty mind and therefore
[342.9s] as a teacher we need to be we need to
[345.8s] understand or we need to engage all the
[348.4s] delegates so that you be sure that
[350.2s] whatever you are teaching or the
[351.3s] whatever you are presenting must be
[353.3s] understood by all the delegates and at
[355.2s] the same time we know and understand
[356.6s] that all things who are taken to the
[358.2s] YouTube we are sure that the viewers who
[360.6s] are going to view our channel will be
[362.2s] able
[363.8s] But for
[364.8s] now that we had the series of studies
[367.5s] that we had as well assure you that the
[371.0s] delegates are able to understand and you
[373.0s] see when you make a call and you see
[374.5s] people make a step of of joining the to
[377.6s] be prayed for it is very sure that those
[380.5s] people are understanding what is being
[382.1s] taught. Therefore in the classes of
[383.8s] education I saw people getting to
[386.4s] understand what redemption is because
[388.1s] all of us we are deciding to be set to
[391.0s] be saved. No one will not desire not to
[394.0s] be saved to be saved because what we
[395.8s] want is redemption. That's the central
[397.6s] theme what is to be preached and
[399.1s] therefore people must understand the
[400.3s] plan of redemption and I saw that they
[402.2s] were able to understand it. Oh all right
[404.3s] thank you. Thank you uh evangelist
[407.1s] Jeffnik. So uh our
[410.0s] viewers I would like to inform you that
[412.4s] this is just one of the speakers of this
[416.8s] convention and uh he has played a key
[419.6s] role uh by giving us the topic about the
[424.5s] true education and I know that this is
[427.6s] one of the subjects that is bringing
[429.9s] contention among the reformers among the
[433.7s] children even of the world. So uh I
[437.1s] would wish that uh may God help us and
[441.0s] uh if you want to learn more as I've
[442.6s] said just go back to our the description
[445.8s] down there I'm going I'm going to put a
[447.5s] link that is going to direct you to all
[449.8s] those series about education. Now to
[452.8s] bring this to a close uh uh um to Mishi.
[455.7s] Yes. Uh we have uh many people who are
[461.2s] are still not having the depth
[463.6s] understanding when it comes to
[465.2s] education. So maybe what can you tell
[468.4s] them where where did you get all these
[470.6s] informations from so that their minds
[473.0s] may be directed well to get the right
[476.1s] understanding as you do? What can you
[478.0s] tell them? Where is the where do we get
[479.9s] all these truths from or where did you
[482.6s] learn all these truths about education?
[485.1s] Thank you for that. One of the thing
[487.0s] that I will desire to tell the viewers
[489.9s] that if we don't understand what
[492.2s] education is in other words we cannot
[494.5s] get you cannot be redeemed. In other
[497.1s] words, you cannot be saved without
[498.7s] education. And therefore it comes to a
[501.4s] personal
[503.0s] uh responsibility to everyone that
[505.7s] everyone who desiring for eternal life
[507.8s] must strive to understand the true
[511.1s] science of what? Education. And
[512.8s] therefore like we said as we beginning
[514.9s] that the central theme of the Bible is
[517.4s] educate education. One of our things
[519.3s] that we need to understand that the
[520.9s] Bible will always en line 10 human mind
[524.6s] on every point of doctrine in everything
[527.1s] because the book that is 2 Timothy 3:16
[530.9s] says that all things in the scriptures
[533.0s] are there to train us so that we might
[535.0s] be good people and therefore one of the
[537.7s] sources of the truth that is going to
[541.0s] sanctify the soul and lead to the
[543.5s] perfect redemption are in the in the
[546.1s] Bible that is why we are always being
[548.3s] admonished that we need to study the
[549.8s] Bible daily. Amen. And therefore, us
[552.6s] being an Adventist, another source of
[554.9s] our truth, we know as Adventist that our
[556.9s] creed is the the Bible. We realize that
[559.7s] God gave the church the gift of the
[562.0s] spirit of what? Prophecy. And therefore,
[564.2s] there's also another source of light
[566.0s] that is the spirit of through prophecy.
[568.0s] And we believe that the spirit of
[569.4s] prophecy is manifested in the writings
[571.7s] of Ellen Ellen White. And Ellen White is
[573.9s] also speaking that let the dead speak,
[576.6s] the dead speak. M says that the dead
[579.8s] speak for people of God living in the
[582.2s] last days we need to understand what the
[585.3s] servant of God meaning because the dead
[587.4s] cannot do what cannot speak and
[589.0s] therefore she explains that can only
[591.0s] speak through their what their writings
[592.7s] and she says we need to study the
[594.9s] writings of pioneers pioneers like Jones
[600.0s] Stephankell log James
[603.2s] White we need to study their work their
[605.9s] work I tell that Stephan was explaining
[609.8s] the book of Daniel chapter 4. You go to
[612.2s] expl when he explains Daniel chapter 11,
[614.5s] the whole theme of Daniel chapter 4 and
[616.2s] Daniel chapter 11 is always that system
[619.5s] of educ education and is trying to tell
[621.8s] us that we need to have an education
[624.1s] education that is higher than the even
[627.1s] education the universities of the the
[629.2s] world because that is the only education
[630.6s] that is going to be accepted in heaven.
[633.4s] Let me assure the viewers that the
[634.9s] education can only be obtained in the
[636.7s] schools of the pro the prophets prophets
[638.5s] and therefore God is calling us to be
[641.2s] men who are going to study the
[642.4s] scriptures and the spirit of prophecy
[644.3s] enlightening the truth in Jesus name. Oh
[647.0s] thank you thank you to me. Uh there is
[649.8s] this book that uh you've used so much
[653.2s] written by someone like uh stherlands.
[655.8s] Yeah. Uh what is the title of that book?
[658.0s] The title of that book is uh studies on
[660.9s] Christian education. studies on
[663.2s] Christian education. Can you recommend
[664.8s] it to the viewers because it is such a
[667.2s] powerful book when it comes to
[669.1s] education. Thank you for that. I'll
[672.2s] recommend it to the viewers. Number one,
[674.2s] we need to understand that
[675.7s] Southerntherlands was a principle, a
[678.6s] teacher in the Madison school. Madison
[681.8s] school is a school that was established
[683.4s] by the seventh adventist and therefore
[686.0s] he explains and I let me just give them
[689.4s] a brief overview of what is in the book.
[691.7s] If you want to know the history of 1844,
[693.7s] what happened to the remuneration of
[695.4s] 1844, the best book to study is studies
[698.5s] on Christian education by Netherlands.
[700.7s] And therefore, children of God who are
[703.0s] listening to me, what you need to
[704.2s] understand that each one of us needs to
[706.7s] get that book to study it deeply and
[709.5s] therefore those things that happened to
[711.4s] each movement happened unto them for our
[715.2s] examples that we seventh day Adventists
[717.0s] who are living in the last days need to
[718.7s] understand our position as a people.
[720.8s] spoken. Amen. Thank you. Thank you,
[722.6s] Mishi. That is powerful. So, uh viewers,
[725.4s] there is a book called studies on
[727.4s] Christian education written by one who
[730.4s] is speaking at a point of information
[732.4s] that is southerntherlands. So, in the
[734.6s] description go down there uh I've
[736.7s] attached the link to the book and uh I
[739.9s] know that it is going to be a great
[741.8s] blessing. He was one of the principles
[744.6s] in Madison school and we know that
[746.6s] Madison school is the blueprint where we
[749.3s] can find the blueprint of true
[751.0s] education. So I I hope you are blessed
[753.6s] and uh maybe uh um Tumishi. Yes. Uh
[757.1s] maybe as we bring this to a close you
[759.2s] can uh give us maybe your last remarks.
[762.7s] uh you can give the viewers your last
[764.4s] remark just just in a in a nutshell or
[766.2s] in a in a short way so that uh the
[768.9s] viewers can uh can actually know that uh
[774.2s] uh the
[775.2s] ministry is doing much and uh there are
[779.3s] a lot of people that actually they don't
[782.2s] understand these truths. So what can you
[785.1s] maybe as you give your close remarks
[787.4s] what can you tell us? What I can tell
[789.9s] the viewers is that uh now as never
[792.3s] before we need to understand the two
[794.3s] science of education. If we fail to
[796.5s] understand this we shall not have a
[799.4s] place in the kingdom of god of of god.
[801.6s] Therefore let's try let's get connected
[804.5s] to the ministry through our media so
[807.0s] that we need to we we we understand the
[809.7s] true science of education and that is
[812.2s] eternal life. All right. Amen. Thank
[814.2s] you. So
[815.2s] uh thank you so much for uh watching up
[818.7s] to this far and uh I know it has been a
[822.2s] blessing. It has been uh an insightful
[825.6s] discussion and we still ask for your
[828.5s] support. uh those who love the truth, we
[830.6s] still ask of your support because uh the
[833.6s] other day we were having a brother from
[836.0s] SIA and uh he really wish that the truth
[838.9s] to reach the home and you saw that one
[841.3s] of the truth that he rejoiced in is the
[844.1s] true education. The other day we are
[846.7s] also also having a sister called Jalenza
[849.4s] from Karungu. She also rejoiced in the
[853.4s] message of the true education. So it
[856.0s] means that youths are accepting this
[857.9s] message. The parents are accepting this
[859.7s] message and also uh the children and
[863.3s] therefore we we really uh request your
[867.0s] support so that we may uh uh make this
[870.6s] truth now to be realistic by
[873.1s] establishing our own institutions by
[875.7s] establishing our own vocational
[877.7s] trainings through your supports. God's
[880.0s] work needs people that needs people that
[883.3s] are going to join forces in these last
[885.1s] days to bring support to the cause of
[887.4s] God. Otherwise, may God bless you all. I
[889.4s] know you are going to respond positively
[891.4s] when the duty is going to call. Thank
[893.6s] you and may God bless you. M
