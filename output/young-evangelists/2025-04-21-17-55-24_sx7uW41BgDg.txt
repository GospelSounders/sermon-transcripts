FULL TRANSCRIPT:
they were really doing uh according to the Lord's will. Then it went verse verse verse. And then we have in the end a church. It's number six. It's Philadelphia. And what do we know about Philadelphia? Philadelphia was the church where there was no rebuke and only praise. It I would say from all the seven churches was the best because even was really good had a small rebuke. Yeah. And then the laudisa it's embarrassing. We don't even want to talk about it. There's no praise at all and a lot of rebuke. So we we have to admit that we are part of these and it's not so nice. Uh and we see around the state of Christianity nowadays. It's not as we want it to be. Maybe in some place it's a little better. I'm sure here it's a little bit better. In our place it's medium. And in some places maybe really bad. So um what was taking place in the time of the early church? In the time of the early church with Ephesus. I um we have here some texts where it says for example and there was um Philillip and he had four daughters who prophesied. And then Paul was saying to the ladies, "Hey ladies, please please please if if you prophesy please wear a head covering." So they were prophet prophesying all the time. So it was very common that there were prophecies that the Lord came over the men and women and gave prophecies. It was very common. So common that the Lord had to say please wear a head covering all all these prophecies. Please at least wear a head covering. So it was very common at that time. We I don't know anything about um prophets in the time between Ephesus and Philadelphia. probably there were here and there one but not much at least they're not very well known I I don't know any maybe you know some uh then we know um in the time of Philadelphia do you know a prophet who was living in the time Philadelphia as far as I know it was between 1798 and about 1900 maybe 1920 do you know any who was living at that time who was it okay yeah so we agree in that there at least one we know maybe there were more I don't know but at least one we know uh unfortunately she's not living anymore and uh as we found out uh in the church of Laisa there's not not so much there's no praise at all so um maybe that has something to do with that we don't have a prophet today or do you know a prophet amongst us is there a prophet here did did you know any somewhere could it could be could be There's somewhere a prophet. I I was thinking long. I didn't come up with one. Uh but maybe you have one here. Can I Does anybody know of a prophet nowadays? Yeah, there's one again. Yeah, false prophets were always around. Yeah, that that's that's that's um unfortunately the case, I'm sure. um for every for every true prophet, Satan will send five false prophets to uh make us um confused. That's unfortunately the case. So, but but um I mean here it's it's it's a nice group here of people who really want to go with the Lord, who really dedicate their lives for his service, who were who were really um devoted to the Lord. So that makes me very happy. And when we combine here uh the text that we're we're reading. So at uh Eli's time there was no prophet because uh the word of the lord was very rare because the leaders were really in a very bad um apostasy. In the times of Ephesus there were loads of prophets because the people were really faithful to to the teachings of Jesus. Then there was nothing. And then there was the church Philadelphia which had only praise. There was a very big prophet. And um then there was nothing anymore because we're now in Laosa. But we have also the promise from Acts two that in the end your sons and daughters will have dreams and your ancients and your old men and women will have visions. And even that's a quote from Joel chapter 2 where even he was prophesying in the end time at the very end we will have many um visions and dreams. So since I see now with a lot of joy in my heart that people are coming back to where they should be. We are coming back to the message that were was preached in the time of Philadelphia. I think we agree in this that all these things that we learn here about the father and the son and many other things about country living and health reform and and clothes reform and all these reforms that's that's just going back to the time of Philadelphia. So if we have really um groups here with uh lots of people who go back to the teachings that we know from Philadelphia from that time that were uh rediscovered at that time. I mean they were not new but at that time they were really keeping them. So we can expect that the Lord will be merciful to us again and he will send us also some visions and some prophe prophecies from some people and I wouldn't be surprised if one day like in a group like this somebody will come in in the morning and say oh brothers and sisters you know what this this night an angel came and you know what he said we should do this and this and he explained that Bible text and he was saying to me this and this yeah that was so unbelievable And uh don't don't laugh about him. Don't kick him out. I think that's that's what we can expect that will happen. And so don't be so um judgmental about these thing this person who might come. You can prove him. There are lots of proofs we have in the Bible. There will definitely come also some who will who will claim that. But there are wrong prophets. We have good Bible knowledge here in our group and many other groups nowadays. So you can prove. So what did he say? Uh ah okay. He met in he was in heaven. He met Abraham. Ah, forget it. Sit down. We don't want to hear you. He He is against the Bible. But Abraham is dead. So you we we can understand um if if everything that he says is in um conformity with the Bible that we know, I think very well now. um and his life is in in um accordance with the reforms and and he's a good Christian and unselfish and uh he's a loving person then and he's um yeah all these tests that we have then he's fulfilling them or or she it might be a she and it says the sons and daughters it will be also uh ladies elderly ladies and young ladies will have dreams and visions So this is what um I want to tell we what we can expect for the last days. We need special guidance. We have a lot of guidance here from uh Ellen White. But for the last days we might need some more that we can really be sure that there will I mean even she wrote that there will be still many things that we have to unlearn and learn and uh truth is progressive and we will learn more things. So there might be uh a ne necessity even especially in these last days when there are coming some problems that we don't really know how to react. I mean we had all the all these vaccines and there might come other problems uh in this world where we really not sure what what to do. Should we go this way or this way and then it might be very well um that God will give us special guidance. So this I wanted to encourage you to be aware of this and everybody leads a life that he might be the one or maybe even everyone uh can be enlightened directly by dreams and visions by the lord because uh it says here um in I think it was in first Corinthians strive to um have have visions and prophecies. It's it's it's something that we can desire. So that's what I wanted to say to you and I want to encourage you to continue on your road. I'm really happy to see all these faithful people. Uh go with the Lord and may you be blessed.

TIMESTAMPED TRANSCRIPT:
[0.1s] they were really doing uh according to
[2.5s] the Lord's will. Then it went verse
[5.2s] verse verse. And then we have in the end
[7.8s] a church. It's number six. It's
[10.8s] Philadelphia. And what do we know about
[12.9s] Philadelphia? Philadelphia was the
[14.6s] church where there was no rebuke and
[18.6s] only praise. It I would say from all the
[21.7s] seven churches was the best because even
[24.9s] was really good had a small rebuke.
[27.5s] Yeah. And then the laudisa it's
[30.5s] embarrassing. We don't even want to talk
[32.2s] about it. There's no praise at all and a
[34.1s] lot of rebuke. So we we have to admit
[37.8s] that we are part of these and it's not
[41.3s] so nice. Uh and we see around the state
[44.3s] of Christianity nowadays. It's not as we
[48.0s] want it to be. Maybe in some place it's
[50.7s] a little better. I'm sure here it's a
[52.6s] little bit better. In our place it's
[54.5s] medium. And in some places maybe really
[56.9s] bad.
[57.9s] So
[59.7s] um what was taking place in the time of
[63.6s] the early church? In the time of the
[65.9s] early church with Ephesus. I um we have
[70.2s] here some texts where it says for
[72.8s] example and there was um Philillip and
[76.4s] he had four daughters who
[78.3s] prophesied. And then Paul was saying to
[81.7s] the ladies, "Hey ladies, please please
[83.0s] please if if you prophesy please wear a
[85.8s] head covering." So they were prophet
[87.4s] prophesying all the time. So it was very
[89.8s] common that there were prophecies that
[92.0s] the Lord came over the men and women and
[94.4s] gave prophecies. It was very common. So
[96.7s] common that the Lord had to
[98.5s] say please wear a head covering all all
[101.2s] these prophecies. Please at least wear a
[103.0s] head covering. So it was very common at
[105.9s] that
[106.8s] time. We I don't know anything about um
[111.4s] prophets in the time between Ephesus and
[114.2s] Philadelphia. probably there were here
[115.8s] and there one but not much at least
[117.5s] they're not very well known I I don't
[119.4s] know any maybe you know some uh then we
[121.9s] know um in the time of Philadelphia do
[125.4s] you know a prophet who was living in the
[127.3s] time Philadelphia as far as I know it
[129.3s] was between 1798 and about 1900 maybe
[133.6s] 1920 do you know any who was living at
[136.8s] that
[138.6s] time who was it
[143.5s] okay yeah so we agree in that there at
[145.5s] least one we know maybe there were more
[147.4s] I don't know but at least one we know uh
[149.8s] unfortunately she's not living anymore
[152.6s] and uh as we found out uh in the church
[156.7s] of Laisa there's not not so much there's
[160.2s] no praise at all so um maybe that has
[163.4s] something to do with that we don't have
[165.6s] a prophet today or do you know a prophet
[167.4s] amongst us is there a prophet here did
[170.6s] did you know any somewhere could it
[173.2s] could be could be There's somewhere a
[174.9s] prophet. I I was thinking long. I didn't
[177.4s] come up with one. Uh but maybe you have
[179.9s] one here. Can I Does anybody know of a
[183.5s] prophet
[185.8s] nowadays? Yeah, there's
[188.4s] one again.
[195.8s] Yeah, false prophets were always around.
[197.6s] Yeah, that that's that's that's um
[199.8s] unfortunately the case, I'm sure. um for
[203.3s] every for every true prophet, Satan will
[205.8s] send five false prophets to uh make us
[209.5s] um confused. That's unfortunately the
[213.2s] case. So, but but um I mean here it's
[219.0s] it's it's a nice group here of people
[220.6s] who really want to go with the Lord, who
[222.5s] really dedicate their lives for his
[224.2s] service, who were who were really um
[227.7s] devoted to the Lord. So that makes me
[230.5s] very happy. And when we combine here uh
[234.3s] the text that we're we're reading. So at
[237.2s] uh Eli's time there was no prophet
[240.3s] because uh the word of the lord was very
[242.6s] rare because the leaders were really in
[244.9s] a very bad um
[247.5s] apostasy. In the times of Ephesus there
[250.1s] were loads of prophets because the
[251.8s] people were really faithful to to the
[254.3s] teachings of Jesus. Then there was
[256.6s] nothing. And then there was the church
[258.8s] Philadelphia which had only praise.
[261.1s] There was a very big prophet. And um
[264.3s] then there was nothing anymore because
[266.0s] we're now in Laosa. But we have also the
[269.4s] promise from Acts two that in the end
[273.0s] your sons and daughters will have dreams
[274.9s] and your ancients and your old men and
[277.9s] women will have visions. And even that's
[281.4s] a quote from Joel chapter 2 where even
[284.6s] he was prophesying in the end time at
[287.2s] the very end we will have many um
[289.8s] visions and dreams. So since I see now
[294.5s] with a lot of joy in my heart that
[296.5s] people are coming back to where they
[299.0s] should be. We are coming back to the
[300.9s] message that were was preached in the
[303.0s] time of Philadelphia. I think we agree
[305.4s] in this that all these things that we
[307.1s] learn here about the father and the son
[309.3s] and many other things about country
[311.6s] living and health reform and and clothes
[314.0s] reform and all these reforms that's
[316.1s] that's just going back to the time of
[318.3s] Philadelphia. So if we have really um
[321.5s] groups here with uh lots of people who
[325.0s] go back to the teachings that we know
[327.4s] from Philadelphia from that time that
[329.4s] were uh rediscovered at that time. I
[332.2s] mean they were not new but at that time
[333.8s] they were really keeping them. So we can
[337.4s] expect that the Lord will be merciful to
[339.8s] us again and he will send us also some
[343.0s] visions and some prophe prophecies from
[346.0s] some people and I wouldn't be surprised
[349.0s] if one day like in a group like this
[351.5s] somebody will come in in the morning and
[353.2s] say oh brothers and sisters you know
[355.3s] what this this night an angel came and
[357.5s] you know what he said we should do this
[359.0s] and this and he explained that Bible
[361.3s] text and he was saying to me this and
[363.3s] this yeah that was so unbelievable And
[365.7s] uh don't don't laugh about him. Don't
[367.6s] kick him out. I think that's that's what
[369.9s] we can expect that will happen. And so
[372.3s] don't be so um judgmental about these
[375.5s] thing this person who might come. You
[377.8s] can prove him. There are lots of proofs
[379.7s] we have in the Bible. There will
[381.3s] definitely come also some who will who
[383.4s] will claim that. But there are wrong
[385.0s] prophets. We have good Bible knowledge
[387.3s] here in our group and many other groups
[389.7s] nowadays. So you can prove. So what did
[392.2s] he say? Uh ah okay. He met in he was in
[395.2s] heaven. He met Abraham. Ah, forget it.
[397.4s] Sit down. We don't want to hear you. He
[399.5s] He is against the Bible. But Abraham is
[401.9s] dead. So you we we can understand um if
[405.2s] if everything that he says is in um
[408.2s] conformity with the Bible that we know,
[410.5s] I think very well now. um and his life
[414.5s] is in in um accordance with the reforms
[419.2s] and and he's a good Christian and
[421.3s] unselfish and uh he's a loving person
[425.0s] then and he's um yeah all these tests
[429.3s] that we have then he's fulfilling them
[431.5s] or or she it might be a she and it says
[433.8s] the sons and daughters it will be also
[436.5s] uh ladies elderly ladies and young
[438.6s] ladies will have dreams and visions So
[441.8s] this is what um I want to tell we what
[445.1s] we can expect for the last days. We need
[447.5s] special guidance. We have a lot of
[449.5s] guidance here from uh Ellen White. But
[452.6s] for the last days we might need some
[454.6s] more that we can really be sure that
[457.0s] there will I mean even she wrote that
[458.9s] there will be still many things that we
[460.5s] have to unlearn and learn and uh truth
[463.2s] is progressive and we will learn more
[465.1s] things. So there might be uh a ne
[468.2s] necessity even especially in these last
[470.6s] days when there are coming some problems
[473.1s] that we don't really know how to react.
[475.3s] I mean we had all the all these vaccines
[477.3s] and there might come other problems uh
[480.0s] in this world where we really not sure
[482.2s] what what to do. Should we go this way
[484.4s] or this way and then it might be very
[487.0s] well um that God will give us special
[490.3s] guidance. So this I wanted to encourage
[492.6s] you to be aware of this and everybody
[495.3s] leads a life that he might be the one or
[498.4s] maybe even everyone uh can be
[500.5s] enlightened directly by dreams and
[502.4s] visions by the lord because uh it says
[505.7s] here um in I think it was in first
[509.2s] Corinthians strive to um have have
[512.5s] visions and prophecies. It's it's it's
[514.6s] something that we can desire. So that's
[517.2s] what I wanted to say to you and I want
[518.9s] to encourage you to continue on your
[520.6s] road. I'm really happy to see all these
[523.0s] faithful people. Uh go with the Lord and
[526.9s] may you be blessed.
