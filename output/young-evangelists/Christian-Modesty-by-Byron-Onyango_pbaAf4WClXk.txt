FULL TRANSCRIPT:
to work for the salvation of men and women without presenting them the need of breaking away from the sinful gratifications which destroy what? So anything that is going to destroy health and debates the soul and prevent divine truth from impressing the mind must be discarded because what injures the health? It hinders physical, mental and what? spiritual and for us to be well all these things must be in harmony. Now in the education of children and youth because we are in a Bible convention. So it is very clear when you read that is child guidance page 392 paragraph 2 this is what it says in the education of children and youth they should be done what they should be taught that the habits of number one number two and number three dressing which have been formed after the world's standard are not in accordance with the laws of health and what and life they must be taught. Now read with me this book. This is a book of Romans 12 from verse one. 12:1 the book of Romans. What does it say? 12:1 the book of Romans. Someone from the congregation. As the Bible says, hey, beseech you therefore, I beseech you therefore, hey, by the mercies of God, it says, allow me to read. I beseech you, bre therefore, brethren, by the mercies of God that you present your bodies a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable unto which is your reasonable what? Service. So it means that God is calling us to present our bodies as a dead or a dying sacrifice living. As a living, what will happen when we present a dying or a dead sacrifice? Will it be acceptable unto God? No. So for it to be accepted, we must work diligently to give a living and a what? Read with me. That you present your bodies as a living sacrifice. Number one, holy and acceptable unto. Do you know that God, he cannot accept your service then reject you? Praise God. God will accept you with your sacrifice. Let me give you an example of Cain. God rejected accepted the sacrifice of Abel. And he also accepted Abel. When he rejected the sacrifice of Cain, he also rejected who? So God cannot actually accept your sacrifice then reject you. He first accepts you then accept the s the sacrifice because sacrifice cannot come by itself. It must come from you. So when we are called that we present our bodies, it is not actually spiritual. It is very physical and it should be understood in a literal way that we present this body as a living because God wants people who are healthy so that they may preach the gospel that he has given them. Praise God. And I know that we are going to see some of the things that are restoring our health. Be it the minutest of it, we are going to correct so that we be healthy the way God want us to be. Because when we are seeing sin, what are we seeing? We are seeing when we are seeing disease, we are seeing sin and its consequences. J. So when we are seeing sin, when we are seeing diseases, what should come in our minds? Sin. Now continue here. What will you say? You know many people you are telling them to come out of the what? To get out of the road. Why? Because there is something coming. What is he saying? What what is he saying? So what is it that is always common to us as human beings? When we are corrected, we are saying we are judged. When someone is correcting you not to fornicate, you are saying don't judge misjudgment or sin. When you are told to wear this and wear this, you are saying God's judgment is coming. And when you are corrected, you are saying don't judge me. Do you think this person is going to remain alive? Do you think will he remain alive? No. The same thing is coming because when we are not going to follow the laws of health here, what is going to result are diseases that is going to destroy our body and we are going to lose all our money. We are going to lose all our time in hospitals trying to restore that which you could have corrected with that simple change of lifestyle and when Christ is going to come you are going to suffer the consequences of misusing the health that he has given you. So my friends that is what is coming and when we are warning you to come out of it we are not judging anyone. So when we are going to say that braiding is not godly, it is something that is from men, it is devilish by nature itself, then we need to accept because God's judgment is coming to they that are calling his his name. But to believers and to not believe, then believe us. So don't say you are judged, but accept the call that you may move out of the way to be safe when the judgment come judgment comes. Praise God. Now this is how the pastor is preaching. This is how things happen when uh the preaches the truth is presented. God is just concerned with your heart. The way I dress does not matter. What did we read last time that our address are constant what? Constant preachers. Now let me continue. When you read this book testimonies to South Africa, this is 87 paragraph 2. It says, "Educate, educate, educate in the what?" In the dress, the words of scriptures in regard to dress should be carefully where you not talking should be carefully considered. We need to understand that which that which the Lord of heaven appreciates even the dressing of the bo of the body. So they must be carefully considered. When you don't consider them my friends, the the service you are offering it is not going to be accepted by God. You can be a good carer with a good voice. You can transpose your tenor but the way you dress makes God not to accept your your service. Another thing the working of the spirit of God uh the working of the spirit of God inwardly will show a change outward. That is why we read the book evangelism to 72 where we said that the question of grace will not be the main what because we have a lot of things that we need to be what to be studying or to be pointing to people that is that is Christ. So we said very well that it should be working from inward out. When Christ is in the art it will be shown outwardly. Now the fashion because this is the problem. The fashion. Where's my phone? The fashion. The fashion eco. I want to read you something here. The fashion. Mhm. Now when you read here uh the fashion is a tyrannical mistress. The fashion is a tyrant. Do you know someone who is a tyrant? Tyrant is like a dictator. This is the spirit of papacy. Tyrant is like a dictator. He dictates. He will not allow you to he will not give actually the room for argument. When he has said right right when he said left left, he will not allow the room for what? for argument. So you need to understand that fashion is a tyrannical what? Mistress. I want to give you something here. Passion being a tyrannical tyrannical mistress. Passion a tyrannical mistress. It says that fashion is deteriorating the intellect. Fashion is deteriorating the intellect and eating out the spirituality of our what? Of our people. You know the testimonies were not written to those people who are in the world. It were written to those people who are inside the church. So this message is for us. Can we be in the church yet fashion is eating our spirituality? Passion is deteriorating the intellect and eating out intellect and it is deteriorating the intellect and eating out the spirituality of our obedience to fashion is pervading our seventh day adventist. You know when we speaking of seventh day adventist churches we are not speaking of general conference because they are already in apostate they have become Babylon. So the seventh day adventist churches we are speaking about is you and I who have received the present what so we are seeing that obedience to fashion is pervading our seventh day Adventist church and is doing more than any other power to separate our people from who? So if there is a tool that the devil is going to use to separate us from God, what is it? So is it a subject that is worth consideration? Yes. Now get here. This is child guidance for 32 paragraph 1. It says fashion is a tyrannical ruler. That is the title. Fashion rules the world and she is a tyrannical mistress often compelling her devotees to submit to the greatest inconvenience and discomfort. fashion taxes without reason and collects without. Do you know tax? Are you getting the point now? It says that Uhhuh. He says that uhhuh often compelling her devotees to submit to the greatest inconvenience and discomfort. We are going to see how people are taxed into greatest inconvenience and their lives are being deteriorated and the only thing that they doing they're submitting to the to the fashion because as demanded she's a master. She's a master. And what is she paying is what is written in the book of Romans 6:23. The wages of sin is death. She will pay you debt. She will pay you diseases and she will make you to lie in nos and waste your time and resources. Now it's saying that fashion taxes without reason and collects without m. She has a fascinating power and stands ready to criticize. Do you know those people who love to who knows how to criticize when you tell him right? I think you know the critics he knows and stands ready to criticize and radical all who do not follow in her what in her wake but friends I've come to tell you that by following fashions we are not going to go far and in fact our people we are going to deteriorate at the greatest levels when our people are going to embrace fashions of the world. So we need to be very careful when it comes to issues of fashion because it was bringing a problem in the times of LG White and the same time it is bringing the problem today. Let me use the Babylonian 7th day Adventist while about their postit in a one in a in a in a in a choir you can find a video being recorded one single video of 3 minutes. Then in that one video it has the choir members by the end of the video change more than five there are more than what they're more than so are they advertising the clothes or what are they doing is it a fashion what how do you call it a fashion show where people are advertising the manner of clothes and people are competing of the of the fashion that have arrived of the beauty and everything. I want you to think of that and that is where you'll find that a member has 10 uniforms which the least amount is how many is how much 2,000 I'm 3,000 but does not have even a single B single Bible because people want to to reach the what the fashion very dangerous so fashion is a tyrannical mistress she's a dictator in fact the Bible says she not even he she is a a tyran helical mistress. Now when you read here there is a terrible curse by the way that is resting upon the church and as a people when we are not taking this in consideration there is a terrible curse coming. It says that a terrible curse rest upon the church for allowing improper dress in its what? In its members. He says there is a terrible sin upon us as a people that we have permitted our members to dress in a manner inconsistent with their what? So there is a dress that is consistent with our faith and there is a dress that is not inconsistent with our what? Now when we allow this dress to be in our place and we are not containing them, what will be the result? There is a terrible curse of God resting upon the responsible people. Praise God. Now, too little attention is generally given to the prevential preservation of health. It is far better to prevent disease than to know how to do what? How to treat it when contracted. When you read Proverbs 26:2, it says that we need to handle the disease from the cause to the what? To effect. Sor read this book, the book of Matthew 3:10. 3:10. The book of Matthew. Mhm. Verse 10, the Bible says, "Uh-huh. And the Bible says, "And now also, and now also the axe is laid unto the root of the what? Of the trees. Therefore, every tree which bringeth not forth good fruit is healed down and cast into the what? Into the fire." So the tree by the way even when it comes to the principles of health the sister is giving us four principles to follow that the disease must be handled from the cost to what cause to effect and the same principle is being applied here because the book of Job says there is hope for a tree. It is only a tree that has not been cut from the root. That is that is the only tree that has hope. The same thing applies to the disease. The disease that has hope of coming back is a disease that has been handled from the what? From the effects to the cause. But when we handle a problem from its cause is like we are uprooting the tree. And when we uproot the tree there is no hope for that tree. It will never come back. And even for us today when these diseases that are disturbing people in their lives when we handle them from their courses then we have a sure result that they will never do what they will never come back. Now we need to be acquainted because the problem is we are not actually acquainted with our anatomy and what and our physiology the structure of how God created us. That is what is bringing the problem because for you to wear high heels that makes you now to walk this way. Do you think you understand your anatomy and physiology? You walk this way in the church. Do you think it is safe? Praise God. understood and that is the secret. Praise God. Let me continue. It says all need to become acquainted with their physical are you are you in class? They all need to become acquainted with their physical structure. That is anatomy and the laws that control natural laws and that is physio. He who remains in willing ignorance of the laws of phys is physical being and who violates them through ignorance is sinning against who? So ignorance concerning anatomy and physiology is a sin against who? So all of us must learn anatomy and what? So it says all should place themselves in the best possible relation to life and what our habits should be brought under the control of a mind that is itself under the control of God. So when you allow the tyrannical mistress to rule you, God is not ruling you. And that is why we are saying you are sinning against who? Against God. Now look upon this video. I want you to see I to see it kely. Down there. [Music] What time? Leave it. [Music] Heat. [Music] Heat. Heat. Heat. [Music] the video first. The body should be allowed to function as normal as possible. [Music] Heat. Heat. [Music] Note that your body is the temple of who? Your body is the temple of the Holy Ghost which is in you which you have of who? And you are not your what? You are bought with what? Therefore glorify God in your word and in your which are whose. So anything that is deteriorating our health, we need to correct on that. And that is why the spirit of prophecy is very clear that as the people of God dress message there is a need of us preaching the dress reform. When you read the book selected messages book two page 43 paragraph one it says that my sisters and my brothers there is a need of dress reform among us. We are wearing it is very wanting until there is no proper circulation of what? Of blood. Very dangerous. Now the other day I was speaking of the of the and I bring this to show you Go and look. I know one of us here. Are you seeing that? How many's parents feet are like that? I don't want to carry your hand. But how many wink s do you know the cause is because of small shoes? Get this. I want you to read with me this quotation. Uhhuh. This is a book uh the health reformer December 1st 1871 paragraph 10. It says the results of my friend's self-imposed miadom was the loss of health, peace of mind and natural beauty. She suffered the penalty of her folly in shattered nerves, swollen joints and deformed feet. The nails grew into her what? I could have showed you how the nails nails are growing inside the fle the flesh because do you think that is how God created that feet? What is the result? small small shoes this the nails. Okay. uh I don't know uh for example you see here when uh I I have a friend by the way in high school that he had to go to operation because of this go even in in Google Such such like for example a a a nail in the what? This is a a big a big toe I mean English nail in a big just you're going to see these things and they're going to see you to tell you even the effect the effects when this flesh many of the times It will not be the place of the what of the nail and you know the nail is growing naturally. So the the more the nail is growing and your grow and flesh it is not normal. They always feel pain and pass when pass and sometimes they go to operation so that this flesh to be cut so that the nail have a convenient space for it to grow and that is what is always happening there are medical research online and I've seen with my eyes those who know Evans I'm sorry for calling his name he suffered that thing in school. Now let me continue there. I think uh you now understand what I'm speaking about. Now let me continue here. I was reading health reformer page uh page what paragraph 10 that is pu 1871 December uh December 1st. It says that the nails grew into her flesh. That is a sup. The nails grew into her. The nails grew into her flesh. Nails can grow into your flesh when you compress your foot using your small shoes. The nails grew into her flesh. In ingrown tonally uh tone what? ing grown tonalist and caused the most extruding ex ex what excating suffering when I told her that this was in consequence of wearing what small so small shoes has a problem consequence of wearing small shoes she will not admit it she could not elevate is telling her So we need to correct that because you don't correct that it is a great problem and that is why the other time I was saying very well that when it comes to it is very dangerous for those people and you know when the leg is this way and I compress What? Do you see how it looks like the shape of a subooter? That is the thing. And says that these things make small shoes. It will not grow maturely the way it should be. That that is what will make a small child. Some of her easy to some are long and some deficient abnormal simply because they provide a good environment for it to grow natural. Naturally you are compressing it and that is very dangerous. Now I want to show you here what then should we teach? Teach the people how to prevent disease. Tell them to cease rebelling against what? Nature's laws. An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of what? Of kiwa. An ounce of prevention is worth a what? A pound of of kiwa. Extremist or limbs should be covered. Now here another evil which custom fosters is the unequal distribution of clo of clothing. The feet and the limbs being removed from the vital organs should be especially guarded from cold by abundant water. Now the question can be asked that when the limbs should be because they are very far from the system they need to be covered more than anything. They need to be covered more than anything but most of us much of the stress all is okay. Now read here number one the health cannot be enjoyed where there is no unequal distribution of what circulation of the blood. Therefore we advocate that the limbs of women should not be exposed but sensibly neatly and comfortably what clad is the problem of the diseases. Another thing here what are the limbs? arms or what? Or legs of a person or a four-legged animal. So when I speak of the limbs, it is not actually but also the arms. Praise God. All of them are what are limbs. So when inspiration is saying that the limbs also should be covered, then does it does it say that we need to to cover both the arms and the feet? That is what it means. It is inappropriate. Uhhuh. Uh it says the limbs were not formed. That is 2T page 531 paragraph 3. The limbs were not formed by our creator to endure exposure as was the what? As was the face. They were not created to endure the same cold, to endure the same heat. It is only face protective to endure all those climates. But when it comes to the limbs, it was not it was not so. So when our limbs are facing the same environment, we are allowing them to face the same heat as is the what is the is the face then there is a problem. Another evil which are the feet another line there the feet and limbs being removed from the vital organs should be especially guarded from cold by abundant wash clothing. So from this do you think short sleeve? What do you think of short sleeve shirt? What do you think of short sleeve shirt? Sat shirt. What do you think of it? Praise God. What do you think of it? Is it dangerous to the health? Is it? Yes. Because the the limbs in no matter by the way sometimes when you go to these these places a lot of heatffected but the sometimes remains to be no to be normal and that is very dangerous in it is impossible to have health when the extremities are habitual what cooled for if there is too little blood in them there will be too much in the portions of the body and by the way headache not because there is of anything but because you've you've worn a a short sleeve shirt because once your arms are cold the blood is not going to be supplied there efficiently meaning that other parts of the body are going to have excess blood like the brain and that is what will be causing headache. Praise God. Now it says perfect health requires a perfect what but perfect circulation but this cannot be while there while three or four times as much clothing is worn upon the body as upon the feet and my friend is it so shortle in my chest and everything I've covered them But my limbs are they are free. Elen is saying you cannot have a perfect health because there is no way you can have three or four times as much clothing worn upon the body as upon the what the feet and and limbs. So when you read down the all of them we should give a equal distribution of heat in the in the body. Now let me give you another one here. The limbs and feet have large veins to receive large amount of blood that warmth, nutrition, elasticity and strength may be imparted to them. But when the blood is chilled from these extremities, the blood vessels contract which makes the circulation of the necessary amount of blood in them still more what? Difficult. So we need to give body actually easy time because when you don't give them easy time there is a problem. And we will be going to simply because of adaption or regular wearing of the long sleeved what charts. I want to read something here. Mhm. I want to give you something here. Uh-huh. The limbs. Our creator. Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Just read. Our creator has formed. Our creator has formed the limbs with large veins and vessels to contain a large proportion of blood that the limbs may be sufficiently nourished and proportionately warmed with the other portions of the what? There must be equal distribution of heat in the bowl. But what robs the limbs of the coverings and the life current is chilled from its natural channel and thrown back upon its internal what? So what is depriving the limbs of what it requires passion there's a there is something I want to read for you so that you see all these things in a clear light. fashion child guidance for 27 paragraph one so that you see who brought these things we have sleeveless I didn't capture the photos here sleeveless cut book tople trousers short skirts All of those they are doing what? They're exposing our what? Our limbs. And we've said limbs concern the arms and the what? And the legs. Now read this quotation 427 paragraph one the book of what? Child guidance. It says Satan invented the fashions which leave the limbs exposed. may invent sleeveless may [Music] invents. Yes, by the way, the problem is do you think the arms are suffering? According to what we've read from the inspired word, they are suffering. So it says Satan invented the fashions which leave the limbs exposed chilling back the life current from its original course and parents bow at the shrine of fashion to uh and so clothe their children that the nerves and veins become contracted and do not answer the purpose that God designed they should. The result is habitually called feet and what hands. Those parents whose follow fashions instead of reason will have an account to render to God for thus robbing their children of health. This is parents being addressed. Do you know you'll have an account to render before God? By the way, most of the children and you know the Bible says that we need to teach our little children that God is not happy when seeing them in torn and filthy garments. Do you know that? And you know that the truth cannot place its delicate feet in the filthy environment. Praise God. So how will you convince this child up that he need to be neat? When he was young, you allowed him to roam around with torn garments and everything. Praise God. Very dangerous. So it says that parents, my friends, will have to give an account when you allow your children to roam around with what? with short-sleeved clothes. You don't cover their limbs well and they suffer diseases. You take them to hospital, they are dragged to death and some are laid under grave because of improper what? Immodesty dress. So we need to change and even for us for our ministers when you go to to buy a shirt from the inspiration you need actually to embrace the long sleeved what? Because it will be the one that will be complying to what is written. I want to show you something here. How do we clothe our bodies to maintain this proper what? Circulation. The limbs which should have even more covering than any other portion of the what? Because of their farthest from the center of the circulation are often not suitably protected while over the vital organs. Uhhuh. It says while over the vital organs where there is naturally more warmth than in any other portion of the body there is an undue proportion of what of covering from from the pain of inspiration we need to give burden upon clothing our limbs because they are far from heart and for them to maintain a proper circulation of the blood they need to be held by proper cover. Are we going back to the fig leaves or are we embracing the uh uh the the what the coats of skin that God clothed with Adam and Eve? That is the question I want you to read here. We must cover our limbs be it summer or what at all seasons bear arms and bear arms and leg. We think we think this mode of dressing must be recorded as one of the most prominent causes of uh prominent causes of summer compliance. In colder weather, congestion and inflammation of the lungs, congestion and inflammations of the brain, convulsions etc will result at all seasons. Congestion more or less is what is caused simply because of what is called uncovering of the limbs. I want to show you something here called the next list after this where I'm going to list the diseases that comes as a result that we are not closing our covering our limbs. So it says special attention special attention should be given to the extremities that they may be thoroughly they may be as thoroughly do you know what is thorough they may be as thoroughly clothed as the chest and the region over the what over the heart where the greatest amount of heat where is the greatest amount of the heat in order to equalize the circulation of the blood the clothing should be equally distributed upon the p upon the person that that equal warmth may be preserved in all parts of the what of the body. Now health problems related to not covering the arms and the limbs. The list is long but I've just given these ones for a start. Number one you have short shortness of breath for those who have experienced this. This is this is true. Many people are suffering this headaches, nose bleedings. You can just be nos bleeding because of this problem. The body is not is not heavenly distributed. We have the fullness in chest chest problem because of unequal distribution of heat in the body because we are not covering our limbs. Palputation of the heart. Irritation and restless heart failure. This thing my friends in a letter had what is called heart failure. Let me go back to children. The lips of our children should be done what? Thoroughly and score that should be thoroughly and sensibly covered or clad. Parents who dress their children with extremities naked or nearly so are sacrificing the health and the lives of their children to what? But you know that there is another altar here that people are sacrificing their children on. What is that altar? the order of her of not covering the limbs of the children. Let me repeat this quotation. Parents who parents who who dress their children with the extremities naked or merely so are sacrificing the health and their lives. Not just the health but also the what of their children to the what? To the fashion. Children are killed. Which commandment is that? Do not kill. Six cind get what the parents are doing? Children are killed by the manner in which they are watched. So when you have your siblings here, you need to take notes of this because many children are killed by the parents and by their siblings in which in the manner of which they what they are dressed left with bare arms and legs and with low naked what? dresses. It is a sin in the sight of heaven for parents to dress their children as the way they do. It is a sin before in the sight of heaven for parents to dress their children the way they are doing. Judgment shall run or shall rest upon the what? Upon the parents. How many are seeing that we need actually we need a reformation on this issue? May God help us because when God is not going to help us on this many of our children are going to be laid on grave because of very simple issues other related problems in digestion not because of but because of improper what you're not covering the extremities in a letter by the way praise Extraring constipating nerves and veins become contracted causing bad circulation. And by the way, this list comprises also when you're on a bad tight tight tight skin tight tight. Now it says uhhuh edma congestion of the lungs and everything. You can screenshot that it is online. I don't know our technician is not around. I don't know how we are helping those people online. Uhhuh. And many other more. Now I read this that who is the inventor of the sleeveless? Who is the inventor of the short sleeves? Who is the inventor of shorts? Who is the inventor of short skirts? Satan invents the version which leaves the limbs what? Exposed. It is Satan's design so to pervert every function of our being that life may be made miserable and God may be dishonored in the creation in the creatures he had he had created. Satan plans and pre premeditates ways that we can be made miserable. Satan kill a kill a time kill a time in how can I make the health of these people miserable very small praise God because he wants your health to be deteriorated because he knows that when your health is infled You cannot give God the perfect the perfect service that you ought to have given him. It is a solemn statement beloved on one a one that should take us to our knees. It is a it is a solemn statement one that should take us to our knees possibly before our wardrobe and make some decisions. Do you know that after this two weeks we need when we go back home we need to go back to our what our wardrobe. Do you know what is a wardrobe? Do you know that the some of us came with with clothes that we need to go back to our wardrobes and make a decision? It says certain plans and pre pre what meditates ways that we can be made miserable. How many are miserable because they are not dressing properly? How many? millions. It is a solemn statement, one that should take us to our knees. It is a solemn statement that should take us to our knees possibly be uh before our wardrobes and make what? Some decisions. Praise God. Charity. Which charity? Which charity is that? Is it charity? Is it a charitable work? What is the solution for that? If medical books are banned, what of dress? They need to be another thing. Because my friends there are some by the way you can modify so that and by the way you have some short sleeves maybe I don't say because we have this these are small you can put that short sleeve inside inside it is presentable for that praise God and it will help you to to distribute it heavenly now dress from reason and what don't just dress because don't just dress. Sometimes you need even to pray before you dress. It is manifest that most women do not think and act in reverence to dress from reason and reflect. They accept without questioning that which imposes upon what? Upon them. You are not dressing out of reason and reflection. You need to dress out of reason and what? Reflection. Another point in the preparation of the clothing, can you actually seek God's blessings on that? Do you think you can do that? May you bless this that God thank you for how many are always praying. Praise God. How many always pray? Let me connect this with the first angel's message. And I I saw another angel that is Revelation 14:6. And I saw another angel flying in the midst of what? Having the everlasting gospel to preach unto them that dwell on the on the what? And to and to every nation kindred and and he said with what? with a loud voice that we need to do what? We need to fear God. Number one to fear and give glory. Why? For the hour of his judgment is what? Did you see the guy showed you is the hour of judgment is coming? Yes. What should we do? We should we need to fear God and give glory. And what does the book of 1 Corinthians chapter 10:31, what does it say? Uh-huh. Whatsoever. Uh-huh. Let me read it. Says, "Wherefore whatsoever you eat or drink or whatsoever you do, do all to the glory of who?" Of God. So, by the way, is dressing something we do? Yes. Now when we are dressing we need to do it to the glory of and that is why when we are dressing up we need even to give we need to pray over it so that our dressing be of good influence upon nonbelievers and also upon the believers. We need to ask God is my dress giving glory and honor to you because when it is not doing that then it is contrary to the spirit of the gospel. To bring this to a close, it says when they really desire, I would ask, let me start in the preparation of their clothing, can they seek the Lord's blessing? I would ask of today who profess to believe present truth when they really desire an article of dress or some of convenience. Do they lay the matter before the Lord in prayer? Do you present that before that when you go sanctioned to know if his spirit will sanction that now beloved we need actually to make a change because when you don't make a change in this there is a great issue that is awaiting us and God is calling upon his children and when God is calling upon on his children. It is very serious. It is something that is worth consideration. It is worth consideration and I'll not talk of that. Women are always what are too often tempters. They are too often tempters. If women would only elevate their lives, they will be less danger through their what? Through their influence. Do you know that there are many people who are in the nin they are in the they're in the prisons because of how someone dressed somewhere. Do you know that they're in prisons because of how someone dressed somewhere and he was tempted and he raped today is in prison maybe for 30 years because someone who professed to be a seventh day Adventist somewhere somewhere and I wish that God may help us. We need to be daughters of Zion and we need not the daughters of God of Babylon. And it is time to change you. What was what was what was our topic? The Christian modesty. What was the subtopic? Dress, fashion, and what? And health. How many have understood something? May God bless us in Jesus name. Allow me to pray. Our heavenly father in heaven, we thank you because of your love that you have given us. I thank you because of the message of dress which is an index to our heart. May you help your children to be convicted upon their thoughts to make a sound decision that shall glorify your name. Forgive us of our past ignorances and where we had messed up and multiply us grace to ensure that we comply to your will which is the demands of heaven. Be with us I pray in Jesus holy name. Thank you. I to give uh uh some

TIMESTAMPED TRANSCRIPT:
[0.6s] to work for the salvation of men and
[2.9s] women without presenting them the need
[5.4s] of breaking away from the sinful
[8.8s] gratifications which destroy what? So
[11.9s] anything that is going to destroy health
[14.2s] and debates the soul and prevent divine
[16.9s] truth from impressing the mind must be
[21.6s] discarded because what injures the
[24.1s] health? It hinders physical, mental and
[28.2s] what? spiritual and for us to be well
[31.5s] all these things must be in harmony. Now
[35.4s] in the education of children and youth
[38.2s] because we are in a Bible convention. So
[40.6s] it is very clear when you read that is
[42.3s] child guidance page 392 paragraph 2 this
[46.9s] is what it says in the education of
[49.3s] children and youth they should be done
[52.2s] what they should be taught that the
[55.5s] habits of number one number two and
[59.4s] number three dressing which have been
[63.0s] formed after the world's standard are
[65.6s] not in accordance with the laws of
[67.2s] health and what and life they must be
[71.0s] taught. Now read with me this book. This
[72.9s] is a book of Romans 12 from verse
[77.7s] one. 12:1 the book of
[81.0s] Romans. What does it
[84.0s] say? 12:1 the book of Romans. Someone
[87.4s] from the
[90.0s] congregation. As the Bible
[92.2s] says, hey, beseech you therefore, I
[95.4s] beseech you therefore,
[98.7s] hey, by the mercies of
[103.1s] God, it says, allow me to read. I
[105.7s] beseech you, bre therefore, brethren, by
[108.0s] the mercies of God that you present your
[110.6s] bodies a living sacrifice, holy,
[114.1s] acceptable
[115.3s] unto which is your reasonable what?
[118.2s] Service. So it means that God is calling
[122.0s] us to present our bodies as a dead or a
[125.4s] dying sacrifice
[127.2s] living. As a
[129.5s] living, what will happen when we present
[132.3s] a dying or a dead
[134.4s] sacrifice? Will it be acceptable unto
[136.9s] God? No. So for it to be accepted, we
[140.4s] must work diligently to give a living
[144.3s] and a what?
[146.6s] Read with me. That you present your
[148.8s] bodies as a living sacrifice. Number
[152.0s] one, holy and acceptable unto. Do you
[156.6s] know that
[157.5s] God, he cannot accept your
[160.4s] service then reject you? Praise God. God
[164.7s] will accept you with your sacrifice. Let
[167.7s] me give you an example of
[169.6s] Cain. God rejected accepted the
[173.9s] sacrifice of Abel.
[176.6s] And he also accepted
[179.6s] Abel. When he rejected the sacrifice of
[182.6s] Cain, he also rejected who? So God
[186.4s] cannot actually accept your sacrifice
[189.0s] then reject you. He first accepts you
[193.3s] then accept the s the sacrifice because
[196.1s] sacrifice cannot come by itself. It must
[198.4s] come from you. So when we are called
[202.3s] that we present our bodies, it is not
[204.6s] actually spiritual. It is very physical
[206.6s] and it should be understood in a literal
[208.3s] way that we present this body as a
[211.7s] living because God wants people who are
[215.0s] healthy so that they may preach the
[217.2s] gospel that he has given them. Praise
[218.8s] God. And I know that we are going to see
[221.5s] some of the things that are restoring
[222.9s] our health. Be it the minutest of it, we
[225.4s] are going to correct so that we be
[226.9s] healthy the way God want us to be.
[229.4s] Because when we are seeing sin, what are
[231.0s] we seeing? We are seeing when we are
[233.7s] seeing disease, we are seeing sin and
[235.8s] its
[236.9s] consequences.
[243.0s] J. So when we are seeing sin, when we
[245.8s] are seeing diseases, what should come in
[247.4s] our
[248.4s] minds?
[250.0s] Sin. Now continue
[252.6s] here. What will you say? You know many
[256.2s] people you are telling them to come out
[258.6s] of the
[260.0s] what? To get out of the road. Why?
[263.6s] Because there is something
[273.7s] coming. What is he
[277.2s] saying? What what is he
[279.9s] saying? So what is it that is always
[282.6s] common to us as human beings? When we
[284.2s] are corrected, we are saying we are
[287.0s] judged. When someone is correcting you
[289.3s] not to fornicate, you are saying don't
[292.4s] judge misjudgment or sin. When you are
[294.6s] told to wear this and wear this, you are
[296.8s] saying God's judgment is coming. And
[299.5s] when you are corrected, you are saying
[302.0s] don't judge
[304.0s] me. Do you think this person is going to
[306.3s] remain alive?
[308.6s] Do you
[309.6s] think will he remain
[315.0s] alive? No. The same thing is
[318.4s] coming because when we are not going to
[321.5s] follow the laws of health here, what is
[323.8s] going to result are
[326.0s] diseases that is going to destroy our
[328.6s] body and we are going to lose all our
[331.4s] money. We are going to lose all our time
[334.0s] in hospitals trying to restore that
[336.2s] which you could have corrected with that
[338.0s] simple change of
[339.5s] lifestyle and when Christ is going to
[341.7s] come you are going to suffer the
[343.4s] consequences of misusing the health that
[345.4s] he has given you. So my friends that is
[348.0s] what is coming and when we are warning
[350.0s] you to come out of it we are not judging
[353.4s] anyone. So when we are going to say that
[356.0s] braiding is not godly, it is something
[358.7s] that is from men, it is devilish by
[361.8s] nature itself, then we need to accept
[363.8s] because God's judgment is coming to they
[366.0s] that are calling his his name. But to
[368.6s] believers and to not believe, then
[371.0s] believe us. So don't say you are judged,
[373.4s] but accept the call that you may move
[375.4s] out of the way to be safe when the
[377.1s] judgment come judgment comes. Praise
[379.4s] God.
[380.8s] Now this is how the pastor is
[387.6s] preaching. This is how things happen
[391.0s] when uh the preaches the truth is
[393.6s] presented. God is just concerned with
[395.8s] your heart. The way I dress does not
[398.5s] matter. What did we read last time that
[401.9s] our address are constant what? Constant
[404.2s] preachers. Now let me continue. When you
[406.4s] read this book testimonies to South
[408.2s] Africa, this is 87 paragraph 2. It says,
[411.6s] "Educate, educate, educate in the what?"
[415.8s] In the dress, the words of scriptures in
[418.3s] regard to dress should be
[422.5s] carefully where you not talking should
[424.9s] be carefully considered. We need to
[427.7s] understand that which that which the
[429.9s] Lord of heaven appreciates even the
[433.3s] dressing of the bo of the body. So they
[436.0s] must be carefully considered. When you
[438.7s] don't consider them my friends, the the
[440.9s] service you are offering it is not going
[442.6s] to be accepted by God. You can be a good
[444.9s] carer with a good voice. You can
[446.6s] transpose your tenor but the way you
[449.2s] dress makes God not to accept your your
[453.8s] service. Another thing the working of
[456.3s] the spirit of God uh the working of the
[459.4s] spirit of God inwardly will show a
[462.5s] change outward. That is why we read the
[465.7s] book evangelism to 72 where we said that
[469.4s] the question of grace will not be the
[470.9s] main what because we have a lot of
[473.0s] things that we need to be what to be
[474.9s] studying or to be pointing to people
[476.4s] that is that is Christ. So we said very
[479.2s] well that it should be working from
[481.2s] inward out. When Christ is in the art it
[484.7s] will be shown outwardly.
[490.3s] Now the
[492.4s] fashion because this is the problem. The
[496.3s] fashion. Where's my phone? The
[499.6s] fashion. The
[504.4s] fashion eco. I want to read you
[507.7s] something
[511.7s] here. The
[515.5s] fashion. Mhm.
[517.9s] Now when you read here uh the fashion is
[521.0s] a tyrannical mistress. The fashion is a
[525.3s] tyrant. Do you know someone who is a
[527.7s] tyrant? Tyrant is like a
[530.4s] dictator. This is the spirit of papacy.
[533.6s] Tyrant is like a dictator. He dictates.
[537.3s] He will not allow you to he will not
[539.8s] give actually the room for argument.
[541.8s] When he has said right right when he
[543.7s] said left left, he will not allow the
[546.0s] room for what? for argument. So you need
[548.1s] to understand that fashion is a
[549.5s] tyrannical what? Mistress. I want to
[551.7s] give you something here. Passion being a
[554.9s] tyrannical
[556.7s] tyrannical
[558.3s] mistress. Passion a
[560.9s] tyrannical mistress.
[572.6s] It says that fashion is
[575.8s] deteriorating the intellect.
[583.2s] Fashion is deteriorating the intellect
[587.0s] and eating out the spirituality of our
[590.1s] what? Of our people. You know the
[592.7s] testimonies were not written to those
[594.3s] people who are in the world. It were
[597.0s] written to those people who are inside
[598.3s] the church. So this message is for us.
[602.2s] Can we be in the church yet fashion is
[604.2s] eating our
[605.9s] spirituality? Passion is deteriorating
[608.4s] the intellect and eating out
[611.6s] intellect and it is deteriorating the
[614.8s] intellect and eating out the
[616.6s] spirituality of
[618.6s] our obedience to fashion is pervading
[622.3s] our seventh day adventist.
[625.0s] You know when we speaking of seventh day
[626.7s] adventist churches we are not speaking
[628.2s] of general conference because they are
[630.2s] already in apostate they have become
[632.5s] Babylon. So the seventh day adventist
[634.6s] churches we are speaking about is you
[636.3s] and I who have received the present what
[639.5s] so we are seeing that obedience to
[641.7s] fashion is pervading our seventh day
[644.3s] Adventist church and is doing more than
[646.9s] any other power to separate our people
[649.8s] from
[650.8s] who? So if there is a tool that the
[653.8s] devil is going to use to separate us
[655.6s] from God, what is
[657.2s] it? So is it a subject that is worth
[660.8s] consideration? Yes. Now get here. This
[664.5s] is child guidance for 32 paragraph 1. It
[666.3s] says fashion is a tyrannical ruler. That
[669.3s] is the title. Fashion rules the world
[672.0s] and she is a tyrannical mistress often
[676.0s] compelling her devotees to submit to the
[679.1s] greatest inconvenience and discomfort.
[682.2s] fashion taxes without reason and
[685.0s] collects
[686.0s] without. Do you
[700.8s] know
[703.7s] tax? Are you getting the point now? It
[706.7s] says that Uhhuh. He says
[711.2s] that uhhuh often compelling her devotees
[715.0s] to submit to the greatest inconvenience
[717.4s] and discomfort. We are going to see how
[719.8s] people are taxed into greatest
[722.5s] inconvenience and their lives are being
[724.9s] deteriorated and the only thing that
[726.8s] they doing they're submitting to the to
[729.0s] the
[732.6s] fashion because as
[736.0s] demanded she's a master. She's a master.
[740.2s] And what is she paying is what is
[742.5s] written in the book of Romans 6:23. The
[745.2s] wages of sin is death. She will pay you
[748.3s] debt. She will pay you diseases and she
[750.3s] will make you to lie in nos and waste
[752.2s] your time and
[753.6s] resources. Now it's saying that fashion
[756.6s] taxes without reason and collects
[758.6s] without m. She has a fascinating power
[762.4s] and stands ready to
[764.8s] criticize. Do you know those people who
[766.7s] love to who knows how to
[768.8s] criticize when you tell him
[771.9s] right? I think you know the critics he
[775.8s] knows and stands ready to criticize and
[778.7s] radical all who do not follow in her
[781.2s] what in her wake but friends I've come
[783.8s] to tell you that by following fashions
[786.9s] we are not going to go far and in fact
[789.7s] our people we are going to
[794.0s] deteriorate at the greatest levels when
[797.0s] our people are going to embrace fashions
[799.0s] of the world. So we need to be very
[801.4s] careful when it comes to issues of
[803.6s] fashion because it was bringing a
[805.4s] problem in the times of LG White and the
[807.8s] same time it is bringing the problem
[809.3s] today. Let me use the Babylonian 7th day
[811.9s] Adventist while about their
[814.9s] postit in a one in a in a in a in a
[818.3s] choir you can find a video being
[821.2s] recorded one single video of 3 minutes.
[824.9s] Then in that one video it has the choir
[829.6s] members by the end of the
[832.6s] video change more than
[835.3s] five there are more than what they're
[838.6s] more
[839.6s] than so are they advertising the clothes
[843.3s] or what are they doing is it a fashion
[845.1s] what how do you call it a fashion show
[848.4s] where people are advertising the manner
[850.2s] of clothes and people are competing of
[852.2s] the of the fashion that have arrived of
[854.5s] the beauty and
[855.7s] everything. I want you to think of that
[858.6s] and that is where you'll find that a
[860.1s] member has 10 uniforms which the least
[863.4s] amount is how many is how much 2,000 I'm
[868.2s] 3,000 but does not have even a single B
[871.4s] single Bible because people want to to
[873.9s] reach the what the fashion very
[876.5s] dangerous so fashion is a tyrannical
[879.5s] mistress she's a dictator in fact the
[882.7s] Bible says she not even he she is a a
[886.2s] tyran helical
[888.0s] mistress. Now when you read
[891.6s] here there is a terrible curse by the
[894.8s] way that is resting upon the church and
[897.4s] as a people when we are not taking this
[899.1s] in consideration there is a terrible
[901.2s] curse coming. It says that a terrible
[903.8s] curse rest upon the church for allowing
[906.3s] improper dress in its
[908.3s] what? In its members. He says there is a
[912.0s] terrible sin upon us as a people that we
[915.5s] have permitted our members to dress in a
[918.7s] manner inconsistent with their what? So
[922.0s] there is a dress that is consistent with
[923.9s] our faith and there is a dress that is
[926.2s] not inconsistent with our what? Now when
[929.0s] we allow this dress to be in our place
[931.5s] and we are not containing them, what
[933.6s] will be the result? There is a terrible
[935.6s] curse of God resting upon the
[937.6s] responsible
[939.3s] people. Praise God.
[943.8s] Now, too little attention is generally
[947.2s] given to the prevential preservation of
[949.9s] health. It is far better to prevent
[952.5s] disease than to know how to do what? How
[955.8s] to treat it when contracted. When you
[958.9s] read Proverbs 26:2, it says that we need
[962.1s] to handle the disease from the cause to
[965.0s] the what? To effect. Sor read this book,
[969.0s] the book of Matthew
[970.7s] 3:10. 3:10. The book of Matthew.
[978.6s] Mhm.
[980.9s] Verse 10, the Bible says,
[986.3s] "Uh-huh.
[990.5s] And the Bible says, "And now also, and
[993.8s] now also the axe is laid unto the root
[997.5s] of the what? Of the trees. Therefore,
[1001.2s] every tree which bringeth not forth good
[1004.0s] fruit is healed down and cast into the
[1007.4s] what? Into the fire." So the tree by the
[1010.8s] way even when it comes to the principles
[1012.6s] of health the sister is giving us four
[1015.6s] principles to follow that the disease
[1018.0s] must be handled from the cost to what
[1020.8s] cause to effect and the same principle
[1023.5s] is being applied here because the book
[1025.1s] of Job says there is hope for a tree. It
[1028.8s] is only a tree that has not been cut
[1030.9s] from the root. That is that is the only
[1032.6s] tree that has hope. The same thing
[1034.5s] applies to the disease. The disease that
[1036.6s] has hope of coming back is a disease
[1039.0s] that has been handled from the what?
[1041.8s] From the effects to the cause. But when
[1044.2s] we handle a problem from its cause is
[1047.2s] like we are uprooting the tree. And when
[1049.9s] we uproot the tree there is no hope for
[1052.0s] that tree. It will never come back. And
[1055.0s] even for us today when these diseases
[1057.8s] that are disturbing people in their
[1059.1s] lives when we handle them from their
[1062.0s] courses then we have a sure result that
[1064.6s] they will never do what they will never
[1066.7s] come back. Now we need to be acquainted
[1071.0s] because the problem is we are not
[1073.5s] actually acquainted with our anatomy and
[1075.5s] what and our physiology the structure of
[1079.2s] how God created us. That is what is
[1081.7s] bringing the problem because for you to
[1084.2s] wear high heels that makes you now to
[1086.4s] walk this way. Do you think you
[1088.0s] understand your anatomy and physiology?
[1089.8s] You walk this way in the church.
[1110.5s] Do you think it is safe? Praise
[1121.2s] God.
[1122.8s] understood and that is the
[1129.6s] secret. Praise
[1132.2s] God. Let me continue. It says all need
[1135.2s] to become acquainted with their
[1138.1s] physical are you are you in class? They
[1141.8s] all need to become acquainted with their
[1144.7s] physical structure. That is
[1147.5s] anatomy and the laws that control
[1150.4s] natural laws and that is physio. He who
[1154.6s] remains in willing ignorance of the laws
[1158.1s] of phys is physical being and who
[1160.5s] violates them through ignorance is
[1163.0s] sinning against who? So ignorance
[1166.0s] concerning anatomy and physiology is a
[1167.8s] sin against who? So all of us must learn
[1170.8s] anatomy and what? So it says all should
[1174.4s] place themselves in the best possible
[1177.6s] relation to life and what our habits
[1181.4s] should be brought under the control of a
[1183.5s] mind that is itself under the control of
[1186.3s] God. So when you allow the tyrannical
[1189.0s] mistress to rule you, God is not ruling
[1191.8s] you. And that is why we are saying you
[1193.7s] are sinning against who? Against God.
[1196.1s] Now look upon this
[1201.5s] video. I want you to see
[1219.2s] I to see it kely.
[1277.2s] Down there.
[1282.0s] [Music]
[1318.6s] What
[1320.8s] time? Leave it.
[1332.6s] [Music]
[1352.0s] Heat.
[1353.6s] [Music]
[1359.4s] Heat. Heat. Heat.
[1365.7s] [Music]
[1397.0s] the video first.
[1466.3s] The body should be allowed to function
[1468.5s] as normal as possible.
[1483.1s] [Music]
[1495.0s] Heat. Heat.
[1496.9s] [Music]
[1528.6s] Note that your body is the temple of
[1531.2s] who? Your body is the temple of the Holy
[1534.6s] Ghost which is in you which you have of
[1538.1s] who? And you are not your what? You are
[1542.0s] bought with what? Therefore glorify God
[1544.9s] in your word and in your which are
[1548.6s] whose. So anything that is deteriorating
[1551.3s] our health, we need to correct on that.
[1554.8s] And that is why the spirit of prophecy
[1557.2s] is very clear that as the people of God
[1559.8s] dress message there is a need of us
[1562.6s] preaching the dress reform. When you
[1564.2s] read the book selected messages book two
[1565.8s] page 43 paragraph one it says that my
[1569.0s] sisters and my brothers there is a need
[1571.8s] of dress reform among us.
[1575.9s] We are
[1582.4s] wearing it is very
[1588.5s] wanting until there is no proper
[1590.5s] circulation of what? Of blood. Very
[1593.6s] dangerous. Now the other day I was
[1596.9s] speaking of the of
[1598.9s] the and I bring this to show you
[1607.0s] Go and
[1608.4s] look. I know one of us
[1614.7s] here. Are you seeing that? How many's
[1617.5s] parents feet are like
[1619.2s] that? I don't want to carry your hand.
[1622.2s] But how many wink
[1625.5s] s do you know the cause is because of
[1628.1s] small
[1629.2s] shoes? Get this. I want you to read with
[1632.0s] me this
[1635.4s] quotation. Uhhuh. This is a book uh the
[1638.2s] health reformer December 1st 1871
[1641.2s] paragraph 10. It says the results of my
[1643.4s] friend's self-imposed miadom was the
[1647.8s] loss of health, peace of mind and
[1651.2s] natural beauty. She suffered the penalty
[1654.3s] of her folly in shattered nerves,
[1657.7s] swollen joints and deformed feet. The
[1661.8s] nails grew into her what? I could have
[1665.2s] showed
[1666.6s] you how the
[1668.8s] nails nails are growing inside the fle
[1672.5s] the flesh
[1675.3s] because do you think that is how God
[1677.4s] created that
[1678.7s] feet? What is the result?
[1682.4s] small small
[1686.8s] shoes this the
[1691.1s] nails. Okay. uh I don't know
[1696.2s] uh for example you see here when uh I I
[1700.6s] have a friend by the way in high school
[1702.2s] that he had to go to operation because
[1704.2s] of
[1717.3s] this go even in in Google
[1721.4s] Such such like for
[1724.4s] example a a a nail in the what? This is
[1729.0s] a a big a big toe I mean English nail in
[1734.0s] a big just you're going to see these
[1735.8s] things and they're going to see you to
[1737.9s] tell you even the effect the effects
[1740.6s] when this
[1745.2s] flesh many of the times
[1752.2s] It will not
[1758.2s] be the place of the what of the nail and
[1761.3s] you know the nail is growing
[1763.4s] naturally. So the the more the nail is
[1766.1s] growing and
[1770.4s] your
[1772.4s] grow
[1774.7s] and flesh it is not normal. They always
[1777.8s] feel pain
[1783.7s] and pass when pass and sometimes they go
[1787.8s] to operation so that this flesh to be
[1790.0s] cut so that the nail have a convenient
[1793.8s] space for it to grow and that is what is
[1796.6s] always
[1797.4s] happening there are medical research
[1800.1s] online and I've seen with my eyes those
[1802.7s] who know Evans I'm sorry for calling his
[1805.6s] name he suffered that thing in
[1809.7s] school. Now let me continue there. I
[1813.0s] think uh you now understand what I'm
[1815.2s] speaking
[1816.9s] about.
[1818.4s] Now let me continue
[1822.8s] here. I was reading health reformer page
[1825.7s] uh page what paragraph 10 that is pu
[1828.6s] 1871 December
[1831.4s] uh December 1st. It says that the nails
[1834.8s] grew into her flesh. That is a sup. The
[1837.6s] nails grew into her. The nails grew into
[1841.3s] her flesh. Nails can grow into your
[1843.0s] flesh when you compress your foot using
[1846.2s] your small
[1847.4s] shoes. The nails grew into her
[1851.9s] flesh. In ingrown tonally uh tone what?
[1859.4s] ing grown tonalist and caused the most
[1863.4s] extruding ex ex what excating suffering
[1868.2s] when I told her that this was in
[1870.2s] consequence of wearing what
[1873.8s] small so small shoes has a
[1876.6s] problem consequence of wearing small
[1879.4s] shoes she will not admit
[1883.6s] it she could not elevate is telling her
[1893.2s] So we need to correct that because you
[1895.8s] don't correct that it is a great problem
[1898.6s] and that is why the other time I was
[1900.2s] saying very well that when it comes to
[1903.5s] it is very dangerous for those
[1912.5s] people and you know when the leg is this
[1915.6s] way and I compress
[1923.6s] What? Do you see how it looks
[1926.2s] like the shape of a subooter? That is
[1929.6s] the
[1931.4s] thing. And says that these things
[1936.9s] make small
[1942.4s] shoes. It will not grow maturely the way
[1945.6s] it should
[1947.0s] be. That that is what will make a small
[1950.0s] child. Some of her easy to some are long
[1955.3s] and some deficient abnormal simply
[1959.1s] because they provide a good environment
[1961.8s] for it to grow natural. Naturally you
[1964.2s] are compressing it and that is very
[1966.9s] dangerous. Now I want to show you here
[1969.0s] what then should we teach? Teach the
[1971.0s] people how to prevent disease. Tell them
[1973.7s] to cease rebelling against what?
[1977.5s] Nature's
[1979.3s] laws. An ounce of prevention is worth a
[1982.6s] pound of
[1983.9s] what?
[1986.7s] Of kiwa. An ounce of prevention is worth
[1990.8s] a what? A pound of of kiwa. Extremist or
[1995.8s] limbs should be covered. Now here
[1998.4s] another evil which custom fosters is the
[2003.2s] unequal distribution of clo of clothing.
[2006.4s] The feet and the limbs being removed
[2008.3s] from the vital organs should be
[2010.2s] especially guarded from cold by abundant
[2013.4s] water. Now the question can be asked
[2017.2s] that when the
[2019.7s] limbs should be because they are very
[2022.7s] far from the system they need to be
[2024.3s] covered more than anything. They need to
[2026.9s] be covered more than anything but most
[2029.0s] of
[2031.6s] us much of the
[2035.7s] stress all is okay. Now read here number
[2038.2s] one the health cannot be enjoyed where
[2040.3s] there is no unequal distribution of what
[2042.6s] circulation of the blood. Therefore we
[2045.2s] advocate that the limbs of women should
[2047.8s] not be exposed but sensibly neatly and
[2051.4s] comfortably what
[2056.6s] clad is the problem of the
[2060.0s] diseases. Another thing here what are
[2062.8s] the limbs? arms or what? Or legs of a
[2066.2s] person or a four-legged animal. So when
[2068.4s] I speak of the limbs, it is not
[2072.9s] actually but
[2074.9s] also the arms. Praise God. All of them
[2078.5s] are what are limbs. So when inspiration
[2080.7s] is saying that the limbs also should be
[2083.7s] covered, then does it does it say that
[2086.1s] we need to to cover both the arms and
[2088.8s] the feet? That is what it means.
[2092.3s] It is
[2093.6s] inappropriate. Uhhuh. Uh it says the
[2097.6s] limbs were not formed. That is 2T page
[2099.8s] 531 paragraph 3. The limbs were not
[2102.2s] formed by our creator to endure exposure
[2105.1s] as was the what? As was the face. They
[2108.6s] were not created to endure the same
[2110.1s] cold, to endure the same heat. It is
[2112.9s] only face protective to endure all those
[2116.2s] climates. But when it comes to the
[2118.1s] limbs, it was not it was not so. So when
[2121.3s] our limbs are facing the same
[2123.1s] environment, we are allowing them to
[2125.2s] face the same heat as is the what is the
[2129.3s] is the face then there is a problem.
[2131.4s] Another evil which are the feet another
[2134.0s] line there the feet and limbs being
[2136.0s] removed from the vital organs should be
[2138.2s] especially guarded from cold by abundant
[2140.6s] wash
[2143.6s] clothing. So from this do you
[2147.7s] think short sleeve? What do you think of
[2149.9s] short sleeve
[2154.0s] shirt? What do you think of short sleeve
[2156.4s] shirt? Sat shirt. What do you think of
[2160.1s] it? Praise
[2162.0s] God. What do you think of
[2164.5s] it? Is it dangerous to the
[2167.9s] health? Is
[2169.9s] it? Yes.
[2172.1s] Because the the limbs in no matter by
[2177.0s] the way sometimes when you go to these
[2179.3s] these
[2182.4s] places a lot
[2184.6s] of
[2199.5s] heatffected but the sometimes remains to
[2202.2s] be no to be normal and that is very
[2204.6s] dangerous in it is impossible to have
[2207.1s] health when the extremities are habitual
[2209.2s] what cooled for if there is too little
[2211.9s] blood in them there will be too much in
[2214.0s] the portions of the body and by the
[2216.5s] way headache not because there is of
[2220.2s] anything but because you've you've worn
[2222.6s] a a short
[2223.9s] sleeve shirt because once your arms are
[2228.4s] cold the blood is not going to be
[2230.9s] supplied there
[2232.1s] efficiently meaning that other parts of
[2234.2s] the body are going to have excess blood
[2236.5s] like the brain and that is what will be
[2238.6s] causing
[2240.0s] headache. Praise God. Now it says
[2243.6s] perfect health requires a perfect what
[2246.4s] but perfect circulation but this cannot
[2250.8s] be while there while three or four times
[2254.9s] as much clothing is worn upon the body
[2257.1s] as upon the feet
[2259.4s] and my
[2264.5s] friend is
[2266.2s] it so
[2269.1s] shortle in my chest and everything I've
[2271.5s] covered them But my limbs
[2274.0s] are they are free. Elen is saying you
[2277.1s] cannot have a perfect health because
[2279.0s] there is no way you can have three or
[2280.5s] four times as much clothing worn upon
[2282.9s] the body as upon the what the feet and
[2286.0s] and limbs. So when you read down
[2288.0s] the all of them we should give a equal
[2292.4s] distribution of heat in the in the body.
[2295.7s] Now let me give you another one here.
[2297.4s] The limbs and feet have large veins to
[2300.2s] receive large amount of blood that
[2302.8s] warmth,
[2304.4s] nutrition, elasticity and strength may
[2307.9s] be imparted to them. But when the blood
[2310.7s] is chilled from these extremities, the
[2313.2s] blood vessels contract which makes the
[2315.5s] circulation of the necessary amount of
[2317.0s] blood in them still more what?
[2319.8s] Difficult. So we need to give body
[2321.9s] actually easy time because when you
[2323.8s] don't give them easy time there is a
[2325.8s] problem.
[2327.4s] And we will be going to simply because
[2330.0s] of adaption or regular wearing of the
[2333.4s] long sleeved what charts. I want to read
[2336.2s] something
[2336.9s] here.
[2340.1s] Mhm. I want to give you something
[2350.9s] here. Uh-huh. The
[2354.0s] limbs. Our
[2358.1s] creator.
[2360.8s] Uh-huh.
[2363.6s] Uh-huh. Just read. Our creator has
[2369.8s] formed. Our creator has formed the limbs
[2372.3s] with large veins and vessels to contain
[2374.8s] a large proportion of blood that the
[2378.6s] limbs may be
[2380.1s] sufficiently nourished and
[2382.3s] proportionately warmed with the other
[2384.1s] portions of the what? There must be
[2386.5s] equal distribution of heat in the bowl.
[2388.9s] But
[2389.8s] what robs the limbs of the
[2392.8s] coverings and the life current is
[2395.9s] chilled from its natural channel and
[2398.4s] thrown back upon its internal what? So
[2401.6s] what is depriving the limbs of what it
[2403.6s] requires
[2407.2s] passion there's a there is something I
[2409.6s] want to read for you so that you see all
[2412.5s] these things in a clear light.
[2416.4s] fashion child guidance for 27 paragraph
[2420.5s] one so that you see who brought these
[2423.2s] things we have sleeveless I didn't
[2424.6s] capture the photos here
[2427.2s] sleeveless cut book
[2440.4s] tople trousers short skirts
[2444.5s] All of those they are doing what?
[2446.2s] They're exposing our what? Our limbs.
[2449.2s] And we've said limbs concern the arms
[2451.3s] and the what? And the legs. Now read
[2453.4s] this quotation 427 paragraph one the
[2455.8s] book of what? Child guidance. It says
[2458.4s] Satan invented the fashions which leave
[2462.0s] the limbs exposed.
[2465.7s] may invent
[2467.5s] sleeveless may
[2471.8s] [Music]
[2473.3s] invents.
[2475.1s] Yes, by the
[2478.8s] way, the problem
[2485.6s] is do you think the arms are suffering?
[2488.8s] According to what we've read from the
[2490.1s] inspired word, they are suffering. So it
[2492.6s] says Satan invented the fashions which
[2495.1s] leave the limbs exposed chilling back
[2497.8s] the life current from its original
[2499.8s] course and parents bow at the shrine of
[2503.3s] fashion to uh and so clothe their
[2506.2s] children that the nerves and veins
[2508.6s] become contracted and do not answer the
[2511.6s] purpose that God designed they should.
[2514.3s] The result is habitually called feet and
[2517.3s] what hands. Those parents whose follow
[2521.4s] fashions instead of reason will have an
[2523.8s] account to render to God for thus
[2526.2s] robbing their children of health. This
[2529.3s] is parents being addressed. Do you know
[2531.5s] you'll have an account to render before
[2533.6s] God? By the way, most of the
[2553.2s] children and you know the Bible says
[2555.1s] that we need to teach our little
[2556.6s] children that God is not happy when
[2558.8s] seeing them in torn and filthy
[2561.1s] garments. Do you know that?
[2564.2s] And you know that the truth cannot place
[2566.5s] its delicate feet in the filthy
[2568.8s] environment. Praise God. So how will you
[2571.9s] convince this child up that he need to
[2573.9s] be neat? When he was young, you allowed
[2576.2s] him to roam around with torn
[2579.6s] garments and everything. Praise God.
[2582.5s] Very
[2583.2s] dangerous. So it says that parents, my
[2585.8s] friends, will have to give an account
[2588.0s] when you allow your children to roam
[2589.5s] around with what? with short-sleeved
[2593.4s] clothes. You don't cover their limbs
[2595.2s] well and they suffer diseases. You take
[2597.5s] them to hospital, they are dragged to
[2599.1s] death and some are laid under grave
[2601.9s] because of improper what? Immodesty
[2606.1s] dress. So we need to change and even for
[2609.3s] us for our ministers when you go to to
[2611.6s] buy a shirt from the inspiration you
[2614.0s] need actually to embrace the long
[2615.6s] sleeved what? Because it will be the one
[2618.1s] that will be complying to what is
[2619.5s] written.
[2620.9s] I want to show you something
[2622.9s] here. How do we clothe our bodies to
[2625.8s] maintain this proper what? Circulation.
[2628.2s] The limbs which should have even more
[2630.3s] covering than any other portion of the
[2634.4s] what? Because of their farthest from the
[2638.8s] center of the circulation are often not
[2641.5s] suitably protected while over the vital
[2644.7s] organs. Uhhuh. It says while over the
[2647.5s] vital organs where there is naturally
[2650.0s] more warmth than in any other portion of
[2652.4s] the body there is an undue proportion of
[2655.1s] what of covering from from the pain of
[2657.7s] inspiration we need to give burden upon
[2661.2s] clothing
[2662.4s] our limbs because they are far from
[2666.2s] heart and for them to maintain a proper
[2669.1s] circulation of the blood they need to be
[2671.1s] held by proper cover. Are we going back
[2674.7s] to the fig leaves or are we embracing
[2677.5s] the uh uh the the what the coats of skin
[2680.6s] that God clothed with Adam and Eve? That
[2683.4s] is the question I want you to read here.
[2686.4s] We must cover our limbs be it summer or
[2690.0s] what at all
[2693.2s] seasons bear arms and bear arms and leg.
[2697.4s] We think we think this mode of dressing
[2700.4s] must be recorded as one of the most
[2702.6s] prominent causes of uh prominent causes
[2706.6s] of summer compliance. In colder weather,
[2710.3s] congestion and inflammation of the
[2712.2s] lungs, congestion and inflammations of
[2714.3s] the brain, convulsions etc will result
[2718.2s] at all seasons. Congestion more or less
[2721.6s] is what is caused simply because of what
[2724.3s] is called uncovering of the limbs. I
[2726.3s] want to show you something here called
[2728.3s] the next list after this where I'm going
[2730.5s] to list the diseases that comes as a
[2732.3s] result that we are not closing our
[2734.4s] covering our limbs. So it says special
[2738.4s] attention special attention should be
[2740.7s] given to the extremities that they may
[2744.2s] be thoroughly they may be as thoroughly
[2747.2s] do you know what is
[2748.4s] thorough they may be as thoroughly
[2751.0s] clothed as the chest and the region over
[2753.2s] the what over the heart where the
[2757.3s] greatest amount of heat where is the
[2759.7s] greatest amount of the heat in order to
[2761.7s] equalize the circulation of the blood
[2764.2s] the clothing should be equally
[2766.5s] distributed upon the p upon the person
[2769.0s] that that equal warmth may be preserved
[2772.5s] in all parts of the what of the body.
[2776.3s] Now health problems related to not
[2778.6s] covering the arms and the limbs. The
[2780.4s] list is long but I've just given these
[2782.6s] ones for a start. Number one you have
[2784.5s] short shortness of breath for those who
[2788.0s] have experienced this. This is this is
[2792.0s] true. Many people are suffering this
[2794.4s] headaches, nose bleedings. You can just
[2797.0s] be nos bleeding because of this problem.
[2799.9s] The body is not is not heavenly
[2803.8s] distributed. We have the fullness in
[2806.1s] chest chest problem because of unequal
[2810.5s] distribution of heat in the body because
[2812.3s] we are not covering our limbs.
[2813.9s] Palputation of the heart. Irritation and
[2816.3s] restless heart failure. This thing my
[2819.4s] friends in a letter had what is called
[2821.8s] heart failure. Let me go back to
[2824.4s] children. The lips of our children
[2827.0s] should be done what?
[2829.9s] Thoroughly and score that should be
[2834.3s] thoroughly and
[2836.1s] sensibly covered or clad. Parents who
[2839.5s] dress their children with extremities
[2842.1s] naked or nearly so are
[2845.9s] sacrificing the health and the lives of
[2848.5s] their children to
[2858.6s] what? But you know that there is another
[2861.0s] altar here that people are sacrificing
[2863.6s] their children on. What is that altar?
[2865.4s] the order of her of not covering the
[2868.6s] limbs of the
[2870.0s] children. Let me repeat this quotation.
[2874.0s] Parents who parents who who dress their
[2878.8s] children with the
[2881.3s] extremities naked or merely so are
[2884.9s] sacrificing the health and their lives.
[2887.5s] Not just the health but also the what of
[2890.2s] their children to the what? To the
[2892.2s] fashion.
[2893.8s] Children are killed. Which commandment
[2896.0s] is that? Do not
[2897.8s] kill. Six cind get what the parents are
[2901.4s] doing? Children are killed by the manner
[2904.6s] in which they are watched. So when you
[2907.0s] have your siblings here, you need to
[2909.4s] take notes of this because many children
[2912.1s] are killed by the parents and by their
[2913.7s] siblings in which in the manner of which
[2916.6s] they what they are dressed left with
[2919.0s] bare arms and legs and with low naked
[2921.8s] what?
[2924.0s] dresses. It is a sin in the sight of
[2927.4s] heaven for parents to dress their
[2929.4s] children as the way they
[2936.4s] do. It is a sin before in the sight of
[2940.9s] heaven for parents to dress their
[2943.0s] children the way they are doing.
[2945.9s] Judgment shall run or shall rest upon
[2948.7s] the what? Upon the parents. How many are
[2951.2s] seeing that we need actually we need a
[2952.8s] reformation on this issue?
[2956.6s] May God help us because when God is not
[2959.6s] going to help us on this many of our
[2962.2s] children are going to be laid on grave
[2964.2s] because of very simple
[2967.5s] issues other related problems in
[2971.2s] digestion not because
[2974.0s] of but because of improper
[2978.2s] what you're not covering the extremities
[2981.0s] in a letter by the
[2983.6s] way praise
[2994.7s] Extraring constipating nerves and veins
[2998.0s] become contracted causing bad
[3000.2s] circulation. And by the way, this list
[3001.8s] comprises also when you're on a bad
[3003.8s] tight tight tight skin tight tight. Now
[3008.6s] it
[3009.3s] says uhhuh edma congestion of the lungs
[3013.6s] and everything. You can screenshot that
[3015.9s] it is online. I don't know our
[3018.4s] technician is not around. I don't know
[3020.1s] how we are helping those people online.
[3022.0s] Uhhuh. And many other more. Now I read
[3026.6s] this that who is the inventor of the
[3028.9s] sleeveless? Who is the inventor of the
[3031.0s] short sleeves? Who is the inventor of
[3033.6s] shorts? Who is the inventor of short
[3035.8s] skirts? Satan invents the version which
[3038.4s] leaves the limbs what? Exposed. It is
[3041.9s] Satan's design so to pervert every
[3044.4s] function of our being that life may be
[3046.7s] made miserable and God may be dishonored
[3049.9s] in the creation in the creatures he had
[3052.4s] he had created. Satan plans and pre
[3057.0s] premeditates ways that we can be made
[3060.6s] miserable. Satan kill a kill a time kill
[3064.2s] a time in how can I make the health of
[3067.4s] these people
[3075.2s] miserable very
[3082.1s] small praise God because he wants your
[3085.1s] health to be
[3087.6s] deteriorated because he knows that when
[3089.8s] your health is infled You cannot give
[3092.2s] God the perfect the perfect service that
[3094.8s] you ought to have given him. It is a
[3096.8s] solemn statement
[3098.4s] beloved on one a one that should take us
[3103.0s] to our knees. It is a it is a solemn
[3105.9s] statement one that should take us to our
[3108.6s] knees possibly before our wardrobe and
[3111.8s] make some decisions. Do you know that
[3114.8s] after this two weeks we need when we go
[3118.0s] back home we need to go back to our what
[3120.8s] our wardrobe. Do you know what is a
[3122.8s] wardrobe? Do you know that the some of
[3125.0s] us came with with clothes that we need
[3127.0s] to go back to our wardrobes and make a
[3128.8s] decision? It says certain plans and pre
[3133.0s] pre what meditates ways that we can be
[3136.6s] made miserable. How many are miserable
[3139.6s] because they are not dressing properly?
[3141.8s] How many? millions. It is a solemn
[3145.2s] statement,
[3146.7s] one that should take us to our knees. It
[3150.2s] is a solemn statement that should take
[3151.9s] us to our knees possibly be uh before
[3155.4s] our wardrobes and make what? Some
[3165.0s] decisions. Praise God.
[3171.0s] Charity. Which
[3174.0s] charity? Which charity is
[3179.6s] that? Is it charity? Is it a charitable
[3183.3s] work? What is the solution for
[3187.2s] that? If medical books are banned, what
[3189.8s] of
[3190.7s] dress? They need to
[3194.4s] be another thing. Because my friends
[3198.1s] there are some by the way you can modify
[3199.6s] so
[3200.5s] that and by the way you have some short
[3202.8s] sleeves maybe I don't say because we
[3206.1s] have this these are
[3208.6s] small you can put that short sleeve
[3210.8s] inside inside it is presentable for that
[3213.8s] praise God and it will help you to to
[3216.5s] distribute it heavenly
[3220.4s] now dress from reason and what don't
[3225.2s] just dress because don't just dress.
[3228.6s] Sometimes you need even to pray before
[3229.8s] you dress. It is manifest that most
[3232.8s] women do not think and act in reverence
[3235.0s] to dress from reason and
[3238.6s] reflect. They accept without questioning
[3241.8s] that which imposes upon what? Upon
[3247.5s] them. You are not dressing out of reason
[3250.3s] and reflection. You need to dress out of
[3252.8s] reason and what? Reflection. Another
[3255.0s] point in the preparation of the
[3257.5s] clothing, can you actually seek God's
[3260.2s] blessings on
[3261.9s] that? Do you think you can do
[3267.1s] that? May you bless
[3270.8s] this that God thank you for how many are
[3274.6s] always
[3276.7s] praying. Praise
[3278.7s] God. How many always
[3282.0s] pray? Let me connect this with the first
[3284.4s] angel's message. And I I saw another
[3287.5s] angel that is Revelation 14:6. And I saw
[3290.7s] another angel flying in the midst of
[3292.9s] what? Having the everlasting gospel to
[3295.5s] preach unto them that dwell on the on
[3297.6s] the what? And
[3301.6s] to and to every nation
[3305.3s] kindred and and he said with what? with
[3309.9s] a loud voice that we need to do what? We
[3313.0s] need to fear God. Number one to
[3315.9s] fear and give glory. Why? For the hour
[3320.5s] of his judgment is what? Did you see the
[3323.1s] guy showed you is the hour of judgment
[3325.4s] is
[3326.4s] coming? Yes. What should we do? We
[3329.4s] should we need to fear God and give
[3332.4s] glory. And what does the book of 1
[3334.7s] Corinthians chapter
[3336.1s] 10:31, what does it say?
[3342.0s] Uh-huh.
[3344.0s] Whatsoever.
[3346.4s] Uh-huh. Let me read it. Says, "Wherefore
[3351.0s] whatsoever you eat or drink or
[3353.8s] whatsoever you do, do all to the glory
[3356.6s] of who?" Of God. So, by the way, is
[3361.2s] dressing something we
[3362.8s] do? Yes. Now when we are dressing we
[3366.2s] need to do it to the glory of and that
[3369.3s] is why when we are dressing up we need
[3371.5s] even to give we need to pray over it so
[3373.9s] that our dressing be of good influence
[3376.8s] upon nonbelievers and also upon the
[3379.9s] believers. We need to ask God is my
[3382.4s] dress giving glory and honor to you
[3385.2s] because when it is not doing that then
[3387.1s] it is contrary to the spirit of the
[3388.6s] gospel.
[3390.2s] To bring this to a close, it says when
[3393.3s] they really desire, I would ask, let me
[3397.1s] start in the preparation of their
[3398.8s] clothing, can they seek the Lord's
[3401.0s] blessing? I would ask of today who
[3404.3s] profess to believe present truth when
[3406.6s] they really desire an article of dress
[3409.0s] or some of convenience. Do they lay the
[3412.5s] matter before the Lord in prayer?
[3420.2s] Do you present that
[3422.0s] before that when you
[3425.7s] go
[3428.0s] sanctioned to know if his spirit will
[3431.1s] sanction
[3432.7s] that now
[3434.8s] beloved we need actually to make a
[3437.8s] change because when you don't make a
[3439.7s] change in this there is a great issue
[3441.9s] that is awaiting us and God is calling
[3444.2s] upon his children and when God is
[3446.6s] calling upon on his children. It is very
[3449.0s] serious. It is something that is worth
[3453.6s] consideration. It is worth consideration
[3456.2s] and I'll not talk of
[3457.7s] that.
[3459.4s] Women are always what are too often
[3464.0s] tempters. They are too often tempters.
[3467.7s] If women would only elevate their lives,
[3470.0s] they will be less danger through their
[3471.6s] what? Through their influence. Do you
[3475.0s] know that there are many people who are
[3477.2s] in the nin they are in the they're in
[3480.5s] the prisons because of how someone
[3482.0s] dressed somewhere. Do you know
[3485.0s] that they're in prisons because of how
[3488.5s] someone dressed somewhere and he was
[3490.5s] tempted and he
[3492.1s] raped today is in prison maybe for 30
[3496.0s] years because someone who professed to
[3498.6s] be a seventh day Adventist somewhere
[3501.4s] somewhere and I wish that God may help
[3503.8s] us. We need to be daughters of Zion and
[3507.7s] we need not the daughters of God of
[3510.1s] Babylon. And it is time to change you.
[3513.4s] What was what was what was our
[3516.0s] topic? The Christian modesty. What was
[3519.4s] the subtopic? Dress, fashion, and what?
[3523.8s] And health. How many have understood
[3527.1s] something? May God bless us in Jesus
[3529.7s] name. Allow me to
[3536.7s] pray.
[3540.2s] Our heavenly father in
[3543.1s] heaven, we thank you because of your
[3545.5s] love that you have given
[3547.2s] us. I thank you because of the message
[3550.2s] of
[3551.1s] dress which is an index to our heart.
[3555.4s] May you help your
[3556.9s] children to be convicted upon their
[3560.5s] thoughts to make a sound decision that
[3563.1s] shall glorify your name. Forgive us of
[3566.1s] our past ignorances and where we had
[3568.9s] messed up and multiply us grace to
[3572.4s] ensure that we comply to your will which
[3576.1s] is the demands of heaven. Be with us I
[3578.8s] pray in Jesus holy
[3581.2s] name. Thank you. I to give uh uh some
