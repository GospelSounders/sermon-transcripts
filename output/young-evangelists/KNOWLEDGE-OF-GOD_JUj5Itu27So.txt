FULL TRANSCRIPT:
Paragraph number three says of ministry page 49 transformation of character purity of life efficiency in service knowledge is the essential preparation for a preparation both for this life and for the life to come. So this is the knowledge that is going to help us to prepare for this life and even for the life to come to come. So it is very important to know the God you worship. How shall we know God right? Then let us read philosophical speculation and scientific research in which God is not acknowledged are making skeptics of thousands Listen, philosophical speculation and scientific research in which God is not acknowledged are making skeptics of what? Thousands in the schools of today the conclusion that land men have reached as the result of their scientific investigation are carefully taught and fully explained. While the impression is distinctly given that if these land men are correct the Bible cannot be. So if what you are taught in the school about God by the philosophy of the schools is correct that the Bible is never going to be what to be true. Now which God is taught in the Babylonian schools in the schools of today is the one true God acknowledged. No. What about from primary school? He's the one true God acknowledged in secondary schools. What about in the higher schools, universities and colleges? He's the one true God acknowledged. No. But now listen the prophet says skepticism is attractive to the human mind. The youth see it an independence that captivates the imagination and they are deceived. Satan does what? Triumphs. He nourishes every seed of doubt that is sown in your in young hearts. He causes it to grow and bear fruit and soon harvest of infidelity is reaped. That is why the teachers of education are really understand what is education and make us understand why do we need education? Because today in the schools that we study in God is not acknowledged. But it is the will of Satan that he may triumph through the study of scientific investigation that will never help us understand who God is. All right? But for us to know God then we need to go back to the Bible and understand who God is. Now listen in C 94 paragraph 2 it says through success successive ages of darkness in the minute of athenism God permitted men to try the experiment of finding out God by their own wisdom not to demonstrate their ability to his certification but that men themselves might see that they could obtain a knowledge of God and of Jesus Christ his son saved through The revelation of what? His word by the Holy Spirit. Amen. So how are men supposed to understand God and his son Jesus Christ? It was through the revelation by his word. But it is gotten through the Holy Spirit. Do we how the prophet speaks? How am I supposed to know God? It is through the revelation of what? His word in the Bible. But now the only generating power that was supposed to help them understand who God is was the Holy Spirit. Now does the prophetist determine the Holy Spirit as a person? No. But you're going to find you're going to find. But it says when Christ came to the world by the wisdom by sorry when Christ came to the world the experiment had been fully tried and the result made it evident that the world by wisdom knew not who God. Even in the church God has allowed men to test down wisdom in this matter. But when a crisis has been brought about through human fability, God has risen mighty mightily to defend his people. When the church has been brought low, when trial and oppression have come upon his people, he more abundantly exalted them by the signal of deliverance. When unfaithful teachers came among the people, wickedness followed, and the faith of God's people seemed to win. But God arose and ped his flock and and and the tried and the true were lifted up. Now listen brethren my quotation then I'm going back to the scriptures. It says in testament to judge volume 5 that is which page? Which page? It says be therefore followers of God as dear children and walk in love as Christ also hath done what? Hath loved us and hath given himself for us an offering and a sacrifice to God for a sweet smelling s. Man by wicked work alienated himself from God. But Christ gave his life that all who would might be freed from sin reinstated in the favor of the creator. It was the anticipation of a redeemed holy universe that prompted Christ to make this great sacrifice. Have we accepted the privileges so dearly purchased? Are we followers of God? As their children or three servants of prince of darkness? Are we worshippers of Jehovah? Or of who? Or of who? Of the living God or idols? That's a question we are supposed to ask ourselves. Are we followers of the true living God or idols? The next paragraph says in paragraph 4 that no outward shrines may be visible that no outward shines shrines may be visible. There there may be no image for the eye to rest upon yet we may be practicing what? Idolatry. What is idolatry? Many of us thinks that idolatry is when someone makes something like a cow, something in form of Maria to worship. But now EG White says through the pen of inspiration that no outward may be visible. There may be no image of the eye to rest upon yet we may be practicing what? Idolatry. It is an easy to make an idol of cherished ideas or objects as to fashion gods of hood and what? So that means again we can make idols of what? Cherished ideas. Yeah, very true. And today we are going to see in the reformation movement that are rising that many of the reformation movement are making idols of cherished ideas. They are not bringing up their doctrine from the Bible as the only creed. Now listen brother and sister thousands have a false conception of God and his what attributes? How many? Many are not understanding who God is and they have a false conception of God and his attributes. It says there are as very status of false god as the servant of Bal. Now listen, are we worshiping the true God as as is revealed in his word in Christ? Amen. Question. Do we worship the true God as this God is revealed in the word? By who? By Christ. Now what did Christ came to reveal to us? Christ came to reveal who to us the father. Christ came to give us the perfect character of who? Of the father. Was there sin in Christ? No. Why? God was manifested in the flesh. That's a stat that you need to understand that for the people living in the last days for us to live the life of Christ then again God must be manifested in the flesh. Amen. It says they are as serving a false god as the servants of Bal. Are we worshiping the true God as is revealed in his word in [Applause] Christ in nature or are we adoring some philosophical idols enshrined in his place? God is a God of what? Truth, justice and mercy are the attributes of his throne. He is a God of love, of pity and of tender compassion. Thus he is represented in his son our savior. He is a god of patient and longsuffering. If such is the being whom we adore and to whose character we are seeking to assimilate, we are worshiping the true God who is revealed in the Bible by his son Jesus Christ. And that is the God that we seek to worship. Not a God that is cherished by people by their own ideas. But you worship a God who Christ came to manifest in his word is the God we worship. Brethren, understanding the third person of the Godhead. Amen. Though some of us has been waiting for that such a long time, date has come. Amen. It is here. Now, let's turn back to our Bibles. Leave alone the quotation. Turn to your Bibles please so that you study the Bible and understand what the Bible says. Now we go before the Bible. Allow me read this verse. Then now we come to the Bible principle. Then I come back to the quotation. Then we understand. Amen. Now it says in describing to his disciples the office work of all. I want to take that point that Christ was describing the office work. Do you understand the meaning of office? You will understand brothers and sisters there is delegates to work in that office. We are going to see in describing to his disciples the office work of the Holy Spirit. Jesus sought to inspire them with the joy and hope that inspired his own heart. Amen. He rejoiced because of the abundant help he had provided for his church. The Holy Spirit was the highest of all gift. Amen. Now the Holy Spirit is a gift. Do we listen? The highest gift that Christ could give to his church was what? The Holy Spirit. That's a point. A gift. We are going to see the gift was the highest of all gifts that he consolidated from his father for the exaltation of his people. The spirit was to be given as a regenerating what? Agent. And without this, the sacrifice of Christ would have been of no avail. The power of evil had been strengthening for centuries. And the submission of what? Of men to this satanic captivity was amazing. Now listen the quotation. Sin could not be resisted and overcome only through the mighty agency of the third person of the godhead who will not come with no modified energy but in the fullness of divine power. Are you together brethren? Some are sleeping. Is this thing projected? I'm not seeing the projector now. Listen, brethren, sin could be resisted. Listen, sin could be resisted and overcome only. Now the quotition says, it means this is the only way that strain could be done. What? resisted through the mighty agency of the third person of the godhead. But now from Christ we saw that the personalities that Christ is only himself, God, angels and man. But now each word says that it again another person called the third person of what? The godhead. But now we have to ask Christ why in your word you are not reh revealing to us that indeed there's a third person in your sayings you only tell us you know three personalities but now listen brethren in the book of Zechariah chapter 6 verse 13 we need to understand why is the bible is the spirit of prophecy speaking with the third person of the godhead one Christ in his word identifies only for personalities is Zechariah chapter 6 verse 13 the Bible says even shall be the temple of the Lord even he shall be the temple of the Lord who is that that Christ himself even he shall be the temple of what of the Lord have you opened your Bibles yes yes let's read together even he shall be the temple of who? And he shall bear the glory and shall sit and rule upon his what? And he shall be a priest upon his what? Throne. And the council of peace shall be between them both. Now the council of peace is between Christ himself and who? The father. Is that the third person? Is that the third person? No. Turn to the book of Genesis. We see cuz this is another verse that people use to prove from the Bible that this trinity doctrine. But now let's see in Genesis 1 26 the Bible reads, "And God said, let us make man in our own what? image after our likeness, and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fall of the air, and over the cattle, and over all the earth, and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon what? The earth. Now God speaks and saying, "Now let us make man in our own image, and who is in the image of God." The book of Colossians chapter 1 verse one. These are verses that you know. Let's open Colossians 1:16. The Bible says who is there? Colossians 1 it says verse 15 says who is the image of the invisible God of Egypt. Who is that? That Christ himself is in the image of who? of the invisible God. Verse 16 says, "For by him are all things created." So by whom did God create all things? By Christ. Then who is in the image of the invisible God? Has anyone in this congregation ever read where the Bible says that the Holy Spirit who is in the image of the invisible God? Help me brethren. Who has read that? that the Holy Spirit who is a in the image of invisible God is that writing like that in the Bible who has read such a thing in the Bible can help us understand it is not we are very sure that it is only Christ who is in the image of who invisible God now when God says let us create man in our own image who was God speaking to Christ himself. You read the book of Proverbs 8:22 going downward says that Christ was with the father in the cre in the creation. Was there the third person called God the Holy Spirit? No, the Bible don't reveal that it was Christ who was by the side of the father during the creation what the creation work. Now the only person who can enter into council with the father is who is Christ himself. That the council of peace shall be between them both. Now listen brethren turn to PP. Let's check that is not in the projector but we read it. Not everything is written. So God also brings some quotations as we continue so that you understand the book of PP that is part and prophets. Yeah. That is page 34. The sovereign of the universe is page 34. Sure. Now it says the sovereign of the universe. That is 34 paragraph 1. Listen this brethren. The sovereign of the universe was not alone in his work of beneficiaries. He had a associate a coworker who could appreciate his what? His purposes. Now the sovereign of the universe God the father he was not alone in his work of what of creation. Then she says that he had an associate a coworker who could appreciate his work. He had a coworker. Check the grammar. Does the spirit of prophecy says that he had coworkers? He had a co worker with a few English. I know the little English I know. I know that is that is something that is not plural but singular. Sure. Now it says that he had an associate single a coworker who could appreciate his purposes and could share his joy in giving happiness to the created what beings. In the beginning was the word and the word was with God and the word was God. The same was in the beginning with God. Christ. Now listen brother and sister. Christ the word of God the only begotten of God was one with eternal father. One in what? Nature. Nature. One in character in purpose. The only being all the purposes of God. Are we together? that the only being that could enter into the councils and purposes of God was who was Christ. Now, where was this third person of the Godhead? Where are so many of us thought that you see there's the third person of the Godhead? There's another being called the Holy Spirit. Is that true? Is that true? Because the spirit of prophecy says that the only being that will enter into the council and the purpose of God was who was Christ himself. Amen. Now when God is doing his work of beneficial who was with him as a coworker is Christ himself there was not another being. But now we are coming back to the quotation. Why is EG saying that sin could only be resisted by the mighty agency of the third person of the Godhead? What does she mean by saying this? And we're going to look at some more quotations. What was this woman meaning? You have to study this woman rightly and understand how she writes and ammonize all the quotations that she's giving us because I believe could not give us something that is an error. Is that very true? He was led by the spirit of what? The spirit of God. Now it is us to study what did she mean? Many of us run to these quotations and say now you see the spirit of prophecy of the godhead. Now there are three beings in heaven. But now the Bible says that the only being who could enter into the councils and the purposes of God was who was Christ himself. Turn to great controversy. The book great controversy. Another proof that is being given from the spirit of prophecy that we have only two beings who came into one council to bring the council of peace into the earth. Now listen 493 paragraph 1. It says before the entrance of evil there was peace and joy throughout the universe. Amen. All was in perfect harmony with the creator's will. Love for God was supreme. Love on one another impartial. That is 493 brethren and sisters. 493 paragraph 1. Great controversy. It says before the entrance of evil there was peace and what joy throughout the universe always in perfect harmony with the creator's will. Love for God was supreme. Love for one another in passion. Christ the word, the only begotten of God was one with whom? Eternal father, one in nature, in character, in purpose, the only being in all the universe who could enter into the council into all the councils and purposes of God. Now listen brethren the only being in all the universe now is the only being who could enter into the council and purposes of God is Christ himself. Amen. Now come back to your Bible because you have realized that the only being who could enter into the council and purposes of Jehovah is Christ is what? So is there a person called God the Holy Spirit who engage in the work of creation? No. There were only two who did the work of creation. Now come back to your Bible. Now let us turn to the book of second Peter. You want to see yesterday we got that in the Bible precept the Holy Spirit can speak. Sure. That was the book of Acts 13:2. And the Holy Ghost said, we want to look how is this possible? How does a thing that doesn't have form speaks? How is something that is a being speaks? We are to be sure from the word of God. Now, let's turn to the book of second Peter chapter 1 19. We see in many aspects of the Bible, it says, Yeah, we have also a word of prophecy that we have also a word of prophecy where you look Uhhuh. life in that place. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. In your heart. Sure. Knowing this fact, now knowing this fact that no prophecy of the scripture is any private interpretation. That no prophecy of the scriptures is of any private inition. Read verse 21. The prophecy came not in the will. That prophecy came not in all time by the will of man. But holy men of God, that holy men of God, I want you to understand how the Bible is written. Now Peter says that the holy men of God spake as they were moved by the Holy Ghost. It mean everything they spake was from God. They were filled with the Holy Spirit and then they spoke the words of who? The words of God. It may be possible when I say okay let me not first bring that principle but now turn to again the book of John chapter 14. I want to bring that principle later. The book of John chapter 14. No, let's first check John 15 first. Check this principles of the Bible. John 15:26. Bible says the comforter is now listen. But now when the comforter is come and who is the comforter? Who is the comforter? Who is the comforter? Someone saying Christ. I'm the Holy Spirit. Yeah, we'll see that. That always very true. Now read brother. But now when the comforter is come from the father whom the father is going to send from the father even the spirit even the spirit of truth proceedth from the father. Then this spirit proceedth from who? It shall testify of me. This spirit shall testify of of me. Now listen brethren that when that comforter come even the spirit of truth he shall testify of me he shall personality can I say that a lawyer it come in the house grammatical in in any sense that brother it went it went and it came it is very impossible but now the bible say that when that water come, whomever will send unto you from the father, even the spirit of truth which proceedth from the father, he shall testify of me. Why in the Bible have you ever read the spirit testifying of Christ? What am I doing here? What am I doing here? But what is Christ says that when that spirit comes, he shall testify of what? Who has ever seen the Holy Spirit testifying? Who has ever seen? I read somewhere that that spirit came and it was testifying and people were moved by the word of who has ever read such a thing. Now listen, brethren, let us see. There are those who testify of Jesus. Number one principle, turn to the book of Revelation. and take that to be your mind that when the spirit of truth come even the comforter he shall testify of me when the Bible have you ever read the spirit testify of the Christ himself No. 22:16 the book of Revelation. Jesus sent my angel. Jesus have sent my angel to testify unto you these things in the midst of churches. Amen. Now who is testifying here? But what did Christ say that? Who did Christ say that will testify of him? But now Revelation says that it is the angel. This is Christ still speaking himself that he has seen his angel to testify and what these things. But the same speaks in John chapter 15 that the spirit of truth even the converter shall testify of me who is testifying. Now listen brethren turn the book of acts 1 vers8 you have to understand what Christ was meaning 18 acts 1 vers8 now listen Christ said but he disciples shall receive power and after the holy ghost is come upon you he shall be witnesses unto me both in Jerusalem and all Judea in Samaria and unto the uttermost part of what? Now Christ says, "But he shall receive power after that the Holy Ghost is come upon what? Then he shall do that that what? Witness or testify of me only after the Holy Spirit comes unto you." It is very true when I say that the Holy Spirit was testifying of Christ in the days of the apostles. Is that very true? Yes. But now he's testifying of the apost of Christ himself through the apostles. Why? Because preaches can testify but it can only witness and testify inside a believer or an angel. Are we together? Now listen, stand to this book. I'm coming back to the Bible. I'm not running from the Bible. That's the same quotation in 29 page 34. This is true quotation. Those who have here sometimes saying these things were added. This is manuscript volume 2 page 34 paragraph 1. that evil had been accumulating for centuries and could only be restrained and assisted by the mighty power of what? The Holy Spirit. The third person of what? The who could come with no modified energy. Listen, there's this spirit does not come with its own modified energy, but in the fullness of what? Divine power. Another spirit must be met for the essence of evil was working in all ways and the submission of man to his what? Satanic captivity was amazing. The same in 1888 materials page 49 1493 paragraph 2 says evil had been accumulating for centuries and could only be restrained and resisted now in each and every quotations using white ads some vocabulary and English. He she says he evil had been accumulating for centuries and could only be restrained and resisted by the mighty power of what? The Holy Spirit, the third person, the Godhead who could come with no modified energy but in the fullness of divine power. The mighty agency in CTR Christ triumphant page 301 paragraph number one. How many witnesses are those in the quotations? Now can you say this quotation was added? No. It is there the Bible and it came from the lips of each. It says Christ determined to bestow a gift of those who had been with him and who should believe on him because this was the equation of his ascension and inaugression and to believe in heaven. What gift could Christ bestow rich enough to signalize and grace his ascension to the medial throne? It must be worthy of his greatness and his royality. Christ gave his representative the third person of the godhead, the holy what? Spirit. And this gift could not be done what? This thing is a gift. It is a gift. Take that. And how do God bestow gift unto his people? Through which process? Through which process? How do we receive the gift of the Holy Spirit? Do they come direct from the father? What is the order? It comes from the father, the son. Then the ministation of what? All the angels. It is a gift. The Holy Spirit is a gift that is given unto us. Turn back to your Bible, brethren. There is the third person of the godhead. Last time the book of John chapter 14 and veil we are coming back still. This is something that is very easy to explain in the Bible. Now the book of John chapter 14. Let us take verse number 15 says, "If you love me, keep my commandments and I will pray the father and he shall give you another what that he personality he may abide with you forever. Even the spirit of truth whom the world cannot receive because it seeth him what? Never knoweth him not but he know him." How to listen bre what Christ says and I will pray the father and he shall give you another comforter that is the holy spirit sure that we may abide with you forever forever even the spirit of truth now listen brethren turn to the book of matthew we are coming back there is precept upon precept 28 verse 19 that you The Bible reads 28 verse 19, the book of Matthew. Go therefore, teach all nations. Uh-huh. Know the Son, not the Holy Ghost. Yeah. Yeah. Always even unto the end of the world. Now Christ says long I Christ I am with you always even unto the end. Now who was supposed to remain the disciples until the end of the world? Is Christ himself in the book of Matthew? Are we together? But now listen in 14:16 he says even the spirit of truth whom the world cannot do what? receive because it seeth him not neither knoweth him not but he know him for he dwelleth with you and shall be in you I don't know much English not learned such as you people not learned but I understand what the Christ is saying now Christ says that this comforter will abide with them forever then Matthew 28 19 and 20 Christ says that me Christ I shall be with you even unto the end of the world. Christ himself speaking. But now Christ speaks of the spirit and saying that this spirit will b with you forever even unto the end of what? The world. Then verse 17, Christ says that even the spirit of truth whom the world cannot receive because it seeth him not yet never knoweth him but he know him for he dwelleth with you now. Sure. For he does what? Dwelleth with you. Now as he speaks, that spirit dwells with what? With you. But again he says and shall be in you. That is what? In the future. Now that dwells with them as he speaks with them. But now he says but later he will be in you. Do we understand? Do you understand? Oh, listen brethren. Turn down to your phones. Open the quotations. We are harmonizing the scriptures in the spirit of prophecy cuz my time is up. Oh brother. Okay, let me read the last quotation. Now I want to read a book that most of you I don't know if you have it in your phones. Now we are so used to the red estate. Now I want to read from letters and manuscript. Letters and manuscript. Allow me look for it brother. Okay. Letters and manuscripts 19 LTMS 9 sorry 9 LTMS letter 66 of 1894 paragraph number 18 9 LTMS then put comma then letter LT66 of 1894 paragraph number I don't know if someone is there or I'll read mine can write and look it later. My time also is up. I want to be okay. It says 19 LTMS letter 66 of 1894 paragraph 18 paragraph 18. Now it says let me read mine. If any of you lack wisdom, let him ask of God that giveth all men li liberally and apprenth not. And it shall be given him, but let him act in what? In faith, nothing wavering. James 1:5 and 6. And whatsoever we ask, we receive of him because we keep his commandments and do those things that are pleasing in his sight. And we know that the son of God is come, that is Christ himself, the son of God, and hath given us an understanding that we may know him that is true and we are in him that is true even in his son Jesus Christ. This is the true God and eternal life. Little children, keep yourself from others. Then the Bible says in 1 John 5 21, the Lord is soon to come. We want that complete and perfect understanding which the letter alone can give. Now listen brothers and sisters, it is not safe to catch the spirit from another. It is not safe to do what? To catch the spirit from another. We want the Holy Spirit which is Jesus Christ. Are we together? that we want the Holy Spirit to reach. Listen to the grammar that this woman had. I'm praying. We want the Holy Spirit to which is Jesus Christ. If you commune with God, we shall have strength and grace and efficiency. Amen. Now, who is the Holy Spirit? I'll continue from there as we be looking. What did EG White mean by saying that seal could only be resisted only through the mighty agency of the third person of what? But now the spirit of truth that Christ is promising to his disciples is he himself manifested in what? In the person of his spirit. Amen. Are we together? How many are following this? Allow me see. know you can be teaching a big class and how many just carry up and be be very I'm seeing brethren how many are saying man not understanding this I'm still confused sure sister you'll speak and I'll give chance for questions now let us pray then I believe tomorrow God will give us another chance to continue in Jesus We are praying. Our father in heaven, we thank you for this day. Thank you for giving me strength to speak unto thy children. Indeed, I'm unworthy to stand before such a congregation because of our sinfulness. But father because of thy graces you still allow us to preach these mighty truths and holy truths. We pray that each and every time we study this truth help us father that even ourselves you'll be sanctified through the truth. That father one day as you come in the glory of thy angels, the glory of thy father and the glory that you have. We might stand firm to say this is our God that you have been waiting for. I pray for the brethren listening unto these messages. Indeed, this is a powerful convention which youths are deciding to walk in the truth. How I pray that you help both of us to stand firm upon the platform of eternal truth as we'll be continuing this study. Father, I pray that you help us understand who you are right because we know that the only topic that will help us overcome sin and live a purity of life is to know they are right. I pray for those who are in this all women, children, youths, men that father give us strength to know their right. Help us to study our Bibles and help us to be of humble spirit to be taught by thee that you know who you are. The programs that remain in this day, the teachings we have, Father, we pray that you help us to take them seriously. That father we might say that at the end of this convention that indeed it was very powerful and God was with us through his ministration of all the angels above with us. Father help us to understand more and more in thy scriptures and above. Father we pray that we daily help us to claim upon thy promises and trust in the righteousness of thy son that we live a holy life is our prayer by faith in Jesus holy name. Amen.

TIMESTAMPED TRANSCRIPT:
[1.0s] Paragraph number three says of ministry
[4.2s] page 49 transformation of
[7.3s] character purity of life efficiency in
[12.1s] service knowledge is the essential
[14.7s] preparation for a preparation both for
[18.0s] this life and for the life to
[21.0s] come. So this is the knowledge that is
[23.6s] going to help us to prepare for this
[27.6s] life and even for the life to come to
[31.1s] come. So it is very important to know
[35.8s] the God you worship. How shall we know
[38.3s] God right? Then let us read
[41.8s] philosophical speculation and scientific
[43.8s] research in which God is not
[46.3s] acknowledged are making
[48.6s] skeptics of thousands
[52.8s] Listen, philosophical speculation and
[55.4s] scientific research in which God is not
[58.7s] acknowledged are making skeptics of
[61.2s] what? Thousands in the schools of today
[64.8s] the conclusion that land men have
[67.0s] reached as the result of their
[68.5s] scientific investigation are carefully
[71.6s] taught and fully explained. While the
[74.9s] impression is distinctly given that if
[77.5s] these land men are correct the Bible
[80.1s] cannot be. So if what you are taught in
[82.8s] the school about God by the philosophy
[86.1s] of the schools is correct that the Bible
[88.6s] is never going to be what to be true.
[92.2s] Now which God is taught in the
[94.7s] Babylonian schools in the schools of
[97.2s] today is the one true God
[99.7s] acknowledged. No. What about from
[102.3s] primary school? He's the one true God
[105.2s] acknowledged in secondary schools. What
[108.6s] about in the higher schools,
[109.9s] universities and colleges? He's the one
[112.2s] true God acknowledged. No. But now
[115.3s] listen
[116.2s] the prophet says skepticism is
[119.4s] attractive to the human mind. The youth
[122.2s] see it an independence that captivates
[125.0s] the imagination and they are deceived.
[127.4s] Satan does what? Triumphs. He nourishes
[131.2s] every seed of doubt that is sown in your
[133.4s] in young hearts. He causes it to grow
[135.9s] and bear fruit and soon harvest of
[140.8s] infidelity is reaped. That is why the
[144.5s] teachers of education are
[147.4s] really understand what is education and
[151.9s] make us understand why do we need
[154.5s] education? Because today in the schools
[157.4s] that we study in God is not
[160.0s] acknowledged. But it is the will of
[162.2s] Satan that he may triumph through the
[165.5s] study of scientific investigation that
[168.5s] will never help us understand who God
[171.2s] is. All right? But for us to know God
[174.2s] then we need to go back to the Bible and
[178.0s] understand who God is. Now listen in C
[182.6s] 94 paragraph 2 it says through success
[186.8s] successive ages of darkness in the
[189.4s] minute of athenism God permitted men to
[192.5s] try the experiment of finding out God by
[195.8s] their own wisdom not to demonstrate
[198.3s] their ability to his certification but
[201.8s] that men themselves might see that they
[204.6s] could obtain a knowledge of God and of
[207.1s] Jesus Christ his son saved through The
[209.9s] revelation of
[211.2s] what? His word by the
[214.3s] Holy Spirit. Amen. So how are men
[218.8s] supposed to understand God and his son
[221.3s] Jesus Christ? It was through the
[225.2s] revelation by his word. But it is gotten
[229.4s] through the Holy Spirit. Do we how the
[232.4s] prophet
[233.5s] speaks? How am I supposed to know God?
[236.6s] It is through the revelation of what?
[239.4s] His word in the Bible. But now the only
[243.2s] generating power that was supposed to
[246.1s] help them understand who God is was the
[249.0s] Holy
[250.0s] Spirit. Now does the
[252.9s] prophetist determine the Holy Spirit as
[255.3s] a
[256.8s] person? No. But you're going to find
[259.8s] you're going to find. But it says when
[262.4s] Christ came to the world by the wisdom
[264.6s] by sorry when Christ came to the world
[268.4s] the experiment had been fully tried and
[271.4s] the result made it evident that the
[274.3s] world by wisdom knew not who
[278.5s] God. Even in the church God has allowed
[281.4s] men to test down wisdom in this matter.
[284.3s] But when a crisis has been brought about
[286.6s] through human fability, God has risen
[290.3s] mighty mightily to defend his people.
[293.6s] When the church has been brought low,
[295.6s] when trial and oppression have come upon
[298.4s] his people, he more abundantly exalted
[301.0s] them by the signal of deliverance. When
[303.1s] unfaithful teachers came among the
[305.4s] people, wickedness followed, and the
[307.8s] faith of God's people seemed to win. But
[310.7s] God arose and ped his flock and and and
[314.4s] the tried and the true were lifted up.
[319.0s] Now listen brethren my quotation then
[322.2s] I'm going back to the scriptures. It
[324.2s] says in testament to judge volume 5 that
[327.4s] is which
[328.8s] page? Which
[331.2s] page? It says be therefore followers of
[334.6s] God as dear children and walk in love as
[339.0s] Christ also hath done what? Hath loved
[342.3s] us and hath given himself for us an
[345.3s] offering and a sacrifice to God for a
[348.2s] sweet smelling s. Man by wicked work
[352.1s] alienated himself from God. But Christ
[355.0s] gave his life that all who would might
[357.9s] be freed from sin reinstated in the
[360.5s] favor of the creator. It was the
[363.4s] anticipation of a redeemed holy universe
[366.6s] that prompted Christ to make this great
[369.0s] sacrifice. Have we accepted the
[371.2s] privileges so dearly purchased? Are we
[373.7s] followers of God? As their children or
[377.6s] three servants of prince of darkness?
[380.0s] Are we worshippers of Jehovah? Or of
[384.9s] who? Or of
[388.2s] who? Of the living God or
[393.0s] idols? That's a question we are supposed
[395.7s] to ask
[396.7s] ourselves. Are we followers of the true
[399.3s] living God or idols?
[402.8s] The next paragraph says in paragraph 4
[405.3s] that no outward shrines may be
[408.1s] visible that no outward shines
[411.5s] shrines may be visible. There there may
[415.4s] be no image for the eye to rest upon yet
[418.2s] we may be practicing what?
[421.4s] Idolatry. What is idolatry? Many of us
[423.8s] thinks that idolatry is when someone
[426.1s] makes something like a cow, something in
[428.9s] form of Maria to worship. But now EG
[433.0s] White says through the pen of
[434.6s] inspiration that no outward may be
[437.6s] visible. There may be no image of the
[440.0s] eye to rest upon yet we may be
[442.2s] practicing what? Idolatry.
[445.4s] It is an easy to make an idol of
[447.4s] cherished ideas or objects as to fashion
[450.7s] gods of hood and what? So that means
[453.9s] again we can make idols of what?
[457.2s] Cherished
[458.8s] ideas. Yeah, very true. And today we are
[462.5s] going to see in the reformation movement
[464.6s] that are rising that many of the
[466.6s] reformation movement are making idols of
[470.5s] cherished ideas. They are not bringing
[473.4s] up their doctrine from the Bible as the
[476.6s] only creed. Now listen brother and
[478.3s] sister thousands have a false conception
[481.8s] of God and his what attributes? How
[486.2s] many? Many are not understanding who God
[490.7s] is and they have a false conception of
[493.8s] God and his attributes. It says there
[497.1s] are as very status of false god as the
[500.9s] servant of Bal. Now
[507.8s] listen, are we worshiping the true God
[511.4s] as as is revealed in his word in Christ?
[515.9s] Amen. Question. Do we worship the true
[519.1s] God as this God is revealed in the word?
[521.7s] By who? By Christ. Now what did Christ
[525.4s] came to reveal to
[530.8s] us? Christ came to reveal who to
[534.5s] us the father. Christ came to give us
[537.8s] the perfect character of who? Of the
[540.3s] father. Was there sin in Christ? No.
[543.3s] Why? God was manifested in the flesh.
[547.8s] That's a stat that you need to
[549.1s] understand that for the people living in
[551.4s] the last days for us to live the life of
[554.3s] Christ then again God must be manifested
[558.0s] in the
[558.9s] flesh. Amen. It says they are as serving
[563.5s] a false god as the servants of Bal. Are
[566.8s] we worshiping the true God as is
[569.4s] revealed in his
[572.0s] word in
[573.3s] [Applause]
[575.2s] Christ in nature or are we adoring some
[579.8s] philosophical idols enshrined in his
[582.1s] place? God is a God of what? Truth,
[585.8s] justice and mercy are the attributes of
[588.5s] his throne. He is a God of love, of pity
[591.5s] and of tender compassion. Thus he is
[594.4s] represented in his son our savior. He is
[597.6s] a god of patient and longsuffering. If
[600.9s] such is the being whom we adore and to
[604.2s] whose character we are seeking to
[606.1s] assimilate, we are worshiping the true
[610.4s] God who is revealed in the Bible by his
[613.4s] son Jesus
[615.0s] Christ. And that is the God that we seek
[617.5s] to worship. Not a God that is cherished
[620.8s] by people by their own ideas. But you
[623.5s] worship a God who Christ came to
[626.1s] manifest in his word is the God we
[628.9s] worship. Brethren, understanding the
[631.1s] third person of the Godhead. Amen.
[633.2s] Though some of us has been waiting for
[634.6s] that such a long time, date has come.
[637.9s] Amen. It is
[639.9s] here. Now, let's turn back to our
[642.7s] Bibles. Leave alone the quotation. Turn
[645.6s] to your Bibles
[648.4s] please so that you study the Bible and
[653.2s] understand what the Bible says. Now we
[657.2s] go before the Bible. Allow me read this
[660.1s] verse. Then now we come to the Bible
[663.9s] principle. Then I come back to the
[666.3s] quotation. Then we understand. Amen.
[669.6s] Now it says in describing to his
[673.2s] disciples the office
[676.3s] work of
[678.4s] all. I want to take that point that
[682.2s] Christ was describing the office
[686.1s] work. Do you understand the meaning of
[690.2s] office? You will understand brothers and
[692.5s] sisters there is delegates to work in
[694.6s] that office. We are going to see in
[697.0s] describing to his disciples the office
[699.0s] work of the Holy Spirit. Jesus sought to
[701.8s] inspire them with the joy and hope that
[704.5s] inspired his own heart. Amen. He
[707.8s] rejoiced because of the abundant help he
[711.0s] had provided for his church. The Holy
[713.8s] Spirit was the highest of all gift.
[716.0s] Amen. Now the Holy Spirit is a
[719.9s] gift. Do we listen?
[723.0s] The highest gift that Christ could give
[726.2s] to his church was what? The Holy
[730.3s] Spirit. That's a point. A gift. We are
[733.7s] going to
[735.5s] see the gift was the highest of all
[738.7s] gifts that he consolidated from his
[741.7s] father for the exaltation of his people.
[745.8s] The spirit was to be given as a
[748.2s] regenerating what? Agent. And without
[751.5s] this, the sacrifice of Christ would have
[753.6s] been of no avail. The power of evil had
[756.5s] been strengthening for centuries. And
[759.3s] the
[760.3s] submission of what? Of men to this
[763.8s] satanic captivity was amazing. Now
[766.5s] listen the quotation. Sin could not be
[769.3s] resisted and overcome only through the
[772.4s] mighty agency of the third person of the
[776.7s] godhead who will not come with no
[779.1s] modified energy but in the fullness of
[781.8s] divine
[785.7s] power. Are you together brethren? Some
[789.0s] are sleeping. Is this thing
[791.9s] projected? I'm not seeing the projector
[795.1s] now. Listen,
[797.0s] brethren, sin could be
[802.7s] resisted.
[804.2s] Listen, sin could be resisted and
[806.7s] overcome
[809.1s] only. Now the quotition
[812.3s] says, it means this is the only way that
[816.0s] strain could be done. What?
[820.6s] resisted through the mighty agency of
[823.9s] the third person of the godhead. But now
[828.1s] from Christ we saw that the
[830.3s] personalities that
[832.4s] Christ is only
[835.4s] himself,
[837.3s] God, angels and man. But now each word
[842.4s] says that it again another person called
[845.0s] the third person of what? The godhead.
[847.9s] But now we have to ask Christ why in
[850.1s] your word you are not reh revealing to
[853.3s] us that indeed there's a third person in
[856.8s] your sayings you only tell us you know
[858.6s] three personalities but now listen
[860.7s] brethren in the book of Zechariah
[862.5s] chapter 6 verse 13 we need to understand
[866.5s] why is the bible is the spirit of
[869.2s] prophecy speaking with the third person
[870.8s] of the godhead one Christ in his word
[874.6s] identifies only for personalities
[878.3s] is Zechariah
[881.4s] chapter 6 verse 13
[887.0s] the Bible says even shall be the temple
[889.8s] of the Lord even he shall be the temple
[891.8s] of the Lord
[894.0s] who is that that Christ himself even he
[897.6s] shall be the temple of what of the Lord
[900.8s] have you opened your Bibles yes yes
[903.3s] let's read together even he shall be the
[905.8s] temple of who? And he shall bear the
[909.5s] glory and shall sit and rule upon his
[912.9s] what? And he shall be a priest upon his
[916.0s] what? Throne. And the council of peace
[919.9s] shall be between them both. Now the
[923.8s] council of peace is
[925.6s] between Christ himself and
[928.9s] who? The
[932.4s] father. Is that the third person?
[936.6s] Is that the third
[939.3s] person? No. Turn to the book of Genesis.
[942.2s] We see cuz this is another verse that
[944.6s] people
[946.8s] use to prove from the Bible that this
[949.8s] trinity doctrine. But now let's see in
[952.5s] Genesis 1 26 the Bible reads, "And God
[956.6s] said, let us make man in our own what?
[960.8s] image after our likeness, and let them
[963.5s] have dominion over the fish of the sea,
[965.7s] and over the fall of the air, and over
[968.4s] the cattle, and over all the earth, and
[970.6s] over every creeping thing that creepeth
[972.9s] upon what? The earth. Now God speaks and
[975.8s] saying, "Now let us make man in our own
[979.5s] image, and who is in the image of God."
[982.4s] The book of Colossians chapter 1 verse
[984.2s] one. These are verses that you know.
[987.2s] Let's open Colossians 1:16.
[994.3s] The Bible says who is
[999.5s] there? Colossians 1 it says verse 15
[1005.5s] says who is the image of the invisible
[1009.2s] God
[1011.9s] of Egypt. Who is that? That Christ
[1015.4s] himself is in the image of who? of the
[1018.7s] invisible God. Verse 16 says, "For by
[1021.4s] him are all things created." So by whom
[1025.0s] did God create all
[1027.2s] things? By Christ. Then who is in the
[1030.5s] image of the invisible
[1033.5s] God? Has anyone in this congregation
[1036.2s] ever read where the Bible says that the
[1038.6s] Holy Spirit who is in the image of the
[1041.0s] invisible
[1042.2s] God? Help me brethren. Who has read
[1045.1s] that? that the Holy Spirit who is a in
[1048.4s] the image of invisible
[1050.3s] God is that writing like that in the
[1053.4s] Bible who has read such a thing in the
[1055.8s] Bible can help us
[1058.0s] understand it is
[1060.2s] not we are very sure that it is only
[1064.0s] Christ who is in the image of who
[1068.2s] invisible God now when God says let us
[1071.4s] create man in our own image who was God
[1075.9s] speaking to Christ himself. You read the
[1078.8s] book of Proverbs
[1080.1s] 8:22 going downward says that Christ was
[1083.5s] with the father in the cre in the
[1085.8s] creation. Was there the third person
[1087.9s] called God the Holy Spirit? No, the
[1090.9s] Bible don't reveal that it was Christ
[1093.4s] who was by the side of the father during
[1095.8s] the creation what the creation work. Now
[1098.8s] the only person who can enter into
[1101.1s] council with the father is who is Christ
[1105.6s] himself. That the council of peace shall
[1108.4s] be
[1109.4s] between them both. Now listen brethren
[1113.5s] turn to
[1114.7s] PP. Let's check that is not in the
[1117.2s] projector but we read it. Not everything
[1120.3s] is written. So God also brings some
[1122.0s] quotations as we continue so that you
[1124.1s] understand the book of
[1130.8s] PP that is part and prophets.
[1137.9s] Yeah. That is page 34. The sovereign of
[1140.7s] the universe is page 34. Sure. Now it
[1143.2s] says the sovereign of the universe. That
[1145.4s] is 34 paragraph 1. Listen this brethren.
[1148.8s] The sovereign of the universe was not
[1151.5s] alone in his work of beneficiaries. He
[1154.2s] had a associate a coworker who could
[1158.2s] appreciate his what? His purposes. Now
[1162.1s] the sovereign of the universe God the
[1164.4s] father he was not alone in his work of
[1168.2s] what of creation. Then she says that he
[1172.5s] had an associate a coworker who could
[1175.1s] appreciate his work. He had a coworker.
[1179.0s] Check the
[1181.2s] grammar. Does the spirit of prophecy
[1183.5s] says that he had
[1188.1s] coworkers? He had a co worker with a few
[1192.5s] English. I know the little English I
[1193.8s] know. I know that is that is something
[1195.6s] that is not plural but singular. Sure.
[1200.4s] Now it says that he had an associate
[1204.6s] single a coworker who could appreciate
[1208.2s] his purposes and could share his joy in
[1211.3s] giving happiness to the created what
[1214.0s] beings. In the beginning was the
[1216.9s] word and the word was with God and the
[1220.6s] word was God. The same was in the
[1223.3s] beginning with God. Christ. Now listen
[1226.7s] brother and sister. Christ the word of
[1229.5s] God the only begotten of God was one
[1233.8s] with eternal father. One in what?
[1237.0s] Nature. Nature. One in character in
[1241.8s] purpose. The only
[1245.7s] being all the purposes of God.
[1250.7s] Are we together? that the only being
[1254.8s] that could enter into the councils and
[1257.8s] purposes of God was
[1259.4s] who was Christ. Now, where was this
[1262.1s] third person of the Godhead? Where are
[1264.6s] so many of us thought that you see
[1266.2s] there's the third person of the Godhead?
[1267.7s] There's another being called the Holy
[1269.3s] Spirit. Is that
[1271.9s] true? Is that true? Because the spirit
[1275.5s] of prophecy says that the only being
[1278.7s] that will enter into the council and the
[1281.4s] purpose of God was who was Christ
[1284.2s] himself. Amen. Now when God is doing his
[1288.0s] work of beneficial who was with him as a
[1291.9s] coworker is Christ himself there was not
[1295.0s] another being. But now we are coming
[1296.7s] back to the quotation.
[1298.5s] Why is EG saying that sin could only be
[1304.4s] resisted by the mighty agency of the
[1307.8s] third person of the Godhead? What does
[1311.4s] she mean by saying this? And we're going
[1313.7s] to look at some more
[1315.4s] quotations. What was this woman meaning?
[1317.8s] You have to study this woman rightly and
[1319.9s] understand how she writes and ammonize
[1322.6s] all the quotations that she's giving us
[1325.0s] because I believe could not give us
[1328.0s] something that is an error. Is that very
[1329.8s] true? He was led by the spirit of what?
[1332.9s] The spirit of God. Now it is us to study
[1336.6s] what did she mean? Many of us run to
[1339.8s] these quotations and say now you see the
[1342.6s] spirit of prophecy of the godhead. Now
[1345.4s] there are three beings in heaven. But
[1347.2s] now the Bible says that the only being
[1349.8s] who could enter into the councils and
[1352.1s] the purposes of God was who was Christ
[1355.7s] himself. Turn to great
[1359.1s] controversy. The book great
[1363.6s] controversy. Another
[1366.4s] proof that is being given from the
[1368.9s] spirit of prophecy that we have only two
[1373.6s] beings who came into one council to
[1377.0s] bring the council of peace into the
[1379.5s] earth. Now listen 493 paragraph 1. It
[1382.2s] says before the entrance of evil there
[1385.8s] was peace and joy throughout the
[1387.4s] universe.
[1388.4s] Amen. All was in perfect harmony with
[1391.2s] the creator's will. Love for God was
[1393.4s] supreme. Love on one
[1396.1s] another impartial. That is 493 brethren
[1399.9s] and sisters. 493 paragraph
[1402.4s] 1. Great controversy. It says before the
[1407.0s] entrance of evil there was peace and
[1409.0s] what joy throughout the universe always
[1412.1s] in perfect harmony with the creator's
[1413.9s] will. Love for God was supreme. Love for
[1417.5s] one another in passion. Christ the word,
[1421.0s] the only begotten of God was one with
[1424.4s] whom? Eternal father, one in nature, in
[1428.8s] character, in purpose, the only being in
[1432.7s] all the universe who could enter into
[1435.2s] the
[1436.6s] council into all the
[1439.6s] councils and purposes of God. Now listen
[1443.5s] brethren the only being in all the
[1450.2s] universe now is the only being who could
[1452.9s] enter into the council and purposes of
[1455.2s] God is Christ
[1458.1s] himself. Amen. Now come back to your
[1461.2s] Bible because you have realized that the
[1463.5s] only
[1464.8s] being who could enter into the council
[1467.8s] and purposes of Jehovah is Christ is
[1470.7s] what?
[1472.4s] So is there a person called God the Holy
[1475.0s] Spirit who engage in the work of
[1477.5s] creation? No. There were only
[1481.3s] two who did the work of creation. Now
[1484.9s] come back to your Bible. Now let us turn
[1487.1s] to the book of second Peter. You want to
[1491.8s] see yesterday we got that in the Bible
[1494.5s] precept the Holy Spirit can speak.
[1498.4s] Sure. That was the book of Acts 13:2.
[1501.8s] And the Holy Ghost said, we want to look
[1503.6s] how is this possible? How does a thing
[1506.2s] that doesn't have form
[1509.5s] speaks? How is something that is a being
[1514.0s] speaks? We are to be sure from the word
[1516.8s] of God. Now, let's turn to the book of
[1519.4s] second Peter chapter 1
[1521.5s] 19. We see in many aspects of the Bible,
[1527.8s] it says,
[1529.4s] Yeah, we have also a word of prophecy
[1532.5s] that we have also a word of prophecy
[1534.9s] where
[1538.6s] you look
[1542.8s] Uhhuh. life in that place. Uhhuh.
[1548.8s] Uhhuh.
[1550.8s] In your heart. Sure. Knowing this fact,
[1553.4s] now knowing this fact that no prophecy
[1556.2s] of the scripture is any private
[1558.2s] interpretation. That no prophecy of the
[1560.6s] scriptures is of any private inition.
[1565.0s] Read verse 21. The prophecy came not in
[1569.0s] the will. That prophecy came not in all
[1572.3s] time by the will of man.
[1576.0s] But holy men of God,
[1579.7s] that holy men of God,
[1584.6s] I want you to understand how the Bible
[1585.9s] is written. Now Peter says that the holy
[1589.2s] men of God spake as they were moved
[1593.6s] by the Holy Ghost. It mean everything
[1598.6s] they spake was
[1603.2s] from
[1604.8s] God. They were filled with the Holy
[1607.4s] Spirit and then they spoke the words of
[1609.9s] who? The words of God. It may be
[1612.3s] possible when I
[1614.0s] say okay let me not first bring that
[1616.3s] principle but now turn to again the book
[1617.8s] of John chapter 14. I want to bring that
[1620.6s] principle later. The book of John
[1622.6s] chapter
[1625.6s] 14. No, let's first check John 15 first.
[1629.5s] Check this principles of the Bible. John
[1633.0s] 15:26.
[1635.8s] Bible says the comforter is now listen.
[1639.8s] But now when the comforter is come and
[1642.1s] who is the comforter?
[1644.2s] Who is the
[1647.4s] comforter? Who is the
[1650.8s] comforter? Someone saying Christ. I'm
[1653.1s] the Holy Spirit. Yeah, we'll see that.
[1656.1s] That always very true. Now read brother.
[1661.0s] But now when the comforter is
[1663.6s] come from the father whom the father is
[1666.5s] going to send from the father
[1669.7s] even the spirit even the spirit of truth
[1673.5s] proceedth from the father. Then this
[1675.5s] spirit proceedth from who?
[1678.9s] It shall testify of me. This spirit
[1681.8s] shall testify of of me. Now listen
[1685.9s] brethren that when that comforter come
[1688.4s] even the spirit of truth he shall
[1692.1s] testify of me he shall
[1694.8s] personality can I say that a lawyer it
[1698.2s] come in the
[1701.5s] house grammatical in in any
[1704.8s] sense that brother it went it went and
[1709.3s] it came it is very impossible but now
[1713.1s] the bible say that when that water come,
[1716.6s] whomever will send unto you from the
[1719.0s] father, even the spirit of truth which
[1721.4s] proceedth from the father, he shall
[1725.3s] testify of me. Why in the Bible have you
[1729.0s] ever read the spirit testifying of
[1735.6s] Christ? What am I doing here?
[1740.0s] What am I doing here?
[1742.9s] But what is Christ
[1744.4s] says that when that spirit comes, he
[1747.0s] shall testify of what? Who has ever seen
[1749.5s] the Holy Spirit
[1751.4s] testifying? Who has ever seen? I read
[1754.1s] somewhere that that spirit came and it
[1756.7s] was testifying and people were moved by
[1759.0s] the word of who has ever read such a
[1760.9s] thing. Now listen, brethren, let us see.
[1763.5s] There are those who testify of
[1767.3s] Jesus. Number one principle, turn to the
[1769.8s] book of Revelation.
[1772.0s] and take that to be your mind that when
[1774.2s] the spirit of truth come even the
[1776.5s] comforter he shall
[1779.0s] testify of me when the Bible have you
[1782.6s] ever read the spirit
[1785.2s] testify of the Christ himself
[1807.4s] No. 22:16 the book of Revelation. Jesus
[1811.5s] sent my angel. Jesus have sent my
[1815.6s] angel to
[1818.0s] testify unto
[1820.8s] you these things in the midst of
[1823.1s] churches.
[1827.7s] Amen. Now who is testifying here? But
[1832.1s] what did Christ say that? Who did Christ
[1834.8s] say that will testify of
[1838.1s] him? But now Revelation says that it is
[1841.6s] the angel. This is Christ still speaking
[1845.6s] himself that he has seen his angel to
[1849.0s] testify and what these things. But the
[1852.4s] same speaks in John chapter 15 that the
[1855.4s] spirit of truth even the converter shall
[1858.1s] testify of me who is testifying.
[1863.4s] Now listen brethren turn the book of
[1866.4s] acts 1
[1868.3s] vers8 you have to understand what Christ
[1870.8s] was meaning 18 acts 1 vers8
[1874.9s] now listen Christ said but he disciples
[1877.4s] shall receive
[1878.9s] power and
[1882.1s] after the holy ghost is come upon
[1886.4s] you he shall be
[1888.7s] witnesses unto me both in Jerusalem
[1893.3s] and all Judea in
[1896.7s] Samaria and unto the uttermost part of
[1899.7s] what? Now Christ says, "But he shall
[1902.5s] receive power after that the Holy Ghost
[1905.0s] is come upon what? Then he shall do that
[1908.2s] that what? Witness or testify of me only
[1912.2s] after the Holy Spirit comes unto you."
[1915.1s] It is very true when I say that the Holy
[1917.0s] Spirit was testifying of Christ in the
[1919.1s] days of the
[1921.2s] apostles. Is that very true? Yes. But
[1925.3s] now he's testifying of the apost of
[1927.8s] Christ himself through the apostles.
[1931.0s] Why? Because
[1934.1s] preaches can testify but it can only
[1938.1s] witness and testify inside a
[1941.1s] believer or an angel.
[1945.4s] Are we
[1947.0s] together? Now listen, stand to this
[1950.1s] book. I'm coming back to the Bible. I'm
[1952.6s] not running from the
[1954.0s] Bible. That's the same quotation in 29
[1957.4s] page 34. This is true quotation. Those
[1960.3s] who have here sometimes saying these
[1962.0s] things were added. This is manuscript
[1964.6s] volume 2 page 34 paragraph 1. that evil
[1968.0s] had been accumulating for centuries and
[1970.2s] could only be restrained and assisted by
[1972.0s] the mighty power of what? The Holy
[1974.2s] Spirit. The third person of what? The
[1977.2s] who could come with no modified energy.
[1980.1s] Listen, there's this spirit does not
[1983.1s] come with its own modified energy, but
[1986.2s] in the fullness of what? Divine power.
[1988.8s] Another spirit must be met for the
[1991.1s] essence of evil was working in all ways
[1993.4s] and the submission of man to his what?
[1995.5s] Satanic captivity was amazing. The same
[1998.5s] in 1888 materials page 49 1493 paragraph
[2003.2s] 2 says evil had been accumulating for
[2005.8s] centuries and could only be restrained
[2009.1s] and resisted now in each and every
[2012.1s] quotations using white
[2014.6s] ads some vocabulary and English. He she
[2018.0s] says he evil had been accumulating for
[2020.4s] centuries and could only be restrained
[2023.1s] and resisted by the mighty power of
[2025.7s] what? The Holy Spirit, the third person,
[2029.6s] the Godhead who could come with no
[2031.5s] modified energy but in the fullness of
[2033.7s] divine power. The mighty agency in CTR
[2036.5s] Christ triumphant page 301 paragraph
[2040.6s] number one. How many witnesses are those
[2043.5s] in the quotations? Now can you say this
[2046.0s] quotation was
[2048.5s] added? No. It is there the Bible and it
[2051.7s] came from the lips of each. It says
[2056.4s] Christ determined to bestow a gift of
[2059.0s] those who had been with him and who
[2062.1s] should believe on him because this was
[2064.9s] the equation of his ascension and
[2066.9s] inaugression and to believe in heaven.
[2069.6s] What gift could Christ bestow rich
[2072.1s] enough to signalize and grace his
[2075.2s] ascension to the medial throne? It must
[2078.6s] be worthy of his greatness and his
[2080.8s] royality. Christ gave his representative
[2083.7s] the third person of the godhead, the
[2086.1s] holy
[2087.2s] what? Spirit. And this gift could not be
[2090.2s] done
[2091.0s] what? This thing is a gift. It is a
[2094.8s] gift. Take that. And how do God bestow
[2097.7s] gift unto his people? Through which
[2101.2s] process? Through which process? How do
[2104.3s] we receive the gift of the Holy Spirit?
[2106.2s] Do they come direct from the father?
[2108.8s] What is the order? It comes from the
[2112.1s] father, the
[2114.0s] son. Then the ministation of what? All
[2117.4s] the angels. It is a gift. The Holy
[2119.4s] Spirit is a gift that is given unto us.
[2122.4s] Turn back to your Bible, brethren. There
[2124.5s] is the third person of the godhead. Last
[2126.3s] time the book of John chapter 14 and
[2130.5s] veil we are coming back still. This is
[2133.8s] something that is very easy to explain
[2136.4s] in the Bible. Now the book of John
[2138.7s] chapter 14. Let us
[2141.7s] take verse number 15 says, "If you love
[2145.6s] me, keep my commandments and I will pray
[2149.0s] the father and he shall give you another
[2151.8s] what that he
[2155.3s] personality he may abide with
[2158.7s] you forever. Even the spirit of truth
[2162.2s] whom the world cannot receive because it
[2164.6s] seeth him what? Never knoweth him not
[2167.8s] but he know him."
[2173.1s] How to listen bre what Christ says and I
[2177.4s] will pray the father and he shall give
[2179.3s] you another comforter that is the holy
[2181.4s] spirit sure that we may abide with you
[2184.8s] forever forever even the spirit of truth
[2188.3s] now listen brethren turn to the book of
[2189.9s] matthew we are coming back
[2192.4s] there is precept upon precept 28 verse
[2196.2s] 19 that you
[2198.7s] The Bible reads
[2201.5s] 28 verse 19, the book of Matthew.
[2204.4s] Go therefore, teach all nations.
[2208.9s] Uh-huh. Know the Son, not the Holy
[2211.9s] Ghost.
[2213.8s] Yeah.
[2215.4s] Yeah.
[2218.5s] Always even unto the end of the world.
[2220.8s] Now Christ says long I Christ I am with
[2225.2s] you always even unto the end. Now who
[2229.8s] was supposed to remain the disciples
[2231.3s] until the end of the world? Is Christ
[2233.4s] himself in the book of Matthew? Are we
[2235.5s] together? But now listen in 14:16 he
[2238.5s] says even the spirit of truth whom the
[2241.6s] world cannot do what? receive because it
[2244.1s] seeth him not neither knoweth him not
[2246.2s] but he know him for he dwelleth with you
[2249.1s] and shall be in
[2252.6s] you I don't know much English not
[2255.7s] learned such as you
[2257.7s] people not learned but I understand what
[2260.6s] the Christ is saying now Christ says
[2263.3s] that this comforter will abide with them
[2266.1s] forever then Matthew 28 19 and 20 Christ
[2269.8s] says that me Christ I shall be with you
[2273.4s] even
[2274.9s] unto the end of the world. Christ
[2278.2s] himself speaking. But now Christ speaks
[2280.8s] of the spirit and saying that this
[2283.0s] spirit will b with you forever even unto
[2286.8s] the end of what? The world. Then verse
[2289.6s] 17, Christ says that even the spirit of
[2291.4s] truth whom the world cannot receive
[2294.0s] because it seeth him not yet never
[2296.5s] knoweth him but he know him for he
[2298.9s] dwelleth with you
[2301.0s] now.
[2302.6s] Sure. For he does what? Dwelleth with
[2306.2s] you. Now as he speaks, that spirit
[2309.0s] dwells with what? With you. But again he
[2312.5s] says and shall be in you. That is what?
[2316.5s] In the
[2317.7s] future. Now that dwells with them as he
[2321.5s] speaks with them. But now he says but
[2324.7s] later he will be in
[2329.4s] you. Do we understand?
[2332.6s] Do you
[2333.8s] understand? Oh, listen brethren. Turn
[2335.8s] down to your phones. Open the
[2337.6s] quotations. We are harmonizing the
[2339.8s] scriptures in the spirit of prophecy cuz
[2342.2s] my time is
[2343.6s] up. Oh brother. Okay, let me read the
[2346.3s] last
[2352.8s] quotation. Now I want to read a book
[2355.0s] that most of you I don't know if you
[2356.6s] have it in your
[2357.8s] phones. Now we are so used to the red
[2365.2s] estate. Now I want to read from letters
[2367.4s] and
[2373.8s] manuscript. Letters and manuscript.
[2376.6s] Allow me look for it
[2378.4s] brother. Okay.
[2380.6s] Letters and manuscripts 19
[2383.2s] LTMS 9 sorry 9
[2386.7s] LTMS letter 66 of
[2389.6s] 1894 paragraph number
[2393.2s] 18 9
[2398.3s] LTMS then put comma then letter
[2403.4s] LT66 of
[2405.3s] 1894 paragraph number
[2409.8s] I don't know if someone is there or I'll
[2411.4s] read mine can write and look it later.
[2413.7s] My time also is up. I want to be
[2419.0s] okay. It says 19 LTMS letter 66 of 1894
[2422.9s] paragraph 18
[2426.7s] paragraph 18. Now it says let me read
[2429.3s] mine. If any of you lack wisdom, let him
[2433.0s] ask of God that giveth all men li
[2436.3s] liberally and apprenth not. And it shall
[2439.8s] be given him, but let him act in what?
[2442.5s] In faith, nothing wavering. James 1:5
[2445.1s] and 6. And whatsoever we ask, we receive
[2448.0s] of him because we keep his commandments
[2450.7s] and do those things that are pleasing in
[2453.0s] his sight. And we know that the son of
[2455.8s] God is come, that is Christ himself, the
[2458.0s] son of God, and hath given us an
[2460.6s] understanding that we may know him that
[2463.1s] is true and we are in him that is true
[2467.6s] even in his son Jesus Christ. This is
[2470.5s] the true God and eternal life. Little
[2474.0s] children, keep yourself from
[2476.6s] others. Then the Bible says in 1 John 5
[2480.2s] 21, the Lord is soon to come. We want
[2484.2s] that complete and perfect understanding
[2487.1s] which the letter alone can give. Now
[2489.4s] listen brothers and sisters, it is not
[2491.8s] safe to catch the spirit from another.
[2495.3s] It is not safe to do what? To catch the
[2498.6s] spirit from another. We want the Holy
[2501.8s] Spirit which
[2504.0s] is Jesus
[2507.1s] Christ. Are we
[2509.3s] together? that we want the Holy Spirit
[2512.2s] to reach. Listen to the grammar that
[2514.3s] this woman
[2515.7s] had. I'm praying. We want the Holy
[2518.9s] Spirit to which is Jesus Christ. If you
[2521.6s] commune with God, we shall have strength
[2523.8s] and grace and efficiency. Amen. Now, who
[2527.5s] is the Holy
[2529.0s] Spirit? I'll continue from there as we
[2532.2s] be looking. What did EG White mean by
[2535.4s] saying that seal could only be
[2538.4s] resisted only through the mighty agency
[2541.0s] of the third person of what? But now the
[2543.9s] spirit of truth that Christ is promising
[2545.8s] to his disciples is he himself
[2549.8s] manifested in what? In the person of his
[2554.3s] spirit. Amen. Are we together? How many
[2558.5s] are following this? Allow me see. know
[2560.7s] you can be teaching a big class and how
[2563.6s] many just carry up and be be very I'm
[2566.6s] seeing brethren how many are saying man
[2569.0s] not understanding
[2570.4s] this I'm still
[2572.9s] confused sure sister you'll speak and
[2576.6s] I'll give chance for questions now let
[2579.0s] us pray then I believe tomorrow God will
[2581.4s] give us another chance to continue in
[2582.7s] Jesus
[2591.9s] We are
[2594.3s] praying. Our father in heaven, we thank
[2596.6s] you for this
[2598.2s] day. Thank you for giving me strength to
[2600.6s] speak unto thy children. Indeed, I'm
[2602.6s] unworthy to stand before such a
[2604.2s] congregation because of our
[2606.1s] sinfulness. But father because of thy
[2608.4s] graces you still allow us to preach
[2610.1s] these mighty truths and holy truths. We
[2613.2s] pray that each and every time we study
[2614.9s] this truth help us father that even
[2616.6s] ourselves you'll be sanctified through
[2618.3s] the truth. That father one day as you
[2621.0s] come in the glory of thy angels, the
[2622.7s] glory of thy father and the glory that
[2624.5s] you have. We might stand firm to say
[2627.4s] this is our God that you have been
[2628.7s] waiting for. I pray for the brethren
[2631.4s] listening unto these messages. Indeed,
[2633.3s] this is a powerful convention which
[2634.9s] youths are deciding to walk in the
[2637.8s] truth. How I pray that you help both of
[2640.3s] us to stand firm upon the platform of
[2643.3s] eternal truth as we'll be continuing
[2646.1s] this study. Father, I pray that you help
[2647.6s] us understand who you are right because
[2650.3s] we know that the
[2651.7s] only topic that will help us overcome
[2655.0s] sin and live a purity of life is to know
[2656.7s] they are right. I pray for those who are
[2659.8s] in this all women, children, youths, men
[2663.9s] that father give us strength to know
[2665.5s] their right. Help us to study our Bibles
[2668.1s] and help us to be of humble spirit to be
[2670.3s] taught by thee that you know who you
[2672.8s] are. The programs that remain in this
[2675.8s] day, the teachings we have, Father, we
[2678.2s] pray that you help us to take them
[2679.5s] seriously. That father we might say that
[2682.5s] at the end of this convention that
[2684.0s] indeed it was very powerful and God was
[2686.6s] with us through his ministration of all
[2688.0s] the angels above with us. Father help us
[2691.1s] to understand more and more in thy
[2692.9s] scriptures and above. Father we pray
[2695.4s] that we daily help us to claim upon thy
[2698.0s] promises and trust in the righteousness
[2700.7s] of thy son that we live a holy life is
[2703.2s] our prayer by faith in Jesus holy name.
[2706.0s] Amen.
