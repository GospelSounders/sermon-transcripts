that Christ was to come in 22nd October 1844 they were preaching that the sanctuary was to be cleansed by the end of3 days sadly enough they never understood that there was also sanctuary in heaven

most holy place and they went back and stud the sanctuary basing the illustration from the book of HEBs and from that God gave them Revelations and visions and the Sabbath message came to them in 1847 after which they went on with studying the scriptures they began to preach having publishing houses remember we were told that James White began the publishing house was given name sth Day Adventist

this history as the time was going on things were changing AB you know 1956 there was a question by evangelicals asking if Adventist are remember the first to be discussed the of trity by some people known [Music] as you realize that the sth Adventist began to deny some points of their fath that made them a distinct people realize that the sctu message was denied wison General Conference president by then announced publicly before the sth day Adventist because they are now adopted the Trinity that belong to Catholics there was another another Universal and truly Catholic church called [Music] the will tell the booked messages B4 204 religion was changed but according to the principles of God's government in the book upward Luke 131 we are told that God will always generation to car with the work if the first generation CH proved unfaithful to God now that there group of people that were to study the Bible in the S ADV to give them light to be able to go back to the true principles of

allow me give you the history of people with church members who are sitting here today so that we might know how the Lord has led us in the past now there was a school opened by the general conference confence somewhere in the school was called in it short form in this school people stud the Bible and God gave them light and by this movement of young evangelist was organized in the year 2018 I'll try to be brief because of time so in 2018 the Evangelist Ministry was organized but you see the Church of God had been there before I I I had told you that it began from the Advent movement in 184 it began from 1844 down down the lineing that principle that I that God will choose another generation so the chist in 201 was organized and they began preaching the thirs message within the general conference churches in November 2018 Ministry was expelled from the general conference you can remember most of them were coming from conference so they were expelled from the conference some of them

[191.6s] the
[194.3s] future unless we forget how the Lord has
[198.0s] [Music]

[202.5s] give Mission reports to remind us of the
[209.9s] today I want to give a very large
[214.3s] report since the ministry of evangelist
[217.4s] was
[229.3s] Oran
[234.2s] begin first we have the Advent movement
[241.1s] Advent movement that were preaching that
[242.9s] Christ was to come in 22nd October
[250.9s] 1844 they were preaching that the
[253.2s] sanctuary was to be cleansed by the end
[255.5s] of3
[261.9s] days sadly enough they never understood
[264.5s] that there was also sanctuary in heaven
[270.9s] the Advent movement you know was
[272.3s] disappointed in the year
[280.2s] 1844 but there was a group that remained
[282.6s] to study the
[285.4s] scriptures a group led
[291.0s] by you know that was given a vision that
[294.7s] Christ was to go to the most holy place
[301.8s] and they went back and stud the
[303.0s] sanctuary basing the illustration from
[304.8s] the book of
[313.0s] HEBs and from that God gave them
[315.4s] Revelations and visions and the Sabbath
[317.4s] message came to them in
[322.4s] 1847 after which they went on with
[324.8s] studying the
[327.2s] scriptures they began to preach having
[329.7s] publishing
[333.3s] houses remember we were told that James
[335.8s] White began the publishing
[345.4s] house was given name sth Day
[352.2s] Adventist 18637 Adventist organized into
[356.0s] a general conference
[363.0s] 1872 18 from
[369.5s] 1872 ADV James declare fundamental
[380.4s] principles and that the sth Adventist
[383.6s] believed on one true God
[389.7s] and his son Jesus
[391.3s] Christ and the spirit of God the power
[393.7s] of
[396.0s] God that is why to can have of one true
[404.7s] God
[408.2s] 1872 1874 another fundamental principle
[411.6s] is
[415.9s] written 189 another fundamental
[418.8s] principle is written
[422.3s] allow me just take you briefly on this
[427.0s] history as the time was going
[430.8s] on things were changing
[436.6s] AB you know
[443.1s] 1956 there was a question by
[445.3s] evangelicals asking if Adventist are
[453.6s] remember the first to be discussed the
[455.5s] of
[461.4s] trity by some people known
[464.6s] [Music]
[469.7s] as you realize that the sth Adventist
[472.7s] began to deny some points of their fath
[475.0s] that made them a distinct people
[482.6s] realize that the sctu message was
[494.6s] denied wison General Conference
[497.4s] president by
[500.3s] then
[502.0s] announced publicly before the sth day
[505.0s] Adventist
[509.6s] because they are now adopted the Trinity
[511.9s] that belong to
[516.6s] Catholics there was another another
[519.4s] Universal and truly Catholic church
[521.1s] called
[525.0s] [Music]
[527.3s] the will tell the booked messages
[534.7s] B4 204
[539.6s] religion was
[542.4s] changed but according to the principles
[544.8s] of God's
[547.6s] government in the book upward Luke
[554.7s] 131 we are told that God will always
[557.8s] generation to car with the
[563.6s] work if the first generation
[567.0s] CH proved unfaithful to God
[574.8s] now that there group of people that were
[578.5s] to study the Bible in the S
[584.6s] ADV to give them
[588.4s] light to be able to go back to the true
[591.2s] principles
[594.8s] of and by this allow me tell you
[599.6s] that God has been leading a group of
[603.7s] people and a brief history just on how
[606.9s] evangelist was
[612.7s] organized I know there are very many
[615.0s] groups that are taking the
[620.4s] message but allow me give you the
[622.5s] history of people
[629.5s] with church members who are sitting here
[633.4s] today so that we might know how the Lord
[635.5s] has led us in the
[638.4s] past now there was a school opened by
[641.4s] the general
[645.2s] conference confence somewhere
[648.5s] in the school was called in it short
[654.5s] form in this school people stud the
[657.0s] Bible
[660.5s] and God gave them
[663.0s] light and by
[666.3s] this movement of young evangelist was
[669.2s] organized in the year
[675.7s] 2018 I'll try to be brief because of
[680.2s] time so in 2018 the Evangelist Ministry
[683.2s] was
[686.8s] organized but you see the Church of God
[688.9s] had been there
[691.5s] before I I I had told you that it began
[696.1s] from the Advent movement in
[706.2s] 184 it began from 1844 down down the
[712.8s] lineing that principle that
[716.0s] I that God will choose another
[718.3s] generation
[720.9s] so the chist in 201 was
[726.8s] organized and they began preaching the
[729.0s] thirs message within the general
[730.5s] conference
[736.7s] churches in November
[742.5s] 2018 Ministry was expelled from the
[745.1s] general conference
[752.1s] you can remember most of them were
[753.6s] coming from
[758.6s] conference so they were expelled from
[761.0s] the
[763.4s] conference some of them were just chased
[766.2s] literally from
[769.8s] churches they were expelled and they
[771.8s] could not preach in those
[775.1s] churches they came to and there was a
[778.1s] church that welcome
[781.7s] them and that is called
[785.2s] Church they preach
[788.6s] there in that
[793.5s] church2 that church also expelled
[799.7s] them in 201 when the ministry was
[806.3s] organized they went and visited a place
[808.9s] in
[815.3s] they dist books and
[822.7s] bibles together with cloes for those
[828.9s] who the second second mission in they
[835.3s] went by this time they were together
[837.6s] with brother sad brother
[840.0s] and
[844.1s] [Music]
[846.2s] together but today we still don't have
[849.4s] other people within this group but they
[850.6s] are also preaching somewhere
[854.3s] else so missions there are several
[856.7s] missions and several
[861.8s] conventions in
[864.8s] 2019 several conventions were held and
[867.6s] people were coming into this convention
[869.3s] to
[873.8s] be and in
[877.0s] 2019 they went and
[884.1s] preach total number of 42 members were
[890.7s] baptized
[893.0s] uh a total number of 42 people were
[896.1s] baptized
[899.9s] and they established a church
[903.4s] there that church was called Amazing
[905.8s] Grace I
[908.5s] think we have members from that
[919.0s] place thank you
[926.0s] for sometimes you can forget but thank
[928.7s] God pioneers of the
[934.8s] ministry I see the import of P by the
[938.5s] [Music]
[941.0s] way no apy apas
[948.9s] comes so there are several missions that
[952.3s] were
[954.7s] done me come to20
[959.4s] mission was done now
[963.5s] in members
[966.6s] baptized I remember
[970.1s] there for
[978.1s] Ministry Ministry is the ministry of our
[980.8s] Elder Patrick
[986.6s] there they met there
[989.6s] by this time evangelist was preaching
[995.2s] independently without the support of of
[998.0s] these churches because they had been
[1005.6s] expelled and allow me allow me allow me
[1008.4s] come to 2021 because I see time is
[1010.5s] running so
[1013.0s] fast now
[1015.6s] 2021 having been expelled from the
[1018.1s] conference
[1020.7s] we were asking ourselves how to how will
[1022.9s] our camp
[1027.3s] meetings according to the concept that
[1029.5s] was
[1037.5s] given the first meeting was organized in
[1040.1s] the
[1043.3s] year2 in the month of August a c meeting
[1047.0s] of 10 days
[1050.7s] was held in a place
[1056.4s] called the theme of that
[1058.7s] [Music]
[1062.3s] meeting was I want my church
[1068.0s] back weed the church that began in
[1073.6s] 1844 a church that was organized in 1863
[1081.8s] we wanted a
[1083.2s] church that was using the 1872 74
[1095.4s] 1889 the key text of that meeting was
[1098.0s] from the book of 1timothy
[1104.0s] 3: 3: 14 and
[1107.2s] 15 and the them
[1110.9s] song the them song is the song that
[1113.4s] young evangelist love
[1123.8s] today2 must be the breaking of the
[1128.3s] day those are powerful songs You Need to
[1131.1s] Say
[1133.1s] Amen 20 members were bed from that
[1135.8s] meeting
[1138.9s] remember during those times Brighton was
[1140.8s] very happy to be sent out of school Fe
[1142.5s] to go and finish that
[1152.2s] committee and by the end of that
[1155.4s] meeting the lord gave us our church
[1160.0s] back and church was
[1164.5s] organized based on 1889 FAL principle
[1171.5s] the Lord allowed Us by that
[1175.7s] that
[1181.3s] prach in the month of
[1184.7s] November 16 members were
[1188.1s] baptized and from that churches were
[1197.6s] organized a come meeting was held there
[1200.0s] by the end of the
[1204.0s] year let me come to 2022 very first
[1206.8s] because some
[1208.8s] time there were missions done during the
[1211.0s] year of
[1213.1s] 2022 there were reval efforts
[1219.3s] around then there was a meeting in the
[1221.9s] month of June and the month of
[1226.8s] July in other place
