[4.8s] doing some great work to establish a
[7.4s] sanitarium
[9.5s] where
[10.5s] our young tax will be
[12.5s] finding a great opportunity to
[14.8s] do some good work and as you can see we

[44.5s] uh some wonderful
[46.0s] and noble work
[48.2s] down here this is something that humbles
[51.3s] only humble men can do

[105.1s] establishment of the continent
[107.3s] and other facilities facilities which
[109.1s] are here
[110.1s] we are praying that
[111.8s] this being the
[113.7s] there will be several others that will
[115.4s] also follow
[116.6s] and as we can for the young people they
[119.6s] have sacrificed a lot and given a lot of
[122.2s] their lives
