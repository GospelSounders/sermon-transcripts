and then we saw also the mod by the way when a woman who welcome us told us oh you are the oldest so you come old us so they were telling us because we the old SDS you come and worship here so this is where the old SDS were so when I came back I had to go deep and start uh getting the e of the how the missionaries came to together because that is one of the how the third Angel's message came and because I'm connecting it with the true education I found it very nice in fact I took my time that that I had to go and do research so deep of how the missionary came to Kenya because we are also restoring the old foundations we also restoring the old foundations and as we do it we need to understand our what our history amen very important for us to understand our history so I want you to have it because Church Heritage is very important but I'm not going to go deep in the ones of the general that one you know I want now come to Kenya where we are so I wrote something very briefly so you can also take notes it is important so that even when no old man can can cheat you they can tell you you don't know anything because we not there but as we speak I don't think there which was born in 1906 we still alive there is none but even if there is there are very few and they not able to talk so we need also to know this history very important and I got the story of sth Adventist in K so you can put it this the story or the history of sth Adventist Church in Kenya and uh I this is what I found which may be very important to you to note one there somebody called how I wish I had a chalkboard but I don't have so somebody May write this name wrong way the man who brought sth Adventist Kenya is called CasCal cascine is written as C b a r s car like a car car you know a car is being written so it is car then you add s then c a l e n CasCal or CasCal I don't know how it's being called l e nalen a Grandville Grandville those are the three names but again he had four names he was called CasCal Grandville just a a there's no hcal Grandville Grandville Grand I don't know this man was the first Seventh Adventist in Kenya now he was born in [Music] 1879 before the preaching of right by faith he was born in 1879 in Canada his father was George Edward who was born in 18 44 his father was George Edward born in 1844 and the mother was called mother was called Odin Phillips othering Phillips born o r d l i n Phillips o r d [Music] e order orderly Philips D so not so brother welcome we are talking about the church Heritage here and we talking about the story of the Seventh Adventist Church in Kenya so we when we have just started and the man who brought the Seventh Adventist Kenya is called CasCal Arthur ARA Granville he was the first Seventh Day Adventist in Kenya his father was he was born in 1879 in Canada father was called George Edward born in 1844 and mother order in Philips 1847 the mother was born in 1847 he grew in USA he grew in USA United States of America baptism baptism baptism how CasCal was baptized baptism he was baptized in North Dakota with his parents with his parents his brother amamos and sister Mary in 1899 baptized in North Dakota with his parents his brother Amos and Sister Mary in 1899 now I want to ask you simple mathematics when was born in 1879 and he was baptized in 1899 how many years was he when he was baptized huh years he was baptized into one true God of the faith of the Seventh Day Adventist by that time uh sister is Mary sister is just Mary baptized in 1899 something which you need to note about casalin that as a young man he worked with his father who taught him many skills including as a young man he worked with his father who taught him many skills you remember we are going to learn true education and this this one really touched me his father taught him many things many skills including carpentry farming and metal work carpentry farming and metal work so that is what the father of casalin taught him you may ask about his quing formal education so right that formal school for Arthur ended when he was 10 years foral school for other ended when he was 10 years and he became a farmer a carpenter and a blacksmith his formal School ended when he was 10 thereby he became a farmer a carpenter and a blacksmith so he had three professors a farmer a carpenter and what black so that was the education when at 10 education had ended I don't know how that one you will not ask me that one for now let let's continue um although he loved he loved his father spread because the his father stade was what father taught him carpentry blacksmith those others he really loved his father stade he was also a vivid reader and that ambition to become a teacher he was a vivid reader and ambition to become a what a teacher so he wanted to become a teacher however much he loved his father the father taught him through fing and blacksmith but in his he had ambition become a what a teacher become a teacher thus he attended Union College from 1901 to 1902 he attended Union College from 1901 to 1902 1901 to 1902 he attended a Union College so somebody can go to college having done this those ones he went to college don't ask me do people go to college when they have only learned blacksmith don't ask me that one for now you will ask later in 1901 to 1902 now there's something which took place in the life of caline there's something here which also you need to not having attended Union College from 1901 to 1902 there's another point he was a brilliant student that he complet completed a 2E course in one year he was a brilliant student that completed a 2 year course in one one year year a twoe course he completed in one year in 1904 he entered another College where he completed his course in September 1906 in 1904 he entered another College training by completed his course in September 1906 1906 hope you know that 1906 is when SD began in Kenya so this so we are now entering in serious important uh life of him Ministry and marriage you can write that Ministry and marriage I was reading on how CasCal married and it was so I don't know it was so sweet Ministry and marriage Ministry and marriage in 1902 [Music] CasCal was recruited by General Conference president in 1902 CasCal was recruited by the general conference president a Daniels I hope you know that during that time the President of General Conference was called a Daniels AG Daniels AG Daniels in 1902 CasCal was recruited by General Conference president a G Danel to help 12 help strengthen the young Adventist Church in [Music] Britain to help young Adventist Church in Britain to help young Adventist Church in Britain so by 1902 how many years it was now 20 1902 it was if 1899 it was 20 then 1902 was 20 20 23 years so he was given a church a young Adventist Church in Britain especially as aort evangelis to dop evangelism cport evangelism and he was also to do that cport evangelism in Scotland W Scotland Wales and England so he was taking care of that young Adventist Church and he was also do called evangelism in Wales and in what Scotland and England now there was another interesting topic that he did not do he he did not did the conversing but also assisted in Evangelistic meetings we also not only doing that work but he's also assisting in Evangelistic meetings and camp meetings so he was a speaker in Evangelistic what meetings and also in camp meetings uh so there was a good point here this is a good point listen to it young men and women and all of us and myself yes this is the point I'm reading in one such meeting when they were in one of the meetings of one of the Evangelistic meetings come meeting there was a young lady there was what young lady there was a young lady called la Bruce Thomson Ellen Bruce Thomson one such meeting there was a young lady Helen Bruce Thompson who was a volunteer pianist Helen Bruce Thomson Helen Bruce THS [Music] pianist from GL why are you not writing this thing very important the next convention you be one will be teaching us the Adventist history K very important Glo is from Glo Glo Church spelling is g l o s g o Wu g l o s g o w GL go church and AR is CasCal remember CasCal is called CasCal AR so sometimes when I use the word AR you know it is CasCal AR it wasal grandv so this this young lady Bruce Thomson a volunteer fromo church and AR found himself concentrating more on the music than the Sal Moon Arthur found himself concentrating more on the music than the what than the salon than the salon so when Helen was playing piano CasCal now loved what music than the what so what that is what you want to look at later later now the word later means not not that year the word later not be 1902 so that we see later anden became hband so lat lat so was concentrating on music on so lat later you want to see that was later so you want to look at later I those who are just coming in we are talking about the history of the Seventh Adventist in Kenya so because you are late you will copy notes that man walking will he get this notes these notes are very important this history let nobody take them like me I wanted to only see listen to Fai amen also very salvation amen yes you don't have a pen is saying he doesn't have a pen so I don't know you can check this bag if you can get one I don't know I don't think you can get who has got two P just go and buy now another Point upon realizing CasCal extraordinary potential upon realizing calin's extraordinary potential and with support of Lis Richard upon realizing CasCal extraordinary potential upon realizing CasCal extraordinary potential and with support of Lis Richard with the support of Lois Richard Louise Richard conr conr upon realizing CasCal extraordinary potential and with support of Lis Richard Conrad the European division president the European division president which at that time included European countries which at that time included European countries comma the British Union European countries Comm and then you write the British Union voted to ordain him as a minister the British Union voted to him as a minister the British Union voted to as a what a minister he was ordained in England in 1906 he was ordained in England in 1906 he was ordained in England in 1906 at the time of completion of his Course in New College at the time of completion of his Course in New bold college at the time of completion of his Course in New College New College a new B College poop it was 27 years he was 27 years of age you can also ending you can that was officiated by Elma Elis Elma e l m e r Elis wat Elma Elis wat Brit British Union president Elma El wat wat this thing wat this so El wat is one name Elma Elis British Union president the oration was officed by Elma Elis British Union president and assisted by abber [Music] e r b e r t habat Hab cden how about cden who was the principal elect of the stand stur College who was the principal elect of the stand Boro colle so that one took place in 1906 now after that now the work of caline began after CasCal oration it was It was decided to send him as a missionary to British East Africa in bracket Kenya I believe those who have gone to school you understand British Africa how they divided and for you to come somewhere you are only to go under where your people are so was to come with America because America not any and the were only to come following the British so if you are coming from Britain you are only to go where the British and you to go through the missionaries are they were working to together I hope you know that so that that is why it was very difficult for for people to go to Tanzania because were only Germans so for you to attend a missionary send it German protor there so he came to British after Calo it was decided to send him as a missionary to British East Africa British East Africa in bracket Kenya he came alone but request he was he came alone he came alone Remember by 1906 he had not married we wrot a point later they married so from 1902 to 1906 they're not married he was only interested in music but not in marri but remember when he was being sent he was sent to Kenya without a wife he came a what alone so that that is very powerful point he came alone but he requested that his fany Helen Thomson desent after a year he requested the conference the union MH he came alone but he requested that his fan Helen Thompson be sent yes now a I look at how I love how CasCal organized this thing in a nice way fact this story made look another point now another point at the same time conr asked Peter to go with him to help in African language conr who was the one who him was the president of you don't know let me continue yes so at the same time asked Peter to go with him to help in African language so you can write in bracket Mr Peter Peter he was called Peter nambo he was coming from Malawi nasand Malawi so was an African person he went to Britain to to study the Bible so he was told to bring CasCal because he was going to help in African what language so asked because are an African please kindly go with who language so Peter was not a an American not a Europe but he was he went there so he was they came all of them the two missionar sailed from Hamburg Germany on October 1st 1906 the two missionaries sailed from Hamburg Germany the two missionary s from H Germany on October 1st 1906 and to Mombasa the two missionary sailed from am Germany on October 1st 1906 and route to

Tanga island of i s l a s is island island of Tanga Tanga is presently called tanzan are waiting for them waiting for them another point the three left Tanga and arrived in Mombasa on November 27y October to November 27 you mean this remember when they left coming November 27th is when they arrived in where in Mombasa 1906 27 the three left Tanga and arrived in Mombasa on November 27th 1906

already arrived and they were all calling themselves what Christian you will they welcomed him as their fellow Christians so he went this Miss soci agent in Mombasa went and greeted the M Christians Kenya now from Mombasa from Mombasa they traveled about 960 kilom I didn't go there going to Nairobi and the rest so I just got this kilm 960 kilm by Railway the railway was called wam GF for those

Delma answered as the C an as aaton of honor and the other one Delma was a best what best man best man and best amen they also accompani the new on their honeymoon they also company the new LS on the honeymoon which comprised of the Railway Journeys so that was they also accompany the new on the anyon which comprised of the Railway Journeys on their way they were seeing zebra heners Antelope buffal elephants Lions so it was a nice animal as they were moving I believe you know that those things were there along the way as you are coming Ser Forest they saw those things jumping and it was nice for them it was very nice is written here so it compris of the Railway long Railway Journeys and they offer sing zebra anope which the lady had never seen was nice for the lady in fact it was a nice foren amen anden enjoyed he was very happy amen the next point with his with his wife with his wife who was committed to the mission Arthur continued with the church planting activities with his wife who was committed to the mission Arthur continued arur continued with church planting activities with his wife who was committed to the mission after continued with church planting activities this is what we were learning with the the the junior Youth and the seniors that for those who are willing to marry we need to pray much that you may get a lady that can be committed in Mission work by the way what made kasal to do a serious work here in Kenya is the woman that married imagine a lady who accept to come in a land where people walk naked with you you are going to get a point that L were walking naked and you you know people from do not know why coton what planting began there you don't know I want to read with you the L were walking and the lady came to join a man in the bush now amen amen so may God help the people are [Music] amen that was the life that is muu by the wayu coming [Music] M they bigs they had a tent [Music] am that is how the Miss began in ADV very bad [Music] mhm a the next point you uh he also realized that there were no books in D he also realized that there were no books in he mastered the language and translated some portions of the new testament which was published by the British Society he also realized that there were no books that were no books in he mastered the language mastered the words language and translated some persons on the new testament which was published in by the British Society British Bible Society so what did he do first he realized that that there were no books in he mastered the language and translated some persons in the New Testament which was published by the British Bible societies so the first language to be translated from English was what in that means will be a head of the word of God more than any other Tri they are the ones who are Jokers amen another one so he mastered and transl New Testament New Testament Matthew to Revelation was translated in L and later on is when they came and translated the old what Testament in 1908 b b m and JN Sparks BL M and JN Sparks joined the growing number of missionaries joined the the growing number of missionaries not and J Sparks joined the growing number of missionaries and G became the parent mission for several other Mission FES and G became the parent mission for seever for several other missions filed another Point JD Baker J founded you know who knows where we div to it was founded it was the first it was founded by called J founded out of G in 1909 was began in 1909 19 huh 1909 [Music] [Music] 19 in 1909 making this second in South and the of making it the second Adventist missions in South yanza and the rest of Kenya so after gya the next Vision was is the second one that is still in the South Nang another [Music] one Ellen was capable of s stress s stress what is going on just don't Len okay thank you enen was capable of sim stress s stress who is the seem stress that is s m s t r e s which a Sim Stress Check Your Dictionary who is a sess because Ellen was the wife of cascine was a sress check it yes nobody knows all phones are off but I think there's somebody with this phone check for us stress take the microphone to the one checking s stress yes give him the dictionary check in webst dictionary now as you checking Ellen was capable of s stress and our challenge was not lack of written language in Cav but lack of any clothing at all so the challenge of was she was a capable sress and that challenge was not even lack of written language in Cavo Cavo is the L but lack of any clothing at all so the L were walking naked around Lake Victoria with was a CL which the one you TI it here so when you see somebody coming in front of you so it was very difficult when one is coming in front and the other one behind I don't know how they were doing it so this was a challenge of this woman uh Ellen and um the ls were not in clothes the ls were not in cloes and Ellen learned to change the situation Ellen learned to change change the situation so apart from soliciting closed from the Homeland now the word apart from apart from soliciting clothes from our homeland meaning she was requesting for clothes to come from Scotland to Kenya to help the L to be clothed but they did not only wait to solicit clothing from our homeland to Kenya she rather became a useful cotton gr she became a useful cotton grower used to make clothes used to make clothes those who are coming around and is there you hear that there was Aon growing there we coming from here even ver you don't know you have never seen coton the coton which was grown in around was brought by Ellen Bruce Thompson now this coton was to help them to make clothes and this industry contributed to the effectiveness of the message this industry of coton growing to be used to make cloes contributed to the effectiveness of the message we able to do to ensure that the message reaches to everyone uh baptism the first baptism this is also interesting the first baptism baptism baptism baptism the first baptism and they write this powerful date on May 21st on May 21st 1911 on May 21st 1911 5 years later 5 years later of the arrival of the first missionaries 5 years later of the arrival of the first missionary is the baptism of 16 16 people was witnessed by B I don't know how we read this name b o b full stop o h m e how do we read can that H home B is it home I don't know there was 16 people by baptized which was witnessed by the be home the the superintendant of German East Africa the superintendent of German East Africa now some of the young men that were baptized were some of the young men that were baptized were I'm not going to read all the 16 but there were young men the first the people who accepted the Three Angels message when it came to again it was very difficult five years you are preaching nobody has accepted the message nobody so these people were only after 5 years now the young men that were baptized young men number one some of the young men that were baptized were number one Isa from gandia Village I'm how many knows the isa's place you know it Mama n know where is that was the first person to be baptized as a young man in 1911 died still alive died but the fam is the very rich family is the first young man to be baptized number two J from K maned number three from k k is inel from Ab from Kil and then the last one which I wrote the name I left the 12 names you can go and check Daniel onyango from kyang from those are the first four young men that used to preach the gospel if you go around go and ask the place go and ask if you come Toad go and ask a place called J among many others not talked about May I've not talked about the rest of the others those ones are also there and now following the first baptism and this young men were baptized listen to what took place following the that first baptism that was done in Lake Victoria next to gandia just there in the lake there following the first baptism the mission spread in Gia to their neighboring gy uh uh after this baptism great things happen the mission spread in Gia to their neighboring those young men that were baptized were also engaged in preaching and doing other things now new Mission stations you can write them as a result new Mission stations number one new Mission stations we in 1909 we9 19 10 to 1912 K 1912 n 1912 kambo 1912 1913 got 193 got ringa is in ringa Islands this were the new station that came as a result of the first baptism and the mission now spread powerfully and that is why if you go to the L land and K land most all of them most of them are Adventist the challenge is even the reforms are too much in in KY land and in in in L yes okay okay let me new Miss stations from my not 1910 to 1912 Nan 1912 kamu 1912 1913 kungu 1912 got ringa 1913 got R so those were the first mission stations it was in and the South alone in central Anglican had gone there and remember the British had said something that they did not want interfere with other missionaries so you are to go where another Christian Missionary has never entered because they were saying it is Big please find somewhere people have not gone to so that they may not be able to fight themselves they knew that if they do that Africans will not accept the what the gospel so they didn't want to fight among themselves that is what they were doing those times um to know thanks to not to not things to not this is very important for the missionaries here some people may think that there was money flowing from Europe or from America to this missionaries I found this one very important for us that from 1906 from 1906 when these missionaries arrived the first money the first money to arrive was 22,500 Sterling pound which arrived from the general conference it arrived from the general conference through Mombasa through Mombasa missionary Society it arrived 7 years after the missionaries had arrived that is the first money they received 2,500 Sterling pound and it came after 7 years you can ask yourself how was casalin eating how was coming to KY to open the Mission Station when the first money to be sent came after 7 years that is something to note that is something to be what noted that the money arrived after what 7 years from the general conference that is the Sterling pound 2500 that is something to be noted number two to be noted during World War One one many things were looted and damaged and workers except castaline and others were kept from the station nearly 2 years World War I was in 1914 World War one was in 1914 during that time the properties of were damage the things that the church had done were damaged and some workers had to be removed only CasCal were kept in the station in the British protectorate for 2 years without working as a result of World War I until America entered the war in 1917 which stopped the war because the War was between triple and Triple Alliance in 1921 in 1921 Calen returned to us in this he returned to the US so Calin was not buried in Gia he went back he was not buried here he went back to us and in the same year he went in the same year he returned his wife Ellen died in Oregon his wife Ellen died in Oregon and castaline remained without a wife I think it was around 58 years from 197 1879 to 1921 was how many years 1879 to 1921 it was how many years huh 40 19 1879 to 1921 42 he was 42 okay 42 years the wife died in 1924 pascaline married Anita jamen married an Johnson after the wife died she married that one is allowed she married a lady called Anita Jameson and uh meanwhile other missionaries arrived in gendia other missionaries arrived in gendia they included g g mad mad mad arrived in gendia WT bnet arrived in gendia but L and WW Armstrong also arrived in gandia in 1924 K Mission sanitarium was open which is currently called gandia oal now stolen by the government and the Purple powers and sanar was [Music] open as that one was taking place caline was sent to pastoral work in D in British from 1931 to 1942 where he became the president of the three fields in British final thing to note that Publishing House the small printing house was started in 1910 to 1914 by CasCal and finally CasCal in the east of the ls he wrote four 04 words of the L dictionary which was tered as L dictionary the diary was written by M4 Proverbs were written by him I left there from my church edit there a lot of things I skipped and that is the ad Heritage from there the gospel moved soan the gospel reached when elen white was still alive and that was the Gospel of the Three Angels message it was supported by the hand workk those two the reason why the money did not come from the general confence but the workers help themselves the wife started coton farming and that one was helping to use the clothes the young men that were baptized were helping in NW work in the morning and in the afternoon they were going to preach around to the fellow LS and as they were preaching coming and working with in the farm using their hands and also preaching using the hands they were sent to K here they were preaching and digging and hitting money came after seven good years and it was from the general conference by the Sterling pound 2 2,500 any question up to reached so that I get into Part B any question any addition that was the church Heritage the eory of the Seventh Day Adventist Church in Kenya before the apostasy yes Sur take a microphone yes ask uh my question is our Advent is allowed to marry a second wife after the DAT of the first wife repeat the question are sth Day Adventist allowed to marry the second wife after the death of the first the wife Mich answer yes answer what is the biblical does the bible allow someone to marry again after the death of the wife I think that was in the Bible is it which Corinthians is it first Genesis 25 verse1 we finding Abraham after the death of Sarah Abraham took another wife now according to the bial is allowed that after the first wife if you cannot Remain the way you are you are allowed to marry another wife even a woman is allowed even Paul says that a woman is only bound to the husband when the husband is still alive but when the husband dies she's free to choose anyone even you love reading the wife died and he married again in fact he wanted to man get someone and went and married so they are married yes take the microphone my question is [Laughter] [Music] J yes yes yes yes yes here the microphone below 24 years but 21 223 yes I'm a m I'm I think this will be very far away from yes what is going on there 2 2122 years another person I I think that things to not disturb my class let it be answered very fast or else it will be taken to the Family Life Department yes nobody has got an an answer I I youth not out of his things spiritual prophecy says a youth not out of these things is too young even to discuss what marriage is so somebody from 0 to 19 years should not even talk about it that is from theop that means somebody who has come out of jeans so that is it [Music] [Music] but of the do not allow you because loss of the land does not allow such amen yes in church is a question so my friend I hope you have seen how the church came here here your church up down here that that is the Heritage most of us do not know do not know well on how the church came so they God help us to know and also as we work as missionaries note that it was the young men that first received the gospel and helped the missionaries to ensure that the gospel goes in Kenya as we speak the gospel is in all parts K today we have a man from mqueen here the gospel came so we thank God Amen now translator you can now just come so that we may enter into phas two we will be kneeing down and the few minutes we remaining with we enter into phase two of our study and then we finalize so of [Music] stud thank you so much our Lord in heaven for telling us the history of the Gospel in Kenya and as we will be doing it dear Lord we need to note very many important things as missionaries in the field may you help us may you show your love and your mercy father Lord help us that we may not be lost that we may be able to not forget the past as we enter upon the future your hand LED cascine and the wife together with other missionaries until today we can preach the Three Angels message lead us again because as we reestablish the old principle that was left by them may your will be done as you remember this church and the young people whom you are calling these final days that we may be able to accomplish your work not by might or power but by Spirit as I enter into the second study of my session I pray that you may help me I pray in Jesus holy name amen

[35.5s] message came and because I'm connecting
[38.2s] it with the true
[39.6s] education I found it very nice in fact I
[42.6s] took my time that that I had to go and
[45.7s] do research so deep of how the
[48.9s] missionary came to Kenya because we are
[50.7s] also restoring the old
[53.5s] foundations we also restoring the old
[55.9s] foundations and as we do it we need to
[58.9s] understand our what
[61.8s] our history amen very important for us
[65.4s] to understand our history so I want you
[68.8s] to have it because Church Heritage is
[70.6s] very important but I'm not going to go
[72.4s] deep in the ones of the general that one
[75.9s] you know I want now come to Kenya where
[79.1s] we are so I wrote something very briefly
[82.2s] so you can also take notes it is
[84.4s] important so that even when no old man
[87.5s] can can cheat you they can tell you you
[90.8s] don't know anything because we not there
[92.6s] but as we speak I don't think there
[95.6s] which was born in 1906 we still
[99.2s] alive there
[101.2s] is none but even if there is there are
[104.2s] very few and they not able to talk so we
[106.8s] need also to know this history very
[110.1s] important and I got the

[303.6s] the church Heritage here and we talking
[306.3s] about the story of the Seventh Adventist
[308.2s] Church in

[344.9s] America
[347.4s] baptism baptism baptism how CasCal was
[353.4s] baptized

[361.4s] with his
[363.5s] parents with his
[366.2s] parents his brother amamos and sister
[369.6s] Mary in
[372.6s] 1899 baptized in North Dakota with his
[376.7s] parents his brother Amos and Sister Mary
[380.8s] in
[385.2s] 1899 now I want to ask you simple
[388.3s] mathematics when was born in 1879 and he
[391.9s] was baptized in 1899 how many years was
[395.0s] he when he was
[399.2s] baptized
[401.6s] huh years he was baptized into one true
[405.3s] God of the faith of the Seventh Day
[406.9s] Adventist by that
[409.4s] time
[412.3s] uh sister is Mary sister is just
[416.0s] Mary baptized in 1899
[421.6s] something which you need to note about
[423.2s] casalin that as a young man he worked
[426.3s] with his father who taught him many
[429.0s] skills
[430.7s] including as a young man he worked with
[433.2s] his father who taught him many skills
[435.8s] you remember we are going to learn true
[437.9s] education and this this one really
[441.0s] touched
[442.6s] me his father taught him many things
[445.4s] many skills including
[447.9s] carpentry farming and metal
[450.8s] work
[452.8s] carpentry
[454.3s] farming and metal
[456.6s] work so that is what the father of
[459.2s] casalin taught
[471.1s] him you may ask about his quing formal
[474.8s] education so right that formal school
[477.0s] for Arthur ended when he was 10
[481.4s] years foral school for other ended when
[484.1s] he was 10
[486.7s] years and he became a farmer a carpenter
[489.9s] and a
[491.8s] blacksmith his formal School ended when
[494.3s] he was
[495.9s] 10 thereby he became a
[500.3s] farmer a carpenter and a blacksmith so
[503.8s] he had three professors a
[506.9s] farmer a carpenter and what
[513.3s] black so that was the education when at
[518.8s] 10 education had ended I don't know how
[522.2s] that one you will not ask me that one
[525.0s] for now let let's
[527.2s] continue
[529.6s] um
[531.5s] although he
[533.9s] loved he
[536.9s] loved his father spread because the his
[540.0s] father stade was what father taught him
[542.6s] carpentry blacksmith those others he
[545.8s] really loved his father stade he was
[548.4s] also a vivid reader and that ambition to
[552.2s] become a teacher he was a vivid reader
[556.1s] and ambition to become a what a teacher
[560.5s] so he wanted to become a teacher however
[563.2s] much he loved his father the father
[565.3s] taught him through fing and blacksmith
[568.0s] but in his he had ambition become a what
[570.7s] a
[571.5s] teacher become a
[574.1s] teacher thus he attended Union College
[577.4s] from 1901 to
[579.5s] 1902 he attended Union College from 1901
[584.0s] to
[585.0s] 1902 1901 to
[588.0s] 1902 he attended a Union
[591.8s] College so somebody can go to college
[594.4s] having done this those ones he went to
[597.6s] college don't ask me do people go to
[599.8s] college when they have only learned
[603.2s] blacksmith don't ask me that one for now
[605.8s] you will ask
[607.2s] later in 1901 to
[611.5s] 1902 now there's something which took
[613.7s] place in the life of
[616.0s] caline there's something here which also
[618.7s] you need to
[620.5s] not having attended Union College from
[623.0s] 1901 to
[624.8s] 1902 there's another point he was a
[627.2s] brilliant student that he complet
[629.3s] completed a 2E course in one
[632.6s] year he was a brilliant student that
[636.4s] completed a 2 year course in one one
[639.0s] year year a twoe course he completed in
[643.6s] one year
[665.3s] in
[669.1s] 1904 he entered another
[673.1s] College where he completed his course in
[675.5s] September
[678.5s] 1906 in 1904 he entered another College
[682.6s] training by completed his course in
[685.0s] September
[686.9s] 1906 1906 hope you know that 1906 is
[691.1s] when SD began in Kenya so this so we are
[693.4s] now entering in
[694.9s] serious important
[698.6s] uh life of him Ministry and marriage you
[701.6s] can write that Ministry and marriage I
[704.4s] was reading on how CasCal married and it
[707.4s] was so I don't know it was so
[711.1s] sweet Ministry and
[713.4s] marriage Ministry and
[716.4s] marriage in 1902
[718.8s] [Music]
[720.1s] CasCal was recruited by General
[722.7s] Conference
[723.9s] president in 1902 CasCal was recruited
[728.3s] by the general conference president a
[730.9s] Daniels I hope you know that during that
[733.2s] time the President of General Conference
[734.8s] was called a Daniels AG
[738.5s] Daniels AG
[742.4s] Daniels in 1902 CasCal was recruited by
[746.2s] General Conference president a
[751.3s] G
[754.0s] Danel to
[756.3s] help 12 help strengthen the young
[759.0s] Adventist Church in
[760.5s] [Music]
[761.8s] Britain to help young Adventist Church
[765.4s] in
[768.6s] Britain to help young Adventist Church
[771.4s] in
[774.2s] Britain so by 1902 how many years it was
[777.7s] now 20
[782.5s] 1902 it was if 1899 it was 20 then 1902
[788.2s] was
[790.1s] 20 20 23 years so he was given a church
[796.0s] a young Adventist Church in Britain
[798.2s] especially as aort evangelis to dop
[805.4s] evangelism cport evangelism
[810.6s] and he was also to do that cport
[812.3s] evangelism in
[814.2s] Scotland W Scotland Wales and
[820.6s] England so he was taking care of that
[823.0s] young Adventist Church and he was also
[825.1s] do called evangelism in Wales and in
[829.0s] what Scotland and
[834.3s] England now there was another
[836.3s] interesting topic that he did not do he
[838.5s] he did not did the conversing but also
[841.2s] assisted in Evangelistic
[844.3s] meetings we also not only doing that
[847.5s] work but he's also assisting in
[849.3s] Evangelistic
[851.4s] meetings and camp
[854.6s] meetings so he was a speaker in
[857.2s] Evangelistic what meetings and also in
[861.8s] camp
[865.8s] meetings uh
[873.1s] so there was a good point here this is a
[875.8s] good point listen to it young men and
[878.2s] women and all of us and
[882.2s] myself yes this is the point I'm reading
[885.0s] in one such meeting when they were in
[887.8s] one of the meetings of one of the
[889.4s] Evangelistic meetings come
[891.6s] meeting there was a young lady there was
[894.9s] what young lady there was a young lady
[898.5s] called la Bruce
[900.3s] Thomson Ellen Bruce
[904.6s] Thomson one such meeting there was a
[907.0s] young
[908.1s] lady Helen Bruce Thompson who was a
[912.1s] volunteer
[917.2s] pianist
[919.0s] Helen Bruce
[923.5s] Thomson Helen Bruce THS
[930.1s] [Music]
[940.3s] pianist from
[951.1s] GL why are you not writing this thing
[954.6s] very
[956.5s] important the next convention you be one
[959.0s] will be teaching us the Adventist
[960.4s] history
[962.1s] K very
[967.0s] important Glo is from
[970.2s] Glo Glo
[973.2s] Church spelling is g l o s g o
[979.4s] Wu g l o s g o w GL go
[987.3s] church and AR is CasCal remember CasCal
[991.4s] is called CasCal AR so sometimes when I
[993.7s] use the word AR you know it is CasCal AR
[996.8s] it
[998.1s] wasal grandv so this this young lady
[1002.9s] Bruce Thomson a volunteer fromo church
[1005.8s] and AR found himself concentrating more
[1009.8s] on the music than the Sal
[1014.3s] Moon Arthur found himself concentrating
[1018.2s] more on the music than the what than the
[1023.6s] salon than the
[1027.7s] salon so when Helen was playing
[1032.0s] piano CasCal now loved what music than
[1036.4s] the
[1038.2s] what so what that is what you want to
[1040.5s] look
[1041.6s] at later
[1044.6s] later now the word later means not not
[1047.2s] that year the word later not be 1902 so
[1050.3s] that we see
[1054.4s] later anden became
[1057.9s] hband so
[1060.2s] lat
[1061.7s] lat
[1064.2s] so was concentrating on music
[1071.2s] on so lat later you want to see that was
[1075.4s] later so you want to look at later
[1083.4s] I those who are just coming in we are
[1085.8s] talking about the history of the Seventh

[1346.5s] [Music]
[1348.9s] e
[1350.2s] r b e r t
[1355.0s] habat Hab
[1357.8s] cden how about
[1364.2s] cden who was the principal elect of the
[1367.5s] stand stur
[1369.9s] College who was the principal elect of
[1372.7s] the stand Boro colle
[1383.4s] so that one took place in
[1386.9s] 1906 now after that now the work of
[1390.2s] caline
[1393.5s] began after CasCal oration it was It was
[1397.8s] decided to send him as a missionary to
[1399.6s] British East Africa in bracket Kenya I
[1402.6s] believe those who have gone to school
[1404.0s] you understand British Africa how they
[1407.4s] divided and for you to come somewhere
[1409.8s] you are only to go under where your
[1411.4s] people are so was to come with America
[1413.8s] because America not
[1416.1s] any and the were only to come following
[1419.5s] the
[1421.6s] British so if you are coming from
[1424.5s] Britain you are only to go where the
[1427.8s] British and you to go through the
[1429.8s] missionaries are they were working to
[1433.2s] together I hope you know that
[1436.5s] so that that is why it was very
[1439.2s] difficult
[1440.1s] for for people to go to Tanzania because
[1443.4s] were only Germans so for you to attend a
[1445.8s] missionary send
[1447.3s] it German protor there so he came to
[1452.2s] British after Calo it was decided to
[1455.6s] send him as a missionary to British East
[1459.4s] Africa British East Africa in bracket
[1462.6s] Kenya
[1483.0s] he came
[1484.0s] alone but request he was he came
[1488.7s] alone he came alone Remember by 1906 he
[1491.9s] had not
[1493.1s] married we wrot a point later they
[1495.4s] married so from 1902 to 1906 they're not
[1497.9s] married
[1502.2s] he was only interested in music but not
[1505.7s] in
[1507.4s] marri but remember when he was being
[1509.8s] sent he was sent to Kenya without a wife
[1513.6s] he came a what alone so that that is
[1516.0s] very powerful point he came alone but he
[1519.6s] requested that his fany Helen Thomson
[1522.8s] desent after a
[1525.0s] year he requested the conference the
[1528.6s] union MH he came alone but he requested
[1532.7s] that his
[1534.0s] fan Helen Thompson be
[1552.8s] sent
[1554.7s] yes now
[1561.1s] a I look at how I love how CasCal
[1564.4s] organized this thing in a nice way fact
[1567.3s] this story made
[1569.8s] look another point now another point at
[1574.4s] the same time conr asked Peter to go
[1577.2s] with him to help in African language
[1581.0s] conr who
[1584.9s] was the one who him was the president of
[1595.9s] you don't know let me
[1598.8s] continue yes so at the same time asked
[1602.8s] Peter to go with him to help in African
[1606.6s] language so you can write in bracket Mr
[1610.7s] Peter Peter he was called Peter nambo he
[1614.7s] was coming from Malawi nasand Malawi so
[1618.4s] was an African person he went to Britain
[1620.6s] to to study the Bible so he was told to
[1623.8s] bring CasCal because he was going to
[1626.2s] help in African what
[1629.2s] language so asked because are an African
[1633.0s] please kindly go with
[1637.8s] who
[1641.6s] language so Peter was
[1644.6s] not a an American not a Europe but he
[1649.0s] was he went there so he was they came

[3709.8s] central Anglican had gone there and
[3712.6s] remember the British had said something

[3721.4s] never entered because they were saying
[3723.9s] it is Big please find somewhere people
[3726.6s] have not gone to so that they may not be
[3728.3s] able to fight themselves they knew that
[3730.8s] if they do that Africans will not accept
[3733.9s] the what the gospel so they didn't want
[3737.2s] to fight among themselves that is what
[3740.3s] they were doing those times
[3744.5s] um to know
[3746.9s] thanks to
[3748.6s] not to
[3750.8s] not things to
[3753.5s] not this is very important for the
[3757.2s] missionaries here some people may think
[3758.9s] that there was money flowing from Europe
[3762.6s] or from America to this missionaries I
[3765.9s] found this one very important for us
[3768.5s] that from
[3770.5s] 1906 from 1906 when these missionaries
[3773.6s] arrived the first money the first money
[3777.2s] to arrive was
[3781.6s] 22,500 Sterling
[3785.2s] pound which arrived from the general
[3800.4s] conference it arrived from the general
[3802.6s] conference
[3807.1s] through
[3808.5s] Mombasa through Mombasa missionary
[3816.9s] Society it arrived 7 years after the
[3820.0s] missionaries had arrived that is the
[3821.5s] first money they
[3823.3s] received
[3824.9s] 2,500 Sterling pound and it came after 7
[3828.6s] years you can ask
[3831.5s] yourself how was casalin
[3834.2s] eating how was coming to KY to open the
[3837.5s] Mission Station when the first money to
[3840.4s] be sent came after 7
[3842.6s] years that is something to
[3847.6s] note that is something to be what noted
[3850.8s] that the money arrived after what 7
[3855.2s] years from the general conference that
[3857.5s] is the Sterling pound
[3860.4s] 2500 that is something to be noted
[3862.7s] number two to be noted during World War
[3865.6s] One one many things were
[3867.5s] looted and damaged and workers except
[3870.8s] castaline and others were kept from the
[3874.6s] station nearly 2 years World War I was
[3878.4s] in
[3880.2s] 1914 World War one was in
[3883.0s] 1914 during that time the properties of
[3886.9s] were damage the things that the church
[3888.5s] had done were damaged and some workers
[3891.2s] had to be removed only CasCal were kept
[3894.7s] in the station in the British
[3896.4s] protectorate for 2 years without working
[3899.8s] as a result of World War
[3902.8s] I until America entered the war in
[3906.2s] 1917 which stopped the war because the
[3910.0s] War was between
[3912.6s] triple and Triple Alliance in
[3917.8s] 1921 in
[3923.1s] 1921 Calen returned to us in this he
