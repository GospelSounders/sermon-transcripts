He continued with this command. and told him, "For it shall be that on that day thou goest out out and passeth over the brook of Kidron, thou shalt know for certain that thou shalt surely die die. Thy blood shall be upon all." Now she is told to build. I believe some of us might not know the story of I want you to go to second. Second Samuel there. Yes. Chapter chapter 16. I want us to start from verse five. I think Bible read. The Bible reads verse 5. Verse five. When the king David came to Bahin. Now listen to Sime being told to build a house. By the way, a chance is for all. I'll be giving a case study in the Old Testament and then I will I I'll run to a case study in the new world. Testament. Testament. A chance for all. That is my what? might read. And when the king David came to when the king David came to behold and came out a man of the family of the house of Saul a man of the family of house of who? Of Saul. Uhhuh. Whose name was she? So what was his name? Shime. Shime. Uhhuh. The son of Gera. The son of Gera. He came forth. He came forth and cast still as he came. And he cast as he came came I don't know you see he was cursing he was coming who was casting David the father who stoed by who by God and son you know that from the Bible story And the Bible says that as David was coming to bounding behind he was being what? This reminds me of a story in the year 2001. I was in Messiah. There was a a mother had daughters. I will not mention the name of the mother because the mother she speak in Masai is a friend to my mother. So I will not mention she had daughters. Those daughters used to abuse people. We used to stay with them in the rental houses when we 2001 2000. In fact they used to abuse until they can keep for 10 minutes. You are thinking that he had left you abused think of you I don't know I've even been in this where people you know I'm coming also from polyamas or when we used to be used to see my hallelujah. Amen. I know some of you have always seen them especially women are always find fond of those things. Now this man has for what was he doing? He was cast. Imagine that scene of a man who is coming from the family of Saul and remember Saul had died and this man is remaining and he's casting who David anointed one of God. Let's go. And he cast stones at David. What did he do? He cast stones. I wish I would make something in in in my laptop then I would have shown you how he's doing it. Imagine him casting and throwing stones. What is that? Are you seeing that scenario? He is Maui throwing to who? A king with Can you do that in 1969 for those who are historians here? The same thing took place in in Kisum when came with a party called KPU is it? Yes. And then Tom had been assassinated in broad daylight. And what happened when kata came to open the new raia here the lord started throwing what stones stones until the body to catch a stone and they oh this is stone you know what took place there was a great master from kisumu town until they reach in the land of kings they killed even the children playing around from Kisumui they killed until they entered into the land is when they said now because of the throne stone and Kenya did not come back to Kisum till he died in [Music] 1978 in which year 1978 he did not come imagine throwing a king imag with the same with the same Imagine just talking about a politician healed as we speak. You talk about the government, the incumbent government, he has these goons. You talk about the one aspiring they have and some as we speak and they also don't. Now we want to look at David as again king with soldiers. Now the Bible continues to say and they cast stone at David. Yes. and at all the servants of King David. All the servants of King David. All the people and all the mighty men. So he cast stones at David. And all the servants of King David and all the people and all the mighty men and all the mighty. So he had his sermons that mean soldiers, policemen with him. All the people and the mighty men with him. One on his right hand and on his left. Why? On his right hand on his what? left hand. Imagine the soldiers and mighty men. I believe you know in Kenya here we have the mighty men that where they you cannot even go closer there. So is only coming with what and he's throwing upon who so much courageous king know there are some people who are so much courageous even here in the church you are too much courageous I remember in the year 2013 I went to preach in a church called we boy and after preaching we had a group of youths then a man came to me old man and told me take this book there was a book called Daniel times he told me you have too much courage but you have nothing to preach. You are courageous but you don't know I don't know how to say that. How do you translate that? So courageous but what you preach with your courage is not there. You have courage but what you preach with courage is what you learn and then he gave me our time. I thank that man although he's dead as we speak. So this man was so much courageous. Imagine this is a king with policemen with soldiers with him with national intelligence service with him. But he still throws what? Thrones. Now go to the next scene. Say yes. When he cast when he cast come out he don't look what I tell the king. Come out. Come out thou bloody man. Thou bloody man. Thou man of B. Man of B. Who is B? Satan. David, David is man of Satan. And is bloody man verse eight. Verse eight. The Lord hath returned upon thee all the blood of the house of Saul. Who said, "Thou was rain." The Lord has delivered the kingdom into the hand of Abselum thy son. So look at the people who are making the people who made a tool. Yes. Do you know I realized that in the churches here we are there are people that only there to make others to meet a sinful death. These are the people who made to be tough and start fighting as well. So you man what you did to King Saul? But again now if you read about the story of David and Saul by the way David refused to do what to kill. The seven time he found Saul Saul was looking for him to kill him. You know that the soul even lied that he want somebody to to sing that the evil spirit may want and David was playing and he threw the what? Yes. And what happened? So ran away. He looked for David to cave. There's a time David even found him inside a valley when he was living till David had to cut rent a clothes so that that one will be a witness that I'm not going to do what to kill you. To kill you. Hallelujah. Amen. But the Bible says here that was saying he's the one who has killed who? So was this a lie? So look at how the lines are there. this man so much carriers with the lies. Now it continues to say and behold and behold thou were taken in thy mischief because thou a bloody man a bloody man. Verse n then say to then say the son of Zera the son of the unto the king the king. Why should this dead dog cast thy lord the king? Who you see? By the way, if you go to the king and start abusing come here at home, are you a dog? What is this doing? Let me go over. Let me go over. I pray thee, I pray thee, take off his head. Let him take his head. He has nothing. Let me take his sword what is the head. What of you? Take his hand very fast. And the king said, the king said, "What have I to do with you?" You son of Zera, you son of So let him cast. Let him cast. Because the Lord has said unto him, said, "Let him cast." Maybe the Lord has said unto him, unto him, cast David, cast David, who shall then say, who shall then say, wherefor thou done so? Imagine this man was abusing Saul David stones. Doing a lot and tell the soldiers, Mr. Allow me to go and chop his head off. Then he say, please allow him do that. allow him do who knows that is the Lord who has told him to do unto why David has done a lot of problems. His son at the same time has left with his what? as at the same time the his son is chasing him want to kill him at the same time in his arms the his son called who the one who raped the tama who I'm known as in the same family he had a lot of problems at the same time he has killed who and has taken the what and their first child is what dead So problems it is let's go to the next verse to do that somebody may do to you and you don't complain please let him do I've seen somebody saying we talking like you Have we ever had people when they being abused they say maybe God maybe it is my sins that is making me to be can we reach at a particular moment imagine in the church that when somebody talk about you say maybe God has ability him to do that maybe I should learn a lesson from what he's doing maybe this what David is saying don't do anything to him maybe it is the god who has allowed him to do that now let's go to next verse because of time And David said to Abishai, David said to his son and to all his servants, Yes. Behold, behold my son, my son, which came forth of my bowels, if my son have given birth to this one is coming from the family of my son given birth to seeketh my life. Seek my life. How much more now? How much more now? May this Benjamite do it. Benjamite, let him alone. Let him alone. Let him cast. Let him cast. The Lord has been him. Hallelujah.

Those are the old women here over 50 and above. Have you ever system where your children your own home is against you? You have a problem in your own family that now problems come from outside you say no [Music] please is the one who seeketh my life. one of that person from another village, from another place. Let let them do maybe God is the one doing this. Maybe it is God. And imagine this person is cursing a king who was anointed by Leave him alone. Don't kill him. So Sime was to die. He's baptized. Sime was to be what? But he is saying please leave him. Why? It may be God who has bidden me to do what? To do that to me. To the right verse. I want to write very fast. It may be that the Lord will look on mine affliction. It may be the Lord will look into my on my affliction. And that the Lord will requit me. And the Lord will requit me. Uhhuh. Good for his cursing this day. The Lord will requit me. Uhhuh. Good for cursing me this day. Maybe the Lord will look on mine. What? Let him just read. Maybe the Lord can see. Maybe the Lord will look on my word. I'm spiritual. The things I'm passing through and the Lord may do what requ Can we have such people here in the church of God? I don't know. Let that continue very fast. And as David and his men were by the way, she went along on this hillside. She went along. He did not stop. He went along on the hillside. On the hillside over against him again. And as he went, and threw stones at him. He was stere and cast dust dust and the king and the king and all the people that were with him were became weary came weary and refresh themselves there weary do you know abusing do you know how cursing do you know talking he about people makes people tired do you know today we are in wives whereby women are tired because of how the husbands talk about that. Do you know we have people today in the church they are because of criticisms condemnation one what made them to be weary that they refuses the throwing of strokes there so much then the Bible says that all the people that the men of Israel came to Jerusalem with I will not go to because I talked about last summer. I wanted you wanted to see how was to be killed. David says please leave S alone. Leave him. Leave him alone. Maybe there does nothing to that. He leaves him to live. And then Solomon came to take the kingship. 36 came very well what this man did to his father. He knew if you say that therefore he come upon you from the verse 31 to him do fall upon him and burn him. The Lord shall return his blood upon him. You can read it. I'm not going to read that. And then verse 35, the king of the priest and did the king in the room of Abiata. And then verse 36. And the king said and called she and said unto him, "Build me a house in Jerusalem and dwell there and go not for it shall be from that day thou going out and passes over and thou shall know for that what the king saying is the gold is gold what?" graces. Imagine some of there are people even in this room that do not talk with some people because they sin that was done to them long time ago. Maybe 10 years ago they not talking they in the church of God. There are people here who are not talking to others because others are wrong with their parents and they in the church of God preaching what we got faith. Look at this man, the spirit of David. Spirit of his son and build an house in where? Jerusalem. The day you will go any good. And my lord the king say what is what? Thank you so much. And they dwell in Jerusalem for many what? Many days. For many what days. Please read with me verse 38. He looked in Jerusalem for many days. Many days. And it came to pass. It came to pass at the end of three years. After he stayed after how many years? Three years. After how many years? Three years. Remember in the Jewish economy 3 years when somebody has taken the service in the service of God he was to be ordained among the wildes and the Jewish 3 years was somebody to stay in the hard cities when he was to be given a responsibility of taking a particular church. The same with the pioneers it was 3 years look this man stayed three what? three years. And it came to pass at the end of three years to pass three years that the two of the servants of Shime unto Akish unto Akish, the son of Maka, king of G. And they told Shimeme, saying, "Thy servant be in G. Thy servant be G." Uh-huh. And she arose. She rose and suddenly suddenly and went to God. to G to Akish his servant and Shme went and brought his servant from G and it was told Solomon that Shme had gone from Jerusalem to G to G and was come again imagine he went came again he went and died out he went out and he came back things that people do not know he went he thinks that Solomon do not know anywhere and he was told please be do not come out of where Jerusalem he went please your other side and what did he do went and brought went himself very fast broke come back very fast and when he came he didn't know his provision is what it's closed closed he was given a chance again imagine if you read let's go to verse number 41 it says yes and it was told Solomon told that she had gone from Jerusalem to God. From Jerusalem to God, and was come again. Was come again. And the king sent and called for Shib was called was called and said unto him said unto him, did I not make thee to swear by the Lord? I made you to swear before the Lord and protest unto thee, say, know for a certain on the day that thou goest out, and walkest abroad by hither, yes, that thou shalt surely die. Thou shalt surely die. Thou said unto me, said unto me, the word that heard is good. The word that heard is is good. Is that how we also say when you have accepted the truth it is good the message is good I will walk in the way we thank God and even promise it is what can you remember our baptism of vows when we make vow with God you read that and then people say it is what verse number 42 42 I've read verse 43 why then hast thou not kept the oath of the lord why have you not kept the vows you made and the commandment that I have charged thee with. 44. The king said moreover to Sheime. Listen to this verse says the king said moreover to Shme, thou knowest all the wickedness which thine heart is private to that thou didest to David my father. You remember what he did to his father? He abused the father of David. He was to die. But this me was not to live. See me he said was to be jumped once. Oh, but what happened? Was given probation time. David was so much gracious. I'm wondering about David. David was so much That is why God says David's heart is after his own heart. You know what you did to my world. Thou knowest all the wickedness which thine heart is private to. Yes. That thou didest to David my father. Yes. Therefore the Lord shall return thy weakness upon thy own head. Yes. And King Solomon shall be blessed. Shall be blessed. The throne of David shall be established before the Lord forever. Amen. So the king commanded Baniah the son of Jodia which went out and fell upon it that he died and the kingdom was established in the heart of Solomon. The kingdom of Solomon was established. Amen. Grace of a loving God. Praise the tit mountain out for the way the blood of the lamb was plead gra and and grad all surely s was not to leave. S did wickedness was to be chopped longtime. Sime was not to leave. Do you think even even you look at was he again live again next to David's son he was unworthy but he was given infinite grace. In fact he was even brought to live in Jerusalem not to go anywhere again. He was to leave. He was told he even swel in fact Solomon was not even to talk with this. Do you have you ever been you know there are things which are so sad? Have you ever been in a family and you see somebody abusing your your mother you abuse and talking about you you have you ever seen or your father somebody come and your father in front of you and you big people is it so sad I don't unless you are man slap that mouth of that boy hardly so that he may be able to wake up sit well you are sitting apparate as well amen Now somebody abusing your father or somebody come and beat your mother in your presence. How do you feel? You'll feel how will you feel that somebody slap your mother and kick and you're sitting down and you're big people that person's pricking and then following one year you find that person who kicked your mother they there staying together in the same house and how will you feel it is so sad imagine this man is now living with Solomon Solomon gives him another chance and then later on he breaks went out to the world, comes back to Jerusalem. Remember Jerusalem represent what? The house of God. The house of God. Is that right? Yes. Where God's act of covenant was found. He runs and then comes back again. And when he comes back, his grace is what? Over. Grace is now over. Proverbial is closed. I'm taking another case study and then I pray because my time is almost up. Acts 12 verse 25. There's another man. Bible reads who also went and I I want to tell you that some of us may be taking examples in this last days we can with the vows we are making to work for God you sometimes we can make vibes we don't understand sometimes we entering upon the and that's me young people have made decisions and they think they making they do not understand some people even gone from baptism they don't understand and that is why we are tired jokes and ced and are falling upon some even given themselves on things they do not understand so that when other things come when other messengers bring them some messages please run over there run over there and then they can run there and after some time come back anytime they want and they think that they are still They did and they made vow they think that they making vow to man and not to God. Hallelujah. And this is thought it is a joke. He did not know how wickedness he was. He did not know that he only got grace. And that is why many young people today do not know that this song we are making, the vibes we are making as we speak in this last days, they do not know it is the last chance that we just been given and they are choosing so and so did this, so and so did this. But let me tell you, you may go and you going that was your final chance. Hallelujah. Acts 12 verse 25. Barnabas again. Let's take another case study before we pray. Read Acts 12 verse number 25. The Bible says and Barnabas and Saul returned from Jerusalem. Barnabas and Saul returned from Jerusalem. They had filled their ministry. that what filled their ministry that fulfilled their ministry ministry and took with them John with them a man called who John John whose son name was Mark whose son name was Mark so his name was John Mark who took him and they were preaching they found a man they found what and man his name was called who John chapter 13 Verse number 13, the Bible reads, "Now when Paul and his company lose from Puffos, now when Paul and his what? His company loosed from Pos, they came to Pa. They came to Pah in Pilia. And John departing from them. John departed from them in fact. These verses have taken me to not be praying. Act 12. Saul and who? And Barnabas took who? John Mark in their minist. They took him so that this man may join them in the work of God. In Acts 13, the Bible simply says who departed. Now when Paul and his family come loose from Paposh, they came to P and Pilia and John departed from them to return to Jerusalem. John departed. He left the two men and departed from where? Jerusalem. Jun went to Jerusalem. He departed and left. Let's go very fast 169. I'm remaining with two and we pray. Read this one. Write them down. 169 it reads was not a man of education.

To do what? Trust God's power to deliver. Hallelujah. Amen. So Barnabas and what? And Paul seen and what? Unseen of the gospel. Paul to me and Paul to trust God's power to deliver. Amen. Amen. They knew it is God who will take care of them. Now continue reading. It says, "Yes, their hearts were filled with perent love." Perfect love for perishing souls. What they wanted was to go and look for the Lord. There's a song saying resue the perishing care for the dying. You mean you're an Adventist, you don't know how to sing. You want you want to be given a number is when you say and you're entering upon Sunday law. You are going to be in Mama Janet was in for more than 10 days.

I remember when I was going to high school, I cried to the mother and the mother used to tell me, "You are with your father working for the whole day. What did you do to me? Go back. You are there. And then we go to school without. So what did we do when we go to school in the bathroom? In fact, when it is 3 weeks for people to close because you know when people and then by the end of the time I remember I went to school with not given pocket money. What I was doing I eat it that day so that I may not think something over the box. I study in class. Life of what? And whom that life was preparing because this gospel that you want to make decision is life for. No, there are things that we pass and sometimes you can hate your parents but later on when you sit down you read Romans 8:28 then you say all things work together for good for those who love God and are called to his purpose.

So those are used toward they can labor with success in favorable circumstances. when there's something they get there's food there's brown rice chapel there's fair oh that is favorable war circumstance but now a minister of position a minister what opposition was too much and perils and perils that so often beset the pioneer work that so what often beset the pioneer work God is calling us to a pioneer work we are going back to the old ACD to the faith of the adventist which all charges our general depart from the truth. This is the time we were establishing the Christian world church. We also called in the same work going back to the old ways. It is very difficult for those who will be coming forward. I've been preaching here and men and young ladies are coming forward. that a time cometh that there's not even shoes. A time cometh that you may not have even clothes. A time reaches that when you have a coat and they try new one which somebody has given you. Some people think that maybe maybe nowadays they saw where you get things. It is very if you don't have you are poor go and do something. If you are this one you might have stolen somewhere. It is very difficult. Hallelujah church. Hallelujah. It is very difficult that sometimes you cannot even get money to save your air. Very difficult. But we are told that at such a time is when Mark says it is not possible. I'm going back. Cannot do that. Read. Read with me very fast. He felt he knew hardness as a good soldier of the cross. Good soldier of the cross. He had yet to learn to face danger. He had yet to learn to face danger and persecution and persecution. Adversity with a brave heart. Adversity with a brave heart. Adverse with a brave heart. As the apostle advanced as the apostle advanced and still great difficulties were apprehended. Yes. Mark was intimidated. Mark was intimidated and losing all courage and losing all courage. Refused to go further and return to Jerusalem. He said, "I'm not going with this. This is not a gospel. Gospel with persecution. You know this gospel sometimes very difficult that there are things you may be going through that you don't even want your brothers to know. This gospel is very tough that sometimes you can cry in a cell. Sometimes it is tough that you even don't know how to start. Sometimes things are so tough that you sit somewhere and say how do I start these things? It is very difficult. At that time his Wendy and Mark said this thing Paul and Barabas is doing and every time they trust in God I was reading about Joseph B when the wife call and ask him give us money for food and the answer was God will provide. You said we are tired with God. Every time we provide that every time we have why can we go to the last quotation conflict and courage this the last one 348 paragraph 2 and three and then you jump to 349 and then we pray. Please friends youth must decide for himself but which decision. Do you understand the decision you are making? Did Mark understand? Mark entered the gospel without understanding the obligation. S was also making an obligation without understanding and please do not get opportunity. We want also see this one. Read with me. Mark bring him with you for he find him useful. That is second Timothy what? Mark's what? Mark's mother was a convert to the Christian religion. Christian religion.

All preachers used to go to mother's Mark's home. I love the mothers of Mark. Mark's mother was a good mother. What do you say man? There are mothers here that you cannot go to their homes. My mother thank you did not ask me such question when ministers used to come to our home. This woman was very good. Amen. Amen. Can God give us this other mother. So there are mothers if we go to their home. Amen. Hallelujah. Ma and you know how ministers when they get a place they can go, they will go. Amen. I I think this mother was peaceful. Mark's mother was a convert to the Christian religion. Amen. At home at Jerusalem was an assam for the Mark proposed to Mark was there seeing how the mother was welcoming. Then Mark was touring with ministers in the table and he said to Paul and he said that he should accompany them on their missionary tour go with you the missionary tour. He has proposed he not understand and that is the problem today with men who enter into the ministry without understanding the obligation. They don't understand. That is why we can enter any we want and leave anytime we want. We don't understand. We just love going to miss. People are going to miss. Can we go? Can we go? Oh, you're the minister. Let us go. Now, when things become difficult, when you are taking one year with one sweater, you say, "Oh, I thought I'm going to be like a district. There are people here. There are ministers. They are just proposing. Can we go in a few minutes? We need to help our parents. We need to Mark also proposed to Paul and Barnabas. Yes. That he should accompany them on their missionary tour. He felt the favor of God in his heart and long to devote himself entirely to the work of the gospel. To be to be a fulltime what? Minister. Young man, how many are longing to be full-time ministers? You are longing. We thank God. Longing. I want to give my life entirely to the gospel. You think it is a joke. Ask those who have tried it here. It is not a joke. Ask their mothers. My mother is here. Go with him. Ask is Maxwell sending you something per month. He will tell you. Amen. Hallelujah. That's what difficult. Some people do not understand it. So it was just longing. Now look after longing. Their way was to they encountered hardship. They encountered hardship and privation and were beset with das on every but Paul and Barnabas in learn to trust God's heart. Their hearts were filled with fervent love for perishing spirit. A shful shepherd in search of the lost sheep. They gave thought to their own ease and conveniences. ease and what? Conveniences. Forgetful of self. They faltered not when merry not when weary when weary hungry hungry and called they had in their view but one object. Salvation of those who had wondered far from the fall. Please imagine we had a people with one object. You know nowadays people come to the ministry with se several objects. Somebody come to the ministry and gives the church the list. When I've come to minister you know my mother you have to build a house for him for her. You know yeah you will be close my mother you know you buy buy for me a land in the country you must build for me. I say I'm preaching for you. So those list if you will fulfill them we can go and preach. No, but with these people they had one what? Object. What? What was the object? What? They the they had view but one object. Salvation. Those who were worried one far from the fall. Next point. Mark will be fear and discouragement and discouragement wavered for a time in his for a time in his purpose purpose to give himself wholehearted Lord's word and he used to worship and he used to worship. He was disheartened by the perish and prevision of the way. He had yet to learn to face danger and persecution, adversity with a brave heart. As the apostle advanced and still great difficulties were apprehended, Mark was intimidated. And losing all courage, refused to go further and return to Jerusalem. This decision caused Paul to judge Mark unfavorably. Mark judged Paul. Paul judged Mark unfavorably. Unfavorably. is not like David. Paul is not like what? David. Paul judged Mark what? Unfavorably. Imagine the one who was not judged like was not judge unfavorable. David said, "Please leave him. Please leave him." But look what did Paul do? The decision caused Paul to judge unfavorably. Unfavorably. And even severely. That one thing is 15 we are not going to read. And he judged him severely. He refused because now people were going back and when Mark came people said Mark is joking. Mark is joking. Mark cannot leave us in the field and then go and rest when things were tough and then when things are new with people we cannot work with there people in ministry talking like that. So and so has been leaving us and coming this time around. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Mark judged that Paul judged Mark. Paul judged Mark unfavorable and even severe injuries they were fight they were almost fighting there was sharp contention in Acts 15:36 sharp contention Paul was mistaken what he said is final people love Paul but Paul had something till people separated And then for a Some people are going to come back because somebody do not want them. Look, Mark did not think of what Paul is thinking about him. But we told that Barnabas has encouraged him. Don't we have Barnabas today here who is able to encourage young men to keep the faith? Yes, we have. Don't we have also people like Paul who thinks that others should not be given opportunity? Yes, they are there. They were there with during the time of who of of of David. There was one who said, "Can we chop his head off?" What's that? Abishai. Abby. Don't we have also with the spirit of Paul? But still there was grace. In both there was grace both for and for who? John Mark. How are you going to use that grace? Friends, the work is great and the youth must decide for themselves. Please, the messages we're bringing on to you are hard. The messages that being presented by ministers there are hard they are notice and sometimes when you see people making decisions in this church it is not simp this faith is very hard for you to preach there are lot of things waiting for us it needs those who are going to give themselves unreservedly not with what feelings and those are the people God is calling friends hallelujah and the youth mass and there's a grace if If you get lost, it will be up. But if this anybody will get lost with this opportunity we have gotten, your blood will be upon thee. I'm seeing s is being killed by bay and he's told we killing you and your blood is upon you. Please when the probation will end and we are getting lost in this oldest demo, we will get lost with all these messages which are being brought. Some are even thought by young men, young boys that even your children are older than them. And then we just simply neglect these messages. Please when we get lost, we are going to be killed. Sime is being killed in the presence of Solomon. Ben is taking his tool and is being slaughtered. And then he told your blood thee with all those grace. Please imagine after getting all these messages after sitting in these powerful meetings halls eating and serving every day coming here messages are being presented. There's old men in this meeting. There's young men presenting singing here and then you just simply reject you just simply take this thing for granted. You say it is good. You need the messages you present. And this is how me talk. It is good the way you also talk. Your message is good. I've seen young men calling. I know the messages you preach is good. They are good. They are good. No, that is Bab. They are good. I accept those messages. That is how she also took the message. Please friend as we pray and go for lunch. Sime is being slaughtered and is being killed by told we are killing you and your blood is upon your what? And I'm told that the wicked also when they will be killed their blood will be upon them. They have rejected the redeemer. Please which excuse will we give when there are others like we are and the God second opportunity and used to please in this meeting God is going to give another second opportunity. We have messed we are wicked we are to die. We have even woripped idols and worship of idol is death but God has given us opportunity. Amen. God has again brought us a message. We were to die and God said please with all the wind let that person live. Maybe you know not and you have got another opportunity. Others wanted us even not to be in this work. People have some do not even need us to be here. Some parents did not want us to be here. But God allowed you to be here. Some churches didn't want you to be here. There were promises of goods, but God gave you another chance. Are you going to mess it up? Are you going to again take it that you are also going to run again, goes back to the world for some time and come back leaving work anytime you want and come back anytime you want. May God help us in Jesus name. How many desire help? Let me see by would you stand up as we finish. Now let me make this one call. Today I'm making one call. I will be making final call next Sabbath. One call here. Is there somebody here like this young man? You left the work of God and you want God to give you a second chance and you want to use it not as he may use it but as John Mark used it until John Mark now we read the book of Mark which is a powerful book. Is there somebody like that? You had given yourself to the work of God. But because of challenges, because of hardships, because of things which are tough in the work of God, because of opposition and persecution, because of coldness and anger, because of the things we meet, you thought to run and go back to your mother's house to Jerusalem, but you want God to give you another chance. There's a chance for all. There's a chance for what? Who is there somebody who needs such a chance that God help you to give yourself unreserved for this work? Please there's a space a small I don't want many people. I want just one person or two. This space is small. It's not meant for all of you. So I only need someone here to come for prayers. Can I even get a one one to pray with? I don't want many people here. I only need one.

[138.8s] Chapter chapter 16. I want us to start
[143.0s] from verse five. I think Bible read. The
[145.0s] Bible reads verse 5. Verse five. When
[147.3s] the king David came to Bahin. Now listen
[149.8s] to Sime being told to build a house. By
[152.2s] the way, a chance is for all. I'll be
[154.6s] giving a case study in the Old Testament
[157.4s] and then I will I I'll run to a case
[160.2s] study in the new world. Testament.
[162.1s] Testament. A chance for all. That is my
[165.3s] what?
[168.4s] might read. And when the king David came
[172.6s] to when the king David came to
[176.6s] behold and came out a man of the family
[179.5s] of the house of Saul a man of the family
[183.5s] of house of who? Of Saul. Uhhuh. Whose
[186.0s] name was she? So what was his name?
[188.1s] Shime. Shime. Uhhuh. The son of Gera.
[191.0s] The son of Gera. He came forth. He came
[193.3s] forth and cast still as he came. And he
[195.7s] cast as he came came I don't know you
[199.8s] see he was
[202.4s] cursing he was
[211.6s] coming who was casting David the father
[215.5s] who
[219.0s] stoed by who by God and son you know
[223.0s] that from the Bible story And the Bible
[225.4s] says that as David was coming to
[228.5s] bounding
[240.0s] behind he was being what? This reminds
[243.4s] me of a story in the year 2001. I was in
[247.1s] Messiah. There was a a mother had
[249.9s] daughters. I will not mention the name
[251.6s] of the mother because the mother she
[253.9s] speak in Masai is a friend to my mother.
[256.6s] So I will not mention she had daughters.
[259.0s] Those daughters used to abuse people. We
[261.5s] used to stay with them in the rental
[263.5s] houses when we 2001 2000. In fact they
[268.4s] used to abuse until they can
[270.8s] keep for 10 minutes. You are thinking
[273.2s] that he had left
[284.4s] you
[286.2s] abused
[294.1s] think of you I don't know I've even been
[297.0s] in this where people you know I'm coming
[299.2s] also from polyamas or when we used to be
[302.2s] used to see
[307.0s] my hallelujah. Amen. I know some of you
[310.0s] have always seen them especially women
[312.4s] are always find fond of those things.
[315.4s] Now this man has for what was he doing?
[318.7s] He was cast. Imagine that scene of a man
[324.2s] who is coming from the family of Saul
[326.2s] and remember Saul had died and this man
[328.6s] is remaining and he's casting who David
[332.1s] anointed one of God. Let's go. And he
[335.8s] cast stones at David. What did he do? He
[338.4s] cast stones.
[340.4s] I wish I would make something in in in
[343.1s] my laptop then I would have shown you
[345.3s] how he's doing it. Imagine him casting
[347.3s] and throwing stones.
[350.2s] What is that? Are you seeing that
[352.2s] scenario? He is Maui throwing to who? A
[357.0s] king with Can you do that in 1969 for
[360.2s] those who are historians here? The same
[362.0s] thing took place in in Kisum when came
[365.8s] with a party called KPU is it? Yes. And
[369.1s] then Tom had been assassinated in broad
[372.6s] daylight. And what happened when kata
[375.3s] came to open the new raia
[377.9s] here the lord started throwing what
[380.6s] stones stones until the body to catch a
[383.7s] stone and they oh this is stone you know
[385.8s] what took place there was a great master
[388.6s] from kisumu town until they reach in the
[392.0s] land of kings they killed even the
[393.8s] children playing around from
[397.5s] Kisumui they killed until they entered
[399.9s] into the land is when they said now
[403.9s] because of the throne stone and Kenya
[405.8s] did not come back to Kisum till he died
[407.8s] in
[409.9s] [Music]
[411.7s] 1978 in which year
[414.5s] 1978 he did not come imagine throwing a
[417.8s] king
[424.6s] imag with the same with the same
[432.4s] Imagine just talking about a
[437.1s] politician healed as we speak. You talk
[440.2s] about the government, the incumbent
[441.8s] government, he has these goons. You talk
[444.7s] about the one aspiring they have and
[447.0s] some as we speak and they also don't.
[449.4s] Now we want to look at David as again
[451.7s] king with soldiers. Now the Bible
[453.8s] continues to say and they cast stone at
[456.0s] David. Yes. and at all the servants of
[458.2s] King David. All the servants of King
[460.1s] David. All the people and all the mighty
[462.4s] men. So he cast stones at David. And all
[466.7s] the servants of King David and all the
[470.6s] people and all the mighty men and all
[472.7s] the mighty. So he had his sermons that
[474.6s] mean soldiers, policemen with him. All
[478.2s] the people and the mighty men with him.
[481.3s] One on his right hand and on his left.
[483.3s] Why? On his right hand on his what? left
[486.2s] hand. Imagine the soldiers and mighty
[489.5s] men. I believe you know in Kenya here we
[492.5s] have the mighty men that where they you
[494.3s] cannot even go closer there.
[497.5s] So is only coming with what
[502.6s] and he's throwing upon who so much
[505.5s] courageous king know there are some
[507.4s] people who are so much courageous even
[509.2s] here in the church you are too much
[511.2s] courageous
[513.9s] I remember in the year 2013 I went to
[517.0s] preach in a church called we boy and
[518.6s] after preaching we had a group of youths
[520.9s] then a man came to me old man and told
[523.4s] me take this book there was a book
[525.0s] called Daniel times he told me you have
[527.4s] too much courage but you have nothing to
[529.1s] preach. You are courageous
[532.4s] but you don't know I don't know how to
[536.3s] say that.
[540.8s] How do you translate that? So courageous
[542.7s] but what you preach with your courage is
[544.2s] not there. You have courage but what you
[547.0s] preach with courage is what you learn
[549.3s] and then he gave me
[551.7s] our time.
[554.2s] I thank that man although he's dead as
[557.2s] we speak. So this man was so much
[560.2s] courageous.
[562.9s] Imagine this is a king
[565.2s] with policemen with soldiers with him
[569.0s] with national intelligence service with
[571.3s] him. But he still throws what? Thrones.
[575.0s] Now go to the next scene. Say yes. When
[578.6s] he cast when he cast come out he don't
[581.3s] look
[582.1s] what
[584.9s] I tell the king. Come out. Come out thou
[588.5s] bloody man. Thou bloody man. Thou man of
[590.9s] B. Man of B. Who is B? Satan.
[595.5s] David, David is man of Satan. And is
[598.4s] bloody man
[601.1s] verse eight. Verse eight. The Lord hath
[603.1s] returned upon thee all the blood of the
[605.1s] house of Saul. Who said, "Thou was
[607.7s] rain." The Lord has delivered the
[609.8s] kingdom into the hand of Abselum thy
[611.6s] son.
[616.2s] So look at the people who are
[619.7s] making the people who made a tool.
[623.5s] Yes. Do you know I realized that in the
[626.4s] churches here we are there are people
[629.2s] that only there to make others to meet a
[633.0s] sinful death. These are the people who
[635.8s] made to be tough and start fighting as
[638.9s] well.
[640.9s] So you man what you did to King Saul?
[644.0s] But again now if you read about the
[645.8s] story of David and Saul by the way David
[648.5s] refused to do what to kill. The seven
[651.3s] time he found Saul Saul was looking for
[653.4s] him to kill him. You know that the soul
[656.0s] even lied that he want somebody to to
[659.3s] sing that the evil spirit may want
[663.5s] and David was playing
[671.3s] and he threw the what?
[673.7s] Yes. And what happened? So ran away.
[679.4s] He looked for David to cave. There's a
[681.6s] time David even found him inside a
[684.1s] valley when he was living till David had
[686.8s] to cut rent a clothes so that that one
[689.9s] will be a witness that I'm not going to
[691.8s] do what to kill you. To kill you.
[693.7s] Hallelujah. Amen. But the Bible says
[696.2s] here that was saying he's the one who
[699.0s] has killed who?
[701.0s] So was this a lie?
[703.7s] So look at how the lines are there. this
[706.7s] man so much carriers with the lies. Now
[710.0s] it continues to say and behold and
[712.2s] behold thou were taken in thy mischief
[715.0s] because thou a bloody man a bloody man.
[718.9s] Verse n then
[720.8s] say to then say the son of Zera the son
[725.4s] of the unto the king the king. Why
[727.8s] should this dead dog cast thy lord the
[729.8s] king? Who you
[735.6s] see? By the way, if you go to the
[738.7s] king and start
[741.0s] abusing come here at home, are you a
[746.8s] dog? What is this doing?
[750.6s] Let me go over. Let me go over. I pray
[753.1s] thee, I pray thee, take off his head.
[755.0s] Let him take his
[756.6s] head. He has nothing. Let me take his
[760.0s] sword what is the head. What of
[765.0s] you? Take his hand very fast.
[770.0s] And the king said, the king said, "What
[771.8s] have I to do with you?" You son of Zera,
[774.7s] you son of So let him cast. Let him
[777.9s] cast. Because the Lord has said unto
[780.1s] him, said, "Let him cast." Maybe the
[782.7s] Lord has said unto him, unto him, cast
[785.4s] David, cast David, who shall then say,
[787.7s] who shall then say, wherefor thou done
[789.8s] so?
[792.0s] Imagine this man was abusing Saul David
[797.8s] stones. Doing a lot and tell the
[799.8s] soldiers, Mr. Allow me to go and chop
[802.8s] his head off. Then he say, please allow
[804.8s] him do that. allow him do who knows that
[808.4s] is the Lord who has told him to do unto
[812.0s] why David has done a lot of problems.
[815.0s] His son at the same time has left with
[817.7s] his what? as at the same time the his
[821.0s] son is chasing
[823.6s] him want to kill him at the same time in
[827.4s] his arms the his son called who the one
[831.4s] who raped the tama who I'm known as in
[835.7s] the same family he had a lot of problems
[839.1s] at the same time he has killed who
[843.1s] and has taken the what and their first
[845.4s] child is what dead
[848.6s] So
[851.7s] problems it is let's go to the next
[856.1s] verse to do that somebody may do to you
[859.5s] and you don't complain please let him do
[862.3s] I've seen somebody
[869.1s] saying we talking
[876.0s] like you Have we ever had people when
[878.7s] they being abused they say maybe God
[881.0s] maybe it is my sins that is making me to
[883.5s] be can we reach at a particular moment
[886.2s] imagine in the church that when somebody
[888.6s] talk about you say maybe God has ability
[891.9s] him to do that maybe I should learn a
[893.9s] lesson from what he's doing
[896.8s] maybe this what David is saying don't do
[899.9s] anything to him maybe it is the god who
[903.4s] has allowed him to do that now let's go
[905.5s] to next verse because of time And David
[907.3s] said to Abishai, David said to his son
[909.0s] and to all his servants, Yes. Behold,
[911.2s] behold my son, my son, which came forth
[913.5s] of my bowels, if my son have given birth
[918.2s] to this one is coming from the family of
[921.3s] my son given birth to
[925.0s] seeketh my life. Seek my life. How much
[927.4s] more now? How much more now? May this
[929.8s] Benjamite do it. Benjamite, let him
[932.4s] alone. Let him alone. Let him cast. Let
[934.8s] him cast. The Lord has been
[937.1s] him.
[939.9s] Hallelujah. Let me say this to those who
[943.0s] do not. I think all of us understand
[944.8s] English. I believe all of
[948.1s] us. My mother I think understands
[950.3s] English because he went to school and I
[953.5s] believe she understands. Those are the
[955.8s] old women here over 50 and above.
[973.0s] Have you ever system where your children
[975.8s] your own home is against you? You have a
[979.8s] problem in your own family that now
[982.0s] problems come from outside you say no
[988.5s] [Music]
[990.6s] please is the one who seeketh my life.
[993.6s] one of that person from another village,
[996.2s] from another place. Let let them do
[999.0s] maybe God is the one doing
[1001.6s] this. Maybe it is God. And imagine this
[1005.0s] person is cursing a king who was
[1008.9s] anointed
[1010.0s] by Leave him alone. Don't kill him. So
[1013.4s] Sime was to die. He's baptized. Sime was
[1016.7s] to be what? But he is saying please
[1020.1s] leave him. Why? It may be God who has
[1023.4s] bidden me to do what? To do that to me.
[1025.9s] To the right verse. I want to write very
[1027.4s] fast. It may be that the Lord will look
[1029.1s] on mine affliction. It may be the Lord
[1031.5s] will look into my on my affliction. And
[1034.2s] that the Lord will requit me. And the
[1036.3s] Lord will requit me. Uhhuh. Good for his
[1039.5s] cursing this day. The Lord will requit
[1041.8s] me. Uhhuh. Good for cursing me this day.
[1045.6s] Maybe the Lord will look on mine. What?
[1047.8s] Let him just read. Maybe the Lord can
[1050.4s] see. Maybe the Lord will look on my
[1053.4s] word. I'm spiritual. The things I'm
[1056.2s] passing through and the Lord may do what
[1059.3s] requ
[1070.8s] Can we have such people here in the
[1072.9s] church of God? I don't know. Let that
[1076.5s] continue very fast. And as David and his
[1079.0s] men were by the way, she went along on
[1082.0s] this hillside. She went along. He did
[1084.6s] not stop. He went along on the hillside.
[1087.6s] On the hillside over against
[1102.9s] him
[1104.5s] again. And as he went,
[1111.6s] and threw stones at him. He was stere
[1115.0s] and cast dust
[1117.3s] dust and the king and the king and all
[1120.6s] the people that were with him were
[1122.7s] became weary came weary and refresh
[1125.4s] themselves there weary do you know
[1129.3s] abusing do you know how cursing do you
[1132.4s] know talking he about people makes
[1135.1s] people tired do you know today we are in
[1138.2s] wives whereby women are tired because of
[1141.1s] how the husbands talk about that. Do you
[1144.0s] know we have people today in the church
[1146.0s] they are because
[1147.9s] of
[1149.4s] criticisms condemnation one what made
[1153.3s] them to be weary that
[1156.4s] they refuses the throwing of
[1159.7s] strokes there so
[1162.5s] much then the Bible says
[1167.0s] that all the people that the men of
[1168.9s] Israel came to
[1171.2s] Jerusalem with I will not go to because
[1174.0s] I talked about last summer. I wanted you
[1176.9s] wanted to see how was to be
[1180.9s] killed. David says please leave S alone.
[1185.4s] Leave him. Leave him alone.
[1190.2s] Maybe
[1192.8s] there does nothing to that. He leaves
[1196.3s] him to live. And then Solomon came to
[1199.8s] take the
[1201.7s] kingship.
[1204.2s] 36 came very well what this man did to
[1208.1s] his father. He knew if you say that
[1212.9s] therefore he come upon you from the
[1216.9s] verse
[1218.4s] 31 to him do fall upon him and burn him.
[1223.1s] The Lord shall return his blood upon
[1225.0s] him. You can read it. I'm not going to
[1227.3s] read that. And then verse 35, the
[1230.7s] king
[1233.2s] of the priest and did the king in the
[1236.2s] room of Abiata. And then verse 36. And
[1238.9s] the king said and called she and said
[1240.8s] unto him, "Build me a house in Jerusalem
[1244.2s] and dwell there and go not for it shall
[1247.7s] be from that day thou going out and
[1250.2s] passes over and thou shall know for that
[1256.5s] what the king saying is the gold is gold
[1264.2s] what?"
[1265.2s] graces. Imagine some of there are people
[1269.7s] even in this room that do not talk with
[1272.0s] some people because they sin that was
[1274.0s] done to them long time ago. Maybe 10
[1276.5s] years ago they not talking they in the
[1278.8s] church of God. There are people here who
[1281.3s] are not talking to others because others
[1283.3s] are wrong with their parents and they in
[1285.4s] the church of God preaching what we got
[1288.0s] faith. Look at this man, the spirit of
[1290.9s] David. Spirit of his son and build an
[1294.3s] house in where? Jerusalem. The day you
[1296.7s] will go any
[1302.8s] good. And my lord the king say
[1309.1s] what is what?
[1311.6s] Thank you so much. And they dwell in
[1313.9s] Jerusalem for many what? Many days. For
[1316.0s] many what days. Please read with me
[1318.2s] verse 38. He looked in Jerusalem for
[1320.8s] many days. Many days. And it came to
[1324.0s] pass. It came to pass at the end of
[1325.9s] three years. After he stayed after how
[1328.4s] many years? Three years. After how many
[1330.3s] years? Three years. Remember in the
[1331.7s] Jewish economy 3 years when somebody has
[1334.6s] taken the service in the service of God
[1336.7s] he was to be ordained among the wildes
[1340.0s] and the Jewish 3 years was somebody to
[1342.5s] stay in the hard cities when he was to
[1344.8s] be given a responsibility of taking a
[1347.4s] particular
[1348.6s] church. The same with the pioneers it
[1351.1s] was 3 years look this man stayed three
[1354.2s] what? three years.
[1357.3s] And it came to pass at the end of three
[1358.9s] years to pass three years that the two
[1362.2s] of the servants of
[1363.6s] Shime unto Akish
[1367.0s] unto Akish, the son of Maka, king of G.
[1371.2s] And they told Shimeme,
[1373.4s] saying, "Thy servant be in G. Thy
[1376.6s] servant be G." Uh-huh. And she arose.
[1380.1s] She rose and suddenly suddenly and went
[1383.0s] to God. to G to Akish his servant and
[1386.4s] Shme went and brought his servant from G
[1389.4s] and it was told Solomon that Shme had
[1391.8s] gone from Jerusalem to G to G and was
[1394.2s] come again imagine he went came again he
[1398.2s] went and died out he went out and he
[1401.9s] came
[1404.4s] back things that people do not know he
[1411.2s] went he thinks that Solomon do not know
[1413.8s] anywhere and he was told please be do
[1416.5s] not come out of where Jerusalem he
[1421.0s] went please your other side and what did
[1424.2s] he do went and brought went himself very
[1426.2s] fast broke come back very fast and when
[1428.7s] he came he didn't know his provision is
[1430.4s] what it's closed closed he was given a
[1433.6s] chance again imagine if you read let's
[1436.5s] go to verse number 41 it says yes and it
[1439.9s] was told Solomon told that she had gone
[1442.6s] from Jerusalem to God. From Jerusalem to
[1444.8s] God, and was come again. Was come again.
[1446.7s] And the king sent and called for Shib
[1448.4s] was called was called and said unto him
[1450.5s] said unto him, did I not make thee to
[1452.2s] swear by the Lord? I made you to swear
[1454.2s] before the Lord and protest unto thee,
[1456.6s] say, know for a certain on the day that
[1459.5s] thou goest out, and walkest abroad by
[1462.0s] hither, yes, that thou shalt surely die.
[1464.1s] Thou shalt surely die. Thou said unto
[1465.7s] me, said unto me, the word that heard is
[1468.2s] good. The word that heard is is good. Is
[1472.1s] that how we also say when you have
[1473.4s] accepted the truth it is good the
[1476.2s] message is good I will walk in the way
[1480.1s] we thank
[1481.3s] God and even promise it is what can you
[1485.7s] remember our baptism of vows when we
[1487.4s] make vow with God you read that and then
[1491.0s] people say it is
[1492.7s] what verse number 42 42 I've read verse
[1496.9s] 43 why then hast thou not kept the oath
[1499.8s] of the lord why have you not kept the
[1501.7s] vows you made and the commandment that I
[1504.2s] have charged thee with. 44. The king
[1507.3s] said moreover to Sheime. Listen to this
[1509.6s] verse says the king said moreover to
[1512.6s] Shme, thou knowest all the wickedness
[1515.4s] which thine heart is private to that
[1517.9s] thou didest to David my father. You
[1519.9s] remember what he did to his father? He
[1522.3s] abused the father of David. He was to
[1524.4s] die. But this me was not to live. See me
[1528.2s] he said was to be jumped once. Oh, but
[1530.5s] what happened? Was given probation time.
[1533.6s] David was so much gracious. I'm
[1535.8s] wondering about David. David was so much
[1538.6s] That is why God says David's heart is
[1541.7s] after his own heart. You know what you
[1544.6s] did to my world. Thou knowest all the
[1546.7s] wickedness which thine heart is private
[1548.5s] to. Yes. That thou didest to David my
[1551.1s] father. Yes. Therefore the Lord shall
[1553.1s] return thy weakness upon thy own head.
[1555.3s] Yes. And King Solomon shall be blessed.
[1558.0s] Shall be blessed. The throne of David
[1559.6s] shall be established before the Lord
[1561.0s] forever. Amen. So the king commanded
[1563.0s] Baniah the son of Jodia which went out
[1567.1s] and fell upon it that he died and the
[1570.2s] kingdom was established in the heart of
[1571.8s] Solomon. The kingdom of Solomon was
[1574.1s] established.
[1575.8s] Amen.
[1579.4s] Grace of a loving God. Praise the
[1591.5s] tit mountain out for the way the blood
[1597.2s] of the lamb was
[1606.1s] plead
[1608.7s] gra and
[1612.9s] and
[1621.3s] grad
[1625.1s] all surely
[1628.6s] s was not to leave. S did wickedness was
[1633.9s] to be chopped
[1635.8s] longtime. Sime was not to leave. Do you
[1638.6s] think even even you look at was he again
[1641.4s] live again next to David's
[1643.6s] son he was unworthy but he was given
[1647.4s] infinite
[1650.0s] grace. In fact he was even brought to
[1653.0s] live in Jerusalem not to go anywhere
[1656.8s] again. He was to leave. He was told he
[1660.1s] even
[1667.6s] swel in fact Solomon was not even to
[1670.8s] talk with this. Do you have you ever
[1672.6s] been you know there are things which are
[1674.6s] so sad?
[1676.4s] Have you ever been in a family and you
[1678.1s] see somebody abusing your your
[1680.5s] mother you abuse and talking about you
[1685.0s] you have you ever seen or your father
[1686.7s] somebody come and your father in front
[1688.2s] of you and you big
[1690.0s] people is it so sad I don't unless you
[1693.0s] are
[1694.0s] man slap that mouth of that boy hardly
[1698.9s] so that he may be able to wake up sit
[1701.5s] well you are sitting apparate as well
[1704.3s] amen
[1706.8s] Now somebody abusing your father or
[1709.2s] somebody come and beat your mother in
[1710.6s] your presence. How do you feel? You'll
[1713.4s] feel how will you feel that somebody
[1716.2s] slap your mother and kick and you're
[1717.5s] sitting down and you're big people that
[1719.7s] person's pricking and then following one
[1721.7s] year you find that person who kicked
[1723.5s] your mother they there staying together
[1725.1s] in the same house and how will you
[1730.6s] feel it is so
[1732.9s] sad imagine this man is now living with
[1736.4s] Solomon Solomon gives him another chance
[1739.3s] and then later on he breaks went out to
[1742.9s] the world, comes back to Jerusalem.
[1745.2s] Remember Jerusalem represent what? The
[1747.2s] house of God. The house of God. Is that
[1748.8s] right? Yes. Where God's act of covenant
[1751.3s] was found. He runs and then comes back
[1754.0s] again. And when he comes back, his grace
[1756.9s] is what? Over. Grace is now over.
[1760.2s] Proverbial is
[1762.4s] closed. I'm taking another case study
[1764.6s] and then I pray because my time is
[1767.0s] almost up. Acts 12 verse 25. There's
[1770.7s] another man. Bible reads who also went
[1773.6s] and I I want to tell you that some of us
[1776.2s] may be taking examples in this last days
[1778.9s] we can with the vows we are making to
[1781.4s] work for God you sometimes we can make
[1784.3s] vibes we don't understand sometimes we
[1787.0s] entering upon the and
[1789.2s] that's me young people have made
[1792.0s] decisions and they think they
[1795.1s] making they do not
[1798.1s] understand some people even gone from
[1800.4s] baptism they don't understand and that
[1803.4s] is why we are tired jokes and ced and
[1807.0s] are falling upon some even given
[1809.5s] themselves on things they do not
[1811.2s] understand so that when other things
[1814.4s] come when other messengers bring them
[1816.2s] some messages please run over there run
[1818.8s] over there and then they can run there
[1821.0s] and after some time come back anytime
[1824.0s] they want and they think that they are
[1825.8s] still
[1828.6s] They did and they made vow they think
[1832.2s] that they making vow to man and not to
[1834.6s] God. Hallelujah. And this is thought it
[1838.1s] is a joke. He did not know how
[1840.5s] wickedness he was. He did not know that
[1843.4s] he only got grace. And that is why many
[1846.1s] young people today do not know that this
[1848.8s] song we are making, the vibes we are
[1850.8s] making as we speak in this last days,
[1853.5s] they do not know it is the last
[1856.4s] chance that we just been given and they
[1860.3s] are choosing so and so did this, so and
[1863.3s] so did this. But let me tell you, you
[1865.5s] may go and you going that was your final
[1869.4s] chance. Hallelujah. Acts 12 verse 25.
[1875.4s] Barnabas again. Let's take another case
[1877.9s] study before we pray. Read Acts 12 verse
[1882.1s] number 25. The Bible says and Barnabas
[1884.6s] and Saul returned from Jerusalem.
[1886.4s] Barnabas and Saul returned from
[1889.0s] Jerusalem. They had filled their
[1890.7s] ministry. that what filled their
[1894.1s] ministry that fulfilled their ministry
[1897.7s] ministry
[1899.3s] and took with them John with them a man
[1902.2s] called who John John whose son name was
[1904.8s] Mark whose son name was Mark so his name
[1906.9s] was John Mark who took him and they were
[1911.3s] preaching they found a man they found
[1913.9s] what and man his name was called who
[1916.9s] John
[1919.7s] chapter 13 Verse number 13, the Bible
[1922.7s] reads, "Now when Paul and his company
[1925.0s] lose from Puffos, now when Paul and his
[1928.4s] what? His company loosed from Pos, they
[1932.3s] came to Pa. They came to Pah in Pilia.
[1936.6s] And John departing from them. John
[1939.1s] departed from them
[1942.4s] in fact. These verses have taken me to
[1945.6s] not be praying. Act
[1948.8s] 12. Saul and who? And Barnabas took who?
[1952.9s] John Mark in their minist. They took him
[1956.1s] so that this man may join them in the
[1957.9s] work of God. In Acts 13, the Bible
[1960.6s] simply says who departed. Now when Paul
[1963.0s] and his family come loose from Paposh,
[1964.9s] they came to P and Pilia and John
[1967.5s] departed from them to return to
[1969.4s] Jerusalem. John departed. He left the
[1971.7s] two men and departed from where?
[1974.4s] Jerusalem. Jun went to Jerusalem. He
[1977.1s] departed and left. Let's go very fast
[1985.2s] 169. I'm remaining with two and we pray.
[1989.8s] Read this one. Write them
[1995.3s] down.
[1996.8s] 169 it reads was not a man of
[2001.8s] education. I've said

[2094.7s] to deliver. Amen. Amen. They knew it is
[2097.1s] God who will take care of them. Now
[2099.4s] continue reading. It says, "Yes,
[2102.6s] their hearts were filled with perent
[2104.4s] love." Perfect love for perishing souls.
[2108.7s] What they wanted was to go and look for
[2112.3s] the Lord. There's a song saying resue
[2115.5s] the perishing care for the dying.

[2223.3s] were filled with perfect love for
[2224.6s] perishing souls. lack obearing soul. As
[2227.5s] faithful shepherds, as faithful
[2229.1s] shepherds, in search of the lost sheep,

[2233.9s] convenience. They thought to their own
[2236.1s] what? Ease and convenience. Ease and
[2238.2s] convenience. Forgetful of self,

[2262.4s] do things which are very and you want to
[2264.2s] look at this read. Forgetful of self,

[2320.1s] Hallelujah. Amen. Those were the men
[2321.9s] that were
[2323.3s] called. But as they were doing that
[2326.1s] work, Mark joined them. But look here,
[2330.1s] it was here that Mark, it was
[2333.0s] overwhelmed with fear and
[2334.2s] discouragement.

[2397.4s] Look at who? Please look here. He said
[2399.2s] it was here that Mark It was here that
[2401.3s] Mark overwhelmed with fear and
[2402.6s] discouragement. Discouragement wavered

[2432.7s] and used to hardship and he used to
[2435.0s] hardship hardship he was disheartened he
[2437.7s] was disheartened by the perils Privation
[2440.1s] of the way they're used to what
[2441.8s] privations of the wives what hardship I
[2444.8s] I I want to know the mother of mark I
[2447.1s] don't you know
[2448.9s] hardship please children teach these
[2451.7s] children and I thank my father and my
[2454.4s] mother here my mother is here I thank
[2456.0s] them with us when I look at our life at
[2458.4s] home it was life of hardship
[2460.7s] amenship I remember when we were young
[2463.1s] we had only two benches in our
[2482.7s] Amen. With my
[2488.0s] sisters, this young man, my brother, we
[2491.3s] were
[2493.1s] working in fact
[2495.8s] My mother is here.
[2525.4s] hours by
[2532.0s] 2000 brothers.
[2544.6s] brothers. Now you have big brothers.
[2546.7s] They were in class 8 and I was in class
[2549.3s] one. Life of good. Amen. Amen. I didn't
[2553.8s] know that that was preparing me for the
[2555.6s] gospel work. Let me tell you those make
[2557.5s] decision. This gospel work is very
[2559.6s] difficult. Amen. Amen. That those are
[2573.9s] used. I remember when I was going to
[2576.4s] high school, I cried to the mother and
[2577.9s] the mother used to tell me, "You are
[2579.1s] with your father working for the whole
[2580.7s] day. What did you do to
[2587.2s] me? Go back. You are there.
[2591.3s] And then we go to school
[2593.1s] without. So what did we do when we go to
[2598.0s] school in the
[2602.9s] bathroom? In fact, when it is 3
[2606.5s] weeks for people to
[2610.6s] close
[2613.1s] because you know when people and then by
[2616.4s] the end of the time I remember I went to
[2619.0s] school with not given pocket
[2625.2s] money. What I was doing I eat it that
[2628.4s] day so that I may not think something
[2630.8s] over the box. I study in class. Life of
[2634.1s] what? And whom that life was preparing
[2637.4s] because this gospel that you want to
[2639.5s] make decision is life for. No, there are
[2642.0s] things that we pass and sometimes you
[2644.6s] can hate your parents but later on when
[2646.5s] you sit down you read Romans 8:28 then
[2649.0s] you say all things work together for
[2651.4s] good for those who love God and are
[2653.4s] called to his purpose. Hallelujah.
[2655.9s] Praise God. And used to what? Hardship.
[2660.0s] Hardship. They were using in good house
[2663.2s] electricity mopping with this gospel but
[2667.0s] God still calls them. Why don't you say
[2668.6s] amen?
[2670.2s] Let's read. I'm almost finishing. And he
[2672.2s] used to worship and used to worship. He
[2673.8s] was disheartened by the privilege and
[2675.6s] privation of the way. He had labored
[2677.9s] with success. He had leed with success
[2680.0s] unfavorable circumstances. Unfavor. So
[2682.4s] those are used toward they can labor
[2684.6s] with success in favorable circumstances.
[2687.3s] when there's something they get there's
[2689.0s] food there's brown rice chapel there's
[2692.9s] fair oh that is favorable war
[2695.2s] circumstance but now a minister of
[2698.8s] position a minister what opposition
[2702.4s] was too much and perils and perils that
[2705.6s] so often beset the pioneer work that so
[2708.9s] what often beset the pioneer work God is
[2712.5s] calling us to a pioneer work we are
[2714.9s] going back to the old ACD
[2717.6s] to the faith of the adventist which all
[2720.5s] charges our general depart from the
[2723.8s] truth. This is the time we were
[2726.6s] establishing the Christian world church.
[2729.3s] We also called in the same work going
[2731.4s] back to the old ways. It is very
[2733.8s] difficult for those who will be coming
[2735.6s] forward. I've been preaching here and
[2737.4s] men and young ladies are coming forward.
[2739.6s] that a time cometh that there's not even
[2742.0s] shoes. A time cometh that you may not
[2745.4s] have even clothes. A time reaches that
[2748.3s] when you have a coat and they try new
[2750.8s] one which somebody has given you. Some
[2752.6s] people think that maybe maybe nowadays
[2755.1s] they saw where you get things. It is
[2757.6s] very if you don't have you are poor go
[2759.8s] and do something. If you are this one
[2762.0s] you might have stolen somewhere. It is
[2764.5s] very difficult. Hallelujah church.
[2767.0s] Hallelujah. It is very difficult that
[2770.4s] sometimes you cannot even get money to
[2773.9s] save your air. Very
[2777.2s] difficult. But we are told that at such
[2780.2s] a time is when Mark says it is not
[2783.5s] possible. I'm going back. Cannot do
[2785.8s] that. Read. Read with me very fast. He
[2788.1s] felt he knew hardness as a good soldier
[2789.8s] of the cross.
[2792.0s] Good soldier of the cross. He had yet to
[2793.9s] learn to face danger. He had yet to
[2796.3s] learn to face danger and persecution and
[2799.0s] persecution. Adversity with a brave
[2800.8s] heart. Adversity with a brave heart.
[2803.4s] Adverse with a brave heart. As the
[2805.4s] apostle advanced as the apostle advanced
[2807.5s] and still great difficulties were
[2809.0s] apprehended. Yes. Mark was intimidated.
[2811.9s] Mark was intimidated and losing all
[2814.6s] courage and losing all courage. Refused
[2816.9s] to go further and return to Jerusalem.
[2818.4s] He said, "I'm not going with this. This
[2820.0s] is not a gospel. Gospel with
[2822.2s] persecution.
[2825.9s] You know this gospel sometimes very
[2827.7s] difficult that there are things you may
[2829.1s] be going through that you don't even
[2830.9s] want your brothers to
[2832.4s] know. This gospel is very tough that
[2835.0s] sometimes you can cry in a
[2837.2s] cell. Sometimes it is tough that you
[2840.9s] even don't know how to
[2843.4s] start. Sometimes things are so tough
[2846.1s] that you sit somewhere and say how do I
[2848.2s] start these things? It is very
[2850.2s] difficult. At that time his Wendy and
[2852.3s] Mark said this thing Paul and Barabas is
[2854.3s] doing and every time they trust in God I
[2856.6s] was reading about Joseph B when the wife
[2858.4s] call and ask him give us money for food
[2860.7s] and the answer was God will provide. You
[2862.9s] said we are tired with God. Every time
[2864.4s] we
[2865.2s] provide that every time we have why can
[2868.6s] we go to the last quotation conflict and
[2872.0s] courage this the last one 348 paragraph
[2876.5s] 2 and three and then you jump to 349 and
[2879.5s] then we pray. Please friends youth must
[2883.3s] decide for himself but which decision.
[2885.1s] Do you understand the decision you are
[2886.5s] making? Did Mark understand? Mark
[2888.9s] entered the gospel without understanding
[2891.0s] the obligation. S was also making an
[2894.1s] obligation without understanding and
[2897.0s] please do not get opportunity. We want
[2899.6s] also see this one. Read with me. Mark
[2903.1s] bring him with you for he find him
[2905.7s] useful. That is second Timothy what?
[2908.7s] Mark's what? Mark's mother was a convert
[2910.6s] to the Christian religion. Christian
[2912.2s] religion. Mark's mother was a convert.
[2919.9s] backh and what and home Jerusalem
[2924.5s] Jerusalem is an asylum to the disciples.
[2926.9s] Hallelujah. Amen. So Mark Mark's
[2930.2s] mother's house was an isel. All
[2933.7s] preachers used to go to
[2935.8s] mother's Mark's home. I love the mothers
[2938.6s] of
[2939.7s] Mark. Mark's mother was a good mother.
[2942.2s] What do you say man? There are mothers
[2944.6s] here that you cannot go to their
[2949.6s] homes. My mother thank you did not ask
[2952.1s] me such question when ministers used to
[2955.3s] come to our
[2957.5s] home. This woman was very good. Amen.
[2960.2s] Amen. Can God give us this other mother.
[2962.2s] So there are mothers if we go to their
[2966.4s] home. Amen. Hallelujah.
[2970.6s] Ma and you know how ministers when they
[2972.6s] get a place they can go, they will go.
[2974.4s] Amen. I I think this mother was
[2976.7s] peaceful. Mark's mother was a convert to
[2980.2s] the Christian religion. Amen. At home at
[2983.3s] Jerusalem was an assam for the
[2987.3s] Mark proposed
[2988.8s] to Mark was there seeing how the mother
[2991.5s] was welcoming. Then Mark was touring
[2993.6s] with ministers in the table and he said
[2995.9s] to Paul and he said that he should
[2999.0s] accompany them on their missionary tour
[3001.2s] go with you the missionary tour. He has
[3003.8s] proposed he not understand and that is
[3006.2s] the problem today with men who enter
[3008.8s] into the ministry without understanding
[3010.9s] the obligation. They don't understand.
[3013.0s] That is why we can enter any we want and
[3015.2s] leave anytime we want. We don't
[3016.8s] understand. We just love going to miss.
[3018.9s] People are going to miss. Can we go? Can
[3020.8s] we go? Oh, you're the minister. Let us
[3022.6s] go. Now, when things become difficult,
[3025.2s] when you are taking one year with one
[3027.0s] sweater, you say, "Oh, I thought I'm
[3030.0s] going to be like a district.
[3041.6s] There are people here. There are
[3043.5s] ministers. They are just proposing. Can
[3045.2s] we go in a few
[3047.6s] minutes? We need to help our parents. We
[3050.1s] need to Mark also
[3055.1s] proposed to Paul and Barnabas. Yes. That
[3057.8s] he should accompany them on their
[3059.0s] missionary tour. He felt the favor of
[3061.1s] God in his heart and long to devote
[3063.6s] himself entirely to the work of the
[3064.9s] gospel. To be to be a fulltime what?
[3068.4s] Minister. Young man, how many are
[3070.2s] longing to be full-time ministers? You
[3072.7s] are longing. We thank God. Longing. I
[3076.6s] want to give my life entirely to the
[3078.6s] gospel. You think it is a
[3080.8s] joke. Ask those who have tried it here.
[3083.5s] It is not a joke. Ask their mothers. My
[3086.2s] mother is here. Go with him. Ask is
[3087.9s] Maxwell sending you something per month.
[3090.1s] He will tell
[3095.2s] you. Amen. Hallelujah.
[3099.0s] That's what
[3100.6s] difficult. Some people do not understand
[3103.5s] it. So it was just longing. Now look
[3106.9s] after longing. Their way was to
[3111.2s] they encountered hardship. They
[3112.7s] encountered hardship and privation
[3115.5s] and were beset with das on
[3118.0s] every but Paul and Barnabas
[3121.4s] in learn to trust God's heart.
[3124.5s] Their hearts were filled with fervent
[3126.0s] love for perishing spirit. A shful
[3128.9s] shepherd in search of the lost sheep.
[3131.7s] They gave thought to their own ease and
[3134.0s] conveniences. ease and what?
[3135.8s] Conveniences. Forgetful of self. They
[3139.1s] faltered not when merry not when weary
[3142.0s] when weary hungry hungry and called they
[3144.9s] had in their view but one object.
[3147.1s] Salvation of those who had wondered far
[3148.8s] from the
[3150.3s] fall. Please imagine we had a people
[3152.9s] with one object. You know nowadays
[3154.9s] people come to the ministry with se
[3157.3s] several objects. Somebody come to the
[3159.4s] ministry and gives the church the list.
[3161.8s] When I've come to minister you know my
[3163.8s] mother you have to build a house for him
[3165.8s] for her. You know yeah you will be close
[3169.2s] my mother you know you buy buy for me a
[3171.6s] land in the country you must build for
[3173.5s] me. I say I'm preaching for
[3175.2s] you. So those list if you will fulfill
[3177.9s] them we can go and preach. No, but with
[3181.4s] these people they had one what? Object.
[3183.9s] What? What was the object? What? They
[3186.4s] the they had view but one object.
[3188.5s] Salvation. Those who were worried one
[3190.7s] far from the fall. Next point. Mark will
[3194.3s] be fear and discouragement and
[3196.0s] discouragement wavered for a time in his
[3198.6s] for a time in his purpose purpose to
[3201.7s] give himself wholehearted Lord's word
[3204.5s] and he used to worship and he used to
[3206.6s] worship. He was disheartened by the
[3208.2s] perish and prevision of the way. He had
[3210.6s] yet to learn to face danger and
[3212.8s] persecution, adversity with a brave
[3215.2s] heart. As the apostle advanced and still
[3218.2s] great difficulties were apprehended,
[3220.3s] Mark was intimidated. And losing all
[3223.2s] courage, refused to go further and
[3225.2s] return to Jerusalem. This decision
[3227.5s] caused Paul to judge Mark unfavorably.
[3229.8s] Mark judged Paul. Paul judged Mark
[3232.6s] unfavorably.
[3234.6s] Unfavorably. is not like David. Paul is
[3238.2s] not like what? David. Paul judged Mark
[3241.2s] what? Unfavorably. Imagine the one who
[3243.8s] was not judged like was not judge
[3245.6s] unfavorable. David said, "Please leave
[3247.6s] him. Please leave him."
[3253.3s] But look what did Paul do? The decision
[3255.9s] caused Paul to judge unfavorably.
[3258.4s] Unfavorably. And even severely. That one
[3261.0s] thing is 15 we are not going to read.
[3263.0s] And he judged him severely. He
[3266.5s] refused because now people were going
[3272.1s] back and when Mark came people said Mark
[3274.8s] is joking. Mark is joking. Mark cannot
[3277.4s] leave us in the field and then go and
[3279.2s] rest when things were tough and then
[3280.9s] when things are
[3283.0s] new with people we cannot work with
[3286.1s] there people in ministry talking like
[3287.8s] that. So and so has been leaving us and
[3289.7s] coming this time
[3291.7s] around. Hallelujah.
[3294.9s] Hallelujah. Mark judged that Paul judged
[3297.8s] Mark. Paul judged Mark unfavorable
[3301.4s] and even severe injuries they were fight
[3304.9s] they were almost
[3307.1s] fighting there was sharp contention in
[3309.4s] Acts 15:36 sharp
[3313.5s] contention Paul was
[3317.1s] mistaken what he said is final people
[3320.5s] love Paul but Paul had
[3325.2s] something till people separated
[3328.9s] And then for a
[3567.0s] Some people are going to come back
[3568.3s] because somebody do not want them. Look,
[3570.5s] Mark did not think of what Paul is
[3572.5s] thinking about him. But we told that
[3574.2s] Barnabas has encouraged him. Don't we
[3576.5s] have Barnabas today here who is able to
[3579.7s] encourage young men to keep the faith?
[3582.4s] Yes, we have. Don't we have also people
[3584.7s] like Paul who thinks that others should
[3587.0s] not be given opportunity? Yes, they are
[3589.0s] there. They were there with during the
[3590.6s] time of who of of of David. There was
[3593.1s] one who said, "Can we chop his head
[3594.5s] off?" What's that?
[3596.6s] Abishai. Abby. Don't we have also with
[3599.8s] the spirit of Paul? But still there was
[3602.1s] grace. In both there was grace both for
[3605.0s] and for who? John Mark. How are you
[3607.0s] going to use that grace? Friends, the
[3609.4s] work is great and the youth must decide
[3611.4s] for themselves. Please, the messages
[3613.1s] we're bringing on to you are hard. The
[3615.4s] messages that being presented by
[3617.2s] ministers there are hard they are notice
[3620.4s] and sometimes when you see people making
[3622.4s] decisions in this church it is not simp
[3625.6s] this faith is very hard for you to
[3628.2s] preach there are lot of things waiting
[3630.2s] for us it needs those who are going to
[3633.0s] give themselves
[3634.7s] unreservedly not with what feelings and
[3638.5s] those are the people God is calling
[3639.8s] friends hallelujah and the youth
[3642.6s] mass and there's a grace if If you get
[3645.2s] lost, it will be up. But if this anybody
[3649.0s] will get lost with this opportunity we
[3651.4s] have gotten, your blood will be upon
[3654.2s] thee. I'm seeing s is being killed by
[3656.4s] bay and he's told we killing you and
[3659.4s] your blood is upon you. Please when the
[3661.4s] probation will end and we are getting
[3663.4s] lost in this oldest demo, we will get
[3666.8s] lost with all these messages which are
[3668.6s] being brought. Some are even thought by
[3670.6s] young men, young boys that even your
[3673.5s] children are older than them. And then
[3675.7s] we just simply neglect these messages.
[3678.3s] Please when we get lost, we are going to
[3680.2s] be killed. Sime is being killed in the
[3682.9s] presence of Solomon. Ben is taking his
[3685.7s] tool and is being slaughtered. And then
[3688.2s] he told your
[3690.0s] blood thee with all those grace. Please
[3694.0s] imagine after getting all these messages
[3696.9s] after sitting in these powerful meetings
[3699.4s] halls eating and serving every day
[3701.9s] coming here messages are being
[3704.0s] presented. There's old men in this
[3706.1s] meeting. There's young men presenting
[3708.2s] singing here and then you just simply
[3709.8s] reject you just simply take this thing
[3712.2s] for granted. You say it is good. You
[3714.3s] need the messages you present. And this
[3715.8s] is how me talk. It is good the way you
[3718.8s] also talk. Your message is good. I've
[3720.8s] seen young men calling. I know the
[3723.3s] messages you preach is good. They are
[3725.0s] good. They are good. No, that is Bab.

[3742.6s] And I'm told that the wicked also when

[3764.0s] of idol is death but God has given us
[3766.6s] opportunity. Amen. God has again brought
[3769.0s] us a message. We were to die and God
[3771.1s] said please with all the wind let that
[3773.6s] person live. Maybe you know not and you
[3776.2s] have got another opportunity. Others
[3777.9s] wanted us even not to be in this
[3780.4s] work. People have some do not even need
[3783.4s] us to be here. Some parents did not want
[3785.6s] us to be here. But God allowed you to be
[3787.7s] here. Some churches didn't want you to
[3790.2s] be here. There were promises of goods,
[3792.2s] but God gave you another chance. Are you
[3794.4s] going to mess it up? Are you going to
[3797.0s] again take it that you are also going to

[3821.3s] making final call next Sabbath. One call
[3824.2s] here. Is there somebody here like this
[3827.0s] young man? You left the work of God and
[3831.0s] you want God to give you a second chance
[3832.9s] and you want to use it not as he may use
[3835.5s] it but as John Mark used it until John
[3839.6s] Mark now we read the book of Mark which
[3842.2s] is a powerful book. Is there somebody
[3844.5s] like that? You had given yourself to the
[3847.0s] work of God. But because of challenges,
[3849.5s] because of hardships, because of things
[3851.6s] which are tough in the work of God,
[3853.4s] because of opposition and persecution,
[3855.4s] because of coldness and anger, because
[3857.6s] of the things we meet, you thought to
[3860.1s] run and go back to your mother's house
[3863.4s] to
[3864.2s] Jerusalem, but you want God to give you
[3867.0s] another chance. There's a chance for
[3869.1s] all. There's a chance for what? Who is
[3871.8s] there somebody who needs such a chance
[3873.8s] that God help you to give yourself
[3876.0s] unreserved for this work? Please there's
[3878.3s] a space a small I don't want many
[3879.8s] people. I want just one person or two.
[3882.5s] This space is small. It's not meant for
[3884.3s] all of you. So I only need someone here
[3887.2s] to come for prayers. Can I even get a
[3889.7s] one one to pray with? I don't want many
[3892.5s] people here. I only need one.
