FULL TRANSCRIPT:
catching up with us. Uh we learned from the Bible and also we learned from the SOP and I hope God has really blessed us. Uh song number 88 we are told that nothing can wash us. You know the washing is needed when uh a body is dirty so that the dirt is removed away and therefore that one is bringing us to a topic this uh uh this time uh about cleanliness. I know it is something something that we know and uh it is not something that uh I just need to define is when you know about cleanliness but God requires every child of his to be clean not just on the physical cleanness but in all aspects let's move to the book of uh third John and verse two third John quickly Okay, because we behind time. Uh the readers please we do quickly. Third John verse two. The Bible says the Bible says help. Yes. Be in health that is the physical and also your soul to also prosper. So this uh the the soul mental together with physical can never be separated. We can't say that I can just wash my body that is enough. No, you go deep and then you are cleansed from within and also from without. That is the topic that we want to tackle. Uh so that by the end of it we remind ourselves I know everyone here is clean but uh I think it is brought here. God has written it for us so that we be admonished each and every time to improve so that we be clean as clean as our father in heaven. Let's go to the book of Matthew chapter 5 and also verse 48. Matthew 5 verse 48. The Bible says yes may be there to Yes. Father in heaven. Yeah. We are reminded that we be perfect even as our father who is at he who is in heaven is also perfect. I don't think God is just clean physically. He's clean in all aspects. I don't think that we can find any dirt from our living father. So that is what is required of us. We are reminded that we need to be clean and clean in all aspect the soul mind together with the physical body. That's what we want to tackle very quickly and then we shall see how God uh has planned for us this evening. Thank you. Uh we are having the book of 1 Corinthians chapter 14 and then verse 40. Corinthians chapter 14 verse 40. It reads no time. Which book are you reading? 1 Corinthians 14:14. 14:14. Verse 14. Yes, sir. Amen. Let all things be done decently and in order. So, it means or it is bringing in our mind that our God is a God of order. And do you think cleanliness is in order? Yes. Do you think cleanliness is in order? Yes. And that is why God is reminding us and it is a whole topic in the child guidance. We are having so many things about cleanliness. God is saying that please you Israelites be very clean as I'm coming to pass there. I shall find uh your surroundings very clean so that you can also feel my presence with thee. Amen. So it is not just something that we know that we have we need not to be reminded of. So the the book of first Corinthians Paul is saying that everything must be in order and must be done decently. Amen. Amen. So that is the voice of the Lord. Uh so we are having uh what we are calling cleanliness and that's what we want to tackle. Book of Matthew 5:8 says that without being clean, without being pure, we shall not see God. Amen. And this is the time that we need to do uh the reformations. If I'm not clean in one way or the other, I need to be clean. Even my words, as Matthew records it, I I hope you are in the book of five. Matthew verse 8 says, yes, blessed are the pure in heart, for they shall see God. Our ultimate goal, what has brought us here, what is making us to adore God is that one time, one day we shall meet with our father and then we shall forget about everything, all the infirmities in this world and then we shall be very happy. Amen. Amen. I hope that is what is in you. All of us, we need to see God and we without being pure, we cannot see God. that is recorded in the book of Matthew 5:8 that those happy them are blessed are them that are pure for they shall see God. So it means that if you are not pure, you cannot see God. How can you be pure in your heart, in your soul and then you are not pure in the brain. Is it possible? Is it possible? No. No. Just talk to me. Is it possible? Can you be pure in your heart? You say that me I love God so much but you are dirty on the I mean on your body. You don't care whether you're going to sleep with the legs with the legs with mud. You don't care. Do you think God can be happy with us? No. So God needs us to be pure. So the purity that God is talking about here is it is entire it is bringing in what we call the soul to be pure, the mind and also the physical body. So for somebody to know that this person is pure or this person is clean, the human eye, what will people see from you? Yes. What can people see? Yes. So that they can say you talk to meh. You talk to me. What will people say? And then they depict that this person is clean. Yes. From behind there. Nvin, you've carried up your hand. Oh, okay. to maybe to I know that you know people will look at you the physical appearance your clothes your shoes your body itself the way you've you've kept your hair people shall say ah this person is a clean person is a clean man a clean woman or a clean child so that is not enough God requires much than that what you beyond what human beings can see a pure heart uh in this world people will say that ah Because Moses Alo is really helping people and is very genuine. This person I I I must think that he's very pure before the eyes of the Lord. But it is only the Lord who can read the heart, the heart. And therefore we are told that for us to be in a condition that we shall see our God, then we must be pure. The purity that God wants is all aspects, the mind, the soul and also our body. uh but today uh I want us to check uh on how we can take care of our bodies on how we can take care of our bodies. There are a lot of questions which were asked when you are having uh this the second lesson in the morning uh that was uh modesty. Somebody asked a lot of question some we asked a lot of questions but then we shall see how we answer some of these questions. Okay. nature. Uh when we are doing doing the book of uh I mean we are having the Bible, we are told more about nature and God in his cleverness, he he used nature to teach us more of these things. Uh just check nature. Just check nature. Nature is some all these things that God created. It is not man-made. Anything that God created we can term is that as nature something that natural we find them in all our surroundings. Look at the trees look at the I mean the plants the animals your surroundings even human beings we shall we are going to find that all these things that God created they are clean. Is that true? Is that true? And that is not enough. God made Adam to be in the garden of Ed. What was the work given to Adam? Yes. To take care of the environment. Taking care of the that garden so that he ensures that where he is is clean and that cleanness will keep Adam pure. We have talked about the mind, the I mean the soul, the mind and also the the physical. So God did not want to see things which are not uh well arranged. Everything was to be kept pure, kept clean. And that is what is God what that is what God is calling us to be today. God is clean. There's no question about that one. God is pure. So he needs pure people by the end of this journey to do what? To be victors together with Christ. So nature we seeing animals the way God had created them. It is only by our sin that we are making them to violate the nature or violate the laws of of God. So we finding that uh as God made Adam to be or gave them the garden of Eden, he was the first teacher. He was the instructor. He gave them the work to do. The very first work that he gave them was to take care of their garden. And then we are finding nature. What was nature to Adam and Eve? That was a lesson book. Do you think it ceases to be a lesson book uh to Adam and Eve at their time? Is it can it be a lesson book to us today? Yes. Nature is our lesson book. So look at nature. It's a very big book. We need to learn about it and then God is going to be happy if we going we are ready to learn of nature. Then we are having uh the garden of Eden being the what? No, I just want us to talk. Uhhuh. That is the classroom. So God in his in his wisdom, he knew that these things will help us to the end of the age. So we are also called upon today to learn from nature as our lesson lesson book and then we are put here to call other people who are who have violated the law together with us to improve. What I just want you to check today is clean and know that we are all clean. It is not that we are not clean but we are all clean but then God needs us to improve on the cleanness in all aspects so that we are able to see him when he's coming the second time. Uh let's go to the book of uh Christ object lesson quickly. Uh if you are there page 348 paragraph one we are going to do paragraph one and paragraph two. The Bible says all should have human. Yes. All should have an intelligent knowledge. All is it some all should have is is God talking through sister white to animals. Do you think he's talking to animals here that all cows and elephants should have do you think he's going to is talking to animals? He's talking to us. Yes. Continue. All should have an intelligent knowledge. Yes. Of the human frame. Mhm. that they may keep their bodies in condition necessary to do the work of the lord that we should keep our bodies in a condition for the necessary work. So it means that there are some work which are not necessary but there there work which god approves to be necessary and therefore it is not Jesus who shall come down to make this body in a better condition to do the necessary work that God has given us. Yes. Continue. It says it says the physical life the physical life is to be carefully preserved is to be carefully preserved. Not carelessly should be carefully preserved. preserved and developed that through humanity and developed developed that through humanity yes divine nature may be revealed in its fullness. Just stop there. that when we are clean when the physical body is kept in the condition which is suitable for the necessary work then we are going to show the divinity of of God. Amen. Amen. So it is not something very little if we learn about it. Amen. M so you somebody cannot convince you even if she's a very small baby that you are very dirty you've not b for several days uh you are even you can get some some smell bad smell from you and then you want to convince a baby that I I I am very clean so such things are not bringing the divinity of God so God has has has given us the opportunity so that we can improve the physical call being to develop it. Amen. Continue says the relation of the physical organism the rel physical organism the spiritual life the spiritual life is one of the most important branches of education is one of the most important branches of education. So if there's something that we need to learn and also to teach our children according to the book of Deuteronomy chapter 6 is what? Cleanliness, the purity. One of the branches that God wants us to learn is to keep these bodies, the physical bodies in a condition very suitable for the necessary work. Continue. It should receive careful attention. It should receive the careful attention in the home and in the school. In the home and in the school all need to become acquainted with their physical structure. We need to become acquainted with our physical structure and those that control natural life. Those that control natural life the natural life. Amen. And therefore we uh you just going to read it but uh not now I'm not going to read it here. In the book of Micah chapter 5 and verses 5, we are having the laws of health given there. The eight shepherds and therefore I think we can mention them very fast. Uhhuh. We start with nutrition. No. Please talk to me. Exercise. Exercise. Water. Water. Sunshine. Uhhuh. Sunshine. Air. Rest. Yes. Yes. Trust in God. Uhhuh. There's something that you've passed. Are they eight? They're eight. Cindy dump friends. Are they eight? You and we've not follow them. That that just write new start and you'll have them. So we should have all these things. So anytime that we are not going to meet these doctors every day, we shall see even the physical body not very well. Is that true? miss exercise, miss water, the nutrition if it is bad, rest that we need to have, then even fresh air. Those are the eight doctors that the Lord has given us and in his wisdom he knew that we are going to meet these things and therefore he placed them before we were even created. Amen. Amen. Who was the last to be created? Yes. In God's creation, what was the last thing to be created? And then we entered the servantthood. Man, so man was created after everything had been placed rightly so that when we come we could enjoy it. God loves us so much and then you find somebody saying I cannot do exercise. I cannot go to the fresh air. No, no, no. Today I don't feel like taking a boa. No, no, no. Those are the eight doctors. If you want to be pure, we have to meet the eight doctors every day. And the standard is raised. And the standard is Christ himself. Amen. Amen. And especially this time when Christ is coming back. We are seeing things the way they are happening. We know that Christ very soon is coming back. We should not think that he's turning. Very soon he's coming back. And when he comes back, he tells us that he should find us when we are very ready to meet him in the clouds. Amen. Amen. Uh-huh. You are reading uh c I mean Christ object lesson. It says yes. Yes. He who remains in willing ignorance. Yes. He who remains in willing ignorance. Who is going to remain ignorance of the laws of his physical being of the laws of this physical being and he who violates them Uhhuh. through ignorance Yes. is sinning against God. Yes. We cannot separate physical, mental and spiritual. It is inseparable. It is inseparable. Those things three things cannot be separated. Uh I think God Frey can do this science very fast. Godfrey can you separate vitamins from vegetables? Quickly you tell us how we can do that one. Then we can see how we can separate soul uh mental the brain and also the physical. Can you do quickly go friend? It is separable. We cannot separate. We can never separate. So anyone who is remaining in ignorance of these things, we are told that you are violating the laws of God. And what is sin? Sin is transgression of the law. Sin is violation of the law of God. And therefore God is calling us to be clean. You cannot be clean in your mind if you are dirty on your physical body. I'm not talking about the dirtiness that you go to the garden and then you are you having some soil. No, I've not seen that one. You know what I mean by being dirty? You cannot tell us that you are very clean, the spiritual part of it, but your words which are coming out of your mouth are very unfilting. Amen. That's what I'm coming up with that cleanliness is next to godliness. So we we don't have any option. The only thing that we can do is to uh pull up our socks. There's no way we can separate spiritual and physical. Let's go to the book of No, you have not finished. Go to uh says do two. Yes. All should place themselves in the best possible relation to life. Yes. And health. Uhhuh. Our habits should be brought under the control of our mind. Yes. That is in itself under the control of God. Wait. So the uh our habits should be brought to the control of our mind. means that your mind must be very clear and that's why when we are meeting 5:5 God is telling us that we are I've given you the eight shepherds the seven shepherds and the eight principal men if you want your mind to be clear you have to meet these eight principle men and then if your mind is going to be clear therefore you your physical being is also to be clean to be clean aha Uh, continue. Know ye not? Know ye not, says the apostle Paul. Yes. Your body is the temple of the Holy Ghost. Yes. Which is in you, which you have of God, and you are not your own. Amen. For ye are bought with a price. Therefore, glorify God in your body and your spirit which are gods. Amen. So you you are not your own. Amen. Amen. So you just have to you you have no option. God says that you have to be clean. That is full stop. Period. to him. Amen. Amen. So that is what God wants requires of us. And it is not just body. It is the the spiritual and also the the physical. We must be clean. The standard must be raised. I've not said that some people we are not clean. But I think you are getting what I'm the Lord is speaking to us this evening. Are you getting it? Yeah. Yes. We need to be clean. Just the way you are clean. I'm seeing a lot is very clean here. Look even the shoes and the socks is very clean. is saw coming. And then we are now told what man cannot see in you who which the Lord the only father in heaven can see must also be clean to be reflected out from your physical body. That is 1 Corinthians 6 19- 20. Knowing know ye not that your body is the temple of the living father. You are not your own. You are just given your bodies to take care of them. Some of us who are parents here, even your children are not your own. They are bought at a price. We are bought at a price. So if you are told to come and take care of somebody's I mean uh homestead, are you the owner of that homestead? Are you the owner of that home? You're just taking care and you have to abide by the rules that are in that homestead. Amen. So that is what God has shown us that we have to take care of these bodies. Uh-huh. Move to the book of 1 Corinthians chapter 3 16 and 17. I know they are very familiar books but now God wants us to raise the standard. Uhhuh. 16 17. The Bible says it says Mhm. shall go destroy. Amen. So what God requires of us is holiness. The holiness of our father which are in heaven is what is required of us. And you cannot be holy when you cannot take care of the physical body that you are given. Let's go to the book of child guidance. Child guidance page 106. Page 106. If you're there, please we starting from paragraph one. Just some few lines. I'll tell you. Okay, let me read it from here. God is particular. The Lord commanded the children of Israel to wash their clothes and put away all impurities from their encampment. Lest in passing, lest in passing by he should see their uncleanness. Amen. Amen. And people sleeping or you are busy recording. That is child guardians page 106 and paragraph one. I've just read the first lines there that God is particular. God is not a God of Job. God is not a God of justesting. He has said it and that is the end of it. that it says that the children of Israel where you are staying your encampment must be clean any impurity must not be found within your encampment because when I'm coming to pass I should not see your uncleanliness and I don't think God can pass where things are filthy and unclean uh when you move down there paragraph two towards the end it says uh where it begins the sentence that begins with God has given you the work. Are you there? You can project it. And then Uh-huh. paragraph 2, page 106, paragraph 2 towards the end, just in the middle there. Have you seen it? Ah, can you read it? God has given us a work of educating your children in these lines. Uhhuh. Yes. Amen. So the habit of cleanliness is a spiritual lesson. It is uplifting us to our father which are in heaven. So we don't have shortcut Christians. However much we can read all these things we might know all these through truths and then we don't keep ourselves clean physical spiritual and mental then we are going to miss heaven. We are going to miss the point. So God says that he has given us a work. Imagine you have been given a work those people are employed in whichever way self-employment you have some work to do and then when you go to your work you are just seated do you think the employer will be so much happy with you do you think he will be happy with you will show the cause why even to yourself if you are having some work to do and you just feel that you want to rest you don't want to work you will you shall show the cause why you have not done So God is calling us and he has told us he's not pestering us is commanding us. It is a command that he has given us a work and you cannot teach or train or educate the young ones if you don't have the if you have not prepared for the lessons. Amen. So it means that we have to uplift the standards so that we teach these young ones, the purity, the cleanliness, the orderliness that God wants us to have. Uhhuh. Remember he said he told the Israelites, please in your encampment make sure that everything is in order. Thank you. Just continue page 106 paragraph 4. We read it. It says clean. Yes, it's a British state. Paragraph four. Cleanliness should become second nature. Okay, read it. Okay. And cleanness in the homestead. Yes. Even in babyhood, right direction should be given to the minds and habits of children. Mhm. Show that there are three less in body or objection to God. Yes. Teach them to eat in a clean manner. That these habits may become second nature to them. Mhm. Impunity will be despised as it should. Amen. So God has given us a work and he's telling us that we should uh I mean nature or cleanness is the it becomes the second nature. We we have the first nature. Look at how God created everything. Look at how he has placed everything that he created and in its perfect way we can see that God indeed is a clean God is a holy God. And then he's telling us because we were to we were to take care of this nature that we are given here then we need now to do the work which we were given by our father. And now he's saying that cleanliness the way we are pleasing things be it now man-made or the natural things that we found uh that God had created for us must be in order and must be decently arranged and everything must be done correctly. And he says that this one is now the second nature that we teach our children that uncleanness in the home is a great mistake. How many think that when you go to heaven, we shall find things not orderly arranged there? I don't think we we can have that mind at some corners. You know when you were young, you were told that go and sweep and because you are very tired, you want to go play, you just sweep where people see. Just sweep where people see. But God says must be well done. We have to teach our children if they are given work to clean the house they should move at all the corners so that the house is left clean. They are told to bathe they they bathe well from the hair to the toe. So it is our work. It is our work uh so that we educate them. Oh that how that all will understand that these small duties are not to be neglected. Uh so it is it is a proper uh I mean it is a it is very convenient that we we are given the topic cleanliness. Uh my my colleague was teaching us about health. uh were checking about all these things but remember the diseases here I I heard him saying that diseases is equal to the violation of sin all the all the diseases and majorly the 99% is brought because of our how we eat nutrition it is taking much a bigger percentage so not just we are taking boa we are reformers but how are you taking these fruits are they washed Are they cleaned? So that we avoid the diseases that can be brought by uncleanliness. God says that uncleanliness is not correct in the homestead. Uh-huh. I'm having 7 minutes. Okay, 10 minutes. Uh-huh. We continue. Teach love for cleanliness and hatred of that. I'm in 107 paragraph 2. Teach love for cleanliness and hatred for that. I just want us as God is speaking to us this evening to check wherever we are in our domeies at back at home wherever we are here in the compound if God was talking to the Israelites that make sure that your encampment is clean so that when I come to pass I don't see your uncleanness so let's check wherever you are where you are seated there let us check have we have we reached the standard don't answer God wants us to be clean. So he says that teach love for cleanliness and hatred of dirt. You should cultivate a love for neatness and strict cleanness. If a lawyer is clean, let us not say that a lawyer is very strict. Hey Please mark me right because I know you are also all of us here we are struggling so that we reach the standard which is Christ. She's very clean. We also need to be clean in our hearts. in our mind, in our soul, so that we are we are capable of meeting Christ when he's coming the second time. He's the one who has said it. He says that you should cultivate a love for neatness and strict cleanliness. Cleanliness is not left for the brown people, for the lighted people. Even as dark as I am, I need to be clean. I'm very happy that I am dark. So I I don't want to hide my dirtiness within myself here. We need to be clean both in all aspects, mind, soul and body. Amen. Amen. I we continue. I'm having just around 8 minutes. Dress your children simply and plainly. Let their clothes be made of durable material. Keep them sweet and clean. Amen. Meaning that God that thing is put in us is only that we neglect it because the devil has brought us a lot of things that are not right with our mind. So it means that something is wrong. If the wire, if you are having some short circuited wires, we are not going to have light. Amen. And Jesus says that is the light. Amen. Amen. Good. Uhhuh. Teach them to hate anything like that and really will you teach a child to hate that and any filthy thing. If you can just find will you teach a child? So you give what you have. I'm just concluding. Uhhuh. Go to paragraph uh paragraph I mean 108 paragraph one quickly. Every form it say every form of uncleanness tends to decease. Amen. Leave it there. every form of uncleanliness. Believe that you are unclean in your spirit. You are unclean in your the the brain or the physical. It says that it is it tends to disease. It is tending to decease to the extent that even my teeth is their problem to me. When you sit next to your neighbor, people are just throwing their their noses. Is that happening with us? So that one might be because we have not brushed them well. We are not taking care of them well or we don't know how to brush or something is wrong in the in the stomach that bad breath and who is coming to work it out for you. Jesus has said that we should not neglect this duty. Very important. Look at the the the shoes. Uh we put on our shoes. We are uh we are having the paspiration. Somebody asked about the socks. Socks is helping in that. We are told that we sweat each and every time we do what? We do sweat when we are working. We are sweating. That's why when we put on our clothes and especially the long sleeved and we are having the long crosses, they are absorbed. Uh the sweat is absorbed by that the clothes. Then you remove them, they washed. Isn't it? Is that true? Yeah. Now you are having your so you are having your shoes without socks. You'll just find that it is smelling at a time. I've not said it is very it is sin to put your shoes without socks but it will give you easy time maybe you are at home you can see what you're doing but now when you have you're going to before God please just do it so that it helps you it will it will even control this issue of you remove your shoes and then people start saying ah something bad something bad amen it is very easy easier to wash the socks than to wash the the shoes amen I hope I hope we are all there my time is up. Is it up? Uhhuh. Personal cleanliness essential to health. How many of us here will not want to be healthy? When we was we began with the book of third John verse 2 that I brethren I just need your help both in the soul and also in the the physical. If someone is struggling so much so that we be healthy, what about yourselves? We take upon upon this one so that we be very clean. I want us to conclude with this paragraph. It is important also that the clothing be kept clean. The garments worn absorb the waste. That one I've explained. It is very true. It is in writing. The waste matters that passes off through the pores. If they are not frequently changed and washed, the impurities will be reabsorbed. Question. God in his wisdom, he saw it very wise that we he has given us food to eat. Genesis 1:29. Is that true? Then this one shall be your food. We know the food that God gave us. He know very well that after eating uh after eating and the good food is used in the system, there are some waste that must be removed. Is that true? And he has given us the medium in which the waste products are removed from our our bodies. What are they? First change the mediums where waste products are removed from our bodies. One the skin. Uhhuh. Yes. Kidney the l give us the fourth one. No this class should be balance when you are teachers are just okay. Give us one. The liver. The last one. The the pies. Uhhuh. Which one is the largest amongst the liver? Should it be taken care of? Yes. Should it be taken care of? Amen. Ah, thank you. So God in his wisdom, he knew very well that we are going to uh to to sweat much of the time when we are doing our work. So that skin must be well taken care of. If it is not well taken care of, you are just repeating repeating your clothes. You've uh you've worked with these ones today, tomorrow you repeat them, you repeat them. That is that is very normal with us. Huh? It is very normal. We go to the garden. This one is for the garden. I just keep them. And others are also coming back to sleep with them during the night. We are told that those impurities they going back to the system. They reabsorbed in the system. And what is that is equal to the disease which is equal to the death. We don't want to die like that. And that one alone is not very is not making heavens to be happy. I'm finishing alloy. Read with me paragraph 2 109. It says, I have also seen children's bed. Uhhuh. In such a condition that the fall poisonous order constantly rise from them was to be undurable. Keep everything the eyes of the children rest upon and that comes in contact with the body night or day clean and wholesome. M this will be one means of educating them to choose the cleanly and the pure. Let the sleeping room of your children be neat. However destitute it may be of expensive furniture. Amen. So we are told that we need to anything that the the children are going to lay their eyes on is cleanliness. Nothing less, nothing more. Uh that there are some rooms in our homes whereby when you get into the rooms where children are sleeping, you'll get that bad. God says that is it is not very healthy for the children. I know that there are some children who are still bedwing. Please as a parent you are supposed to take care of the that one. If it is washing every day wash it but you see how these children are helped to stop bedwetting. Maintain a proper balance. Cleanliness and order are Christian duties. May God really help us. I know that uh I was late by 15 minutes but it's okay we have to check time but God says that we have to maintain cleanliness for us to see God we must be clean so that you also uh I mean if we become medical missionaries all of us without making barriers that we we are evangelist these people are medical missionaries please we might we mingle these things so that we take the message you cannot be an evangelist and you are you cannot keep the cleanness. You cannot be a medical missionary but back at home when people are not seeing you, you are very dirty. So the mind must be washed, the soul must be washed and also our physical body must be pure so that we see God when he's coming in his second time in Jesus name we pray. So I think questions uh we shall tackle them in the next lesson. Let us pray. Lord our father in heaven. It is true that cleanliness is a very small topic that we might think so but we found that it entails a lot. We pray that you may forgive us in whichever way we've gone against thy will. And it is a high time that we begin with this small things so that we can reach greater things. It is you who call your disciples that they should be given the power to defeat all the devils. One of the devils which is catching up with us is uncleanliness. May you help us Lord so that we become clean in all aspects are waiting for your second kingdom. Thank you for the session that is passed and all the sessions that had passed in the morning and even the ones which are left. May you lead us through your holy spirit in the name of Jesus I pray. Amen. Thank you.

[17.6s] body is dirty so that the dirt is
[20.2s] removed away and therefore that one is
[22.4s] bringing us to a topic this uh uh this
[25.8s] time uh about cleanliness.
[29.0s] I know it is
[31.2s] something something that we know and uh
[35.4s] it is not something that uh I just need
[37.5s] to define is when you know about
[39.7s] cleanliness but God requires every child
[43.1s] of his to be
[44.7s] clean not just on the physical cleanness
[49.4s] but in all aspects let's move to the
[52.6s] book of uh third John and verse two
[57.1s] third John quickly Okay, because we
[59.1s] behind time. Uh the readers please we do
[62.8s] quickly. Third
[64.7s] John verse two. The Bible says
[70.2s] the Bible
[75.4s] says help.
[79.6s] Yes. Be in health that is the physical
[83.6s] and also your soul to also prosper. So
[87.9s] this uh the the soul mental together
[91.2s] with physical can never be separated. We
[94.4s] can't say that I can just wash my body
[96.6s] that is enough. No, you go deep and then
[99.5s] you are cleansed from within and also
[101.8s] from without. That is the topic that we
[103.9s] want to tackle. Uh so that by the end of
[106.9s] it we remind ourselves I know everyone
[109.0s] here is clean but uh I think it is
[112.7s] brought here. God has written it for us
[115.0s] so that we be admonished each and every
[117.4s] time to improve so that we be clean as
[121.2s] clean as our father in heaven. Let's go
[123.6s] to the book of Matthew chapter 5 and
[125.9s] also verse
[127.4s] 48. Matthew 5 verse 48. The Bible says
[134.0s] yes
[137.0s] may be there to Yes. Father in heaven.
[141.8s] Yeah. We are reminded that we be perfect
[144.2s] even as our father who is at he who is
[147.4s] in heaven is also perfect. I don't think
[150.0s] God is just clean physically. He's clean
[153.0s] in all aspects. I don't think that we
[155.5s] can find any dirt from our living
[157.8s] father. So that is what is required of
[160.0s] us. We are reminded that we need to be
[162.6s] clean and clean in all aspect the soul
[165.9s] mind together with the physical body.
[168.7s] That's what we want to tackle very
[170.3s] quickly and then we shall see how God uh
[174.0s] has planned for us this evening. Thank
[176.5s] you. Uh we are having the book of 1
[179.6s] Corinthians chapter 14 and then verse
[182.0s] 40. Corinthians chapter 14 verse
[187.2s] 40. It reads
[190.6s] no time.
[192.9s] Which book are you reading? 1
[194.2s] Corinthians 14:14.
[196.5s] 14:14.
[198.1s] Verse 14. Yes, sir.
[202.1s] Amen. Let all things be done decently
[205.6s] and in order. So, it means or it is
[208.7s] bringing in our mind that our God is a
[211.2s] God of order. And do you think
[214.2s] cleanliness is in order?
[216.9s] Yes. Do you think cleanliness is in
[218.7s] order? Yes. And that is why God is
[221.1s] reminding us and it is a whole topic
[223.7s] in the child guidance. We are having so
[226.8s] many things about cleanliness. God is
[228.9s] saying that please you Israelites be
[231.0s] very clean as I'm coming to pass there.
[233.5s] I shall find uh your surroundings very
[236.5s] clean so that you can also feel my
[239.7s] presence with thee. Amen. So it is not
[243.0s] just something that we know that we have
[245.8s] we need not to be reminded of. So the
[248.2s] the book of first Corinthians Paul is
[250.6s] saying that everything must be in order
[254.5s] and must be done decently. Amen. Amen.
[258.4s] So that is the voice of the Lord. Uh so
[261.0s] we are having uh what we are calling
[263.1s] cleanliness and that's what we want to
[265.1s] tackle. Book of Matthew 5:8 says that
[268.7s] without being clean, without being pure,
[271.8s] we shall not see God. Amen. And this is
[273.9s] the time that we need to do uh the
[276.7s] reformations. If I'm not clean in one
[279.0s] way or the other, I need to be clean.
[281.8s] Even my words, as Matthew records it, I
[284.6s] I hope you are in the book of five.
[287.0s] Matthew verse 8
[289.7s] says, yes,
[292.6s] blessed are the pure in heart, for they
[295.4s] shall see God. Our ultimate goal, what
[298.9s] has brought us here, what is making us
[301.4s] to adore God is that one time, one day
[304.5s] we shall meet with our father and then
[307.2s] we shall forget about everything, all
[309.5s] the infirmities in this world and then
[311.6s] we shall be very happy. Amen. Amen. I
[313.8s] hope that is what is in you. All of us,
[316.2s] we need to see God and we without being
[319.0s] pure, we cannot see God. that is
[321.4s] recorded in the book of Matthew 5:8 that
[325.1s] those happy them are blessed are them
[327.8s] that are pure for they shall see God. So
[331.5s] it means that if you are not pure, you
[333.4s] cannot see God. How can you be pure in
[337.0s] your heart, in your soul and then you
[339.2s] are not pure in the brain. Is it
[341.4s] possible?
[343.0s] Is it possible? No. No. Just talk to me.
[345.8s] Is it possible? Can you be pure in your
[348.7s] heart? You say that me I love God so
[350.5s] much but you are dirty on the I mean on
[353.7s] your body. You don't care whether you're
[357.1s] going to sleep with the legs with the
[359.4s] legs with mud. You don't care. Do you
[361.4s] think God can be happy with us? No. So
[364.1s] God needs us to be pure. So the purity
[366.0s] that God is talking about here is it is
[368.5s] entire it
[370.0s] is bringing in what we call the soul to
[373.0s] be pure, the mind and also the physical
[375.7s] body. So for somebody to know that this
[378.2s] person is pure or this person is clean,
[381.6s] the human eye, what will people see from
[385.6s] you? Yes. What can people see?
[390.2s] Yes. So that they can
[401.1s] say you talk to
[403.2s] meh. You talk to me. What will people
[405.9s] say? And then they depict that this
[407.6s] person is
[409.6s] clean. Yes. From behind there.
[412.9s] Nvin, you've carried up your hand.
[416.4s] Oh, okay. to maybe to I know that you
[419.7s] know people will look at you the
[421.8s] physical appearance your clothes your
[424.8s] shoes your body itself the way you've
[427.5s] you've kept your hair people shall say
[429.5s] ah this person is a clean person is a
[432.9s] clean man a clean woman or a clean child
[436.1s] so that is not enough God requires much
[438.6s] than that what you beyond what human
[441.1s] beings can see a pure heart uh in this
[445.0s] world people will say that ah Because
[447.3s] Moses Alo is really helping people and
[449.7s] is very genuine. This person I I I must
[452.6s] think that he's very pure before the
[453.9s] eyes of the Lord. But it is only the
[456.4s] Lord who can read the heart, the heart.
[459.0s] And therefore we are told that for us to
[461.4s] be in a condition that we shall see our
[463.6s] God, then we must be pure. The purity
[467.0s] that God wants is all aspects, the mind,
[471.8s] the soul and also our body. uh but today
[475.7s] uh I want us to check uh on how we can
[478.9s] take care of our bodies on how we can
[481.8s] take care of our bodies. There are a lot
[483.6s] of questions which were asked when you
[485.0s] are having uh this the second lesson in
[488.5s] the morning
[490.3s] uh that was uh
[493.9s] modesty. Somebody asked a lot of
[495.9s] question some we asked a lot of
[497.8s] questions but then we shall see how we
[500.6s] answer some of these questions. Okay.
[503.8s] nature. Uh when we are doing doing the
[506.3s] book of uh I mean we are having the
[508.3s] Bible, we are told more about nature and
[512.0s] God in his cleverness, he he used nature
[516.3s] to teach us more of these things. Uh
[520.2s] just check
[521.6s] nature. Just check nature. Nature is
[525.1s] some all these things that God created.
[527.6s] It is not man-made. Anything that God
[530.6s] created we can term is that as nature
[533.1s] something that natural we find them in
[536.2s] all our surroundings. Look at the
[538.9s] trees look at the I mean the plants the
[542.2s] animals your surroundings even human
[545.2s] beings we shall we are going to find
[548.1s] that all these things that God created
[551.0s] they are clean. Is that true? Is that
[554.8s] true? And that is not enough. God made
[558.0s] Adam to be in the garden of Ed. What was
[560.9s] the work given to
[563.3s] Adam? Yes. To take care of the
[567.7s] environment. Taking care of the that
[569.6s] garden so that he ensures that where he
[573.0s] is is
[574.2s] clean and that cleanness will keep Adam
[578.9s] pure. We have talked about the mind, the
[581.9s] I mean the soul, the mind and also the
[584.0s] the physical. So God did not want to see
[586.7s] things which are not uh well arranged.
[589.8s] Everything was to be kept pure, kept
[593.1s] clean. And that is what is God what that
[595.8s] is what God is calling us to be today.
[599.1s] God is clean. There's no question about
[601.6s] that one. God is pure. So he needs pure
[604.5s] people by the end of this journey to do
[607.4s] what? To be victors together with
[610.0s] Christ. So nature we seeing animals the
[612.9s] way God had created them. It is only by
[615.4s] our sin that we are making them to
[618.2s] violate the nature or violate the laws
[621.2s] of of God. So we finding that uh as God
[626.2s] made Adam to be or gave them the garden
[628.8s] of Eden, he was the first teacher. He
[631.9s] was the instructor. He gave them the
[634.3s] work to do. The very first work that he
[636.6s] gave them was to take care of their
[638.7s] garden. And then we are finding nature.
[642.1s] What was nature to Adam and Eve?
[645.6s] That was a lesson book. Do you think it
[648.1s] ceases to be a lesson book uh to Adam
[650.6s] and Eve at their time? Is it can it be a
[653.6s] lesson book to us today? Yes. Nature is
[657.1s] our lesson book. So look at nature. It's
[660.6s] a very big book. We need to learn about
[663.0s] it and then God is going to be happy if
[665.5s] we going we are ready to learn of
[667.8s] nature. Then we are having uh the garden
[671.2s] of Eden being the
[673.2s] what? No, I just want us to talk. Uhhuh.
[677.0s] That is the
[678.8s] classroom. So God in his in his wisdom,
[683.0s] he knew that these things will help us
[685.2s] to the end of the age.
[690.2s] So we are also called upon today to
[693.0s] learn from nature as our
[696.8s] lesson lesson book and then we are put
[700.6s] here to call other people who are who
[703.5s] have violated the law together with us
[705.9s] to improve. What I just want you to
[708.2s] check today is clean and know that we
[710.3s] are all clean. It is not that we are not
[712.9s] clean but we are all clean but then God
[715.2s] needs us to improve on the
[718.4s] cleanness in all aspects so that we are
[722.0s] able to see him when he's coming the
[725.0s] second time. Uh let's go to the book of
[727.7s] uh Christ object lesson quickly. Uh if
[731.0s] you are there page
[733.1s] 348 paragraph one we are going to do
[735.7s] paragraph one and paragraph two.
[740.2s] The Bible says
[742.6s] all should have human.
[748.0s] Yes. All should have an intelligent
[750.2s] knowledge. All is it some all should
[754.3s] have is is God talking through sister
[757.5s] white to
[759.3s] animals. Do you think he's talking to
[761.4s] animals here that all cows and elephants
[764.2s] should
[765.2s] have do you think he's going to is
[767.7s] talking to animals? He's talking to us.
[770.4s] Yes. Continue. All should have an
[773.8s] intelligent knowledge. Yes. Of the human
[776.2s] frame. Mhm. that they may keep their
[778.4s] bodies in condition necessary to do the
[780.2s] work of the lord that we should keep our
[783.3s] bodies in a condition for the necessary
[786.7s] work. So it means that there are some
[788.5s] work which are not necessary but there
[791.0s] there work which god approves to be
[793.2s] necessary and therefore it is not Jesus
[795.7s] who shall come down to make this body in
[798.0s] a better condition to do the necessary
[801.1s] work that God has given us. Yes.
[803.0s] Continue. It says it says the physical
[805.6s] life the physical life is to be
[807.8s] carefully preserved is to be carefully
[810.6s] preserved. Not
[812.8s] carelessly should be carefully
[815.5s] preserved. preserved
[817.9s] and developed that through humanity and
[821.0s] developed developed that through
[823.2s] humanity yes divine nature may be
[825.4s] revealed in its fullness. Just stop
[827.4s] there. that when we are clean when the
[831.1s] physical body is kept in the condition
[833.5s] which is suitable for the necessary work
[836.4s] then we are going to show the divinity
[839.9s] of of God. Amen. Amen. So it is not
[843.2s] something very little if we learn about
[845.6s] it. Amen. M so you somebody cannot
[849.4s] convince you even if she's a very small
[852.1s] baby that you are very dirty you've not
[855.6s] b for several days uh you are even you
[859.8s] can get some some smell bad smell from
[862.2s] you and then you want to convince a baby
[863.9s] that I I I am very clean so such things
[867.0s] are not bringing the divinity of God so
[869.8s] God has has has given us the opportunity
[872.9s] so that we can improve the physical call
[876.9s] being to develop it. Amen. Continue says
[881.4s] the relation of the physical organism
[883.5s] the rel physical organism the spiritual
[886.4s] life the spiritual life is one of the
[888.6s] most important branches of education is
[891.0s] one of the most important branches of
[894.5s] education. So if there's something that
[896.3s] we need to learn and also to teach our
[900.2s] children according to the book of
[901.8s] Deuteronomy chapter 6 is what?
[905.4s] Cleanliness, the
[908.6s] purity. One of the branches that God
[911.2s] wants us to learn is to keep these
[913.8s] bodies, the physical bodies in a
[916.2s] condition very suitable for the
[919.0s] necessary work. Continue.
[922.1s] It should receive careful attention. It
[924.6s] should receive the careful attention in
[928.2s] the home and in the school. In the home
[929.8s] and in the school all need to become
[931.6s] acquainted with their physical
[933.1s] structure.
[934.9s] We need to become acquainted with our
[937.4s] physical structure and those that
[939.6s] control natural life. Those that control
[942.6s] natural life the natural life. Amen. And
[945.4s] therefore we uh you just going to read
[947.8s] it but uh not now I'm not going to read
[950.1s] it here. In the book of Micah chapter 5
[952.1s] and verses 5, we are having the laws of
[954.7s] health given there. The eight shepherds
[957.3s] and therefore I think we can mention
[958.9s] them very fast. Uhhuh. We start with
[961.8s] nutrition.
[963.3s] No. Please talk to me. Exercise.
[966.2s] Exercise. Water. Water.
[969.6s] Sunshine.
[971.5s] Uhhuh. Sunshine.
[978.0s] Air. Rest.
[982.6s] Yes.
[984.6s] Yes. Trust in God. Uhhuh. There's
[987.8s] something that you've passed. Are they
[989.5s] eight? They're eight. Cindy dump
[992.0s] friends. Are they eight? You and we've
[993.8s] not follow them. That that just write
[995.3s] new start and you'll have them. So we
[997.4s] should have all these things. So anytime
[999.3s] that we are not going to meet these
[1000.8s] doctors every day, we shall see even the
[1004.6s] physical body not very well. Is that
[1007.2s] true? miss
[1009.3s] exercise, miss water, the nutrition if
[1013.1s] it is bad, rest that we need to have,
[1016.7s] then even fresh air. Those are the eight
[1019.5s] doctors that the Lord has given us and
[1021.6s] in his wisdom he knew that we are going
[1024.8s] to meet these things and therefore he
[1026.5s] placed them before we were even created.
[1029.3s] Amen. Amen. Who was the last to be
[1032.6s] created? Yes. In God's creation, what
[1036.2s] was the last thing to be created? And
[1037.7s] then we entered the servantthood. Man,
[1039.8s] so man was created after everything had
[1042.2s] been placed rightly so that when we come
[1045.0s] we could enjoy it. God loves us so much
[1048.3s] and then you find somebody saying I
[1050.1s] cannot do exercise. I cannot go to the
[1052.9s] fresh air. No, no, no. Today I don't
[1055.7s] feel like taking a boa. No, no, no.
[1058.5s] Those are the eight doctors. If you want
[1060.2s] to be pure, we have to meet the eight
[1062.2s] doctors every day. And the standard is
[1065.6s] raised. And the standard is Christ
[1067.9s] himself. Amen. Amen. And especially this
[1070.4s] time when Christ is coming back. We are
[1072.8s] seeing things the way they are
[1074.2s] happening. We know that Christ very soon
[1076.3s] is coming back. We should not think that
[1079.8s] he's turning. Very soon he's coming
[1082.0s] back. And when he comes back, he tells
[1084.8s] us that he should find us when we are
[1086.6s] very ready to meet him in the clouds.
[1088.8s] Amen. Amen. Uh-huh. You are reading uh c
[1092.0s] I mean Christ object lesson. It says
[1094.4s] yes. Yes. He who remains in willing
[1096.0s] ignorance. Yes. He who remains in
[1098.4s] willing ignorance. Who is going to
[1100.4s] remain ignorance of the laws of his
[1103.1s] physical being of the laws of this
[1105.4s] physical being and he who violates them
[1108.2s] Uhhuh. through ignorance Yes. is sinning
[1110.6s] against God. Yes. We cannot separate
[1114.2s] physical, mental and spiritual. It is
[1118.4s] inseparable. It is inseparable. Those
[1121.6s] things three things cannot be separated.
[1124.7s] Uh I think God Frey can do this science
[1126.8s] very fast. Godfrey can you separate
[1129.9s] vitamins from vegetables? Quickly you
[1131.8s] tell us how we can do that one. Then we
[1133.3s] can see how we can separate soul uh
[1136.8s] mental the brain and also the physical.
[1139.0s] Can you do quickly go friend? It is
[1141.4s] separable. We cannot separate. We can
[1144.0s] never separate. So anyone who is
[1146.6s] remaining in ignorance of these things,
[1149.9s] we are told that you are violating the
[1151.8s] laws of God. And what is sin? Sin is
[1155.9s] transgression of the law. Sin is
[1157.7s] violation of the law of God. And
[1160.6s] therefore God is calling us to be clean.
[1163.7s] You cannot be clean in your mind if you
[1166.3s] are dirty on your physical body. I'm not
[1169.7s] talking about the dirtiness that you go
[1171.2s] to the garden and then you are you
[1173.4s] having some soil. No, I've not seen that
[1176.2s] one. You know what I mean by being
[1177.4s] dirty? You cannot tell us that you are
[1179.4s] very clean, the spiritual part of it,
[1181.6s] but your words which are coming out of
[1183.8s] your mouth are very unfilting. Amen.
[1187.0s] That's what I'm coming up with that
[1189.2s] cleanliness is next to godliness. So we
[1193.5s] we don't have any option. The only thing
[1196.4s] that we can do is to uh pull up our
[1199.9s] socks. There's no way we can separate
[1203.3s] spiritual and physical. Let's go to the
[1206.8s] book of No, you have not finished. Go to
[1209.3s] uh says do two. Yes. All should place
[1211.8s] themselves in the best possible relation
[1213.7s] to life. Yes. And health. Uhhuh. Our
[1216.2s] habits should be brought under the
[1217.8s] control of our mind. Yes. That is in
[1219.7s] itself under the control of God. Wait.
[1222.2s] So the uh our habits should be brought
[1226.9s] to the control of our mind. means that
[1229.7s] your mind must be very clear and that's
[1232.2s] why when we are
[1233.7s] meeting 5:5 God is telling us that we
[1237.4s] are I've given you the eight
[1240.2s] shepherds the seven shepherds and the
[1242.6s] eight principal men if you want your
[1246.1s] mind to be clear you have to meet these
[1248.1s] eight principle men and then if your
[1250.9s] mind is going to be clear therefore you
[1253.5s] your physical being is also to be clean
[1256.6s] to be clean aha Uh, continue.
[1260.5s] Know ye not? Know ye not, says the
[1262.8s] apostle Paul. Yes. Your body is the
[1265.0s] temple of the Holy Ghost. Yes. Which is
[1266.9s] in you, which you have of God, and you
[1269.8s] are not your own. Amen. For ye are
[1271.8s] bought with a price. Therefore, glorify
[1273.9s] God in your body and your spirit which
[1276.0s] are gods. Amen. So you you are not your
[1279.2s] own. Amen. Amen. So you just have to you
[1282.5s] you have no option. God says that you
[1285.0s] have to be clean. That is full stop.
[1287.0s] Period. to him. Amen. Amen. So that is
[1289.8s] what God wants requires of us. And it is
[1292.0s] not just body. It is the the spiritual
[1295.8s] and also the the physical. We must be
[1298.7s] clean. The standard must be raised. I've
[1302.0s] not said that some people we are not
[1303.8s] clean. But I think you are getting what
[1305.9s] I'm the Lord is speaking to us this
[1308.2s] evening. Are you getting it? Yeah. Yes.
[1310.5s] We need to be clean. Just the way you
[1312.0s] are clean. I'm seeing a lot is very
[1313.4s] clean here. Look even the shoes and the
[1315.7s] socks is very clean. is saw coming. And
[1319.0s] then we are now told what man cannot see
[1321.8s] in you who which the Lord the only
[1324.7s] father in heaven can see must also be
[1327.1s] clean to be reflected out from your
[1330.5s] physical body. That is 1 Corinthians 6
[1334.4s] 19- 20. Knowing know ye not that your
[1338.5s] body is the temple of the living father.
[1342.8s] You are not your own. You are just given
[1345.4s] your bodies to take care of them. Some
[1348.1s] of us who are parents here, even your
[1350.0s] children are not your own. They are
[1353.7s] bought at a price. We are bought at a
[1356.6s] price. So if you are told to come and
[1359.5s] take care of somebody's I mean uh
[1362.6s] homestead, are you the owner of that
[1364.7s] homestead? Are you the owner of that
[1366.6s] home? You're just taking care and you
[1369.4s] have to abide by the rules that are in
[1372.6s] that homestead. Amen. So that is what
[1375.0s] God has shown us that we have to take
[1377.3s] care of these bodies. Uh-huh. Move to
[1379.9s] the book of 1 Corinthians chapter 3 16
[1382.4s] and 17. I know they are very familiar
[1385.4s] books but now God wants us to raise the
[1387.8s] standard. Uhhuh. 16 17. The Bible says
[1396.5s] it
[1401.5s] says Mhm.
[1405.8s] shall go destroy. Amen.
[1412.2s] So what God requires of us is
[1415.7s] holiness. The holiness of our father
[1418.6s] which are in heaven is what is required
[1420.5s] of us. And you cannot be holy when you
[1424.4s] cannot take care of the physical body
[1427.0s] that you are given.
[1431.4s] Let's go to the book of child guidance.
[1434.0s] Child guidance page 106. Page
[1438.0s] 106. If you're there, please we
[1441.3s] starting from paragraph one. Just some
[1444.2s] few lines. I'll tell you. Okay, let me
[1446.8s] read it from here. God is particular.
[1449.6s] The Lord commanded the children of
[1451.0s] Israel to wash their clothes and put
[1453.2s] away all impurities from their
[1455.8s] encampment. Lest in passing, lest in
[1459.0s] passing by he should see their
[1461.2s] uncleanness.
[1462.8s] Amen. Amen. And people sleeping or you
[1467.0s] are busy recording. That is child
[1468.5s] guardians page 106 and paragraph one.
[1470.7s] I've just read the first lines there
[1472.8s] that God is particular. God is not a God
[1476.2s] of Job. God is not a God of justesting.
[1479.1s] He has said it and that is the end of
[1481.6s] it. that it says that the children of
[1484.1s] Israel where you are staying your
[1487.0s] encampment must be clean any impurity
[1491.3s] must not be found within your encampment
[1494.4s] because when I'm coming to pass I should
[1497.2s] not see your
[1499.2s] uncleanliness and I don't think God can
[1501.2s] pass where things are filthy and unclean
[1504.3s] uh when you move down there paragraph
[1506.4s] two towards the end it says uh where it
[1509.8s] begins the sentence that begins with God
[1511.6s] has given you the work. Are you there?
[1515.2s] You can project it. And then Uh-huh.
[1518.2s] paragraph 2, page 106, paragraph 2
[1521.1s] towards the end, just in the middle
[1523.0s] there. Have you seen it? Ah, can you
[1524.7s] read it?
[1526.8s] God has given us a
[1528.6s] work of educating your children in these
[1533.1s] lines.
[1534.9s] Uhhuh. Yes.
[1537.6s] Amen. So the habit of cleanliness is a
[1541.4s] spiritual lesson. It is uplifting us to
[1545.4s] our father which are in heaven. So we
[1548.6s] don't have shortcut Christians. However
[1551.4s] much we can read all these things we
[1553.0s] might know all these through truths and
[1555.0s] then we don't keep ourselves
[1557.5s] clean physical spiritual and mental then
[1561.4s] we are going to miss heaven. We are
[1563.2s] going to miss the point. So God says
[1564.9s] that he has given us a work. Imagine you
[1567.2s] have been given a work those people are
[1569.0s] employed in whichever way
[1570.4s] self-employment you have some work to do
[1573.0s] and then when you go to your work you
[1574.9s] are just seated do you think the
[1577.2s] employer will be so much happy with you
[1580.0s] do you think he will be happy with
[1582.0s] you will show the cause why even to
[1585.8s] yourself if you are having some work to
[1587.8s] do and you just feel that you want to
[1589.7s] rest you don't want to work you will you
[1591.8s] shall show the
[1593.6s] cause why you have not done So God is
[1597.2s] calling us and he has told us he's not
[1599.6s] pestering us is commanding us. It is a
[1601.8s] command that he has given us a work and
[1605.4s] you cannot teach or train or educate the
[1608.6s] young ones if you don't have the if you
[1611.7s] have not prepared for the lessons. Amen.
[1613.8s] So it means that we have to uplift the
[1616.9s] standards so that we teach these young
[1619.4s] ones, the purity, the cleanliness, the
[1623.4s] orderliness that God wants us to have.
[1626.6s] Uhhuh. Remember he said he told the
[1629.0s] Israelites, please in your encampment
[1631.5s] make sure that everything is in order.
[1634.6s] Thank you. Just continue page 106
[1637.2s] paragraph 4. We read it. It says clean.
[1642.1s] Yes, it's a British state. Paragraph
[1644.8s] four. Cleanliness should become second
[1647.8s] nature.
[1650.2s] Okay, read it.
[1654.1s] Okay. And cleanness in the homestead.
[1658.0s] Yes.
[1663.0s] Even in babyhood, right direction should
[1665.8s] be given to the minds and habits of
[1667.4s] children. Mhm. Show that there are three
[1669.4s] less in body or objection to God. Yes.
[1674.0s] Teach them to eat in a clean manner.
[1678.5s] That these habits may become second
[1680.1s] nature to them. Mhm. Impunity will be
[1682.2s] despised as it should. Amen. So God has
[1685.4s] given us a work and he's telling us that
[1687.8s] we should uh I mean nature or cleanness
[1691.7s] is the it becomes the second nature. We
[1694.9s] we have the first nature. Look at how
[1696.6s] God created everything. Look at how he
[1698.9s] has placed everything that he created
[1701.6s] and in its perfect way we can see that
[1704.7s] God indeed is a clean God is a holy God.
[1708.8s] And then he's telling us because we were
[1710.6s] to we were to take care of this nature
[1712.4s] that we are given here then we need now
[1715.6s] to do the work which we were given by
[1718.2s] our father. And now he's saying that
[1720.6s] cleanliness the way we are pleasing
[1722.9s] things be it now man-made or the natural
[1725.5s] things that we found uh that God had
[1727.9s] created for us must be in order and must
[1731.4s] be decently arranged and everything must
[1734.3s] be done correctly. And he says that this
[1736.7s] one is now the second nature that we
[1739.4s] teach our children that uncleanness in
[1741.9s] the home is a great mistake.
[1746.6s] How many think that when you go to
[1748.6s] heaven, we shall find things not orderly
[1751.0s] arranged
[1752.7s] there? I don't think we we can have that
[1761.7s] mind at some corners. You know when you
[1764.7s] were young, you were told that go and
[1766.2s] sweep and because you are very tired,
[1767.5s] you want to go play, you just sweep
[1769.8s] where people see. Just sweep where
[1771.7s] people see. But God says must be well
[1775.2s] done. We have to teach our children if
[1777.4s] they are given work to clean the house
[1781.0s] they should move at all the corners so
[1783.7s] that the house is left clean. They are
[1785.6s] told to bathe they they bathe well from
[1788.7s] the hair to the toe. So it is our work.
[1792.4s] It is our work uh so that we educate
[1795.4s] them. Oh that how that all will
[1799.4s] understand that these small duties are
[1801.6s] not to be
[1803.6s] neglected. Uh so it is it is a proper uh
[1807.3s] I mean it is a it is very convenient
[1809.3s] that we we are given the topic
[1811.8s] cleanliness. Uh my my colleague was
[1815.2s] teaching us about health. uh were
[1817.9s] checking about all these things but
[1819.4s] remember the diseases here I I heard him
[1822.2s] saying that diseases is equal to the
[1825.7s] violation of sin all the all the
[1828.8s] diseases and majorly the
[1831.6s] 99% is brought because of our how we eat
[1836.3s] nutrition it is taking much a bigger
[1839.2s] percentage so not just we are taking boa
[1842.2s] we are reformers but how are you taking
[1844.4s] these fruits are they washed
[1847.8s] Are they
[1849.2s] cleaned? So that we avoid the diseases
[1852.0s] that can be brought by uncleanliness.
[1854.4s] God says that uncleanliness is not
[1857.3s] correct in the homestead. Uh-huh. I'm
[1860.5s] having 7 minutes. Okay, 10 minutes.
[1863.1s] Uh-huh. We continue. Teach love for
[1865.9s] cleanliness and hatred of that. I'm in
[1869.2s] 107 paragraph 2. Teach love for
[1872.4s] cleanliness and hatred for that. I just
[1875.7s] want us as God is speaking to us this
[1877.6s] evening to check wherever we are in our
[1880.6s] domeies at back at home wherever we are
[1883.3s] here in the compound if God was talking
[1886.4s] to the Israelites that make sure that
[1888.2s] your encampment is clean so that when I
[1891.2s] come to pass I don't see your
[1895.0s] uncleanness so let's check wherever you
[1898.2s] are where you are seated there let us
[1900.7s] check have we have we reached the
[1902.6s] standard don't answer God wants us to be
[1906.5s] clean. So he says that teach love for
[1909.0s] cleanliness and hatred of dirt. You
[1912.6s] should cultivate a love for neatness and
[1915.6s] strict cleanness. If a lawyer is clean,
[1920.1s] let us not say that a lawyer is very
[1922.3s] strict. Hey
[1940.6s] Please mark me
[1946.2s] right because I know you are also all of
[1949.1s] us here we are struggling so that we
[1951.5s] reach the standard which is Christ.
[1966.6s] She's very
[1982.5s] clean. We also need to be clean in our
[1985.8s] hearts.
[1987.3s] in our mind, in our soul, so that we are
[1991.3s] we are capable of meeting Christ when
[1993.4s] he's coming the second time. He's the
[1994.8s] one who has said it. He says that you
[1997.3s] should cultivate a love for neatness and
[2000.1s] strict cleanliness. Cleanliness is not
[2003.0s] left for the brown people, for the
[2005.2s] lighted people. Even as dark as I am, I
[2008.9s] need to be clean. I'm very happy that I
[2011.4s] am dark. So I I don't want to hide my
[2014.0s] dirtiness within myself here. We need to
[2016.5s] be clean both in all aspects, mind,
[2022.0s] soul and body. Amen. Amen. I we
[2026.3s] continue. I'm having just around 8
[2028.4s] minutes. Dress your children simply and
[2031.0s] plainly. Let their clothes be made of
[2033.7s] durable material. Keep them sweet and
[2036.6s] clean.
[2057.5s] Amen. Meaning that God that thing is put
[2060.6s] in us is only that we neglect it because
[2063.1s] the devil has brought us a lot of things
[2066.0s] that are not right with our mind. So it
[2068.7s] means that something is wrong. If the
[2070.7s] wire, if you are having some short
[2072.9s] circuited wires, we are not going to
[2075.0s] have light. Amen. And Jesus says that is
[2077.0s] the light. Amen. Amen. Good. Uhhuh.
[2080.3s] Teach them to hate anything like that
[2083.8s] and really will you teach a child to
[2087.1s] hate that and any filthy thing. If you
[2091.8s] can just
[2098.8s] find will you teach a
[2101.6s] child? So you give what you have. I'm
[2104.6s] just concluding. Uhhuh. Go to paragraph
[2108.4s] uh paragraph I mean 108 paragraph one
[2111.0s] quickly. Every form it say every form of
[2113.5s] uncleanness tends to decease. Amen.
[2115.9s] Leave it there. every form of
[2118.6s] uncleanliness. Believe that you are
[2120.4s] unclean in your
[2121.8s] spirit. You are unclean in your the the
[2125.1s] brain or the physical. It says that it
[2129.1s] is it tends to disease. It is tending to
[2142.0s] decease to the extent that even my teeth
[2145.1s] is their problem to me. When you sit
[2148.5s] next to your
[2150.3s] neighbor, people are just throwing their
[2153.0s] their
[2154.4s] noses. Is that happening with us?
[2157.8s] So that one might be because we have not
[2160.0s] brushed them well. We are not taking
[2161.8s] care of them well or we don't know how
[2164.5s] to brush or something is wrong in the in
[2167.4s] the stomach that bad breath and who is
[2171.0s] coming to work it out for you. Jesus has
[2174.1s] said that we should not neglect this
[2176.3s] duty. Very important. Look at the the
[2179.4s] the shoes. Uh we put on our shoes. We
[2182.5s] are uh we are having the paspiration.
[2185.0s] Somebody asked about the socks. Socks is
[2187.3s] helping in that. We are told that we
[2189.8s] sweat each and every time we do what? We
[2192.0s] do sweat when we are working. We are
[2193.5s] sweating. That's why when we put on our
[2195.5s] clothes and especially the long sleeved
[2197.4s] and we are having the long crosses, they
[2199.3s] are
[2200.4s] absorbed. Uh the sweat is absorbed by
[2203.3s] that the clothes. Then you remove them,
[2205.6s] they washed. Isn't it? Is that true?
[2209.0s] Yeah. Now you are having your so you are
[2211.5s] having your shoes without socks. You'll
[2214.3s] just find that it is smelling at a time.
[2216.8s] I've not said it is very it is sin to
[2218.9s] put your shoes without socks but it will
[2221.3s] give you easy time maybe you are at home
[2223.5s] you can see what you're doing but now
[2225.0s] when you have you're going to before God
[2227.2s] please just do it so that it helps you
[2230.2s] it will it will even control this issue
[2232.5s] of you remove your shoes and then people
[2234.4s] start saying ah something bad something
[2236.3s] bad amen it is very easy easier to wash
[2239.4s] the socks than to wash the the shoes
[2242.1s] amen I hope I hope we are all there my
[2244.9s] time is up. Is it up? Uhhuh. Personal
[2248.1s] cleanliness essential to health. How
[2251.0s] many of us here will not want to be
[2252.7s] healthy? When we was we began with the
[2255.3s] book of third John verse 2 that I
[2259.8s] brethren I just need your help both in
[2263.1s] the soul and also in the the physical.
[2265.6s] If someone is struggling so much so that
[2267.5s] we be healthy, what about yourselves? We
[2270.6s] take upon upon this one so that we be
[2273.0s] very clean. I want us to conclude with
[2275.5s] this paragraph. It is important also
[2278.8s] that the clothing be kept clean. The
[2281.4s] garments worn absorb the waste. That one
[2283.8s] I've explained. It is very true. It is
[2285.5s] in writing. The waste matters that
[2288.0s] passes off through the pores. If they
[2291.4s] are not frequently changed and washed,
[2294.9s] the impurities will be reabsorbed.
[2297.9s] Question.
[2299.6s] God in his wisdom, he saw it very wise
[2302.6s] that we he has given us food to eat.
[2305.1s] Genesis 1:29. Is that true? Then this
[2308.0s] one shall be your food. We know the food
[2309.4s] that God gave us. He know very well that
[2311.8s] after eating uh after eating and the
[2314.6s] good food is used in the system, there
[2316.8s] are some waste that must be removed. Is
[2318.4s] that true? And he has given us the
[2321.2s] medium in which the waste products are
[2323.0s] removed from our our bodies. What are
[2325.7s] they? First
[2329.3s] change the mediums where waste products
[2332.6s] are removed from our bodies. One the
[2335.2s] skin. Uhhuh. Yes.
[2338.6s] Kidney
[2342.2s] the
[2343.6s] l give us the fourth
[2346.1s] one. No this class should be balance
[2348.6s] when you are
[2350.0s] teachers are just okay. Give us one. The
[2353.8s] liver. The last
[2356.4s] one. The the pies. Uhhuh. Which one is
[2360.8s] the largest amongst the liver?
[2364.9s] Should it be taken care of? Yes. Should
[2367.4s] it be taken care of? Amen. Ah, thank
[2370.0s] you. So God in his wisdom, he knew very
[2372.5s] well that we are going to uh to to sweat
[2376.9s] much of the time when we are doing our
[2378.5s] work. So that skin must be well taken
[2380.6s] care of. If it is not well taken care
[2383.0s] of, you are just repeating repeating
[2385.0s] your clothes. You've uh you've worked
[2386.8s] with these ones today, tomorrow you
[2388.4s] repeat them, you repeat them. That is
[2390.4s] that is very normal with us. Huh? It is
[2392.7s] very normal. We go to the garden. This
[2394.3s] one is for the garden. I just keep them.
[2396.4s] And others are also coming back to sleep
[2398.4s] with them during the night. We are told
[2400.3s] that those impurities they going back to
[2402.6s] the system. They reabsorbed in the
[2405.0s] system. And what is that is equal to the
[2407.8s] disease which is equal to the death. We
[2410.2s] don't want to die like that. And that
[2411.8s] one alone is not very is not making
[2415.0s] heavens to be happy. I'm finishing
[2416.7s] alloy. Read with me paragraph 2 109. It
[2420.6s] says, I have also seen children's bed.
[2423.4s] Uhhuh. In such a condition that the fall
[2426.1s] poisonous order constantly rise from
[2428.2s] them was to be undurable.
[2431.5s] Keep everything the eyes of the children
[2433.4s] rest upon and that comes in contact with
[2436.1s] the body night or day clean and
[2438.5s] wholesome. M this will be one means of
[2440.7s] educating them to choose the cleanly and
[2443.3s] the pure. Let the sleeping room of your
[2445.8s] children be neat. However destitute it
[2448.1s] may be of expensive furniture. Amen. So
[2451.3s] we are told that we need to anything
[2453.5s] that the the children are going to lay
[2455.3s] their eyes on is cleanliness. Nothing
[2457.4s] less, nothing more. Uh that there are
[2459.8s] some rooms in our homes whereby when you
[2462.7s] get into the rooms where children are
[2464.3s] sleeping, you'll get that bad. God says
[2468.2s] that is it is not very healthy for the
[2470.3s] children. I know that there are some
[2471.5s] children who are still bedwing. Please
[2474.2s] as a parent you are supposed to take
[2476.2s] care of the that one. If it is washing
[2478.6s] every day wash it but you see how these
[2480.9s] children are helped to stop bedwetting.
[2483.8s] Maintain a proper balance. Cleanliness
[2486.4s] and order are Christian duties. May God
[2490.7s] really help us. I know that uh I was
[2495.0s] late by 15 minutes but it's okay we have
[2497.7s] to check time but God says that we have
[2499.9s] to maintain cleanliness for us to see
[2502.3s] God we must be clean so that you also uh
[2506.5s] I mean if we become medical missionaries
[2508.8s] all of us without making barriers that
[2510.7s] we we are evangelist these people are
[2513.0s] medical missionaries please we might we
[2515.4s] mingle these things so that we take the
[2518.2s] message you cannot be an evangelist and
[2520.6s] you are you cannot keep the cleanness.
[2523.4s] You cannot be a medical missionary but
[2525.5s] back at home when people are not seeing
[2527.4s] you, you are very dirty. So the mind
[2529.9s] must be washed, the soul must be washed
[2532.5s] and also our physical body must be pure
[2534.9s] so that we see God when he's coming in
[2537.2s] his second time in Jesus name we pray.
[2540.6s] So I think questions uh we shall tackle
[2543.8s] them in the next lesson. Let us pray.
[2558.9s] Lord our father in
[2561.2s] heaven. It is true that cleanliness is a
[2565.1s] very small topic that we might think
[2569.3s] so but we found that it entails a
[2572.8s] lot. We pray that you may forgive us in
[2575.8s] whichever way we've gone against thy
[2577.6s] will. And it is a high time that we
[2580.6s] begin with this small things so that we
[2582.3s] can reach greater
[2583.7s] things. It is you who call your
[2587.8s] disciples that they should be given the
[2591.2s] power to defeat all the
[2593.4s] devils. One of the devils which is
[2595.7s] catching up with us is
[2597.9s] uncleanliness. May you help us Lord so
[2601.2s] that we become clean in all aspects are
[2604.2s] waiting for your second kingdom. Thank
[2606.9s] you for the session that is passed and
[2609.4s] all the sessions that had passed in the
[2611.0s] morning and even the ones which are
[2612.8s] left. May you lead us through your holy
[2614.7s] spirit in the name of Jesus I pray.
[2617.1s] Amen.
[2619.8s] Thank you.
