You know I've been working with my fellow young evangelist. we've been having with ministers.

Amen. And if you is what a son to your brother or sister like I have here that is my nephew. So I thank God the gospel people had relatives. Why didn't you say amen? Now we're seeing Byron here has got his brother young. Okay, thank you brother sister. That is the eldest in the family. Then Byron the second. Then Godfrey the third. Then the fourth Fourth word. Do you know the one who preached to them? The second born who took the message preached to God. And then the last one. Hallelujah. You don't even have any plan. Praise God. Check with me. The Bible [Music] says salute you to my fellow captive and Marus the nephew of Barnabas. So who was Marus the nephew? So Barnabas was a man who encourages I hope you know what Barnabas used to do. He even took the the the son to the what they either sister or a brother there and they were with him in the ministry. Why don't you say amended as a family you know I was in kissing during revival week of prayer and I found I was so much happy with elder ke all the sisters even the ones who are old walks like this I want to go and be he took the message to all the sisters and I loved that and I was so much challenged that what are my sisters can they also be with us. Some of us are here do not think of their brothers and sisters. They preach to people's brothers. They preach to people's mothers but they don't think that their mothers also need to be one true God believers. Amen. Barnabas knew that that is a work that must be done even to the relatives. And some of us think that this message is only meant for you. You don't even share that word. You give people papers but you don't remember your brothers. You give people documents and you think they your brothers will go to heaven and because you just love them because you given How many have ever thought that you don't think about them but listen who you I'm seeing another person called Jesus verse number 11. Are you seeing him Jesus called the name Jesus was a common name called the reason why Jesus again you know you can imagine living with Jesus in the house. Hallelujah. Yes. And Jesus is called justice who are the circumcision. These only are fellow workers who reign of God who did become comfort to me. So which people comforted Paul? These fellow workers they confronted Paul when Paul was in a problem. Please can we have such workers in this last days that we can be a comfort to one another. But if you have a problem you say I want to mention them. Belot Venus also brothers you have a sister also. So I will talk about that one next time. Nelson, James, those are the only brothers. You know when the Bible says those are the only what that means other brothers did not comfort. I don't want to go to that one. Verse number salute you do a father who is of you a servant of Christ always striving for you in what? Prayer. So there's a prayer band member here. I called you. What is a furnace doing? striving, praying on behalf of arms. Praise God. There were people during the time of Paul that were striving. You know the word striving, that means that person is a prayer warrior. I don't know if that is the name striving. Praise God. But there's a man the Bible mentions is striving for others. Praying on behalf of others striving for prayers in behalf of what others are you even you know I was looking at this box. This boxing nothing completely in this box. This is a prayer box. You mean prayer box? You cannot even struggle even make a prayer request for a brother that surely god I have a friend I want to write his name that even if he's not here God may use any to reach him look at the box people do not have prayers which prayers which prayers do we need to have we don't have look at this box even your mother if you don't have a friend does your mother love god but you have why don't you have tried alone since you love this others who like who like what say he can drive on behalf of you. Paul says there are others salute to you do epas who of you are servant or always driving for you in what in the prayers they are in this meeting and people refuse. Honorable brother relative even even a brother to your father so that may strive on their on if our relatives will get lost they will get off because you refuse that a parents cannot do what pray for you there were prayer warriors who are driving on behalf number one by the way Before I go to this, it says always striving for you in the prayers. That you may what? Stand perfect and made fully the will of what? God. There were people during the time of Paul that their work was to pray for God's people to stand what? In the will of who? God. Hallelujah. Verse number 13. Are you there with me? Say amen. For I do testify to him that he has much zeal for you and those inia and those inolish. Meaning this person had a zeal. The zeal he had for the people of God. He was a zeal that he want them to be saved. His desire was to see. Do we have mothers? I'm sorry that our mothers all are outside. They are not here. who were even praying for people that their work is to see even young men even preachers to be saved confirms that I'm aware this person prays hallelujah this person is striving for us please let me ask you what are you known for can people say that surely we know so and so is praying on my behalf are you aware if you are going for miss there's a people praying for me. I know they might not be with me here but they are striving but even if you have a prayer request you can call please kindly kneel down and pray on my behalf. Do you know why we meet problems and we disturbed there are people who have refused to pray for us but can talk that minister that minister is that prayers? Hallelujah. This woman I don't know if if it's a man or a woman. I don't know. Is a what? Three. What is he that people is that what perfect? Is it to see a people perfect church perfect ministers that are not perfect? Paul says he testify that he had much zeal in those prayers. He prays for those in he prays for those in. And then he finishes by saying salute you Dr. Lucas. You know when he say salute to you in it says medical. Hallelujah. In Paul's ministry there were medical missionaries physicians. Hallelujah. And the Bible says that salute Lucas the beloved one. Paul love Luke. Why Luke when his sick was like Rolex walking with remedies. Amen. That ministry was full. You know today I've just seen a message that there's a church here. 57 members were brought [Music] district and do you know why Satan is using such a people they will say the churches are like this the devil is so busy in fact it's in the news I've placed it in the group you can check it and see the stories so dangerous stories so people can think but that is not that is how the devil but devil will not make it Christ has defeated the devil in heaven in the cross in the garden of Eden Christ will still lead praise God there was a beloved physician this man is called who I'm seeing here I'm seeing belat here medical missionary in the room I'm seeing you here I we are with in fact Paul says we are with Lucas the beloved Not. And then he says, "And and not." So when Paul is writing the book of Colossians, he says, "They're with Lucas and they're with who?" They're with Demas. So how many people were there when letter was written? Two were next to what? Paul, who who are they? Lucas and who? Demos. Praise God. Lucas and who? Let me give you some of the verses where the name of Deas is mentioned. Uh, can I give you those verses? Filimon 124. The Bible reads, "Mus Lucas, my fellow workmen, are you there in Philippians? Please check it. Check it. My time is only 7 minutes and I'm praying." Philon 1 verse 24. The Bible says, are you seeing it? Musles. And who? Uh-huh. My fellow. So Paul mentions his fellow what? Paul was not working alone. Listen, in this work, you must have fellow workers. I know that there are times that the work was too tough. I told you the other time that there's a time that John Mark had to leave the work. Hallelujah. Because the work was tough. But Paul always had fellow workers. Even at the time they were with Barnabas, they had to separate. They also met challenges the way we do. Hallelujah. Phil, not Philippians. Please speak in a little tone. Hallelujah. Fleon 1 24 confirms not only in the book of Colossians but says Marus and his demas Lucas my fellow what? Work men. My fellow what? Workmen. Workmen. I also see I also see the name of uh this man written again in 2 Timothy 4:10. For Demas had forsaken me. Deas has done what? Having loved the present. In fact, there's a verse says having loved the present age and is gone to Thessalonica to Galatia Titus to Dalmatia. Praise God. A fellow workman with Paul when they were writing letters preaching with Paul and fellow Aman. Do you know the book of Filimon is written to somebody who had you know who was that? The book of filmon is written to a man called who? Onesimus. And did you see the name of Onesimus? Onimus came back and joined Paul. Paul made him a very you know what did Onesimus do in the book of filmon verse number one to three. Let me say there is the Bible says the Bible reads the Bible reads Paul Paul a prisoner of Jesus Christ and of Jesus Christ and Timothy our brother Timothy our brother and to Filon our dearly beloved and fellow laborer and to our beloved Afiah and Aibus our fellow soldier our fellow soldier the church in thy house the church in that so in the filimon's house there was a what church. Uhhuh. Grace to you. Grace to you and peace from God our fatherh the Lord Jesus Christ. Amen. I thank my God. I thank my God. Making mention of thee always in my prayers. Depends on you. Always in my word. Yes. There was a church in the house for those who think that they cannot leave big churches. There was a church in the house of filmon. Hallelujah. He always and he tells I remember that church my friend. Read very fast. It says, "I thank my God, making mention the always in my prayers, hearing of my of thy love and faith, yes, which thou has towards the Lord Jesus, to all the saints, that the communication of thy faith may become effectual, and the knowledge of every good thing which is in you in Christ Jesus. For we have great joy and consolation in thy love because the poed by thee brother might be much bold in Christ to enjoy thee that which is convened convenient yet for love's sake I rather beseech thee being such an one as Paul the aged and now also prisoner of Jesus Christ I beseech thee for my son ones I beseech you for my what my son ones my son what ones the bible whom I be bonds. Uh-huh. Which in time past, Uhhuh. was to thee unprofitable. Or in the time what? Pass. Was to thee what? Unprofitable. Profitable. So that means ones and lived with who? Filament. And he said ones and profitable in the time what? Read the Bible. It says it says I receive thee for my son. Yes. whom I beg my bones which in time pass was to thee unprofitable but now profitable to thee and to me. Hallelujah. Never think only that made profitable. Even so Paul made Onesmas what profitable Onesimus was chased by servant I will come back to that sermon again I will come not now imagine today I'm saying deas is when letter is written 1 vers 24 he sees being returned back to the work having left hallelujah he was seeing it he was When Paul used to go and preach, he used to be sent when people had convention like this. He was a speaking there were the let me go to conflict and carry 349 paragraph 2 says 349 conflict and carry says among assistants at home were many of his former companions and fellow workers. Luke the physician was with him still. Dus and Mark were also with him. So which people were with him? Luke many commissioners. Mark and with who? See the early years of his profession of men. Mark Christian experience had deepened as he had studed more closely the life of death and death of crimes. He had obtained clear views of the savior's mission. it toils and conflicts reading in the scars scars and increase hands and feet. The marks of Israelis for humanity and the right in which selfis had become willing to fight the master in the back of what? Self sacrifice. Self what? Sacrifice. Mark came back and saw Mark coming back. Das saw Mark leaving the work and brought again to work again. When somebody leaves the work, he has never seen Jesus the way he should see Jesus. Hallelujah. When somebody leaves the work, he has never seen the scars of Jesus Christ who suffered for the world humanity. Mark came back. We are told now sharing the lot of Paul the prisoner, he understood better than ever before that it is infinite gain to win Christ. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. infinite laws to win the world and lose the soul from whose redemption the blood of Christ was shed. In the face of severe trial and adversity, Mark continued steadfast and a wise and beloved helper of the apostle. Why don't you say amen? When Mark came back, he now understood somebody can go home so that when he comes back, he may be strong. All things work together for what? for those who love one and are called according to his word. Praise God. When Mark came back, he was stronger and he became an help of Paul. Why don't you say amen? But now was there seeing the condition what ste for what afterward forsook in referring to this Paul wrote them as forsaken having love this present 2 Timothy 4:10 for anyone please I'm praying For what every word for them butter exchange those who do not know the word butter it means exchanging in traditional African society. If you have a sheep, somebody has got me you do what he noble. How many? How shortsighted be exchange? power. Yes. Possessing only one word. Well, honor deas was a poor ill might proudly call his home while Mark choosing to suffer for Christ's sake possess what being accounted in heaven and what I joined her with his words. Hallelujah. church them has left because of Christ. They must left the work having preached. Please do you know the verse in verse 27 Paul says that I bring my body under what subjection I want this body to understand. I want to control this body that having preached to others I may not be what a time came Dema said this gospel is very tough. You know sometimes you may say you know I can preach with the word but do you know today young men you know Demas was a young person and he went back to Thessalonica. Do you know it is Thessalonica whereby when Paul preaches people are making noise. Do you know it is Thessalonica whereby Paul says that the people of B are not the people like the people of why with them they they wrote these things down and later on they went to do what? This man goes to Thessalonica where by the people were not serious. Why? World again. How poor was Deas milk accepted to suffer for Christ sake. Imagine this quotation says that Deas was poor indeed. However much he might proudly call his own. I have a cup. You know, you cannot just walk for God barefooted. Today I have a car. Do you have a motorbike? You see, you you don't joke. You know, walking for God. You see Hallelujah. Don't look at me. This could say was pouring and however much he might proudly call his words on that now things don't we have today people who do not people who do not understand the sacrifice of Jesus and having preached having suffered having walked in the path humiliation they leave the gospel work and join things so that they may have things called the word and they proudly walk say I cannot walk in a way where I cannot get anything I cannot suffer. Paul in fact Mark choosing to suffer for Christ sake possess it all being accounted in heaven and of a joint hair with his son if you permit our mind to dwell more upon Christ and the heavenly world. We should find a powerful stimulus and support in fighting the battle of the Lord. Why would you say amen? If we can only be in Christ, we can be encouraged. Even if we see the brethren we used to have are now having good big houses, good safets and you if you go to your room you have nothing. You have old mattress and people tell you because you are walking walking walking for the go walking walk walk walk walk walk walk walk walk walk walk walk walk walk walk walk walk walk walk walk walk walk walk walk walk walk walk walk walk walk walk walk walk walk walk walk walk walk walk walk walking walk walk walk walk walk walk walk walk walk walk walk walk walk walk walk walk walk walk walk walk walk was poor indeed today those who are poor indeed with big houses with big vehicles poor indeed can love people because they don't have anything amen left the work to go and get worldly riches hallelujah Praise God. It finishes by saying pride and love of the world. Why don't you say amen? Uhhuh. The glorious better so soon be our home. Beside loveliness of Christ all attraction will seem of little work. Hallelujah. I'd rather have Jesus 327 to say mommy to say mommy please I'm encouraging my fellow young men while is coming to this work I told you about lot while is coming please I'd rather 327 327 please please please Das was proud he had things he was proud he had moved bag. He had a vehicles. He had a big good house. He had a suit. And he was telling Mark, "Who you wake up and a few clothes?" Do you know if you read the Bible, Paul only had few clothes? Paul didn't have enough Zeus. That is 2 Corinthians 11. You will go and read at home. Hallelujah. And he said, "No, he cannot make us." Number 3:27. Let's sing it. This is Mark singing this song while Demas is proud that he has things. The way today people are proud, we are proud of things we have and we can laugh others and think that those people are lost. They are not good gospel ministers because they lack things that the world have. Hallelujah. But how poor indeed Mark was rich because he has chosen to suffer for the sake of Christ. Hallelujah. 27 [Music] Jesus [Music] is Jesus. [Music] by his heart to be king of our [Music] men in great stus for [Music] I rather Jesus than I rather than the faithful to the I mean than to be the king of our [Music] ra before you go to number three I cannot pray ministers were in the gospel field who are like Mark who sometimes have drawn back and God has given you opportunity ministers who are in the field doing God's work but people tell you my brother please look at this side until you forget suffering and even people even tell you how you will suffer when you follow that course that the Lord has convicted you in his word that it is the cause of Christ but people tell you no no no you see you must have this and when even look others how they have become rich because they have chosen that side you also say in your heart surely I think that is the way but you want to be steadfast in Christ and you want Christ to help you please come forward come forward we pray come forward as we sing number three I want to pray with those who want to be gospel workers and the world promises you good things but you want God to help you know you may think Demas was demas was also a minister like we are but you have seen his name being mentioned fellow servants but he left and that must repeat itself now because they were written for us. Number three is fairer than leaves of red rest blue is sweeter than honey from out the angering spirit reach. I rather ask Jesus and let him lead than to be the king over them. I rather have Jesus than this world. Dear Lord in heaven, I want to thank you so much for allowing me present this evening. Thank you so much for the message. Time is too short and soon and very soon we will be going home. We have seen Paul with his fellow servants who were once [Music] faithful. We have seen Mark coming back to the ministry and accepting Jesus Christ as his personal savior. accepting to suffer, accepting to be poor in the worldly goods which are being seen but rich in heavenly goods which are not seen. Dear Lord in heaven, Dembas chose the world. The spirit of prophecy has confirmed he would have glorified himself with the things he had but he was poor indeed. As we speak, the world is presenting for us goods. a blouse of men. Men are saying please don't waste time in the gospel work. Paul was a missionary just walking to and fro having few clothes didn't have enough things didn't have peace and people are telling young men don't walk like this old you will have nothing to eat. The same messages are being repeated to minister today in the field and some are choosing side. Some are busy in the internet looking people for from abroad to give them money so that they may have good houses, good lands. They may have the upper house of men, good suits. But dear Lord, some are even entering into the worldly businesses which do not glorify your name because they want to have goods of this world. How poor indeed was. But how was Mark? These people are asking you to help them together with myself. Help us to be like Mark found grace in your sight to come back to your work. We pray in Jesus holy name. God bless you.

[377.2s] faithful
[379.3s] minister. You know I've been working
[381.4s] with my fellow young
[384.1s] evangelist. we've been having with

[436.0s] today. Imagine do you trust any minister
[439.7s] when he goes somewhere and what he's

[564.5s] what a son to
[568.7s] your brother or sister like I
[572.0s] have here that is my nephew. So I thank
[575.8s] God the gospel people had relatives. Why
[578.4s] didn't you say amen? Now we're seeing
[580.9s] Byron here has got his brother
[587.2s] young. Okay, thank
[590.6s] you
[594.2s] brother
[603.5s] sister. That is the eldest in the
[605.9s] family. Then Byron the second. Then
[608.1s] Godfrey the third. Then the fourth
[614.3s] Fourth
[618.9s] word. Do you know the one who preached
[621.1s] to them? The second born
[624.5s] who took the message preached
[628.0s] to God.
[635.6s] And then the last
[642.5s] one. Hallelujah. You don't even have any
[646.0s] plan. Praise
[648.3s] God. Check with me. The Bible
[654.4s] [Music]
[657.5s] says salute you
[660.0s] to my fellow captive and Marus the
[664.5s] nephew of
[666.3s] Barnabas. So who was Marus the nephew?
[670.5s] So Barnabas was a man who encourages I
[673.2s] hope you know what Barnabas used to do.
[675.5s] He even took the the the son to the what
[678.3s] they either sister or a brother there
[680.2s] and they were with him in the ministry.
[682.1s] Why don't you say
[683.3s] amended as a family you know I was in
[686.0s] kissing during revival week of prayer
[688.2s] and I found I was so much happy with
[690.2s] elder ke all the sisters even the ones
[692.6s] who are old walks like this I want to go
[695.1s] and
[696.0s] be he took the message to all the
[704.4s] sisters and I loved that and I was so
[708.2s] much challenged that what are my
[710.4s] sisters can they also be with us. Some
[713.3s] of us are here do not think of their
[714.9s] brothers and sisters. They preach to
[716.6s] people's brothers. They preach to
[718.6s] people's mothers but they don't think
[720.4s] that their mothers also need to be one
[722.1s] true God believers. Amen. Barnabas knew
[726.3s] that that is a work that must be done
[728.7s] even to the relatives. And some of us
[731.4s] think that this message is only meant
[733.0s] for
[735.8s] you. You don't even share that word. You
[738.6s] give people papers but you don't
[741.2s] remember your brothers. You give people
[743.4s] documents and you think they your
[745.1s] brothers will go to heaven and because
[746.7s] you just love them because you given How
[748.7s] many have ever thought
[754.7s] that you don't think about
[758.5s] them but listen who
[761.9s] you I'm seeing another person called
[765.1s] Jesus verse number 11. Are you seeing
[767.9s] him Jesus called the name Jesus was a
[771.2s] common
[773.2s] name called the reason why Jesus again
[778.3s] you know you can imagine living with
[780.1s] Jesus in the
[781.6s] house. Hallelujah.
[784.7s] Yes. And Jesus is
[787.6s] called justice who are the circumcision.
[791.4s] These only are fellow workers who reign
[793.8s] of God who did become comfort to me. So
[799.2s] which people comforted Paul? These
[801.5s] fellow workers they confronted Paul when
[805.3s] Paul was in a problem. Please can we
[807.2s] have such workers in this last days that
[809.4s] we can be a comfort to one another. But
[811.3s] if you have a problem you say I want to
[813.8s] mention them. Belot Venus also brothers
[818.9s] you have a sister also. So I will talk
[821.7s] about that one next time. Nelson, James,
[825.8s] those are the only brothers. You know
[827.4s] when the Bible says those are the only
[830.1s] what that means other brothers did not
[832.9s] comfort. I don't want to go to that one.
[835.4s] Verse number salute you do a father who
[839.4s] is of you a servant of Christ always
[841.5s] striving for you in what? Prayer. So
[844.1s] there's a prayer band member here. I
[845.5s] called you. What is a furnace doing?
[849.4s] striving, praying on behalf of arms.
[852.6s] Praise God. There were people during the
[855.0s] time of Paul that were striving. You
[856.9s] know the word striving, that means that
[858.9s] person is a prayer warrior. I don't know
[860.4s] if that is the name
[872.0s] striving. Praise God.
[878.0s] But there's a man the Bible mentions is
[880.6s] striving for others. Praying on behalf
[883.3s] of
[884.0s] others striving for prayers in behalf of
[886.9s] what others are you even you know I was
[890.0s] looking at this box. This boxing nothing
[893.4s] completely in this box. This is a prayer
[895.2s] box. You mean prayer box? You cannot
[898.0s] even struggle even make a prayer request
[900.3s] for a brother that surely god I have a
[903.0s] friend I want to write his name that
[905.4s] even if he's not here God may use
[908.3s] any to reach him look at the box people
[911.9s] do not have prayers which prayers which
[914.2s] prayers do we need to have we don't have
[917.3s] look at this box even your mother if you
[919.8s] don't have a friend does your mother
[921.4s] love god but you have why don't you have
[924.1s] tried alone since you love this
[928.6s] others who like
[931.2s] who like what say he can drive on behalf
[936.3s] of you. Paul says there are others
[940.2s] salute to you do epas who of you are
[943.8s] servant or always driving for you in
[946.9s] what in the
[949.0s] prayers they are in this meeting and
[952.0s] people
[953.0s] refuse.
[956.5s] Honorable
[958.4s] brother relative even even a brother to
[961.4s] your
[962.8s] father so that may strive on
[965.8s] their
[967.9s] on if our relatives will get lost they
[971.1s] will get off because you refuse that a
[973.0s] parents cannot do what pray for you
[975.8s] there were prayer warriors who are
[977.9s] driving on behalf number
[982.0s] one by the way Before I go to this, it
[984.6s] says always striving for you in the
[986.2s] prayers. That you may what? Stand
[988.8s] perfect and made fully the will of what?
[992.1s] God. There were people during the time
[994.6s] of Paul that their work was to pray for
[997.4s] God's people to stand
[998.8s] what? In the will of who? God.
[1002.0s] Hallelujah. Verse number 13. Are you
[1004.8s] there with me? Say amen. For I do
[1007.6s] testify to him that he has much zeal for
[1011.3s] you and those
[1013.8s] inia and those inolish. Meaning this
[1017.5s] person had a zeal. The zeal he had for
[1020.0s] the people of God. He was a zeal that he
[1024.3s] want them to be saved. His desire was to
[1027.1s] see. Do we have
[1028.7s] mothers? I'm sorry that our mothers all
[1031.2s] are outside. They are not here. who were
[1033.8s] even praying for people that their work
[1036.3s] is to see even young men even preachers
[1039.8s] to be
[1040.7s] saved confirms that I'm aware this
[1044.4s] person prays hallelujah this person is
[1048.1s] striving for us please let me ask
[1051.6s] you what are you known for can people
[1055.4s] say that surely we know so and so is
[1058.3s] praying on my behalf are you aware if
[1060.6s] you are going for miss there's a people
[1063.0s] praying for me. I know they might not be
[1065.8s] with me here but they are striving but
[1068.0s] even if you have a prayer request you
[1069.8s] can call please kindly kneel down and
[1072.8s] pray on my behalf. Do you know why we
[1075.7s] meet problems and we disturbed there are
[1078.1s] people who have refused to pray for us
[1080.1s] but can talk that
[1082.4s] minister that
[1087.6s] minister is that
[1090.4s] prayers?
[1092.6s] Hallelujah. This woman I don't know if
[1095.4s] if it's a man or a woman. I don't
[1098.4s] know. Is a what?
[1102.3s] Three. What is he that people is that
[1105.4s] what perfect? Is it to see a people
[1109.6s] perfect church perfect ministers that
[1113.0s] are not perfect? Paul says he testify
[1117.0s] that he had much zeal in those prayers.
[1119.7s] He prays for those in he prays for those
[1123.5s] in. And then he finishes by saying
[1126.6s] salute you Dr. Lucas. You know when he
[1129.2s] say salute to you in it
[1133.4s] says
[1135.6s] medical. Hallelujah. In Paul's ministry
[1139.7s] there were medical missionaries
[1141.1s] physicians. Hallelujah. And the Bible
[1143.4s] says that salute Lucas the beloved one.
[1147.4s] Paul love Luke. Why Luke when his sick
[1151.0s] was like Rolex walking with remedies.
[1154.3s] Amen. That ministry was full. You know
[1156.7s] today I've just seen a message that
[1159.0s] there's a church
[1167.7s] here. 57 members were brought
[1179.1s] [Music]
[1184.6s] district and do you know why Satan is
[1187.3s] using such a
[1189.4s] people they will say the churches are
[1191.8s] like this the devil is so busy in fact
[1193.4s] it's in the news I've placed it in the
[1195.0s] group you can check it and see the
[1197.1s] stories so dangerous
[1200.5s] stories so people can
[1206.8s] think but that is not that is how the
[1209.0s] devil but devil will not make it Christ
[1211.5s] has defeated the devil in heaven in the
[1213.9s] cross in the garden of Eden Christ will
[1217.6s] still lead praise God there was a
[1220.0s] beloved physician this man is called who
[1222.7s] I'm seeing here I'm seeing belat here
[1225.4s] medical missionary in the room I'm
[1226.9s] seeing you here I we are with in fact
[1229.7s] Paul says we are with Lucas the beloved
[1232.1s] Not. And then he says,
[1234.5s] "And and not." So when Paul is writing
[1239.3s] the book of Colossians, he says,
[1241.0s] "They're with Lucas and they're with
[1242.8s] who?" They're with Demas. So how many
[1245.9s] people were there when letter was
[1248.2s] written? Two were next to what? Paul,
[1252.0s] who who are they? Lucas and who? Demos.
[1256.7s] Praise God. Lucas and who? Let me give
[1260.7s] you some of the verses where the name of
[1262.6s] Deas is mentioned. Uh, can I give you
[1265.4s] those verses? Filimon 124. The Bible
[1269.6s] reads,
[1272.9s] "Mus Lucas, my fellow workmen, are you
[1277.1s] there in Philippians? Please check it.
[1279.4s] Check it. My time is only 7 minutes and
[1282.0s] I'm
[1283.0s] praying." Philon 1 verse 24. The Bible
[1286.6s] says, are you seeing it?
[1292.3s] Musles. And who? Uh-huh. My fellow. So
[1298.6s] Paul mentions his fellow what? Paul was
[1302.6s] not working alone. Listen, in this work,
[1305.0s] you must have fellow workers. I know
[1308.6s] that there are times that the work was
[1311.5s] too
[1312.4s] tough. I told you the other time that
[1315.0s] there's a time that John Mark had to
[1317.4s] leave the work.
[1318.7s] Hallelujah. Because the work was tough.
[1322.0s] But Paul always had fellow workers. Even
[1324.9s] at the time they were with Barnabas,
[1326.6s] they had to
[1327.8s] separate. They also met challenges the
[1330.6s] way we do.
[1333.0s] Hallelujah. Phil, not Philippians.
[1335.9s] Please speak in a little tone.
[1338.2s] Hallelujah.
[1340.3s] Fleon 1 24 confirms not only in the book
[1344.6s] of Colossians but says Marus and his
[1349.3s] demas Lucas my fellow
[1352.1s] what?
[1353.7s] Work men. My fellow
[1356.5s] what?
[1358.7s] Workmen.
[1360.6s] Workmen. I also
[1362.9s] see I also see the
[1366.0s] name of
[1368.8s] uh this man written again in 2 Timothy
[1373.4s] 4:10. For Demas had forsaken
[1377.4s] me. Deas has done
[1379.9s] what? Having loved the
[1382.6s] present. In fact, there's a verse says
[1385.4s] having loved the present age and is gone
[1388.6s] to
[1390.0s] Thessalonica to Galatia Titus to
[1394.4s] Dalmatia. Praise
[1396.4s] God. A fellow workman with Paul when
[1400.9s] they were writing
[1404.8s] letters preaching with
[1407.3s] Paul and fellow Aman. Do you know the
[1410.8s] book of Filimon is written to somebody
[1413.8s] who
[1414.7s] had you know who was
[1417.6s] that? The book of filmon is written to a
[1420.3s] man called who? Onesimus. And did you
[1422.9s] see the name of
[1424.0s] Onesimus? Onimus came back and joined
[1427.0s] Paul. Paul made him a very you know what
[1430.6s] did Onesimus do in the book of
[1432.9s] filmon verse number one to three.
[1436.8s] Let me say there
[1441.4s] is the Bible says the Bible reads the
[1444.2s] Bible reads Paul Paul a prisoner of
[1447.2s] Jesus Christ and of Jesus Christ and
[1449.6s] Timothy our brother Timothy our brother
[1451.8s] and to Filon our dearly beloved and
[1454.4s] fellow laborer and to our beloved Afiah
[1458.2s] and Aibus our fellow soldier our fellow
[1461.7s] soldier the church in thy house the
[1463.4s] church in that so in the filimon's house
[1465.4s] there was a what church. Uhhuh. Grace to
[1468.5s] you. Grace to you and peace from God our
[1471.0s] fatherh the Lord Jesus Christ. Amen. I
[1474.0s] thank my God. I thank my God. Making
[1475.9s] mention of thee always in my prayers.
[1477.9s] Depends on you. Always in my word. Yes.
[1481.8s] There was a church in the house for
[1483.4s] those who think that they cannot leave
[1484.9s] big churches. There was a church in the
[1487.0s] house of filmon. Hallelujah. He always
[1490.0s] and he tells I remember that church my
[1492.2s] friend. Read very fast. It says, "I
[1495.4s] thank my God, making mention the always
[1497.7s] in my prayers, hearing of my of thy love
[1500.2s] and faith, yes, which thou has towards
[1502.2s] the Lord Jesus, to all the saints, that
[1505.0s] the communication of thy faith may
[1506.6s] become effectual, and the knowledge of
[1508.8s] every good thing which is in you in
[1510.8s] Christ Jesus. For we have great joy and
[1513.0s] consolation in thy love because the poed
[1516.5s] by thee
[1519.1s] brother might be much bold in Christ to
[1521.5s] enjoy thee that which is convened
[1523.3s] convenient yet for love's sake I rather
[1526.6s] beseech thee being such an one as Paul
[1529.4s] the aged and now also prisoner of Jesus
[1532.0s] Christ I beseech thee for my son ones I
[1535.4s] beseech you for my what my son ones my
[1538.5s] son what ones the bible whom I be bonds.
[1542.2s] Uh-huh. Which in time past, Uhhuh. was
[1544.8s] to thee unprofitable. Or in the time
[1547.9s] what? Pass. Was to thee what?
[1550.9s] Unprofitable. Profitable. So that means
[1553.8s] ones and lived with who? Filament. And
[1557.4s] he said ones and profitable in the time
[1562.4s] what?
[1564.2s] Read the Bible. It says it says I
[1568.2s] receive thee for my son. Yes. whom I beg
[1571.4s] my bones which in time pass was to thee
[1574.2s] unprofitable but now profitable to thee
[1578.1s] and to me. Hallelujah. Never think only
[1581.9s] that made profitable. Even so Paul made
[1587.8s] Onesmas what profitable Onesimus was
[1590.6s] chased by servant I will come back to
[1593.7s] that sermon again I will come not now
[1597.1s] imagine today I'm saying deas is when
[1601.0s] letter is written 1 vers 24 he
[1604.9s] sees being returned back to the work
[1608.2s] having left hallelujah he was seeing
[1612.1s] it he was
[1615.1s] When Paul used to go and preach, he used
[1617.5s] to be sent when people had convention
[1620.2s] like this. He was a
[1624.2s] speaking there were the let me go to
[1626.6s] conflict and carry 349 paragraph 2 says
[1630.5s] 349 conflict and carry says among
[1633.4s] assistants at home were many of his
[1635.7s] former companions and fellow workers.
[1638.7s] Luke the physician was with him still.
[1641.5s] Dus and Mark were also with him. So
[1644.2s] which people were with him? Luke many
[1647.0s] commissioners. Mark and with who?
[1651.1s] See the early years of his profession of
[1653.2s] men. Mark Christian experience had
[1655.7s] deepened as he had studed more closely
[1658.2s] the life of death and death of crimes.
[1660.5s] He had obtained clear views of the
[1662.2s] savior's mission. it toils and conflicts
[1665.1s] reading in the scars scars and increase
[1668.3s] hands and feet. The marks of Israelis
[1670.7s] for humanity and the right in which
[1675.5s] selfis had become willing to fight the
[1678.3s] master in the back of what? Self
[1681.9s] sacrifice. Self what? Sacrifice. Mark
[1684.7s] came back and saw Mark coming
[1688.9s] back. Das saw Mark leaving the work and
[1692.6s] brought again to work again.
[1697.4s] When somebody leaves the work, he has
[1698.9s] never seen Jesus the way he should see
[1700.6s] Jesus.
[1702.8s] Hallelujah. When somebody leaves the
[1704.9s] work, he has never seen the scars of
[1706.5s] Jesus Christ who suffered for the world
[1709.0s] humanity. Mark came back. We are told
[1713.6s] now sharing the lot of Paul the
[1717.2s] prisoner, he understood better than ever
[1719.5s] before that it is infinite gain to win
[1721.9s] Christ. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. infinite
[1725.2s] laws to win the world and lose the soul
[1728.8s] from whose redemption the blood of
[1731.7s] Christ was shed. In the face of severe
[1735.3s] trial and adversity, Mark continued
[1738.0s] steadfast and a wise and beloved helper
[1740.7s] of the apostle. Why don't you say amen?
[1742.8s] When Mark came back, he now understood
[1745.7s] somebody can go home so that when he
[1748.4s] comes back, he may be strong. All things
[1751.1s] work together for what? for those who
[1753.8s] love one and are called according to his
[1757.5s] word. Praise God. When Mark came back,
[1761.1s] he was stronger and he became an help of
[1764.2s] Paul. Why don't you say amen?
[1766.7s] But now was there
[1769.2s] seeing the
[1775.6s] condition
[1778.1s] what ste for what afterward
[1783.1s] forsook in referring to this Paul wrote
[1787.1s] them as forsaken
[1789.6s] having love this present 2 Timothy 4:10
[1793.6s] for anyone
[1795.4s] please I'm praying For what
[1800.7s] every word
[1804.4s] for them butter exchange those who do
[1808.2s] not know the word butter it means
[1810.9s] exchanging in traditional African
[1813.3s] society. If you have a sheep, somebody
[1816.2s] has got me you do what
[1821.2s] he
[1822.8s] noble. How many? How shortsighted be
[1826.0s] exchange? power. Yes. Possessing only
[1829.7s] one word.
[1831.5s] Well, honor deas was a poor
[1836.8s] ill might proudly call his home while
[1841.8s] Mark choosing to suffer for Christ's
[1843.8s] sake possess what being accounted in
[1847.9s] heaven and what I joined her with his
[1851.4s] words. Hallelujah. church them has left
[1855.1s] because of Christ. They must left the
[1858.3s] work having preached. Please do you know
[1861.0s] the verse in verse 27 Paul says that I
[1866.6s] bring my body under what subjection I
[1870.3s] want this body to understand. I want to
[1873.4s] control this body that having preached
[1875.5s] to others I may not be what a time came
[1879.6s] Dema said this gospel is very tough. You
[1882.3s] know sometimes you may say you know I
[1884.8s] can preach with the word but do you know
[1886.6s] today young men you know Demas was a
[1888.9s] young person and he went back to
[1890.8s] Thessalonica. Do you know it is
[1892.2s] Thessalonica whereby when Paul preaches
[1895.1s] people are making noise. Do you know it
[1897.6s] is Thessalonica whereby Paul says that
[1900.6s] the people of B are not the people like
[1902.6s] the people of why with them they they
[1906.2s] wrote these things down and later on
[1908.3s] they went to do what? This man goes to
[1911.2s] Thessalonica where by the people were
[1914.2s] not serious. Why? World
[1918.5s] again. How poor was Deas milk accepted
[1924.7s] to suffer for Christ sake. Imagine this
[1928.1s] quotation says that Deas was poor
[1932.3s] indeed. However much he might proudly
[1934.3s] call his own. I have a cup. You know,
[1937.4s] you cannot just walk for God barefooted.
[1939.8s] Today I have a car. Do you have a
[1941.4s] motorbike? You see, you you don't joke.
[1943.9s] You know, walking for God. You see
[1979.4s] Hallelujah. Don't look at me. This could
[1981.9s] say
[1986.2s] was pouring and however much he might
[1989.0s] proudly call his words on that now
[1992.6s] things don't we have today people who do
[1995.8s] not people who do not understand the
[1998.2s] sacrifice of Jesus and having preached
[2001.0s] having suffered having walked in the
[2003.6s] path humiliation they leave the gospel
[2006.3s] work and join things so that they may
[2008.6s] have things called the
[2011.2s] word and they proudly walk say I cannot
[2014.8s] walk in a way where I cannot get
[2016.5s] anything I cannot suffer. Paul in
[2020.5s] fact Mark choosing to suffer for Christ
[2023.6s] sake possess it all being accounted in
[2026.5s] heaven and of a joint hair with his son
[2030.6s] if you permit our mind to dwell more
[2032.6s] upon Christ and the heavenly world. We
[2035.7s] should find a powerful stimulus and
[2038.3s] support in fighting the battle of the
[2040.3s] Lord. Why would you say amen? If we can
[2043.4s] only be in Christ, we can be encouraged.
[2047.2s] Even if we see the brethren we used to
[2049.6s] have are now having good big houses,
[2052.2s] good safets and you if you go to your
[2054.7s] room you have nothing. You have old
[2056.9s] mattress and people tell you because you
[2058.8s] are walking walking walking for the go
[2061.3s] walking walk walk walk walk walk walk
[2061.8s] walk walk walk walk walk walk walk walk
[2061.8s] walk walk walk walk walk walk walk walk
[2061.8s] walk walk walk walk walk walk walk walk

[2062.5s] walk walk walk walk walk walk walk walk
[2062.5s] walk walk walk walk walk walk walk
[2070.5s] walk was poor indeed today those who are
[2073.8s] poor indeed with big houses with big
[2076.1s] vehicles poor indeed can love people
[2078.8s] because they don't have anything
[2081.7s] amen left the work to go and get worldly
[2085.1s] riches hallelujah
[2086.6s] Praise
[2087.6s] God. It finishes by saying
[2092.1s] pride and love of the world.
[2097.3s] Why don't you say amen? Uhhuh. The
[2099.7s] glorious
[2101.4s] better so soon be our home. Beside
[2104.1s] loveliness of Christ all attraction will
[2106.7s] seem of little work. Hallelujah. I'd
[2109.2s] rather have
[2111.1s] Jesus 327 to say mommy to say mommy
[2114.8s] please I'm encouraging my fellow young
[2116.9s] men while is coming to this work I told
[2119.9s] you about lot while is coming please I'd
[2127.0s] rather 327
[2129.9s] 327 please please
[2132.9s] please Das was proud he had things he
[2137.0s] was proud he had moved bag. He had a
[2140.1s] vehicles. He had a big good house. He
[2143.0s] had a suit. And he was telling Mark,
[2145.7s] "Who you wake up and a few clothes?" Do
[2148.5s] you know if you read the Bible, Paul
[2150.1s] only had few clothes? Paul didn't have
[2152.6s] enough Zeus. That is 2 Corinthians 11.
[2155.1s] You will go and read at home.
[2156.9s] Hallelujah. And he said, "No, he cannot
[2159.1s] make us." Number 3:27. Let's sing it.
[2162.2s] This is Mark singing this song while
[2164.5s] Demas is proud that he has things. The
[2167.6s] way today people are proud, we are proud
[2169.6s] of things we have and we can laugh
[2171.5s] others and think that those people are
[2173.8s] lost. They are not good gospel ministers
[2176.4s] because they lack things that the world
[2178.2s] have. Hallelujah. But how poor indeed
[2182.3s] Mark was rich because he has chosen to
[2185.1s] suffer for the sake of Christ.
[2187.4s] Hallelujah.
[2193.6s] 27

[2207.6s] Jesus
[2210.1s] [Music]
[2212.0s] is Jesus.
[2218.7s] [Music]
[2221.2s] by his heart to
[2225.9s] be king of

[2232.4s] men in great
[2244.9s] stus for
[2247.1s] [Music]
[2250.4s] I
[2251.6s] rather Jesus
[2256.1s] than I rather than the faithful
[2261.0s] to
[2262.8s] the
[2274.4s] I mean
[2277.0s] than to be the king of
[2290.2s] our
[2292.4s] [Music]
[2300.8s] ra before you go to number three I
[2303.4s] cannot pray ministers were in the gospel
[2306.4s] field who are like Mark who sometimes
[2310.1s] have drawn back and God has given you
[2311.8s] opportunity ministers who are in the
[2314.0s] field doing God's work but people tell
[2316.2s] you my
[2317.5s] brother please look at this
[2321.0s] side until you forget suffering and even
[2324.6s] people even tell you how you will suffer
[2326.6s] when you follow that course that the
[2328.2s] Lord has convicted you in his word that
[2330.8s] it is the cause of Christ but people
[2333.3s] tell you no no no you see you must have
[2335.7s] this and when even look others how they
[2337.4s] have become rich because they have
[2339.5s] chosen that side you also say in your
[2341.6s] heart surely I think that is the way but
[2344.3s] you want to be steadfast in Christ and
[2345.8s] you want Christ to help you please come
[2347.4s] forward come forward we pray come
[2349.4s] forward as we sing number three I want
[2351.3s] to pray with those who want to be gospel
[2353.8s] workers and the world promises you good
[2355.8s] things but you want God to help you know
[2358.2s] you may think Demas
[2359.8s] was demas was also a minister like we
[2362.7s] are but you have seen his name being
[2364.7s] mentioned fellow servants but he left
[2367.7s] and that must repeat itself now because
[2370.8s] they were written for us. Number
[2373.0s] three is fairer than leaves of red rest
[2379.3s] blue is sweeter than honey from out
[2387.8s] the angering spirit reach.
[2392.8s] I rather ask Jesus and let him lead than
[2399.1s] to be the king
[2407.5s] over them.
[2411.8s] I rather have Jesus
[2417.0s] than this world.
[2428.7s] Dear Lord in
[2431.2s] heaven, I want to thank you so
[2435.0s] much for allowing me present this
[2437.9s] evening.
[2440.6s] Thank you so much for the
[2442.6s] message. Time is too short and soon and
[2445.8s] very soon we will be going
[2448.9s] home. We have seen Paul with his fellow
[2453.8s] servants who were once
[2456.1s] [Music]
[2457.2s] faithful. We have seen Mark coming back
[2459.7s] to the ministry and accepting Jesus
[2461.9s] Christ as his personal savior. accepting
[2465.0s] to
[2465.9s] suffer, accepting to be poor in the
[2468.8s] worldly goods which are being seen but
[2471.8s] rich in heavenly goods which are not
[2474.5s] seen. Dear Lord in heaven, Dembas chose
[2478.1s] the
[2478.9s] world. The spirit of prophecy has
[2481.3s] confirmed he would have glorified
[2483.7s] himself with the things he had but he
[2485.7s] was poor
[2486.9s] indeed. As we speak, the world is
[2490.8s] presenting for us goods. a blouse of
[2494.0s] men. Men are saying please don't waste
[2496.9s] time in the gospel work. Paul was a
[2499.0s] missionary just walking to and fro
[2502.1s] having few
[2503.8s] clothes didn't have enough things didn't
[2506.9s] have peace and people are telling young
[2509.6s] men don't walk like this
[2512.4s] old you will have nothing to eat. The
[2516.5s] same messages are being repeated to
[2518.2s] minister today in the field and some are
[2521.0s] choosing side. Some are busy in the
[2523.1s] internet looking people for from abroad
[2525.6s] to give them money so that they may have
[2528.5s] good houses, good lands. They may have
[2531.1s] the upper house of men, good suits. But
[2534.4s] dear
[2535.6s] Lord, some are even entering into the
[2538.8s] worldly businesses which do not glorify
[2541.9s] your name because they want to have
[2545.8s] goods of this
[2547.5s] world. How poor
[2550.0s] indeed
[2552.3s] was. But how was Mark?
[2556.5s] These people are asking you to help them
[2559.8s] together with myself. Help
[2562.8s] us to be like
[2565.9s] Mark found grace in your sight to come
[2568.3s] back to your work. We pray in Jesus holy
[2572.0s] name. God bless you.
