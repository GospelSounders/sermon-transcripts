FULL TRANSCRIPT:
and he was separated the young theid became very and realiz that rejected by fa he also cried and when he called he was prayed for and he confessed his sins the brother just read from 1888 messages page 752 852 I think uh which which which we we we we we' seen that saying that brother fall upon the US fall upon the rock in Jesus name if reject this messages there are diseases that will come upon people of God there people will be just found sick a leader will just be SI but sometimes he has rejected something what pains me is that men are not going to realize that they have rejected something but the other men realized that they rejected the gospel of God and when they were prayed for they were healed and told them that will be using you I might have rejected a message but if we have we have seen light then we need to repent that God may help us wherever we are there are truths in this church that makes this CH some people will reject this messages you will real you will just feel sick may God open up your your eyes in that sickness so that you might not die that you may realize that know realize you made a mistake other people will just find themselves in that their legs are broken so by the time you will be trying to get healed of the your broken leg then you need to realize that you made a mistake Hallelujah this this has been our message and this message can also be found in this yes so time is almost and has our message this is the Beast that is taking the world the be and the Bible explained clearly and the spirit of Prophecy explain that let's continue very fast where we left yesterday now there's a book of [Music] microphone 33 who sitting next I want somebody to sit and read uh Isaiah this the this is all all churches are coming together I've explained this yesterday and I believe you understand people looking for but only and Christ is and Christ is the truth so you cannot say you a Christian when you are in error because those things are detrimental to our spiritual health just continue very fast you we saw thisal movement and we were here I want you to replay this video now as34 and 16 the Bible this one of the chief instigators of the they are the ones who came with thisum movement that before3 Isaiah 33:6 it says vers 14- 16 says Ah the sinners in Zion are afraid the sinners in are afraid fearfulness read in in Isaiah 33:4 yes for [Music] [Music] spe we are confing [Music] keep theud [Music] God is a consuming by the way there's a song so the of the consuming time so who wants to with right that if you're desing to go to go to heaven and live with God who are consuming fire then you are to you are to be speaking truth and of propy to be found you selfish out no selfish [Music] corruption for [Music] [Music] [Music] what is written in that Isaiah 3314 to6 is also in Psalms 15 verse1 is the same verse so there is truth there there is coming out from any corruption what bers as corruption so without that we cannot live with God are consuming fire so that means as we learn all these friends we need to pray for Christ righte and we need to pray for the Deep soul searching and self examination in Christ Jesus that as we approach this final events we may be covered by Christ Jesus is theong now this video we watch yesterday just for just replay it just put it again as a a reminder the people who might not be might not be there might not be there but those who are not there yesterday and those who are also willing to be reminded foreign spee [Music] means if you're born again raise your hand if you're born again you're a Catholic and split at the end of the first Millennium we had the Orthodox East and West two Church then 500 years later we have Luther his protest three churches in 1500 years three denominations of three churches and then from Luther's protest onwards 33,000 new [Music] denominations problem to the Catholic I come to understand that diversity is divine it's division that's diabolic it's true what you were saying about the glory I agree with you of course it's true the glory that the father had he gave to Jesus the glory was the presence of God what is the charismatic renewal is when we experience the presence of God and he said and I give them the glory that they may be want it's the glory if you accept that Christ is living in me and the presence of God is in me and the presence of God is in you that's all we need because God will sort out all our doctrines when we get upstairs therefore Christian Unity is the basis of our credibility because Jesus said until they won they will not believe the world will not believe as they should Until We Are One Division destroys our credibility it is fear that keeps us separated because fear is false evidence appearing real it's an acronym f e a r false evidence appearing real because most of your fear is based on propaganda so the isting for The worshipers Who to for the truth but people the truth refus to to Beed and come together it is Tru that is supposed to the people of God in the gr and brother PR the last being that Christ hanging on the cross beel there is something that should be our do hallelujah hallelujah today people are just talking of UN [Music] yes the world these are denominations coming in UN in the whole world and journal says that the has got a serious work of deciding what is truth and the people of Ang say that the pur what is truth and that gift will be received by Alter next one next uh slide this one I sh you yester I yesterday for example for religious liberty everybody knows that during the Middle Ages you know the the Catholic Church uh did not leave according to the that principles but to be fair to to the Catholic it changed in 1965 you know when they have the second Vatican Council because they they made a declaration for religious liberty all right guys welcome back so today we're going to talk a little bit about some things with regards to the general conference 7 Liberty next one chch we so that theing chch is going back we that in 2020in that to Adventist sign that they were now Catholic that people sear from the general conference from 2020 you know coming out of babon was not one it was in sh the one began in 1981 1995 other 1995 2000 other came out in 2000 coming out 2020 the coming out was in 2020 as was going forward was people of and you see so Adventist Catholics Orthodox and can find that there one Church the [Music] Catholic if that is whatt was signed by the S ADV chch and angan Evangelical Methodist the signing ceremony took place in the Catholic church in bolog Italy the document was signed uh all was and they promise to app to app the pro principle of the cical uh uh what cical what to each other so the churches they had agreed that there's no preaching of Prophecy no calling Pope the Beast no calling other churches no talking about Sunday at the back of the Beast no talking about false prophet it ISC hallelujah amen are you seeing it write it in your not if you still going to these churches that signed and you're still going there look very carefully that you are not in the Church of God you are in the train where the conductor is the devil and the engineer is Po and you are taken deep down to the but because Jesus Christ loves you and me this message for you 3 number that because God love this world this world that the devil come to become a he sent his son Jesus Christ whoever believes in him shallish in churches butal 17 [Music] life etal in the only true God and his son Jesus Christ of gr there was a beginning of the end cry clearly coming out from GC churching swelling swelling and swelling into loud cry [Music] and ifs who are thinking that we are going to preach like this and go back the Church of God will not fall will tur no turning back no compromise is C that and andella so the call to those who are still remaining in this adven churches together with churches is very straight and clear without fear or favor that come out come out so that is very clear and it is without compromise let's continue let's continue the next slide next slide I want you to so we read this one as well that if the church join because that isting neighbor wives because those churches have rejected Christ as theand theil asand so they breaking the seventh commandment of do not commit adultery andon committing adultery when the two Church including the sth Day Adventist Church led by the general conference conference start start converting their neighbor because Pap is not the wife of Christ we read from RE 13 that it is the devil that gives the purp power so the Roman Church is the the Roman Church is wife to the to the devil according toel 1:1 and so if there was a true Church of God this for then that is breaking of the seventh commandment and when you commit in the Book of Matthew that the only thing that can make a husband to divorce his [Music] wife when that woman fornicat commits so when the church when the church started conting the Roman Church is theband of of the Condor which is the [Music] devil warning that church was in of becoming a sister toon because it allowed the churches to become corrupted and every false Spirit andage of every unan and clean and what bread and will will what is and will be clear unless we make a decided what movement movement to cure the existing what so that is why all is coming to cure the existing evil we have made decid and clear movement and this movement must clear and must clear and cure these existing evils by going back to the old foundations and [Music] joining this is 1 2 3 so this church is now with every fall of spirit and C of every unlean and and those things we will only be clear unless we make a decided movement to the existing evil so that is why all this is to cure the existing to be very clear that they don't believe in the trity because that have be very clear that Jesus is the son of God son not drama to De to the world the ho is but the of God is the glory of God is the Breath of God and the only one true God is present everywhere through his holy spirit and that what son that God and his son can live in us through the holy spirit so that that have to make clear have to make it very clear that the burner of the Adventist is not the cross but the the the three Ang have to make it clear no dancing in churches reform there's a medical missionary reform movement Health reform must be given priority among others cure the existing evil Hallelujah Church hallelujah hallelujah how are following let's go because I'm almost finishing so pass there we had read yesterday I this I pass this one again another one another one and another oh let's read this one it says the day of God's is

[108.0s] sick a leader will just be
[112.3s] SI but sometimes he has rejected
[115.2s] something
[121.8s] what pains me is that men are not going
[124.0s] to realize that they have rejected
[125.8s] something but the other men realized
[128.9s] that they rejected the gospel of
[134.1s] God and when they were prayed for they
[137.0s] were healed and told them that will be
[139.6s] using
[148.3s] you I might have rejected a message but
[152.4s] if we have we have seen light then we
[155.1s] need to repent that God may help
[158.1s] us wherever we
[163.0s] are there are truths in this
[167.2s] church that makes this
[171.8s] CH some people will reject this

[345.2s] understand people looking
[349.2s] for but
[354.2s] only and Christ
[358.6s] is and Christ is the
[362.0s] truth so you cannot say you a Christian
[364.6s] when you are in
[367.4s] error because those things are
[369.8s] detrimental to our spiritual
[383.0s] health just continue very fast you we
[387.4s] saw thisal movement
[390.3s] and we were here I want you to replay
[392.5s] this video now
[395.3s] as34 and 16 the
[401.8s] Bible
[404.3s] this one of the chief instigators of
[415.4s] the they are the ones who came with
[418.5s] thisum
[424.8s] movement that
[427.6s] before3 Isaiah 33:6 it says vers 14- 16
[432.5s] says Ah the sinners in Zion are afraid
[436.5s] the sinners in are afraid
[439.9s] fearfulness read
[441.7s] in in Isaiah
[444.3s] 33:4
[448.5s] yes for
[456.2s] [Music]
[489.4s] [Music]
[497.5s] spe we are confing
[508.7s] [Music]
[519.0s] keep theud
[528.7s] [Music]
[557.4s] God is a consuming by the way there's a
[560.9s] song
[571.8s] so the of the consuming time so who
[575.4s] wants to with
[600.6s] right that if you're desing to go to go
[603.1s] to heaven and live with God who are
[604.9s] consuming fire then you are

[650.2s] [Music]
[658.2s] corruption for
[671.0s] [Music]
[676.8s] [Music]
[689.9s] [Music]
[698.0s] what is written in that Isaiah 3314 to6
[701.3s] is also in Psalms 15 verse1 is the same
[710.9s] verse
[715.1s] so there is truth there
[719.8s] there is coming out from any
[729.6s] corruption what bers as
[738.1s] corruption so without that we cannot
[740.7s] live with God are consuming
[746.4s] fire so that means as we learn all these
[752.0s] friends we need to pray for Christ
[757.8s] righte and we need to pray for the Deep
[760.7s] soul searching and self examination in
[763.0s] Christ
[769.2s] Jesus that as we approach this final
[772.0s] events we may be covered by Christ Jesus
[775.0s] is theong
[782.8s] now this video we watch
[785.6s] yesterday just for just replay it just
[789.4s] put it again as a a reminder the people
[793.4s] who might not be might not be
[798.2s] there might not be there but those who
[800.3s] are not there
[804.7s] yesterday and those who are also willing
[807.8s] to be reminded
[827.8s] foreign spee
[839.5s] [Music]
[849.2s] means if you're born again raise your
[851.0s] hand if you're born again you're a
[862.6s] Catholic and split at the end of the
[865.1s] first Millennium we had the Orthodox
[866.6s] East and West two Church
[869.9s] then 500 years later we have Luther his
[873.0s] protest three churches in 1500 years
[877.2s] three denominations of three churches
[880.1s] and then from Luther's protest
[883.0s] onwards
[884.9s] 33,000 new
[889.2s] [Music]
[891.6s] denominations problem to the Catholic I
[894.1s] come to understand that diversity is
[896.0s] divine it's division that's diabolic
[903.9s] it's true what you were saying about the
[905.3s] glory I agree with you of course it's
[906.9s] true the glory that the father had he
[910.6s] gave to Jesus the glory was the presence
[913.2s] of God what is the charismatic renewal
[916.0s] is when we experience the presence of
[918.4s] God and he said and I give them the
[922.7s] glory that they may be want
[931.3s] it's the glory if you accept that Christ
[933.9s] is living in me and the presence of God
[935.8s] is in me and the presence of God is in
[937.8s] you that's all we need because God will
[940.6s] sort out all our doctrines when we get
[944.2s] upstairs therefore Christian Unity is
[946.8s] the basis of our credibility because
[949.0s] Jesus said until they won they will not
[951.4s] believe the world will not believe as
[953.8s] they should Until We Are One Division
[957.2s] destroys our credibility
[959.6s] it is fear that keeps us separated
[961.8s] because fear is false evidence appearing
[964.1s] real it's an acronym f e a r false
[967.6s] evidence appearing real because most of
[969.8s] your fear is based on
[972.7s] propaganda
[985.3s] so the isting for The worshipers Who to
[989.7s] for the
[996.8s] truth but people the truth refus to to
[1001.4s] Beed and come
[1004.8s] together it is Tru that is supposed to
[1008.7s] the people of
[1012.5s] God in the gr and brother
[1017.3s] PR the last being that Christ hanging on
[1020.5s] the cross
[1023.5s] beel there is something that should be
[1026.4s] our
[1027.2s] do hallelujah
[1042.6s] hallelujah today people are just talking
[1044.9s] of UN
[1055.7s] [Music]
[1071.0s] yes the world these are denominations
[1074.5s] coming in UN in the whole world and
[1077.2s] journal says that the has got a serious
[1081.3s] work of deciding what is truth and the
[1085.0s] people of Ang say that the
[1088.8s] pur what is
[1093.4s] truth and that gift will be received by

[1131.1s] Middle
[1132.2s] Ages you know the the Catholic
[1136.2s] Church uh did not leave according to the
[1139.8s] that principles but to be fair to to the
[1143.9s] Catholic it changed in
[1146.7s] 1965 you know when they have the second
[1149.4s] Vatican Council because they they made a
[1152.7s] declaration for religious liberty all

[1552.4s] tur no turning
[1555.0s] back no compromise
[1560.1s] is C that and
[1570.4s] andella so the call to those who are
[1573.0s] still remaining in this adven churches
[1576.8s] together with
[1583.3s] churches is very straight and clear
[1585.9s] without fear or favor
[1591.5s] that come
[1595.1s] out come
[1597.8s] out so that is very
[1601.6s] clear and it is without
[1605.7s] compromise let's
[1607.8s] continue let's continue the next
[1611.5s] slide next slide I want you to so we
[1614.6s] read this one as
[1616.3s] well that if the church
[1622.8s] join because that isting neighbor wives
[1626.1s] because those churches have rejected
[1628.5s] Christ as theand theil
[1637.3s] asand so they breaking the seventh
[1639.8s] commandment of do not commit adultery
[1642.5s] andon committing adultery
[1649.3s] when the two Church including the sth
[1651.6s] Day Adventist
[1655.3s] Church led by the general
[1658.4s] conference conference start start
[1662.6s] converting their
[1667.4s] neighbor because Pap is not the wife of
[1675.9s] Christ we read from RE 13 that it is the
[1680.3s] devil that gives the purp
[1686.8s] power so the Roman Church is
[1690.1s] the the Roman Church is wife to the to
[1693.9s] the
[1698.0s] devil according toel 1:1
[1704.0s] and so if there was a true Church of God
[1711.3s] this
[1716.5s] for then that is breaking of the seventh
[1722.8s] commandment and when you
[1727.2s] commit in the Book of
[1732.5s] Matthew that the only thing that can
[1735.2s] make a husband to divorce his
[1739.6s] [Music]
[1742.0s] wife when that woman fornicat
[1746.6s] commits so when the
[1750.1s] church when the church started conting
[1753.5s] the Roman
[1756.3s] Church is theband of of the Condor which
[1760.6s] is the
[1762.8s] [Music]
[1764.4s] devil warning that church was in of
[1768.6s] becoming a sister
[1773.4s] toon because it allowed the churches to
[1775.9s] become
[1779.7s] corrupted and every false Spirit andage
[1782.3s] of every
[1784.8s] unan and clean and what bread and
[1790.4s] will will what is and will be clear
[1794.5s] unless we make a decided what movement
[1797.6s] movement to cure the existing what so
[1800.8s] that is why all is coming to cure the
[1803.2s] existing
[1809.6s] evil we have made decid and clear
[1818.4s] movement and this movement must clear
[1822.2s] and must clear and cure these existing

[1832.1s] by going back to the old
[1836.8s] foundations and
[1843.6s] [Music]
[1848.0s] joining this is

[1867.7s] those
[1871.4s] things we will only be clear unless we
[1874.1s] make a decided movement to the existing

[1887.0s] the existing
