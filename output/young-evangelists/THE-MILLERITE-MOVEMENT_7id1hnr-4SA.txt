FULL TRANSCRIPT:
We are going to determine why and we going to ask ourselves will be in heaven and if he be in heaven it will be happy. We are going to deterine will be in heaven. We being told about William Miller. As a little boy, William Miller lived on a farm in eastern New York. And on and let me read 16.3 16 AP BP AP BP AP BP. Sir, you are also going to write that William was a Baptist. He was in Baptist church. He was a Baptist. And I want to read to you because William Miller, we're being told that at one time when God is using William Miller, there reach a time that William Miller discarded or William Miller at one point neglected or doubted the principle of the B of the Bible whom God used to establish the foundation of our faith. There was at one time he doubted the principles of God or the Bible of God, the Bible of God. And when we will look at it parallel to the Israelites to the uh the parallel of the or Israelites movement, we are going to determine some of the sweet things. And we being told that when William Miller when he was a youth, he he came in contact with those who neglected the oracles of God. The day east Let me read. William Miller had a strong religious background but he become attached to the wrong crowd. His friends were ded. The these people set aside the Bible and had valued idea about God and his personality. It means that that they discarded what the Bible God and also the personality of God the personality of God and when William Miller get in contact with them. William Miller also take their beliefs and William Miller also neglected or he did not what he he did not believe the oracles of God. The oracles of God. Let me proceed. But Miller was always a man of high moral character. What he failed to find in relig religion he sought to find in high and patriot patriotic attainment. He served his country as an officer in the war in 1812. So William Miller was an army officer and the year 1812 he served as an army officer. I know you should write those things in 18 of as an early officer and also he was also a con constable sim. Yes. And also he was a justice of peace. He was he was doing three roles in that community in the year 1812. before that in the year 1812 you're finding that he did not believe the oracles of God and he was serving as an army officer and also when you are writing you also write that the father of William Miller was also an army officer and William Miller also serve as an army officer is served with distinction later in home community served as a justice of peace and his associations with his brethren but there A time after the war in the year 1812 when brother Miller when that war was finished the mother of Miller was widowed and the father of Miller was the father of milad died finding that Miller take his time Miller is going back home that he may stay and be a farmer and after we are finding that Miller being a farmer because of his mother because he loved his mother so much he tried to take time and go to what? To the Baptist church. And when you get to the Baptist church where his uncle was a preacher, there was no preacher. There were sometimes even the deacons were given printed sermon to preach. There were children given printed sermons to preach. But William Miller is not like that. But his motions, he he really liked the oracles of God. But after going to the Baptist church because of the emotions all because of being drawn by his mother who was widowed when he got back home he there was no preacher in that church. Then there was one Sunday which William Miller was given a sermon printed sermon to go and do what? print and sermon to go and uh to go and present and after being given print and sermon William started to believe the Bible and to ask the qu the question of the Bible. Let me uh proceed by reading when William was 34 years of age he become dissatisfied with his views. The Holy Spirit impressed in heart and it turned to the study of the word of God. In this in this book, Jesus was revealed to him as his savior. He found in Christ the answer to all his needs. He determined to study the Bible carefully and to determine if he could the answer to many problem that he had perplexed him. His studies led him to great prophecies that pointed to the first and to the second advent of our law of our Lord. When William Miller was studying the prophecy, he go to the study of the Bible. You're right. In the year 1816, William Miller started studying the oracles of God. In the year 1816, he ventured now to study and to know what is contained in the word of God, the word of God. And he was studying step by step. When Miller Miller started with Genesis 1 verse one, he cannot go to Genesis 1 verse number two. Without understanding Genesis chapter 1 verse number one, one without understanding it's saying the time prophesied interested him particularly the prophecies of Daniel and Revelation. He studied and what did William Miller use when studying the Bible? There were William Miller rules in studying the B the Bible. He had rules and there's a book written by William Miller on rules of interpreting the Bible in the blue estate. If you find time get time to study the rules but he was using something called conudin or conco concordance. Do we know the concordance? explain that was the Bible. What was Miller using or the crudence or concordance and very interesting that when William Miller was studying Daniel and Revelation, he read them. But while getting to the book of Daniel 8 verse number 14, the foundation of the Adventist movement is being established. In the only Daniel 8 verse number 14 is what has made a seventh day advent. Let us read Daniel 8 verse number 14. Daniel 8 verse number 14. The Bible says and he said unto him unto 2,300 days then shall the sanctuary be cleansed. When William Miller reached in Daniel 8 verse number 14, God has been sending his his angels to guide to instructing in the oracles of God. But when he reached the year 18, he reached what? Daniel 8:14, William read that unto 2,300 days shall the sanctuary be then interpreted that the sanctuary is the church and that church is in this earth. So it means that after 2,300 days this earth will be clear cleansed. It means that when this earth is going to be cleansed, it is going to be cleansed with fire. And when he was also reading the Bible, he is finding that that is the it means that the second advent of of Christ, it means then William Miller interpreted that what will be the end of this 2,300 days? What was the the end of this 2,300 days? Then he tried to interpret. I want you to write the first interpretation of Miller. The first interpretation of me. The first interpretation of me. Let me go to 16 number five as I tell you something. It say uh the book that I was reading it say that in the year 1818. So you're right. He started reading the Bible 1816 and the year 1818 he reached the conclusion that after after how many days? 18:18 that Christ will be coming how many days before him? 25 day 25 years within 25 years Christ will be coming. You write that 1818 read that after 25 years Christ will be coming. He come to the conclusion that Christ will come sometimes in the year 1843 or 1844. And you read that between you write March 25, 1843 to March 21st 1844 Christ will be coming between those days between those days between those months that Christ will be coming. That was the first interpretation of me not 1844 not October 1844. No the is first interpretation was that from March 1821st to March March 21st 1844 Christ will be coming. Christ will be coming. That was his first interpretation. And uh me I think that if I was in the time of William I could have believed. I want to I want to establish for you why because William studied thoroughly the Bible. There were signs of time that way. I've taken time that we may read we may sing Psalm 212 and I will read it once more and try to to tell you what was it evidence and try to ask you that if it was you could you not believe then let me let me proceed then that in the year 18 in the year 1818 that it was the conclusion of of William Miller that in 25 years Christ will appear. Can you put for me great controversy page 329.2 329.2 that we may read together as we proceed. GC 329.2 GC329.2 I'm only reading the first word she's saying you see 329.2 two, he had devoted two years to the study of the Bible when in 1818 he reached the solemn conviction that in about 24 years Christ will appear for the redemption of his people. Are we okay? That in about 24 years Christ will be appear for redemption of his what? Of his people. Are we see CCP we are preaching that Christ will appear? It is soon to appear also. This the message that we are preaching is the message that William Miller preached. William Miller preached. But when William Miller the conclusion in the year 1818, he started sharing it to his friend that Christ will appear 25 years later. But he had not he did not publicly pronounce he did not publicly go and start preaching that Christ is coming. But he said that what if I'm in error? What if I'm in error? What if I mislead souls? That was the question which was disturbing William and he start discussing it with friends. But in the year 1831 is the first time that William Miller go publicly to what to proclaim that Christ is coming. Right. In the year 1831, in the year 1831, in the year 1831, then William in the first time publicly give the reason of his faith. How many years from year 1816 to the year 1831? How many years did he devoted in studying the scriptures before publicly pronouncing? It is 15 years. Maybe maybe someone is taking one month and another could really that Christ is coming. But William Miller devoted 15 years before publicly proclaiming and the William Miller heart was being disturbed. God was talking to William Miller that go and proclaim to my people the message that I have given you. William Miller was not in heresy but God sent his angel to guide William Miller. He was not in what? Heresy. He was not in heresy. And we're being told that after William Miller, there was a time that when he was talking to God, he's saying that God, when I will be called, when I will be called to preach this truth, I will do, I will go. And on that on that time, on that day, there was a Baptist preacher who came and invited him to preach a sermon. And that was the first time in the year 1831 that you do what? You take time to establish the reason of his faith. And also that is in the great controversy page 330 paragraph number two. You write great controversy page 330. The paragraph is paragraph number two. And I will read as it ends as it ends. I'm not going for uh 1831. Are you seeing for 9 years? Let me start with let me start the words. The words you can the words were ever recurring to his mind. These were the words which angels were telling the William go and tell it to the world. Their blood will I require at thy who guided William? It means that God guided that he was he was coming in the year 18 but he forced through the ministation of the holy angels we will read the in the writings I know we are coming it's saying for 9 years he waited the burden still pressing upon his soul until in 1831 he for the first time publicly gave the reason of his way publicly gave the reason of is what is faith that is in the year 1831 and from that time was being called from every hand from every every hand and he was alone we going to determine that it is until 18 1838 that we find another associate of William but for all those what 1831 to 183 1839 how many years 8 years he was only preaching alone we are going to find the associates of William Miller. But that was in the year 1831 he first publicly given the reason of his faith and also right in the year 1843. In the year 1843 in the year 1843 that is great controversy. You can move to great controversy 332.1. 332.1 it says that in 1833 Miller received a license to preach from the Baptist church of which he was a member. So we are writing the year 1833 William received a license as a minister of the Baptist church to preach after him giving the evidence of his faith that truly Christ is coming 25 years before me. Christ is coming. He received a license. A large number of ministers of Islam denomination also approved his work and he it was with their formal sanction that he continue his labor. He received what alliances. I know I will try when we are looking for the birth and the progress of the remnant church. We will look about the ordination and the credentials also in the seventh adventist church because we are having ordination and credential Sabbath before us. And I would like that before we reach on that Sabbath where we will have ordination and credential, we will try to look the birth and the progress of seventh adventist about ordination, about credentials and about who to be ordained, who to baptize, why baptism, if I will only find time. But William Miller was given license in the year 1833 by the Baptist church, recognized by ministers and members of what? Members of his church. And I know we have been reading it is Christ in his sanctuary 87.1. This is the foundation of faith. C I H SS 87.1 C IH SS87 number one he said the the scripture above all other the scriptures which above all other had been both the foundation and the central pillar of the Adventist faith. So what is our foundation? Our central pillar. You know I can talk of the Adventist movement but when I do not look the foundation when I do not pass to William Miller and the winnerite movement I have not talk of the Adventist movement. And I want you to have a clear understanding. It say that the scripture above all other had been both the foundation and the central pill of the Adventist way. What the is correlation and to 2,300 days since then shall the sanctuary be cleansed. That is our foundation. That is our central pill. It means that when you want to finish the seven adventist church, don't go to the personality of God. Don't go don't go to the Sabbath, but come unto our central pill. You only remove what? You only remove the sanctuary and the adventist movement is finished. And when you come also with 2520 that is sanctuary you have removed what? You have removed seventh adventist. Why am I saying so? That was unto the declaration of 2,300 days of the sanctuary be cleansed. That is our central pillar of the Adventist movement. When you do not understand that, read with me. Ali writing 63. Ali writing 63.2. 63.2. I want you to post it in screen quickly. Ali writing 63. 63.2. I want you to read with me. Ali writing 63. Paragraph is paragraph number two. And readly read. It say, can you read with me? Uh, but such subjects of the sanctuary in connection with 2300 days, the commandment of God and the per and the faith of Jesus are perfectly calculated to explain the past Adventist movement and show what our present position is. When we want to look the past Adventist movement and our history, we go to the sanctuary and 2300 days as we are connecting with three angels message about the commandment of God and the faith of Jesus. That is our foundation. That is our foundation. And when William Miller was doing what was establishing his faith, there was a book written by William being written science of times. When it was written science of time of January 1843, William Miller read this said this word. He said I want to quote you for the words of William Miller, not mine. is saying that I am fully convinced that I am fully convinced I don't know I let me project for you it is being written a prophet among you a p a y a prophet among you know I will take much of the time also reading prophet a prophet among you it's a serious book if you go to blue estate you will see you write a p a y a prophet among you 193 paragraph number Can you hear these words of William Miller? When William Miller stand to preach, no man can gain say with the oracles and I want to establish the sermon of William Miller. AP AY 193.1 Can you put we read together with my friends? It is not there. Let me read as you searching in the other world. AP AE read in signs of times of January 25, 1843, William Miller declared, I am fully convinced that sometime between March 21st, 1843 and March 25, 1844, according to the Jewish mode of computation of time, Christ will come. The months of 1843 and 1844 rolled by with increased expectancy on the part of the believers in the advent. The proceeding were watched by many unbelieving of sabans and kept skeptism prejudice or moary grieve. William Miller is writing that in January 25 that I'm fully convinced that March 21st 1843 to March 21st 1844 Christ will appear. But there were a lot of prejudices. There were lot of skepticism. But the sad thing that the years the mans keep scrolling that when they were looking in 1843 1844 21st they are not seeing Christ coming but there was something there was a point which William me because let me read may you mark this my word he's saying the majority however although discouraged and disappointed I'm reading my quote which I I put it say the majority however although discourage and disappointment still believed that the advent was to be expected at any moment praise God that in the first word the first interpretation of me the first interpretation of me we are being told that people were not being discouraged by the great disappointment but they believe that in a moment later Christ is going to appear it's say that manfully Miller admitted that he had been in error but he also called the believer's attention to Abak 2:3 let us read when 1840 uh vers 25 1844 passed William came and read in the book of Abak 2:3 that indeed I am correct when I'm looking for the signs of times I'm seeing that Christ is going to appear When I'm reading the sun, I'm reading the stars. Christ is really going to do what? To appear. But 25 1844 is passing. They are not seeing any moment that Christ is doing what? Christ is coming. Then he's going to use scripture and will a man of scriptures, a man of evidences come to the book of Habac 2:3 and try also to start encouraging his people that the vision is for the time appointed. Yet the vision may yet Christ is going to but it is for appointed time. Let you read with me saying for the vision is yet for an time appointed uh for appointed time but at the end of it shall pick and not lie though it t wait for it because it will surely come it will not t that you know from March 21st to 1844 they were entering something called the taring the ting time have you ever read about the taring time and also So because I I will get to to I will get time to speak about the the midnight cry and also when we are looking about the Matthew 25 verse number one as we going down about the 10 virgins there was also a ting time about the ting time the also the adventist movement they enter what is called the ting time they are being told that the vision is for appointed time yet it may be delayed But it will come. It will come. They enter the tearing time. And in that turning time, in that period is what we are also finding the midnight cry. I know I'm going to read when I get time, I will read about the midnight cryog that I may bring it to your mind. Then it continued by saying the vision though it t because it will surely come soon. The adventist papers were filled with reference to the ting time that from the year 184 March 25 every papers was being written a topic called the ting time. It continued by saying speak of Christ parable of the 10 virgin. Millerite lecture suddenly discovered that BC to AD system of chronology allowed no zero year that when William Miller was trying to write because I don't want to teach on the 2300 days because time is limited but we are finding that it started from 457 BC then he was prolonging that line to the year 1843 he calculated by 2300 days but he made a mistake of writing zero year that was the mistake but he come to that indeed there's no zero here when you come to 1 BC you go to 1 A but one what 1 BC C one Z BC but there was not that time then when you calculate 457 2300 days in 1840 1843 but I come to realing time that Christ is coming in the year 18 18 what 44 you only had one year then you read now the conclusion the present standing of me now was indeed when I'm looking for the signs of time in the year 1844 we are going to seeing the son of man coming the son of man coming but I want to bring into your mind that William Miller was I I don't he was correctly interpreting that crisis was Come here. Let me read for you. I will. Can you write a subtopic? The sixth seal. What the interpretation of I tried to determine to you what William Miller established his teaching because not let me let us go Revelation 6. When William Miller read the book of Revelation, this was what he read. William uh Revelation 6 verse number 12. And I'm not going to read uh I want you now to be keen writer. I'm going to read some of the scriptures and spirit of prophecy. You might not, you may not. Then you are going to read at your own your own time. But can you see if this is our interpretation how William interpreted the Bible? He's saying this is a six seal and I beheld. You can put it here to Oh. So read your Bible. Go with me in Revelation 6:12. Let me tell you that the six we have how many seals? Seven seal. But what what is of the seventh seal? The seven. You know it the journey to heaven. It is being talked about journey to heaven. It means that indeed now we are on the sixth seal. And also when we want to understand that Christ is coming, we go to the sixth because after the sixth in Aisha to Eevee, we are going to the journey to heaven. And it say Revelation 6:12. And I beheld when he had opened the sixth seal, and lo, there was great, right? The interpretation of first, there was great, and the sun became black as soft clothes of, and the moon became as blood. Mhm. And the stars of heaven fell unto them even as the fig tree cast her anti untimely figs when she is taken of the mighty wind. So that is the sixth scene. The sixth is continue by saying and the heaven departed as scroll that is the coming of Christ when it is rolled together and every mountain and Islams were moved on uh of their places and the kings of the earth and the great men and the rich men of the chief of captain and the mighty men everyone bondage and everyone free hide themselves to the rocks. That is the coming of who? The coming of Christ. It mean that William is reaching the conclusion that the signs of time which I'm going to use is Christ is coming and when Christ is coming we have not been given definite time but Christ was telling his disciple about the signs of times that after this signs of times Christ is coming here in the Christ is coming in revelation 6:14 s Christ is coming in revelation 6:14 and only revelation 6:12 and 13 you are being told about the signs of times that's why the Millerite song of 212 let me read something for you Millerite movement song 612 he's saying that it is almost time for the Lord to come 212 it is almost time for the Lord to come I hear the people say the stars of heaven are growing dim it must be the breaking of the day the signs for In the sun and moon, in the earth and sea and sky, a loud proclaimed to all mankind the coming of the master draweth. It means that that is their song that Christ is coming. When we look for the signs in the sky, in the moon, in the stars, Christ is coming. We are finding some things the interpretation of Mamela in the signs of times. Do they happen before 1844? Can you read first? We are finding about first sign which happen is about the earthquake that fact the first time which means that Christ is coming is there will be a great earthquake did it happened so you write first the great earthquake the great earthquake first the great earthquake you read we read great controversy 304.2 GC 304.2 GC 304.2 2 you see the interpretation of me what happened GC 304.2 We want to see when was correct in his interpretation. Three or four paragraph is paragraph number two. He's saying this these signs of times these signs were witnessed before the opening of the 9th century. In the fulfillment of this prophecy, they occurred in the year 1755. The most terrible earthquake that has ever been recorded. Praise God. So before 1844 in the year 1755 there was a great earthquake which is being named the Lisbon earthquake. Are we okay? That is the first signs of times that William Miller was doing what William was using. So you write though commonly known as the earthquake of Lisbon it extended in the part of Europe Africa and America it was felt in Greenland in the west in Indies in the east island of there are many country and it was felt it was worldwide it means that the first signs of time that will in the book revelation 6 verse 12 that there will be great earthquake. So you write in the year 1755 the first signs of times is the Lisbon Lisbon earthquake recorded in great controversy 304 it say in revelation 6:12 and I beheld when he had opened the sixth seal there was a great earthquake and the sun became the sun became black as the s close of air that is sign number These were the interpretation of Miller that the sun became blackened as what? The sun. When did the sun became blackened? Huh? You give me evidence. I want evidence. Not when did the sun became blackened? Read with me. Great controversy. I want you to write the 306 306.1 the blackening of the sun or the dark the dark day and moon and moon May you write May 17th May 19th 178 I want you to go to the last part of it 306.1 is 6.1 you write on May 19, 1780. That is the second time, the second sign which is being which we are being told that when you shall see the earthquake when you shall see a great earthquake not only earthquake but a great earthquake of Lisbon which happened. William will say that Christ is coming. When you shall see what the the dark day and when the moon will become as blah as blood Christ is doing what was William Miller wrong because this thing happened you it says that on 19th of May 1780 this prophecy was fulf Okay. 19th May 17 18. But there's something which is remarkable which I do not want to copy it. Let us go to Matthew. It is Matthew 24:39. Matthew 24:39. You I want you to not a point in connection with 12 because when we are reading of what? When we are reading of 2300 days, we are finding that also 12 of 60 days is in 2300 day days. It means that for William Miller to understand 2300 days it means also he fully understand what 1260 days then Matthew which is tens of times when we read also when we are reading what gospel workers page 148.2 True. It means that what should be brought in the mind of people is the book of revelation Daniel and Matthew 24. Matthew 24. It mean that also used Matthew chapter 24. But there's something so interesting. Matthew 24:29. Read with me keenly in that immediately after the tribulation of those days shall the sun be blackened darkened and the moon shall not give her and the star shall fall from and the powers of the heaven shall be and then shall appear the signs of the son of man in heaven. It means that after Matthew 24:29 Christ is appearing. So you what it say that after tribulation s and this tribulation it is 12 60 days Christ is going to happen. What is going to appear? Not a Christ the dark day. The dark day is India. It means that it means that the persecution could before what? Before 1780 because 1260 days in that the persecution 1798 but the powers of persecution is before what? before before 7 before 1780 because Bible is not wrong because Christ is saying that unless those days be shortened no man shall be saved. It means that I want you also to write this that in the year 1776 the year 1776 this is SSP the story of the seat patos 120 paragraph number one 120 paragraph number one 120 paragraph number I want to read between the lines not to take much of the time see 120.1 is But God in mercy shortened the time of persecution. For except those days shall be shortened, no flesh shall be saved. The persecuting powers of the papacy was broken out in 1776. It means that before 1798 the persecution power was broken but when reaching 1780 the sun the sun became blackened. I also great controversy also 306 number one say you're right because my time is spent the 12 of 60 days of the year terminated in 1798 that is the correct interpretation a quarter of century earlier persecution had almost wholly ceased following this persecution according to the words of Christ so 1798US 2573 It means between 1773 to 1776 persecution that's why after tribulation in 1780 we are being told that the what is coming the day to be blah bl you will read much but I'm only giving you the evidences of William and also the third interpretation about the falling of the stars so this was his climax that when stars in a fall to evil rises at the at the door. You read with me great controversy 333.1 GC 333.1 you write the falling of the stars in November 13th you write November 13th 1833 we are seeing the falling of the stars November 13th 184 1833 we are seeing the falling of the stars after the falling of the stars Christ is coming in the year 1844 was William Miller You cannot answer this prophecy that is revelation 6:13 about the falling of the star. We being told that this prophecy it say that this prophecy received a striking of the greatest metoic shower of November 13,833. You will read as you go downward. Meic shower that is what? The falling of the stars that was the last which was being used. It means that William Miller was correct in his interpretation that Christ is soon what is soon coming. There's also last thing that also when William Miller combined with his associates which is who which is it is Josiah le it is Josiah le uh in the because they also interpretated in the year 1838 that when it will reach August 11 1840 there will be the fall of the Ottoman Empire that is in the book of revelation 9 from verse number 19 to verse number 21 and when you come from Revelation 9 19-21 when you are going to the revelation chapter 10 you are being told that they had been given a voice to go and proclaim the first and the second angels message. So you have read about the Ottoman Empire about the church the fall of the Ottoman Empire when the August 18 August 11 1840 you can write that the fall of the Ottoman Empire was also the interpretation which happened in August 11th 1840 if you get time you can read on it on SP78.2 too. You can read the fall of the Ottoman Empire which gave them now the people now believed that the interpretation are what? The interpretation are sure. The interpretation are sure. It means that Miller was correct in his what? In his interpretation. William Miller correct in his interpretation. It means that God had been leading his people. But when we will go to understand we will go to that where why did not Christ do what? Why did not Christ do what did not Christ come? And when we want to know our faith when we want to know the seventh adventist movement it is at the great disappointment that seventh adventist was esta established. It was through the labor of William Miller that our faith was established because God has been leading his people. God has been leading his people. And I know we will have a subtopic and you can also write about about about the Miller and Moses. There's a serious striking similarity that as Moses because I was really impressed by the sermon of of brother Maxwell. I will read those things once more. I will read them once more. He give me now easy time of explaining the striking similarity of the Adventist movement and of the Millerite movement and of Miller. He tried to explain to me but let me tell you that William Miller was correct. And when you want to know that our faith is being established in the Millerite movement, we are also going to look to the as Israelites the Israelites movement that as God led William Miller. So God has led who Moses Moses I know as we will be going also the birth and the progress of the Adventist movement as is apostasy. What will help us so much to have the correct interpretation is about what? It's about the history of the Israelites and the Adventist what movement. Can you write that? The striking similarity of the Israelites and the Adventist movement. Striking similarity. I'm only going that subtopic and introduction then I finish because my time is spent. My time is spent for you to give me easy time and you go and study for yourself. There's something which are being told in great controversy page 457 conclude we will know. Coming to we going to know about the milite movement clearly and if I find time we will talk of the mill associates someone like Josiah lech snow also Joseph snowh who again Charles F who again we are going to look for Yeah. Yes. James White also was associate of William. We will also look for the division among the milit. The division in the milite movement. But read for with me great controversy page 457. The paragraph is paragraph number one. I think so. 457.1. How many minutes do I have? 15 minutes. Thank you so much. 457 paragraph number one. As I look for the the Millerite movement in biblical concept. The Millerite movement in biblical concept. 457 paragraph is paragraph number two. Go with me. Paragraph number two. Paragraph number two. Paragraph number two. He's saying I want you to clearly understand this quotation because it will help us in our study. He's saying we are studying on church heritage or the history of the church. We're being told that the history of the ancient Israelites is a striking illustration of the past experience of the Adventist B. So it means that when you put the history of the ancient Israel this side and also when you put the history of the Adventist movement this side they are striking illustration. That's why I don't want to go to the midnight cry before I come to this that their history is parallel. It continued by saying God led his people in the adventist movement even has he led the children of Israelites from Egypt. It means that as God led his children in the Adventist movement, it is the same way he led his children in from Egypt. In the great disappointment, you can write one thing here because I cannot know because we have Egypt Syri. We are going to look that it resembled the midnight cry. We have the Red Sea you can write which resembles what the great disappointment. We also have what? We have also the rebellion at Kesh Bar which happened in the year 1888. We have also the apostasy at Jordan which is our omega of apostasy. Are we clear? which is our mega of apostasy. We will determine. Let me go. In the great disappointment, their faith was tested as that of the Hebrews in the Red Sea. So there is a striking similarity in the great disappointment which we look and also the testing in the Red Sea. It continued by saying that had they still trusted to the guiding hand that had been with them in their past experience, they would have seen the salvation of God. If all who had labor unitedly in the work in 1844 had received the third angel's message and proclaimed to the power of the spirit, the Lord will have wrote the mighty works of their effort effort. It mean that when William the third angel's message, it mean that we could have been in heaven now. Praise God. We could have been in what? In heaven. It means that when we are looking also for the history, we also go to the history of the of the of the Israelites and understand clearly that this church is a church led by God. See church. And yet we have just come here to to put our things that we believe this and this but we we have dived them from the scripture 2M 399 399.1 number one 2M 399 number one 3991 I want you also to understand this so I'm not too kind I'm Sorry. 3SM 3SM399 number one. It says 3SM3991 is saying that there should be a constant walking in humility. There there should be no just occasion for our Uhhuh. Let me look for the the point which I want. The point which I want the point which I want. Mhm. the point which I want the point which I want but I'm not getting in here but we can get it in the book education I highlighted it by in the book of education 178 I will give you that that 3SM but education 178 also put it clearly when I'm not finding inm let me read in the education education 178 number three 178 number three we are being told that the history with the that am had marked out in his word, uniting link after link in the prophetic chain from eternity in the past to eternity in the future. Tell us where we are today in this procession of the ages and what may be expected in the time to come. All that prophecy had foretold as coming to pass and in the present time has been traced on the pages of the history and we may be assured that all we which is yet to come will be fulfilled in order. It mean that the history which the greater put in the ancient Israelites it is a prophetic chain. It is a chain. It is running in chain after chain chain after chain. and also how God has led his children. His children how God has led his children. Because when we are looking for the Adventist movement, when we will go to the midnight cry, we are finding that when God when we think about Israelites, we are seeing only Moses. So no one can mention Israelites before mentioning Mo Moses. Am I okay? Also no one can mention seventh adventist without talking of the Millerite movement. Without talking on the Millerite movement. Can you write the parallel of Moses and me? As I finishing that the parallel of Moses and me that I may have easy time in the next lesson not to have much of time. The parallel of Moses and Miller. I know you have right about Miller being army officer and becoming a farmer. If you read alo it is also being told in one bio 19.4. about the army officer and then becoming a farm in but there's a parallel of Moses and Miller first you should write that both were called by God to lead his people both were called by God to lead his people Moses to lead God first church and Miller to lead God's last remnant church are we okay that as God called Miller to lead God's remnant church as also God called Moses to lead his church from the wilderness. We are going to see how they were were they called. Number two, that both were intelligent. Both were intelligent. Both were intelligent. The book CTR 100 CDR 100 CDR both were intelligent. CTR page number 100. Thank you. CTR page 100 number three is saying that Moses was a man of intelligence and God in purpose in his providence placed him where he could acquire knowledge and fitness for the great work. He was thoroughly educated as a general when he went out to meet his enemy. William was an army. He was an army officer. And also Moses first he was intelligent. Number two he was educated in in military training. He was educated in military training. Are we seeing that second parallel striking similarity? Are we seeing it? That striking similarity the same. Amen. Are we seeing that similarity? Both were called by God. Both both were intelligent. Let me read for you of William GC. You you you confirm GC37.2 Great Controversy 317.2 Great Controversy page 317 paragraph 2. Can you see this? William Moses was intelligent. Number two, he was trained in military training or he was trained as a general of the army officers. Read this GC 317.2. William Miller, he had a sound physical constitution and even in childhood he gave evidence of more than ordinary intellectual train. Praise God. Was Millia intelligent? Was Moses intelligent? Was Miller an army officer? Was was Moses an army officer? Was were they educated in military line? It means that we are we are on the right path of calling ourself Israelites movement syndrome. You write point number three. Read point number three. Read point number three. Both were uh taught and protected by angels. Both were taught and protected by angels. Both were taught by and protected by angels. PP 245 paragraph number two. PP 245 paragraph number two. PP 245 paragraph number two. Can you see 245 paragraph number two is saying that the the elders of Israelites were taught the elders of Israeli Israel were taught by angels that the time for their deliverance was near and that Moses to accomp that Moses was the man whom God will employ to accomplish this work. Angels instructed Moses also that Jehovah had chosen him to break the bondage of his people. Who instructed Moses? Who instructed Moses? What about William Miller? Ali writings 229. You see these are some of the simple striking similarity. Ali writings 229. Can you see this also? Can you see this also? You know that we are 229 paragraph number one. Can you see it's saying that God sent his angel to move upon the heart of what? A farmer who had not believed the B the Bible to lead him to search the prophecy. Angels of God repeated revisited that chosen one to guard his mind and to open to his understanding the prophecies which has ever been dark to the to God's people. Those were instructed and taught by angels. Another one let me ask you first William was a military Moses was also military. What is agricult? It means that everything will be okay. Let me read the last one. This I will read. Both s not the promised land and both are going to heaven. Praise God. Both s not the promised land but both are all going to we are going to meet William Miller in heaven. Praise God. But Moses is in heaven right now. Let me give you one evidence. Early writings p 257 258. You also understand that as we are understanding that there's a striking similarity between William Miller and Moses Oen White understood it that way. Early writings page page 250 258 258 paragraph number one as I conclude as I go to conclusion it say this was a mistake done by William Miller but there's something which happened let me read I will start with paragraph number one you go with me mark that point they read clearly read clearly it's saying that if William Miller have seen the light of the third angel's message. Many things which look dark and mysterious to him would have been explained. But his brethren professed so deep love and interest for him that he thought he could not tear away from them. His heart will incline toward the truth and then he looked as his brethren they opposed it. Was Moses also posted? You are going to understand. Could he tear away from those who had stood side by side with him in proclamation of the Jesus? He thought they they surely would not lead him astray. The last one, God suffered him to fall under the power of Satan, the dominion of death, and hid him in the grave for those who were constantly drawing him from the truth. Moses aired as he was about to enter the promised. So also I saw that William Miller aired as he was soon to enter the heavenly in suffering his influence to the against the truth. Others led him to this. Others must account for it. But angels watched the precious death of this servant and he will come forth at the sound of the last triumph. Praise God. Will we meet William in heaven? Praise God. Others will be accountable. Others will are going to be what? To be accountable. It means that there's a a serious striking similarity between the uh between the Israelites and also between the advent of the Millerite movement. I know my time is spent, but when I'm coming, I will look for the Miller associates and the menite crying. As I go to the division of the Millerite movement, we're going to in that division looking to the division in the Millerite movement. I leave the Millerite movement. I come to the sabatarian what Adventist Sabatarian Adventist. I know I'm I'm going to the birth of the remnant church and we the bath of the remnant church contain a lot of things. I know there is where to the bath and the progress of the remnant church. We want to look our birth. We want our church back. Praise God. We are crying to God that God may you give us our church back. But we we are going to look that what is that our church? What is that our church? It will get time. I know I'm going to look the found you know we are being told that the foundation of our when we want to look our foundation it is the in the great adventist movement of the year 1840 to the year 1844. Let can I should conclude at that point then let's everyone have a question I I shall pray then I give that time can we pray and God in heaven glory honor and adoration be unto thee and thy son the plan of redemption that thou have set that we might be redeemed unto the perfect image of thy son. Thank you for clearly showing us the striking illustration, the parallel of the Israelites and the Adventist movement and also of the little bit of Millerite movement. You know, if time will allow as we are continuing the lesson of the church heritage, we will clearly understand the Millerite movement and all questions. May you help us to settle in. Above all, God in heaven, help the teachers that are coming before me and let all these things be printed in our mind. For I pray in Jesus name. [Music]

TIMESTAMPED TRANSCRIPT:
[0.2s] We are going to determine why and we
[2.2s] going to ask ourselves will be in heaven
[4.6s] and if he be in heaven it will be happy.
[6.5s] We are going to deterine will be in
[8.5s] heaven. We being told about William
[10.3s] Miller. As a little boy, William Miller
[12.7s] lived on a farm in eastern New York. And
[15.8s] on and let me read
[20.1s] 16.3
[22.3s] 16
[23.9s] AP BP AP
[29.6s] BP AP BP. Sir, you are also going to
[34.0s] write that William was a Baptist. He was
[37.4s] in Baptist church. He was a Baptist. And
[40.6s] I want to read to you because William
[42.6s] Miller, we're being told that at one
[44.6s] time when God is using William Miller,
[47.0s] there reach a time that William Miller
[48.8s] discarded or William Miller at one point
[51.8s] neglected or doubted the principle of
[54.1s] the B of the Bible whom God
[57.9s] used to establish the foundation of our
[60.8s] faith. There was at one time he doubted
[64.3s] the principles of God or the Bible of
[66.6s] God, the Bible of God. And when we will
[69.1s] look at it parallel to the Israelites to
[72.9s] the uh the parallel of the or Israelites
[75.8s] movement, we are going to determine some
[77.9s] of the sweet things. And we being told
[79.8s] that when William Miller when he was a
[82.2s] youth, he he came in contact with those
[85.4s] who neglected the oracles of God. The
[89.2s] day east
[91.5s] Let me read. William Miller had a strong
[94.8s] religious background but he become
[97.5s] attached to the wrong crowd. His friends
[101.0s] were ded. The these people set aside the
[104.9s] Bible and had valued idea about God and
[108.8s] his personality.
[111.1s] It means
[115.0s] that that they discarded what the Bible
[118.6s] God and also the personality of God the
[121.4s] personality of God and when William
[123.7s] Miller get in contact with them. William
[126.2s] Miller also take their beliefs and
[129.6s] William Miller also neglected or he did
[132.5s] not what he he did not believe the
[135.8s] oracles of God. The oracles of God. Let
[138.4s] me proceed. But Miller was always a man
[141.8s] of high moral character. What he failed
[144.5s] to find in relig religion he sought to
[147.5s] find in high and patriot patriotic
[151.0s] attainment. He served his country as an
[153.9s] officer in the war in
[156.4s] 1812. So William Miller was an army
[159.1s] officer and the year 1812 he served as
[162.5s] an army officer. I know you should write
[164.2s] those things in 18 of as an early
[167.8s] officer and also he was also a con
[174.9s] constable
[176.6s] sim. Yes. And also he was a justice of
[180.4s] peace. He was he was doing three roles
[184.2s] in that
[186.0s] community in the year 1812.
[189.3s] before that in the year 1812 you're
[192.1s] finding that he did not believe the
[193.4s] oracles of God and he was serving as an
[196.2s] army officer and also when you are
[197.9s] writing you also write that the father
[199.8s] of William Miller was also an army
[202.2s] officer and William Miller also serve as
[204.8s] an army officer is served with
[207.8s] distinction later in home community
[210.8s] served as a justice of
[214.1s] peace and his associations with his
[217.0s] brethren but there A time after the war
[220.5s] in the year
[221.8s] 1812 when brother Miller when that war
[225.1s] was finished the mother of Miller was
[228.2s] widowed and the father of Miller was the
[231.3s] father of milad died finding that Miller
[234.8s] take his time Miller is going back home
[237.8s] that he may stay and be a farmer and
[241.1s] after we are finding that Miller being a
[242.9s] farmer because of his mother because he
[245.6s] loved his mother so much he tried to
[247.8s] take time and go to what? To the Baptist
[250.8s] church. And when you get to the Baptist
[253.4s] church where his uncle was a
[256.4s] preacher, there was no preacher. There
[259.3s] were sometimes even the deacons were
[261.5s] given printed sermon to preach. There
[264.2s] were children given printed sermons to
[266.6s] preach. But William Miller is not like
[269.1s] that. But his
[272.4s] motions, he he really
[275.5s] liked the oracles of God.
[278.6s] But after going to the Baptist church
[281.1s] because of the emotions all because of
[284.1s] being drawn by his mother who was
[285.7s] widowed when he got back home he there
[289.2s] was no preacher in that church. Then
[292.0s] there was one Sunday which William
[293.9s] Miller was given a sermon printed sermon
[296.7s] to go and do what? print and sermon to
[299.0s] go and uh to go and present and after
[301.5s] being given print and sermon William
[305.0s] started to believe the Bible and to ask
[307.4s] the qu the question of the Bible. Let me
[309.9s] uh proceed by
[313.5s] reading when William was 34 years of age
[316.6s] he become dissatisfied with his views.
[318.9s] The Holy Spirit impressed in heart and
[321.6s] it turned to the study of the word of
[323.3s] God. In
[325.8s] this in this book, Jesus was revealed to
[329.2s] him as his savior. He found in Christ
[332.2s] the answer to all his needs. He
[335.0s] determined to study the Bible carefully
[337.6s] and to determine if he could the answer
[340.6s] to many problem that he had perplexed
[343.0s] him. His
[345.5s] studies led him to great prophecies that
[349.1s] pointed to the first and to the second
[351.8s] advent of our law of our Lord. When
[355.0s] William Miller was studying the
[356.2s] prophecy, he go to the study of the
[357.8s] Bible. You're right. In the year
[360.4s] 1816, William Miller started studying
[363.0s] the oracles of God. In the year 1816, he
[366.9s] ventured now to study and to know what
[369.6s] is contained in the word of God, the
[371.7s] word of God. And he was studying step by
[374.6s] step. When Miller Miller started with
[376.8s] Genesis 1 verse one, he cannot go to
[380.0s] Genesis 1 verse number two. Without
[383.5s] understanding Genesis chapter 1 verse
[385.3s] number one,
[389.4s] one without
[391.3s] understanding it's saying the time
[393.7s] prophesied interested him particularly
[395.8s] the prophecies of Daniel and
[399.5s] Revelation. He studied and what did
[402.3s] William Miller use when studying the
[404.4s] Bible? There were William Miller rules
[408.1s] in studying the B the Bible. He had
[410.3s] rules and there's a book written by
[412.0s] William Miller on rules of interpreting
[414.2s] the Bible in the blue estate. If you
[416.5s] find time get time to study the rules
[419.6s] but he was using something called
[424.1s] conudin or conco concordance. Do we know
[427.1s] the concordance?
[433.4s] explain that was the Bible. What was
[435.6s] Miller using or the
[438.4s] crudence or
[440.8s] concordance and very interesting that
[444.2s] when William Miller was studying Daniel
[446.0s] and Revelation, he read them. But while
[449.8s] getting to the book of Daniel 8 verse
[451.8s] number
[452.8s] 14, the foundation of the Adventist
[455.4s] movement is being established.
[457.8s] In the only Daniel 8 verse number 14 is
[460.6s] what has made a seventh day advent. Let
[463.1s] us read Daniel 8 verse number
[468.2s] 14. Daniel 8 verse number
[471.7s] 14. The Bible
[474.7s] says and he said unto
[477.4s] him unto
[480.5s] 2,300 days then shall the sanctuary be
[484.3s] cleansed. When William Miller reached in
[487.0s] Daniel 8 verse number
[489.2s] 14, God has been sending his his angels
[492.6s] to guide to instructing in the oracles
[495.6s] of God. But when he reached the year 18,
[498.6s] he reached what? Daniel 8:14, William
[501.4s] read that unto
[503.0s] 2,300 days shall the sanctuary
[508.0s] be then interpreted that the sanctuary
[510.7s] is the church and that church is in this
[514.2s] earth. So it means that after
[517.3s] 2,300 days this earth will be clear
[521.0s] cleansed. It means that when this earth
[523.7s] is going to be cleansed, it is going to
[525.8s] be cleansed with fire. And when he was
[528.9s] also reading the Bible, he is finding
[531.0s] that that is the it means that the
[533.0s] second advent of of Christ, it means
[537.0s] then William Miller
[539.1s] interpreted that what will be the end of
[541.9s] this 2,300
[544.8s] days? What was the the end of this
[548.0s] 2,300
[550.9s] days? Then he tried to interpret. I want
[553.5s] you to write the first interpretation of
[555.4s] Miller.
[557.0s] The first interpretation of
[559.3s] me. The first interpretation of me. Let
[562.2s] me go to 16 number five as I tell you
[565.4s] something. It say uh the book that I was
[567.8s] reading it say that in the year 1818. So
[571.6s] you're right. He started reading the
[574.3s] Bible
[575.6s] 1816 and the year
[578.2s] 1818 he reached the conclusion that
[582.8s] after after how many
[586.7s] days? 18:18 that Christ will be coming
[590.3s] how many days before him? 25 day 25
[594.2s] years within 25 years Christ will be
[597.6s] coming. You write that 1818 read that
[601.4s] after 25 years Christ will be coming.
[606.1s] He come to the conclusion that Christ
[608.2s] will come sometimes in the year 1843 or
[612.7s] 1844. And you read that between you
[616.1s] write March 25, 1843 to March 21st
[622.1s] 1844 Christ will be coming between those
[624.9s] days between those days between those
[627.4s] months that Christ will be coming. That
[630.0s] was the first interpretation of me not
[634.1s] 1844 not October 1844. No the is first
[638.4s] interpretation was that from March
[641.1s] 1821st to
[643.6s] March March 21st
[646.4s] 1844 Christ will be
[650.0s] coming. Christ will be coming. That was
[653.4s] his first interpretation.
[657.4s] And uh me I think that if I was in the
[660.6s] time of William I could have believed. I
[663.6s] want to I want to establish for you why
[667.0s] because William studied thoroughly the
[669.5s] Bible. There were signs of time that
[671.6s] way. I've taken time that we may read we
[674.0s] may sing Psalm
[675.6s] 212 and I will read it once more and try
[679.2s] to to tell you what was it evidence and
[682.5s] try to ask you that if it was you could
[684.8s] you not believe
[687.0s] then let me let me proceed then that in
[691.0s] the year 18 in the year
[693.3s] 1818 that it was the conclusion of of
[696.3s] William Miller that in 25 years Christ
[698.2s] will appear. Can you put for me great
[699.9s] controversy page
[702.8s] 329.2
[705.0s] 329.2 that we may read together as we
[708.2s] proceed. GC
[712.9s] 329.2
[715.6s] GC329.2 I'm only reading the first word
[718.6s] she's
[719.4s] saying you see 329.2 two, he had devoted
[723.3s] two years to the study of the Bible when
[726.6s] in
[727.9s] 1818 he reached the solemn conviction
[731.4s] that in about 24 years Christ will
[735.0s] appear for the redemption of his people.
[738.6s] Are we okay? That in about 24 years
[742.2s] Christ will be appear for redemption of
[744.0s] his what? Of his people. Are we see CCP
[747.5s] we are preaching that Christ will
[748.8s] appear? It is soon to appear also. This
[751.9s] the message that we are preaching is the
[754.1s] message that William Miller
[756.9s] preached. William Miller preached. But
[760.7s] when William Miller the conclusion in
[762.6s] the year 1818, he started sharing it to
[765.8s] his friend that Christ will appear 25
[768.9s] years later. But he had not he did not
[771.8s] publicly pronounce he did not publicly
[774.7s] go and start preaching that Christ is
[777.7s] coming. But he said that what if I'm in
[781.7s] error? What if I'm in error? What if I
[784.6s] mislead souls? That was the question
[787.9s] which was disturbing William and he
[790.5s] start discussing it with friends. But in
[793.8s] the year 1831 is the first time that
[797.0s] William Miller go publicly to
[800.4s] what to proclaim that Christ is coming.
[803.7s] Right. In the year 1831, in the year
[807.5s] 1831, in the year 1831, then William in
[811.4s] the first time publicly give the reason
[813.4s] of his faith. How many years from year
[816.4s] 1816 to the year 1831? How many years
[819.8s] did he devoted in studying the
[821.8s] scriptures before publicly pronouncing?
[826.1s] It is 15 years.
[830.2s] Maybe maybe someone is taking one month
[833.4s] and another could really that Christ is
[836.2s] coming. But William Miller devoted 15
[838.3s] years before publicly proclaiming and
[841.8s] the William Miller heart was being
[844.3s] disturbed. God was talking to William
[846.4s] Miller that go and proclaim to my people
[849.9s] the message that I have given you.
[853.0s] William Miller was not in heresy but God
[856.3s] sent his angel to guide William Miller.
[859.1s] He was not in what?
[861.2s] Heresy. He was not in heresy. And we're
[865.0s] being told that after William Miller,
[867.0s] there was a time that when he was
[869.0s] talking to God, he's saying that God,
[871.4s] when I will be called, when I will be
[874.2s] called to preach this truth, I will do,
[877.1s] I will go. And on that on that time, on
[879.8s] that day, there was a Baptist preacher
[882.5s] who came and invited him to preach a
[885.0s] sermon. And that was the first time in
[887.2s] the year 1831 that you do what? You take
[890.5s] time to establish the reason of his
[892.2s] faith. And also that is in the great
[894.0s] controversy page 330 paragraph number
[896.5s] two. You
[897.6s] write great controversy page 330. The
[901.3s] paragraph is paragraph number two. And I
[904.6s] will read as it ends as it ends. I'm not
[907.9s] going for uh 1831. Are you seeing for 9
[912.2s] years?
[913.9s] Let me start with let me start the
[916.9s] words. The words you
[919.8s] can the words were
[922.3s] ever recurring to his mind. These were
[925.5s] the words which angels were telling the
[927.1s] William go and tell it to the world.
[932.2s] Their blood will I require at thy who
[935.7s] guided
[938.1s] William? It means that God guided that
[941.4s] he was he was coming in the year 18 but
[944.3s] he forced
[947.4s] through the ministation of the holy
[948.8s] angels we will read the in the writings
[951.3s] I know we are coming it's saying for 9
[954.0s] years he waited the burden still
[956.9s] pressing upon his soul until in 1831 he
[961.1s] for the first time publicly gave the
[964.0s] reason of his
[966.2s] way publicly gave the reason of is what
[969.2s] is faith that is in the year
[971.2s] 1831 and from that
[973.9s] time was being called from every hand
[977.0s] from every every hand and he was alone
[980.8s] we going to determine that it is until
[984.1s] 18 1838 that we find another associate
[988.0s] of William but for all those what 1831
[991.0s] to
[991.9s] 183 1839 how many years 8 years he was
[996.5s] only preaching alone we are going to
[998.6s] find the associates of William Miller.
[1000.5s] But that was in the year 1831 he first
[1004.2s] publicly given the reason of his faith
[1006.9s] and also right in the year
[1008.8s] 1843. In the year
[1012.7s] 1843 in the year
[1015.6s] 1843 that is great controversy. You can
[1018.1s] move to great controversy 332.1.
[1023.8s] 332.1 it says that in
[1027.3s] 1833 Miller received a license to preach
[1031.0s] from the Baptist church of which he was
[1034.4s] a member. So we are writing the year
[1037.2s] 1833 William received a license as a
[1040.9s] minister of the Baptist church to preach
[1044.2s] after him giving the evidence of his
[1046.0s] faith that truly Christ is coming 25
[1049.7s] years before me. Christ is coming. He
[1052.8s] received a license. A large number of
[1055.2s] ministers of Islam denomination also
[1058.6s] approved his work and he it was with
[1061.6s] their formal sanction that he continue
[1063.8s] his labor. He received what alliances. I
[1066.8s] know I will try when we are looking for
[1069.0s] the birth and the progress of the
[1071.3s] remnant church. We will look about the
[1073.3s] ordination and the credentials also in
[1075.5s] the seventh adventist church because we
[1077.6s] are having ordination and credential
[1080.1s] Sabbath before us. And I would like that
[1082.7s] before we reach on that Sabbath where we
[1084.8s] will have ordination and credential, we
[1086.9s] will try to look the birth and the
[1089.1s] progress of seventh adventist about
[1091.6s] ordination, about credentials and about
[1094.7s] who to be ordained, who to baptize, why
[1097.6s] baptism, if I will only find time. But
[1100.2s] William Miller was given license in the
[1102.1s] year 1833 by the Baptist church,
[1105.0s] recognized by ministers and members of
[1107.6s] what? Members of his church. And I know
[1111.7s] we have been reading it is Christ in his
[1114.4s] sanctuary
[1118.6s] 87.1. This is the foundation of faith. C
[1122.1s] I H SS
[1129.8s] 87.1 C IH
[1133.1s] SS87 number one he said the the
[1136.5s] scripture above all
[1139.9s] other the scriptures which above all
[1142.5s] other had been both the foundation and
[1145.2s] the central pillar of the Adventist
[1147.5s] faith. So what is our foundation? Our
[1150.2s] central pillar. You know I can talk of
[1152.4s] the Adventist movement but when I do not
[1155.5s] look the foundation when I do not pass
[1158.2s] to William Miller and the winnerite
[1160.1s] movement I have not talk of the
[1162.1s] Adventist movement. And I want you to
[1164.0s] have a clear understanding. It say that
[1166.1s] the scripture above all other had been
[1169.0s] both the foundation and the central pill
[1171.1s] of the Adventist way. What the is
[1173.1s] correlation and to 2,300 days since then
[1177.9s] shall the sanctuary be cleansed. That is
[1180.3s] our foundation. That is our central
[1182.6s] pill. It means that when you want to
[1184.8s] finish the seven adventist church, don't
[1187.0s] go to the personality of
[1188.8s] God. Don't go don't go to the Sabbath,
[1192.9s] but come unto our central pill. You only
[1196.8s] remove what? You only remove the
[1198.3s] sanctuary and the adventist movement is
[1201.4s] finished. And when you come also with
[1204.8s] 2520 that is sanctuary you have removed
[1207.5s] what? You have removed seventh
[1209.8s] adventist. Why am I saying
[1213.0s] so? That was unto the declaration of
[1215.8s] 2,300 days of the sanctuary be cleansed.
[1218.4s] That is our central pillar of the
[1221.4s] Adventist movement. When you do not
[1223.6s] understand that, read with me. Ali
[1225.6s] writing 63. Ali writing
[1229.6s] 63.2. 63.2. I want you to post it in
[1233.0s] screen quickly. Ali writing 63.
[1238.8s] 63.2. I want you to read with me. Ali
[1241.4s] writing 63. Paragraph is paragraph
[1244.4s] number two. And
[1248.3s] readly read. It say, can you read with
[1251.8s] me? Uh, but such subjects of the
[1255.6s] sanctuary in connection with 2300 days,
[1260.2s] the commandment of God and the per and
[1263.2s] the faith of Jesus are perfectly
[1265.5s] calculated to explain the past Adventist
[1269.1s] movement and show what our present
[1271.7s] position is. When we want to look the
[1274.9s] past Adventist movement and our history,
[1277.8s] we go to the sanctuary and 2300 days as
[1282.1s] we are connecting with three angels
[1283.8s] message about the commandment of God and
[1286.4s] the faith of Jesus. That is our
[1290.3s] foundation. That is our foundation. And
[1293.2s] when William Miller was doing what was
[1296.4s] establishing his faith, there was a book
[1299.4s] written by William being written science
[1302.3s] of times. When it was written science of
[1305.0s] time of January 1843, William Miller
[1308.3s] read
[1309.6s] this said this word. He said I want to
[1313.3s] quote you for the words of William
[1314.9s] Miller, not mine. is saying that I am
[1317.4s] fully
[1319.9s] convinced that I am fully
[1323.2s] convinced I don't know I let me project
[1326.2s] for you it is being written a prophet
[1328.2s] among you a p a y a prophet among you
[1333.1s] know I will take much of the time also
[1334.6s] reading prophet a prophet among you it's
[1336.3s] a serious book if you go to blue estate
[1339.3s] you will see you write a p a y a prophet
[1342.6s] among you 193 paragraph number
[1345.8s] Can you hear these words of William
[1347.1s] Miller? When William Miller stand to
[1348.5s] preach, no man can gain
[1350.7s] say with the oracles and I want to
[1353.2s] establish the sermon of William Miller.
[1356.2s] AP AY
[1358.4s] 193.1 Can you put we read together with
[1361.3s] my friends? It is not there. Let me read
[1363.9s] as you searching in the other world.
[1366.9s] AP AE read in signs of times of January
[1370.6s] 25, 1843, William Miller declared, I am
[1374.6s] fully convinced that sometime between
[1378.0s] March 21st, 1843 and March 25, 1844,
[1383.1s] according to the Jewish mode of
[1386.5s] computation of time, Christ will come.
[1390.6s] The months of 1843 and 1844 rolled by
[1394.5s] with increased expectancy on the part of
[1397.6s] the believers in the advent. The
[1400.2s] proceeding were watched by many
[1402.2s] unbelieving of sabans and kept skeptism
[1405.4s] prejudice or moary grieve. William
[1408.6s] Miller is writing that in January 25
[1411.1s] that I'm fully convinced that March 21st
[1414.8s] 1843 to March 21st 1844 Christ will
[1418.9s] appear. But there were a lot of
[1421.4s] prejudices. There were lot of
[1423.7s] skepticism. But the sad thing that the
[1427.0s] years the mans keep scrolling that when
[1430.6s] they were looking in
[1432.6s] 1843 1844 21st they are not seeing
[1436.7s] Christ
[1438.3s] coming but there was something there was
[1441.0s] a point which William
[1444.1s] me because let me read may you mark this
[1448.1s] my word he's saying the majority however
[1451.4s] although discouraged and
[1453.3s] disappointed I'm reading my quote which
[1455.4s] I I put it say the majority however
[1458.2s] although discourage and disappointment
[1460.6s] still believed that the advent was to be
[1463.4s] expected at any moment praise God that
[1466.9s] in the first word the first
[1468.3s] interpretation of me the first
[1470.4s] interpretation of me we are being told
[1472.5s] that people were not being discouraged
[1474.6s] by the great
[1475.6s] disappointment but they believe that in
[1479.0s] a moment later Christ is going to appear
[1483.2s] it's say that manfully Miller admitted
[1487.0s] that he had been in error but he also
[1490.2s] called the believer's attention to Abak
[1493.3s] 2:3 let us read when 1840
[1497.6s] uh vers 25 1844 passed William came and
[1502.7s] read in the book of Abak 2:3 that indeed
[1507.4s] I am correct when I'm looking for the
[1509.2s] signs of times I'm seeing that Christ is
[1511.9s] going to appear
[1513.4s] When I'm reading the sun, I'm reading
[1515.1s] the stars. Christ is really going to do
[1517.0s] what? To appear. But 25 1844 is passing.
[1521.4s] They are not seeing any moment that
[1522.9s] Christ is doing what? Christ is coming.
[1525.4s] Then he's going to use scripture and
[1527.4s] will a man of scriptures, a man of
[1529.8s] evidences come to the book of Habac 2:3
[1533.1s] and try also to start encouraging his
[1535.4s] people that the vision is for the time
[1537.9s] appointed. Yet the vision may yet Christ
[1541.2s] is going to but it is for appointed
[1544.2s] time. Let you read with me saying for
[1547.6s] the vision is yet for an time appointed
[1550.1s] uh for appointed time but at the end of
[1553.5s] it shall pick and not lie though it t
[1558.2s] wait for it because it will surely come
[1561.8s] it will not t that you know from March
[1566.3s] 21st to 1844 they were entering
[1568.8s] something called the taring the ting
[1571.0s] time have you ever read about the taring
[1573.1s] time and also So because I I will get to
[1577.9s] to I will get time to speak about the
[1580.2s] the midnight cry and also when we are
[1582.9s] looking about the Matthew 25 verse
[1584.6s] number one as we going down about the 10
[1586.8s] virgins there was also a ting
[1590.0s] time about the ting time the also the
[1594.2s] adventist movement they enter what is
[1596.3s] called the ting
[1598.4s] time they are being told that the vision
[1601.0s] is for appointed time yet it may be
[1603.5s] delayed But it will come. It will come.
[1606.6s] They enter the tearing time. And in that
[1608.8s] turning time, in that period is what we
[1611.2s] are also finding the midnight cry. I
[1612.8s] know I'm going to read when I get time,
[1615.1s] I will read about the midnight cryog
[1618.3s] that I may bring it to your mind. Then
[1620.1s] it continued by saying the vision though
[1623.3s] it
[1624.2s] t because it will surely come soon. The
[1627.7s] adventist papers were filled with
[1629.6s] reference to the ting time that from the
[1632.2s] year 184 March 25 every papers was being
[1635.8s] written a topic called the ting time. It
[1639.0s] continued by saying speak of Christ
[1641.2s] parable of the 10 virgin. Millerite
[1643.7s] lecture suddenly discovered that BC to
[1647.8s] AD system of
[1650.0s] chronology allowed no zero
[1655.5s] year that when William Miller was trying
[1658.5s] to write because I don't want to teach
[1661.3s] on the 2300 days because time is limited
[1665.0s] but we are finding that it started from
[1667.7s] 457 BC then he was prolonging that line
[1672.8s] to the year 1843 he calculated by 2300
[1676.7s] days but he made a mistake of writing
[1679.4s] zero year that was the
[1684.1s] mistake but he come to that indeed
[1687.6s] there's no zero here when you come
[1691.6s] to 1 BC you go to 1 A but
[1698.2s] one
[1699.9s] what 1 BC C one
[1705.6s] Z
[1708.2s] BC but there was not that time then when
[1712.2s] you
[1713.5s] calculate
[1715.3s] 457 2300 days
[1718.8s] in 1840 1843 but I come to
[1726.0s] realing time that Christ is coming in
[1729.0s] the year
[1730.3s] 18 18 what 44 you only had one year then
[1735.0s] you read now the conclusion the present
[1737.4s] standing of me now was indeed when I'm
[1740.4s] looking for the signs of time in the
[1742.6s] year 1844 we are going to seeing the son
[1744.8s] of man coming the son of man
[1748.4s] coming but I want to bring into your
[1751.7s] mind that William Miller was I I don't
[1756.0s] he was correctly interpreting that
[1757.9s] crisis was
[1759.4s] Come here. Let me read for you. I will.
[1763.7s] Can you write a subtopic? The sixth
[1765.5s] seal. What the interpretation of I tried
[1768.6s] to determine to you what William Miller
[1771.1s] established his teaching because not let
[1775.4s] me let us go Revelation 6. When William
[1779.8s] Miller read the book of Revelation, this
[1781.5s] was what he read. William uh Revelation
[1785.7s] 6 verse number 12. And I'm not going to
[1789.1s] read uh I want you now to be keen
[1791.6s] writer. I'm going to read some of the
[1793.8s] scriptures and spirit of prophecy. You
[1795.9s] might not, you may not. Then you are
[1798.3s] going to read at your own your own time.
[1800.5s] But can you see if this is our
[1803.4s] interpretation how William interpreted
[1806.0s] the Bible? He's saying this is a six
[1808.4s] seal and I beheld. You can put it here
[1811.6s] to
[1815.1s] Oh. So read your Bible. Go with me in
[1817.4s] Revelation
[1823.0s] 6:12. Let me tell you that the six we
[1826.2s] have how many
[1827.3s] seals? Seven seal. But what what is of
[1830.0s] the seventh seal? The
[1832.0s] seven. You know
[1834.6s] it the journey to
[1837.6s] heaven. It is being talked about journey
[1839.7s] to heaven. It means that indeed now we
[1842.6s] are on the sixth seal. And also when we
[1846.4s] want to understand that Christ is
[1847.8s] coming, we go to the sixth because after
[1849.9s] the sixth in Aisha to Eevee, we are
[1852.9s] going to the journey to heaven. And it
[1855.8s] say Revelation 6:12. And I beheld when
[1860.2s] he had opened the sixth seal, and lo,
[1863.2s] there was
[1864.7s] great, right? The interpretation of
[1868.2s] first, there was
[1870.0s] great, and the sun
[1872.8s] became black as soft clothes of, and the
[1876.7s] moon became as blood. Mhm. And the stars
[1881.4s] of heaven fell unto them even as the fig
[1884.7s] tree
[1886.0s] cast her anti untimely figs when she is
[1890.1s] taken of the mighty wind. So that is the
[1892.9s] sixth scene. The sixth is continue by
[1895.3s] saying and the heaven departed as scroll
[1897.8s] that is the coming of Christ when it is
[1900.2s] rolled together and every mountain and
[1902.7s] Islams were moved on uh of their places
[1906.8s] and the kings of the earth and the great
[1909.5s] men and the rich men of the chief of
[1911.8s] captain and the mighty men everyone
[1914.4s] bondage and everyone free hide
[1916.6s] themselves to the rocks. That is the
[1919.0s] coming of who? The coming of Christ. It
[1921.5s] mean that William is reaching the
[1923.0s] conclusion that the signs of time which
[1925.4s] I'm going to use is Christ is coming and
[1928.2s] when Christ is coming we have not been
[1930.3s] given definite time but Christ was
[1932.5s] telling his disciple about the signs of
[1935.3s] times that after this signs of times
[1938.8s] Christ is coming here in the Christ is
[1941.0s] coming in revelation 6:14 s
[1945.4s] Christ is coming in revelation 6:14 and
[1948.8s] only revelation 6:12 and
[1951.4s] 13 you are being told about the signs of
[1953.7s] times that's why the Millerite song of
[1957.8s] 212 let me read something for you
[1960.9s] Millerite movement song 612 he's saying
[1966.0s] that it is almost time for the Lord to
[1968.6s] come
[1970.4s] 212 it is almost time for the Lord to
[1973.0s] come I hear the people say the stars of
[1975.8s] heaven are growing dim it must be the
[1977.8s] breaking of the day the signs for In the
[1981.0s] sun and moon, in the earth and sea and
[1985.8s] sky, a loud proclaimed to all mankind
[1988.2s] the coming of the master draweth. It
[1990.9s] means that that is their song that
[1993.0s] Christ is coming. When we look for the
[1995.0s] signs in the sky, in the moon, in the
[1998.3s] stars, Christ is coming. We are finding
[2000.6s] some things the interpretation of Mamela
[2002.6s] in the signs of times. Do they happen
[2004.7s] before
[2006.4s] 1844? Can you read first? We are finding
[2008.9s] about first sign which happen is about
[2011.7s] the earthquake that fact the first time
[2014.2s] which means that Christ is coming is
[2016.6s] there will be a
[2018.0s] great earthquake did it happened so you
[2021.4s] write first the great earthquake the
[2023.8s] great earthquake first the great
[2026.3s] earthquake you read we read great
[2028.5s] controversy
[2029.8s] 304.2 GC
[2033.1s] 304.2 GC 304.2 2 you see the
[2037.5s] interpretation of me what happened GC
[2040.9s] 304.2
[2042.8s] We want to see when was correct in his
[2046.4s] interpretation. Three or four paragraph
[2049.3s] is paragraph number two. He's saying
[2053.2s] this these signs of times these signs
[2057.3s] were witnessed before the opening of the
[2059.2s] 9th century. In the fulfillment of this
[2062.6s] prophecy, they occurred in the year
[2065.2s] 1755.
[2067.2s] The most terrible earthquake that has
[2069.8s] ever been recorded. Praise God. So
[2073.6s] before 1844 in the year 1755 there was a
[2077.4s] great earthquake which is being named
[2079.0s] the Lisbon earthquake. Are we okay? That
[2083.4s] is the first signs of times that William
[2085.3s] Miller was doing what William was using.
[2087.8s] So you write though commonly known as
[2090.0s] the earthquake of Lisbon it extended in
[2092.9s] the part of Europe Africa and America it
[2097.6s] was felt in Greenland in the west in
[2101.6s] Indies in the east island of there are
[2106.4s] many country and it was felt it was
[2108.8s] worldwide it means that the first signs
[2111.0s] of time that
[2112.5s] will in the book revelation 6 verse 12
[2116.6s] that there will be great earthquake. So
[2118.4s] you write in the year 1755 the first
[2121.5s] signs of times is the Lisbon Lisbon
[2124.3s] earthquake recorded in great controversy
[2128.2s] 304 it say in revelation 6:12 and I
[2132.3s] beheld when he had opened the sixth seal
[2135.4s] there was a great earthquake and the sun
[2138.1s] became the sun became black as the s
[2141.8s] close of air that is sign number
[2147.9s] These were the interpretation of Miller
[2150.3s] that the sun became blackened as what?
[2154.4s] The sun. When did the sun became
[2156.8s] blackened?
[2162.0s] Huh? You give me evidence. I want
[2164.6s] evidence. Not when did the sun became
[2168.9s] blackened? Read with me. Great
[2170.8s] controversy. I want you to write the
[2176.6s] 306
[2178.8s] 306.1 the blackening of the sun or the
[2181.6s] dark the dark day and moon and moon
[2187.6s] May you write May 17th May 19th
[2191.8s] 178 I want you to go to the last part of
[2194.6s] it 306.1 is
[2204.4s] 6.1 you write on May 19, 1780. That is
[2208.5s] the second time, the second sign which
[2210.6s] is being which we are being told that
[2213.0s] when you shall see the earthquake when
[2216.3s] you shall see a great earthquake not
[2218.8s] only earthquake but a great earthquake
[2220.4s] of Lisbon which happened. William will
[2222.7s] say that Christ is coming. When you
[2224.8s] shall see
[2226.2s] what the the dark day and when the moon
[2229.6s] will become as blah as blood Christ is
[2232.2s] doing what was William Miller wrong
[2234.6s] because this thing happened you it says
[2237.4s] that on 19th of May 1780 this prophecy
[2241.1s] was fulf
[2242.2s] Okay. 19th May 17 18. But there's
[2247.0s] something which is remarkable which I do
[2249.0s] not want to copy it. Let us go to
[2252.4s] Matthew. It is Matthew
[2254.4s] 24:39. Matthew 24:39. You I want you to
[2257.8s] not a point in connection with 12
[2261.0s] because when we are reading of what?
[2263.0s] When we are reading of 2300 days, we are
[2265.7s] finding that also 12 of 60 days is in
[2268.7s] 2300 day days. It means that for William
[2272.1s] Miller to
[2273.6s] understand 2300 days it means also he
[2276.5s] fully understand what 1260 days then
[2280.5s] Matthew which is tens of times when we
[2283.0s] read also when we are
[2284.8s] reading what gospel workers page 148.2
[2288.3s] True. It means that what should be
[2290.0s] brought in the mind of people is the
[2292.3s] book of revelation Daniel and Matthew
[2296.9s] 24.
[2298.5s] Matthew 24. It mean that also used
[2302.2s] Matthew chapter 24. But there's
[2304.1s] something so interesting. Matthew
[2308.2s] 24:29. Read with me keenly in that
[2312.3s] immediately after the tribulation of
[2315.4s] those
[2316.3s] days shall the sun be blackened darkened
[2321.0s] and the moon shall not give her and the
[2325.2s] star shall fall
[2327.1s] from and the powers of the heaven shall
[2330.3s] be and then shall appear the signs of
[2333.3s] the son of man in heaven. It means that
[2335.7s] after Matthew 24:29 Christ is
[2339.2s] appearing. So you what it say that after
[2343.1s] tribulation s and this tribulation it is
[2346.6s] 12 60 days Christ is going to happen.
[2349.7s] What is going to appear? Not a
[2355.1s] Christ the dark
[2357.1s] day. The dark day is India. It means
[2360.1s] that it means that the
[2361.8s] persecution could before what? Before
[2367.3s] 1780 because 1260 days in that the
[2371.6s] persecution
[2373.2s] 1798 but the powers of
[2376.2s] persecution is before what? before
[2379.7s] before 7 before 1780 because Bible is
[2383.1s] not wrong because Christ is saying that
[2386.2s] unless those days be
[2389.2s] shortened no man shall be saved. It
[2392.7s] means that I want you also to write this
[2394.4s] that in the year
[2396.7s] 1776 the year
[2399.2s] 1776 this is SSP the story of the seat
[2404.8s] patos 120 paragraph number
[2408.7s] one 120 paragraph number one 120
[2412.5s] paragraph number I want to read between
[2414.1s] the lines not to take much of the
[2417.9s] time see 120.1 is
[2422.2s] But God in mercy shortened the time of
[2425.6s] persecution. For except those days shall
[2428.3s] be shortened, no flesh shall be saved.
[2430.2s] The persecuting powers of the papacy was
[2432.8s] broken out in
[2434.9s] 1776. It means that before 1798 the
[2437.8s] persecution power was broken but when
[2439.8s] reaching 1780 the sun the sun became
[2443.8s] blackened. I also great controversy also
[2447.0s] 306 number one say you're right because
[2449.9s] my time is spent the 12 of 60 days of
[2453.0s] the year terminated in 1798 that is the
[2456.2s] correct interpretation a quarter of
[2458.5s] century earlier persecution had almost
[2461.7s] wholly ceased following this persecution
[2464.5s] according to the words of Christ so
[2468.4s] 1798US 2573
[2475.3s] It means between 1773 to 1776
[2478.4s] persecution that's why after tribulation
[2480.8s] in 1780 we are being told that the what
[2483.6s] is coming the day to be blah bl you will
[2487.4s] read much but I'm only giving you the
[2489.8s] evidences of William and also the third
[2494.0s] interpretation about the falling of the
[2497.1s] stars so this was his climax that when
[2501.0s] stars in a fall to evil rises at the at
[2505.1s] the door. You read with me great
[2507.0s] controversy
[2508.4s] 333.1 GC 333.1 you write the falling of
[2512.3s] the stars in November 13th you write
[2515.0s] November 13th
[2517.4s] 1833 we are seeing the falling of the
[2521.1s] stars November
[2523.1s] 13th 184 1833 we are seeing the falling
[2526.9s] of the stars after the falling of the
[2529.1s] stars Christ is coming in the year 1844
[2531.7s] was William Miller
[2535.5s] You cannot
[2539.4s] answer this prophecy that is revelation
[2542.7s] 6:13 about the falling of the star. We
[2545.6s] being told that this
[2547.4s] prophecy it say that this prophecy
[2551.8s] received a striking
[2556.2s] of the greatest
[2558.8s] metoic shower of November
[2563.2s] 13,833. You will read as you go
[2565.3s] downward. Meic shower that is what? The
[2567.8s] falling of the stars that was the last
[2570.9s] which was being used. It means that
[2573.6s] William Miller was correct in his
[2575.2s] interpretation that Christ is soon what
[2577.2s] is soon coming. There's also last thing
[2579.5s] that also when William Miller combined
[2582.6s] with his associates which is who which
[2585.0s] is it is Josiah le it is Josiah le uh in
[2589.4s] the because they also interpretated in
[2592.0s] the year
[2593.1s] 1838 that when it will reach August 11
[2596.9s] 1840 there will be the fall of the
[2600.1s] Ottoman Empire that is in the book of
[2602.9s] revelation 9 from verse number 19 to
[2605.3s] verse number 21 and when you come from
[2607.9s] Revelation 9 19-21 when you are going to
[2611.0s] the revelation chapter 10 you are being
[2613.0s] told that they had been given a voice to
[2614.7s] go and proclaim the first and the second
[2617.7s] angels message. So you have read about
[2620.3s] the Ottoman Empire about the church the
[2623.0s] fall of the Ottoman Empire when the
[2625.7s] August 18 August 11 1840 you can write
[2629.5s] that the fall of the Ottoman Empire was
[2631.6s] also the interpretation which happened
[2633.6s] in August 11th
[2636.9s] 1840 if you get time you can read on it
[2640.5s] on SP78.2
[2643.0s] too. You can read the fall of the
[2645.0s] Ottoman Empire which gave them now the
[2647.7s] people now believed that the
[2649.8s] interpretation are what? The
[2651.9s] interpretation are sure. The
[2655.2s] interpretation are sure. It means that
[2658.2s] Miller was correct in his what? In his
[2661.5s] interpretation. William Miller correct
[2663.4s] in his interpretation. It means that God
[2665.7s] had been leading his people. But when we
[2668.8s] will go to understand we will go to that
[2671.4s] where why did not Christ do what? Why
[2673.8s] did not Christ do what did not Christ
[2677.4s] come? And when we want to know our faith
[2681.9s] when we want to know the seventh
[2683.6s] adventist movement it is at the great
[2686.8s] disappointment that seventh adventist
[2689.4s] was esta established. It was through the
[2692.8s] labor of William Miller that our faith
[2695.8s] was
[2697.5s] established because God has been leading
[2699.8s] his
[2701.4s] people. God has been leading his people.
[2703.9s] And I know we will have a subtopic and
[2706.3s] you can also write about about about the
[2709.8s] Miller and Moses. There's a serious
[2712.9s] striking similarity that as Moses
[2716.1s] because I was really impressed by the
[2717.8s] sermon of of brother Maxwell.
[2720.9s] I will read those things once more. I
[2722.6s] will read them once
[2723.9s] more. He give me now easy time of
[2726.8s] explaining the striking similarity of
[2729.2s] the Adventist movement and of the
[2731.6s] Millerite movement and of Miller. He
[2733.8s] tried to explain to me but let me tell
[2735.9s] you that William Miller was correct. And
[2738.8s] when you want to know that our faith is
[2741.2s] being established in the Millerite
[2742.6s] movement, we are also going to look to
[2744.5s] the as Israelites the Israelites
[2747.8s] movement that as God led William Miller.
[2750.8s] So God has led who Moses Moses I know as
[2756.1s] we will be
[2757.2s] going also the birth and the progress of
[2759.8s] the Adventist movement as is apostasy.
[2762.2s] What will help us so much to have the
[2764.3s] correct interpretation is about what?
[2767.1s] It's about the history of the Israelites
[2768.7s] and the Adventist what movement. Can you
[2770.6s] write that? The striking similarity of
[2773.0s] the Israelites and the Adventist
[2775.4s] movement. Striking similarity. I'm only
[2779.0s] going that subtopic and introduction
[2781.6s] then I finish because my time is spent.
[2784.3s] My time is spent for you to give me easy
[2786.3s] time and you go and study for yourself.
[2789.0s] There's something which are being told
[2790.2s] in great controversy page
[2792.9s] 457 conclude we will know. Coming to we
[2798.1s] going to know about the milite movement
[2800.7s] clearly and if I find time we will talk
[2803.3s] of the mill associates someone like
[2806.2s] Josiah
[2808.5s] lech snow
[2813.6s] also Joseph
[2818.6s] snowh who again
[2822.2s] Charles F who again we are going to look
[2825.3s] for Yeah. Yes. James White also was
[2827.5s] associate of William. We will also look
[2829.4s] for the division among the
[2831.1s] milit. The division in the milite
[2833.3s] movement. But read for with me great
[2835.0s] controversy page 457. The paragraph is
[2837.9s] paragraph number one. I think so.
[2841.3s] 457.1. How many minutes do I have?
[2844.9s] 15 minutes. Thank you so much.
[2847.8s] 457 paragraph number one. As I look for
[2851.1s] the the Millerite movement in biblical
[2853.4s] concept. The Millerite movement in
[2855.4s] biblical concept. 457 paragraph is
[2858.2s] paragraph number two. Go with me.
[2859.9s] Paragraph number
[2861.2s] two. Paragraph number
[2863.9s] two. Paragraph number two. He's saying I
[2867.3s] want you to clearly understand this
[2868.6s] quotation because it will help us in our
[2870.8s] study. He's saying we are studying on
[2873.0s] church heritage or the history of the
[2875.0s] church. We're being told that the
[2876.9s] history of the ancient Israelites is a
[2880.2s] striking illustration of the past
[2882.4s] experience of the Adventist
[2885.5s] B. So it means that when you put the
[2888.7s] history of the ancient Israel this side
[2891.6s] and also when you put the history of the
[2893.7s] Adventist movement this side they are
[2895.1s] striking illustration. That's why I
[2897.5s] don't want to go to the midnight cry
[2899.4s] before I come to this that their history
[2901.6s] is parallel. It continued by saying God
[2904.4s] led his people in the adventist movement
[2907.3s] even has he led the children of
[2909.2s] Israelites from Egypt. It means that as
[2913.0s] God led his children in the Adventist
[2915.4s] movement, it is the same way he led his
[2917.7s] children in from Egypt. In the great
[2921.5s] disappointment, you can write one thing
[2923.5s] here because I cannot know because we
[2926.8s] have Egypt
[2928.4s] Syri. We are going to look that it
[2930.7s] resembled the midnight cry. We have the
[2932.6s] Red Sea you can write which resembles
[2936.9s] what the great disappointment. We also
[2940.6s] have what? We have also the rebellion at
[2944.0s] Kesh Bar which happened in the year
[2947.6s] 1888. We have also the apostasy at
[2950.8s] Jordan which is our omega of
[2954.8s] apostasy. Are we clear? which is our
[2958.0s] mega of apostasy. We will
[2961.4s] determine. Let me
[2965.3s] go. In the great disappointment, their
[2968.3s] faith was
[2969.6s] tested as that of the Hebrews in the Red
[2973.5s] Sea. So there is a striking similarity
[2976.5s] in the great disappointment which we
[2978.2s] look and also the testing in the Red
[2980.9s] Sea. It continued by saying that had
[2985.3s] they still trusted to the guiding hand
[2988.1s] that had been with them in their past
[2989.8s] experience, they would have seen the
[2992.9s] salvation of God. If all who had labor
[2995.4s] unitedly in the work in 1844 had
[2998.4s] received the third angel's message and
[3000.6s] proclaimed to the power of the spirit,
[3002.2s] the Lord will have wrote the mighty
[3004.0s] works of their effort effort. It mean
[3007.1s] that when William the third angel's
[3010.6s] message, it mean that we could have been
[3012.6s] in heaven now. Praise God. We could have
[3015.8s] been in what? In heaven. It means that
[3018.1s] when we are looking also for the
[3019.8s] history, we also go to the history of
[3021.8s] the of the of the Israelites and
[3024.9s] understand clearly that this church is a
[3027.4s] church led by God. See church. And yet
[3030.2s] we have just come here to to put our
[3033.8s] things that we believe this and this but
[3035.8s] we we have dived them from the scripture
[3038.7s] 2M
[3040.4s] 399 399.1 number one 2M 399 number
[3048.1s] one 3991 I want you also to understand
[3054.7s] this so I'm not too kind I'm Sorry.
[3061.2s] 3SM
[3063.1s] 3SM399 number one. It
[3067.0s] says
[3069.2s] 3SM3991 is saying that there should be a
[3072.3s] constant walking in
[3074.9s] humility. There there should be no just
[3077.8s] occasion for our Uhhuh. Let me look for
[3080.2s] the the point which I want. The point
[3083.4s] which I
[3084.5s] want the point which I want.
[3088.4s] Mhm.
[3090.2s] the point which I
[3094.0s] want the point which I want but I'm not
[3096.6s] getting in here but we can get it in the
[3098.2s] book education I highlighted it by in
[3101.0s] the book of education 178 I will give
[3103.7s] you that that 3SM but education 178 also
[3107.4s] put it clearly when I'm not finding inm
[3110.2s] let me read in the education education
[3113.4s] 178 number three 178 number three we are
[3116.6s] being told that the history with the
[3119.0s] that am had marked out in his word,
[3122.0s] uniting link after link in the prophetic
[3125.9s] chain from eternity in the past to
[3128.6s] eternity in the future. Tell us where we
[3131.0s] are today in this procession of the ages
[3135.0s] and what may be expected in the time to
[3138.2s] come. All that prophecy had foretold as
[3141.8s] coming to pass and in the present time
[3144.5s] has been traced on the pages of the
[3147.1s] history and we may be assured that all
[3151.1s] we which is yet to come will be
[3153.0s] fulfilled in order. It mean that the
[3155.5s] history which the greater put in the
[3158.5s] ancient Israelites it is a prophetic
[3160.7s] chain. It is a
[3162.4s] chain. It is running in chain after
[3165.0s] chain chain after chain. and also how
[3167.4s] God has led his children. His children
[3171.0s] how God has led his children. Because
[3174.2s] when we are looking for the Adventist
[3176.0s] movement, when we will go to the
[3177.8s] midnight cry, we are finding that when
[3180.0s] God when we think about Israelites, we
[3183.5s] are seeing only
[3184.8s] Moses. So no one can mention Israelites
[3188.2s] before mentioning Mo Moses. Am I okay?
[3191.9s] Also no one can mention seventh
[3193.8s] adventist without talking of the
[3196.0s] Millerite movement. Without talking on
[3199.2s] the Millerite movement. Can you write
[3200.6s] the parallel of Moses and me? As I
[3203.4s] finishing that the parallel of Moses and
[3205.9s] me that I may have easy time in the next
[3208.5s] lesson not to have much of time. The
[3210.4s] parallel of Moses and Miller. I know you
[3212.7s] have right about Miller being army
[3215.7s] officer and becoming a farmer. If you
[3218.5s] read alo it is also being told in one
[3220.5s] bio 19.4.
[3221.9s] about the army officer and then becoming
[3223.8s] a farm in but there's a parallel of
[3228.0s] Moses and Miller first you should write
[3231.0s] that both were called by God to lead his
[3234.2s] people both were called by God to lead
[3237.7s] his people Moses to lead God first
[3241.1s] church and Miller to lead God's last
[3244.2s] remnant church are we okay that as God
[3248.2s] called Miller to lead God's remnant
[3250.6s] church as also God called Moses to lead
[3252.8s] his church from the wilderness. We are
[3255.8s] going to see how they were were they
[3257.8s] called. Number two, that both were
[3261.9s] intelligent. Both were intelligent. Both
[3266.0s] were intelligent. The book CTR
[3268.8s] 100 CDR
[3272.6s] 100 CDR both were intelligent.
[3276.8s] CTR page number
[3282.0s] 100. Thank
[3285.5s] you. CTR page 100 number three is saying
[3289.3s] that Moses was a man of
[3291.6s] intelligence and God in
[3294.4s] purpose in his providence placed him
[3297.2s] where he could acquire knowledge and
[3299.8s] fitness for the great work. He was
[3303.0s] thoroughly educated as a general when he
[3306.1s] went out to meet his enemy.
[3309.2s] William was an
[3313.3s] army. He was an army officer. And also
[3318.0s] Moses first he was intelligent. Number
[3321.4s] two he was educated in in military
[3326.0s] training. He was educated in military
[3329.8s] training. Are we seeing that second
[3334.1s] parallel striking similarity? Are we
[3337.0s] seeing it? That striking
[3346.7s] similarity the same. Amen. Are we seeing
[3350.0s] that similarity? Both were called by
[3352.9s] God. Both both were intelligent. Let me
[3356.3s] read for you of William GC. You you you
[3360.4s] confirm
[3362.5s] GC37.2 Great Controversy
[3366.3s] 317.2 Great Controversy page 317
[3369.0s] paragraph 2. Can you see
[3372.4s] this? William Moses was intelligent.
[3376.3s] Number two, he was trained in military
[3380.0s] training or he was trained as a general
[3382.8s] of the army officers. Read this GC
[3387.7s] 317.2.
[3389.4s] William Miller, he had a sound physical
[3391.8s] constitution and even in childhood he
[3394.9s] gave evidence of more than ordinary
[3398.0s] intellectual train. Praise God. Was
[3401.4s] Millia
[3402.7s] intelligent? Was Moses
[3405.5s] intelligent? Was Miller an army
[3408.4s] officer? Was was Moses an army officer?
[3412.6s] Was were they educated in military line?
[3416.2s] It means that we are we are on the right
[3418.6s] path of calling ourself Israelites
[3421.0s] movement syndrome. You write point
[3422.7s] number three. Read point number three.
[3426.2s] Read point number three. Both were uh
[3428.8s] taught and protected by
[3431.0s] angels. Both were taught and protected
[3433.7s] by angels. Both were taught by and
[3436.6s] protected by
[3437.8s] angels. PP
[3439.9s] 245 paragraph number two. PP 245
[3443.4s] paragraph number two.
[3446.8s] PP 245 paragraph number two. Can you
[3450.2s] see 245 paragraph number two is saying
[3454.2s] that the the elders of Israelites were
[3457.4s] taught the elders of Israeli Israel were
[3461.6s] taught by angels that the time for their
[3464.6s] deliverance was near and that Moses to
[3467.2s] accomp that Moses was the man whom God
[3470.3s] will employ to accomplish this work.
[3474.0s] Angels
[3475.7s] instructed Moses also that Jehovah had
[3480.1s] chosen him to break the bondage of his
[3482.8s] people. Who instructed
[3485.5s] Moses? Who instructed Moses? What about
[3488.9s] William Miller? Ali writings 229. You
[3493.1s] see these are some of the simple
[3496.1s] striking
[3497.2s] similarity. Ali writings 229. Can you
[3500.2s] see this also? Can you see this also?
[3503.5s] You know that we are
[3506.6s] 229 paragraph number one. Can you see
[3509.8s] it's saying that God sent his angel to
[3514.3s] move upon the heart of what? A farmer
[3517.2s] who had not believed the B the Bible to
[3520.9s] lead him to search the prophecy. Angels
[3523.5s] of God repeated revisited that chosen
[3526.2s] one to guard his mind and to open to his
[3529.8s] understanding the prophecies which has
[3532.1s] ever been dark to the to God's people.
[3535.5s] Those were instructed and taught by
[3538.9s] angels. Another one let me ask you first
[3542.3s] William was a military Moses was also
[3545.8s] military.
[3549.7s] What is
[3568.2s] agricult? It means that everything will
[3570.6s] be okay. Let me read the last one.
[3575.1s] This I will read. Both s not the
[3577.0s] promised land and both are going to
[3580.1s] heaven. Praise God. Both s not the
[3583.8s] promised land but both are all going to
[3588.2s] we are going to meet William Miller in
[3590.0s] heaven. Praise God. But Moses is in
[3592.2s] heaven right now. Let me give you one
[3595.2s] evidence. Early writings p 257 258. You
[3598.7s] also understand that as we are
[3600.8s] understanding that there's a striking
[3602.4s] similarity between William Miller and
[3604.7s] Moses Oen White understood it that way.
[3607.8s] Early writings page page 250
[3612.6s] 258 258 paragraph number one as I
[3616.7s] conclude as I go to conclusion it say
[3621.4s] this was a mistake done by William
[3623.7s] Miller but there's something which
[3625.4s] happened let me read I will start with
[3627.2s] paragraph number one you go with me mark
[3629.4s] that point they read clearly read
[3631.8s] clearly it's saying that if William
[3634.5s] Miller have seen the light of the third
[3637.0s] angel's message. Many things which look
[3639.5s] dark and mysterious to him would have
[3642.2s] been explained. But his brethren
[3645.0s] professed so deep love and interest for
[3647.5s] him that he thought he could not tear
[3651.0s] away from them. His heart will incline
[3653.7s] toward the truth and then he looked as
[3656.1s] his brethren they opposed it. Was Moses
[3659.3s] also posted? You are going to
[3661.8s] understand. Could he tear away from
[3664.3s] those who had stood side by side with
[3666.3s] him in proclamation of the Jesus? He
[3669.5s] thought they they surely would not lead
[3673.0s] him astray. The last one, God suffered
[3677.0s] him to fall under the power of Satan,
[3679.9s] the dominion of
[3681.6s] death, and hid him in the grave for
[3684.6s] those who were constantly drawing him
[3686.4s] from the truth. Moses aired as he was
[3690.9s] about to enter the
[3692.7s] promised. So also I saw that William
[3695.9s] Miller aired as he was soon to enter the
[3700.0s] heavenly in suffering his influence to
[3702.9s] the against the truth. Others led him to
[3705.8s] this. Others must account for it. But
[3708.9s] angels watched the precious death of
[3711.8s] this servant and he will come forth at
[3714.6s] the sound of the last triumph. Praise
[3716.2s] God. Will we meet William in heaven?
[3719.9s] Praise God. Others will be
[3722.4s] accountable. Others will are going to be
[3724.7s] what? To be accountable. It means that
[3726.6s] there's a a serious striking similarity
[3729.9s] between the uh between the Israelites
[3733.4s] and also between the advent of the
[3735.8s] Millerite movement. I know my time is
[3738.1s] spent, but when I'm coming, I will look
[3740.7s] for the Miller associates and the menite
[3743.1s] crying. As I go to the division of the
[3745.4s] Millerite movement, we're going to in
[3747.0s] that division looking to the division in
[3749.5s] the Millerite movement. I leave the
[3751.5s] Millerite movement. I come to the
[3753.3s] sabatarian what
[3755.2s] Adventist Sabatarian Adventist. I know
[3757.7s] I'm I'm going to the birth of the
[3759.9s] remnant church and we the bath of the
[3762.2s] remnant church contain a lot of things.
[3763.9s] I know there is where
[3766.8s] to the bath and the progress of the
[3769.3s] remnant church. We want to look our
[3772.0s] birth. We want our church back. Praise
[3774.1s] God. We are crying to God that God may
[3776.9s] you give us our church
[3778.5s] back. But we we are going to look that
[3781.4s] what is that our church? What is that
[3783.5s] our church? It will get time. I know I'm
[3786.6s] going to look the found you know we are
[3788.4s] being told that the foundation of our
[3790.8s] when we want to look our foundation it
[3793.1s] is the in the great adventist movement
[3795.4s] of the year 1840 to the year
[3799.2s] 1844. Let can I should conclude at that
[3803.0s] point then let's everyone have a
[3805.5s] question I I shall pray then I give that
[3808.3s] time can we
[3819.8s] pray and God in heaven glory honor and
[3823.3s] adoration be unto thee and thy son the
[3826.1s] plan of redemption that thou have set
[3827.9s] that we might be redeemed unto the
[3829.4s] perfect image of thy son. Thank you for
[3832.1s] clearly showing us the striking
[3834.5s] illustration, the parallel of the
[3836.8s] Israelites and the Adventist movement
[3838.4s] and also of the little bit of Millerite
[3840.8s] movement. You know, if time will allow
[3843.0s] as we are continuing the lesson of the
[3844.6s] church heritage, we will clearly
[3846.6s] understand the Millerite movement and
[3848.2s] all questions. May you help us to settle
[3850.1s] in. Above all, God in heaven, help the
[3852.7s] teachers that are coming before me and
[3855.2s] let all these things be printed in our
[3857.0s] mind. For I pray in Jesus name.
