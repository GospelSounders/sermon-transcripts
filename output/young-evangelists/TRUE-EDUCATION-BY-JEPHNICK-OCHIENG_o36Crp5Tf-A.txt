FULL TRANSCRIPT:
obedience to God at the end of the presentation we realized that there's another kind of education that aim is to seek first the kingdom of God and all shall be added unto us then the Lord the Lord was calling us to join the second the second system of Education that a being Obed to God and seeking fast his kingdom and righteousness today I want us to look something on Christ because our gospel in centered upon the ministry of Christ yesterday during the class of gospel order we were taught that we need to preach or present things in according to the order of Christ and therefore Christ is the standard of everything and therefore gospel should uplift Christ [Music] today in the class of true education I want us to check something on Christ because the book of isah 53 shows me how Christ was sacrificed as a [Music] lamb and Christ gave himself to come and die for you and me and the bigger thing that we are striving for is that to have the character of Christ because God only accept the righteousness of Christ because Christ was in a perfect demand of the law so if that righteousness of Christ can be imputed into us then God is going to accept us now I want us to look upon Christ the book of second Peter second Peter chapter 22 chapter 2 let me check if it is first Peter there's something I want it is first Peter 2: 21 allow me begin with vers 20 if you are together with me in the book of First Peter please say amen amen verse 20 says for what glory is it for what glory is it if if when he be buffed buff buffed for your faults he shall take it patiently but if when he do well and suffer for it he take it patiently this is acceptable and with God verse 21 says for even here unto we are he called because Christ also suffered for us leaving us an example that he should follow his steps amen [Music] amen God is good my point is in verse 21 that Christ also suffered for us now leaving as an example that follow his step now for us to be Christians for us to be those who are going to heaven we have to follow the steps of by the way the characteristics of the we are told they do what about the lamp amen they follow the lamp Wherever by the way you go to the Book of Revelation chapter 15 you realized that those who overcome the beast at his image the Bible says that the name of the father and the lamp was upon their forehead and we also realize that the name can also be used to show character and therefore they are going to have the character of Christ now Christ left us an example for us to follow I'm in the class of verse 22 says who did no sin neither was found in his [Music] mouth amen so we need to be like Christ we need to have the humility of Christ we need to have that kindness of Christ and by that if we bring Christ into our gospel then Min are going to be converted now I want us to take an example that Christ left step that he left for us follow me to the Book of Luke Luke 2 I want to touch two things in this Lon and if I'll be finished with these two things even if time will not be over I will give you chance to to comment and ask questions in this class but go with me to the Book of Luke L and the verse is uh 50 I'm reading and they understood not the saying which he spake unto them and they went down with them and came to Nazareth and was subject unto them but his mother kept all these things in the heart look at verse [Music] 52 the Bible tells me and Jesus increased in wisdom and State and in favor with God and man God is good that Jesus incre in was in what wisdom amen amen and we realize that there are two systems of two types of wisdom we have the wisdom of the Greeks and the wisdom of God and we realize from The Book of Job chter 28 that no man knowe the price of wisdom and verse 2 of told us that the fear of the Lord is is wisdom and departing from Evil is is understanding and therefore when Jesus increased in wisdom Christ was in a perfect system that God designed you go to the book says happy that widom and the testimony continues by saying that the system that God began in theard of is clearly evident that wisdom is obtained through ucation so Christ for him to be increased in knowledge and wisdom Christ and therefore we are told that we are to follow the steps of Christ are to acquire the same education that Christ acquired I pray that God may help us to walk according to the steps of Christ because it is the steps of Christ that will lead us to God I don't want to waste a lot of time because today I want you to ask questions and comment I want us to to the book desire I want us to look on how Christ acquired education then we connect to the book first 2 ver 21 that if Christ left for us example that if we are to be follow the lamp wherever he go then ucation system will be should be that of Christ because whatever was perfect in Christ should be made perfect in us because the book of 15 my Bible tells me something the Bible says that for we have not an high priest which cannot be touched with our which which cannot be touched with the feelings of in infirmities but was in all points tempted like we are yet without sin hallelujah hallelujah that Christ was temped even as we are done that is touch [Music] that Christ became man for us for him to understand what man should under and therefore whatever he under we are to go through that the book this is p let me check the page I'm reading from page six uh page 16 paragraph the testimony says wonderful in its [Music] significance in the brief record of his life the [Music] child and and works strong in spirit filled with wisdom that Christ was with what how manying to be like Christ we are to be filled with the wisdom of and therefore we are to walk as Christ listen to this and the grace of God was upon him in the sunlight of his father's countenance Jesus increased in wisdom and and in favor with God and man his mind was active and [Music] penetrating with a thoughtfulness and wisdom Beyond his ears yet his character was beautiful in symmetry the power of Mind and Body developed gradually in keeping with the laws of childhood I hope you are listening to The Life of Christ let me to this paragraph This is now 69 paragraph 29 it says from the earliest uh times the faithful in Israel had given much care to one of the things that very and is the education of the what the ucation of the what we need to see as most by the Lord directed that even from babyhood the children be taught his goodness and greatness especially red in as shown in the history of isra song and prayer lessons from scriptures were to be aded the opening mind hallelujah amen what what what was to be adapted as the opening mind of baby a baby child it is what and what song and prayer song and pray prayer prayer and lessons from the what the scures me what is made the opening the mind of the children today is it in prayer and L from the scriptures [Music] you are cutting up your he is confused in the mind so that when you read ver9 [Music] understand that but this is what this is what God designed and I think what God designed is the best for the children of and are to go to must go back to what God des and therefore today much we had G asay that our minds were not opened up by song prayer and listen from scripture the Lord has prepared to bring us back again so that if we listen to his voice come back to his perfect will then we are going to Beed of Heaven let me Contin fathers and mothers were instructed were to instruct their children that the Lord of God is an expression of his character in in the je economy who was to instruct the children who fathers and who mothers and therefore we realize that there age that a child should spend with parents that that is during the Hebrew economy before taken to the school of prophets children do not even take time with their parents that is why today it is very tough to do devotion with young young men like us and even as we try to be in devotions you realize that we are not so serious with it because we are not growing with it we are just trying because we have read and we we are trying that God may help us be of that character if we would be educated in this way then we will be in a perfect by the way we would be good but today we have problems in the Church of God because we were we were not taught in this life but there hope because God is calling us to back back to this program is prepared to receive us it continues by saying and that as they receive the prin OFW into the [Music] mind because we are told the system that designed was to bring back the image of God upon his children I don't know what kind of system education today that kind of system education we have today can it help to bring back theage of God take for example you are studying that Evolution the can you connect can that bring back the image of God see come back to the [Music] going to continue we are going to continue uh in the system of Education that we not bring back the image of God then there might not be Redemption for us because the book of Education says right you will use you will use Asing somewhere it says in the highest sense education and Redemption is one one maybe something like that because so is it in Redemption so we canot I someone can compare [Music] now question if we go in the system of wrong education are we going to be redeemed are we going to be redeemed come back to the principles friends listen to The Life of Christ in the days of Christ City that not provide for the religious instruction to the young wased C of God by the way this church if we don't train our children the right principles are we are told that the one thing that is seen as necessary is by the way by the way we are not teaching people not to go to school if I find somebody not going to school in this class I'll be the one to call the policemen to arrest him because we are the big supporters of UC education is redemption Hallelujah education is what and therefore what we need to support so much is the education of the youth and any other person now we need to be educated but which system ofation are you going to be educated in is it education that is going to bring back the image of God and to fulfill the Plan of Redemption or is it that education that will crowd the mind with unnecessary knowledge and lead to [Music] death now as never before we need to do what we [Music] fa may God really help us that we might come to principle and Beed of now listen to this yet the teaching had become foral tradition had inur are you seeing the apostasy that was found within the nation now tradition the scriptures no no now their system became this way children could do devotion for 10 minutes but the other hours is me to learn traditions and theories by the way education by that time when tradition had supped the scriptures they justers but still they do exams on that is when tradition the scriptures I'm in the Life of Christ [Music] I don't know the exactag I am but theth uhuh it continues by saying true education will lead the [Music] youth to seek the Lord if happily they might feel after him and find him but the teachers gave attention to the ceremonies [Music] how many are seeing the system was corrupt that the materials that crowded the mind was worthless to the [Music] land I always use this example someone how many have G School just you have gone under that now are you able to apply IND andms in the Life Today Indi no it was to the Lear the Lear yeah someone is learning now now today you see that the world isg the kind of this that was corrupt ised with unnecessary canot apply m and we pray that God may help us so that we might come back topl let me continue by this we are looking upon the Life of Christ because we realize we need to uplift Christ The Gospel we are and first P 2: 21 told us that Christ suffer living example I'm now bringing you to the Life of Christ continues by saying uh the experience which is obtained through personal acceptance of's and that will not be recognized amen that is what I wanted [Music] let me just get that place I'm looking for it materals was worthless to the learner recognized in the schools of the in the higher that will not be recognized in the high school of not going to be accepted in heaven do you think is going to accept you in heaven if what we have learned is not going to be accepted in [Music] the I don't know how to explain this but USI AC of's [Music] word let me give you an example a young a young lady a young man accept the Sabbath as anding to keep theb should be can that be accepted in the UC system of the world today that is how the system of the look at this they they uh uhuh absorbed in the round of externals [Music] the students found no hours to spend with God they did not hear his voice speaking to the heart in in their search have you looking for they turned away from thece of wisdom who the source of wisdom is the corrup system of the system of the world education in search of knowledge people turn away from God in of knowled someone comes and say never cre some don't know break [Music] we have that is how people from the of and by the way by this time these people turned from the source of widom they still to be Christians one of the things that when you read of the Apostles you realized that in Act CH 6 and chter S and chapter 8 Paul Wasing upon the of he convinced Paul that Christ was not the Son of God during the time ofan the book of this things this thinging says the great Essentials of the service of God were neglected the principles of law [Music] the Train the powers of the youth were were repressed [Music] don't exped so this is what the system did mind the mind of a preacher who is preaching this this message today here in front do you know why you can sleep hallelujah amen nowr our example we are to lift up Christ look listen this the Child Jesus re instruction are we calling our Christians are we following Christ Christ never received education in which schools now compare the system of the world today is it the same with the system that I was going among the Jews are they the same listen to what I come to end of this and from the Scrolls of the prophets he learn during the ministry this man us why do you think thews CHR someone was never never Lear someone from the congregation who was listening to the presentation yes he never went to when you were reading a quotation last class we realized that there education that is ESS and if people go to that the world them but was not the same thing is happening here today they look as Christ as someone someone who is not [Music] but those who are going to school and learning there they ask a question how is this person how know this letter having never learn you you see when you are in the school of Christ people will just be wondering at you when people sees you explaining they will be just looking at you and saying where is this person never saw this person going to school but this person is able to explain the Plan of Redemption this man is able to explain Daniel 7 this man is able to help us understand is Revelation 6 and that is when you are in the school of Christ are going to the education of Christ are going to the most WIS say Amen am because the Bible says Theus increased in knowled and had full understanding but he never went to Theo to is wisdom is from we have to come back to the true principles that God be no way you can simplify the message I don't know how to [Music] simplify I want to then I go to the book of ration then I give you amen since he gained knowled as many as we may [Music] do intimate theur shows how his early years were given to the stud of God [Music] says every child May Asus we try to become acquainted with our heavenly father through his word angs will near our minds will be strengthened our characters will be elevated and refined we shall become like our we shall be like our savior how many are deciding to be like the Savior we are to go kind of of go with me to that book as I as we proceed to the Book of Revelation I'm coming to the end of this lesson first Lon 2 first first I'm sorry 26 it says he in me himself also to walk even as he walked that we need to walk as Christ did what we know it is good to uplift Christ in the gospel it is good to talk of the humility of Christ amen it is good to talk about the self sacrificing of Christ in the gospel it is good to talk of Christ kindness but are we talking about the ucation of Christ because it is true we need to like we are to be like look the of that is true my friends I don't reject that but do we the people are to LIF Christ but the education of Christ is TR is is stepped down friends if we are to accomplish this GOP we to be like we have I want to see something in the book of we will be making calls after this lessons 18 ver4 [Music] I had many to share I desire that you I only stop from this point now the Book of Revelation 18: with us what what does the Bible say someone to read from the [Music] conation what does it say and I heard another voice from Heaven uhuh saying saying come out of her come out of her people my people that you may that he may be not partakers of her sins and that he receive not of her place amen so there a call to do what come called to do what come out of what now I want I want us to get this because as we are preaching Bon we go to Revelation 17 and we see a woman and we know how to explain how the woman is Catholic and we know how the and we can all see the daughters as the Fallen churches to list11 38 just write that quation you will help someone let me repeat because I see it is p 081 pH 081 p 3 it says it says command found in Revelation 184 come out of my people means to come out of those in institutions which will place in the minds of our young people principles which are up to make them join the class of worshipers of which we read in second Timothy 3: having a form ofl but deny the power there as faithful Watchmen we should be just as desires of getting our children out of the popular School as we are called to the to the older people out of the popular are only a a product of the command in Revelation 18 18 [Music] ver4 we are calling old men from the Fallen churches it is the same way we need to call from the institions [Music] now if we caller Moses from popular churches then we leave Le in popular institions why it continues to read the the popular churches are only a product of world education so to get at the root of the matter we must separate ourself from from that which creates the [Music] condition in which all the religious world at present finds itself hallelujah amen how many understands that [Music] so if we have to get to the root of that problem for us to destroy the popular churches the populars must also be dest as an example now the same way should be called out from a popular school because if you don't call them then this church is going to be still it is because say [Music] school chular so this person is still going for popular our children still in popular if this old man dies which generation will remain the church the generation that was in popular and when they are from the popular Church education they will make the church to be a [Music] popular so if you don't understand the TR you can just go back thank you if we don't understand the [Music] S we are going to be and going to be called out to come out of this system friends this gospel cannot be simplified this gospel is not preached because we are happy of preaching this gospel is not preached because we see that we we need to preach we yester I was impressed of something that not even explain of action to his friends because they want to explain to theirs people want to explain it to their mothers people want to explain them it to their wives people want to explain this gospel to their brothers time is [Music] know come to theel of we see that the we see that we [Music] needing we to the call that at the end of this Lon we decide to be pray [Music] [Music] are to receive thisel that aref for Christ prepared toed be prepared to sleep in CS be prepared to be moed but if you cannot accept be mocked and Separation by friends there no are going to go with thisel really help us to make decision in Jesus uh yes brother briefly like take for example a teacher who teaching class just answer that briefly just answer that someone from who is in the class who can answer that you want to answerone in fact me I'm a teacher by profession issu is making to have sleep nights because I'm there people she's encouraging them in that imagine in school haveed this message because when this this knowled is devish according to James some I think we are all to come okay there's this thing that having the jewi whatever it is called whatever they down and how to run the schools that that curriculum and then they down is not that Learners to go there to learn but everyone to get so there's a point that they that the teachers are there so I am one of people [Music] time is I don't know what to do seconds by the [Music] way problem the problem why the is not gr yeah that is true [Music] I'm coming to you you see yes amen I love that I don't want to comment on that yes just as then f as we pray [Music] then 11 [Music] uh as we continue with that system yes brother Fel in one minute [Music] like [Music] and around to what do you say think butage so what I just to say all those things that you said but so what I wanted to emphasize that the first thing that we should do is to call people out of the popular schools [Music] the popular churches is that what they go but the first one is call them in fact you can better better better better you don't call them out of popular churches because that that is the product of what is in the popular school they go hand in hand now look the way we are today look the way we are today I'm a teacher the wife of is teer we are having students here people are out of the popular churches what are we making perfecton will be the last but talking you need sometimes to comment we also see is up coming you see heal teacher is coming [Music] yes livelihood [Music] [Music] God is good who teaches more than Christ who teaches more I was there and I was there by the way the Lord has called us and God is going to take care of his works sometimes we can use some something to H you see you see but that is not the thing you see you just want to be there you see so the Lord has called us and is going to take care of his work in Jesus name am let's as we pray because my time is up for for amen you can sing 1 

==================================================

TIMESTAMPED TRANSCRIPT:
[0.2s] obedience to
[5.0s] God at the end of the
[9.6s] presentation we realized that there's
[11.8s] another kind of
[14.6s] education that aim is to seek first the
[17.6s] kingdom of
[22.3s] God and all shall be added unto
[26.2s] us then the Lord the Lord was calling us
[31.6s] to join the second the second system of
[36.6s] Education that
[38.6s] a being Obed to
[44.2s] God and seeking fast his kingdom and
[50.3s] righteousness today I want us to look
[52.5s] something on
[55.1s] Christ because our gospel in centered
[57.7s] upon the ministry of Christ
[64.9s] yesterday during the class of gospel
[70.3s] order we were taught that we need to
[73.7s] preach or present things in according to
[76.3s] the order of
[80.6s] Christ and therefore Christ is the
[82.6s] standard of
[86.3s] everything and therefore gospel should
[88.8s] uplift Christ
[90.7s] [Music]
[93.6s] today in the class of true
[95.8s] education I want us to check something
[98.2s] on
[100.0s] Christ because the book of isah
[105.1s] 53 shows me how Christ was sacrificed as
[109.0s] a
[111.2s] [Music]
[112.5s] lamb and Christ gave
[115.6s] himself to come and die for you and me
[120.7s] and the bigger thing that we are
[122.2s] striving
[124.1s] for is that to have the character of
[127.9s] Christ because God only accept the
[131.0s] righteousness of
[134.3s] Christ because Christ was in a perfect
[137.2s] demand of the
[140.2s] law so if that righteousness of Christ
[143.0s] can be imputed into
[146.2s] us then God is going to accept us
[151.6s] now I want us to look upon
[153.7s] Christ the book of second
[156.9s] Peter second Peter chapter
[160.9s] 22 chapter
[166.6s] 2 let me check if it is first Peter
[169.1s] there's something I
[173.4s] want it is first Peter 2:
[178.1s] 21 allow me begin with vers
[181.2s] 20 if you are together with me in the
[183.4s] book of First Peter please say
[188.5s] amen amen verse 20
[192.4s] says for what glory is
[195.9s] it for what glory is it if if when he be
[201.9s] buffed buff buffed for your faults he
[205.6s] shall take it patiently but if when he
[208.6s] do well and suffer for it he take it
[211.6s] patiently this is acceptable and with
[214.0s] God verse 21 says for even here unto we
[219.1s] are he called because Christ also
[221.7s] suffered for us leaving us an example
[225.4s] that he should follow his steps amen
[236.1s] [Music]
[249.9s] amen God is good my point is in verse
[254.7s] 21 that Christ also suffered for
[258.5s] us now leaving as an
[261.9s] example that follow his
[265.3s] step now for us to be
[268.0s] Christians for us to be those who are
[270.2s] going to
[271.5s] heaven we have to follow the steps
[274.8s] of by the way the characteristics of
[283.8s] the we are told they do what about the
[289.4s] lamp amen they follow the lamp
[294.2s] Wherever by the way you go to the Book
[296.5s] of Revelation chapter 15
[300.6s] you realized that those who overcome the
[302.4s] beast at his
[305.9s] image the Bible says that the name of
[309.6s] the father and the lamp was upon their
[314.7s] forehead and we also
[317.2s] realize that the name can also be used
[319.8s] to show
[323.0s] character and therefore they are going
[324.9s] to have the character of
[326.8s] Christ now Christ left us an example
[331.2s] for us to follow I'm in the class
[335.8s] of verse 22
[338.1s] says who did no
[340.4s] sin neither was found in his
[344.3s] [Music]
[348.2s] mouth amen so we need to be like
[351.6s] Christ we need to have the humility of
[355.1s] Christ we need to have that kindness of
[357.8s] Christ
[360.8s] and by
[361.9s] that if we bring Christ into our
[366.0s] gospel then Min are going to be
[370.1s] converted now I want us to take an
[372.2s] example that Christ
[376.3s] left step that he left for
[379.0s] us
[382.6s] follow me to the Book of
[385.9s] Luke Luke
[388.1s] 2 I want to touch two things in this
[392.9s] Lon and if I'll be finished with these
[395.1s] two
[396.2s] things even if time will not be
[399.8s] over I will give you chance to to
[402.2s] comment and ask questions in this
[406.7s] class but go with me to the Book of
[410.0s] Luke
[412.7s] L and the verse is uh
[418.0s] 50 I'm reading
[420.7s] and they understood not the saying which
[423.1s] he spake unto
[426.4s] them and they went down with
[429.7s] them and came to
[431.9s] Nazareth and was subject unto them but
[435.9s] his mother kept all these things in the
[440.0s] heart look at verse
[442.2s] [Music]
[443.4s] 52 the Bible tells me and Jesus
[447.3s] increased in wisdom and State
[454.2s] and in favor with God and
[457.5s] man God is good that Jesus incre in was
[462.2s] in
[465.2s] what wisdom amen amen and we realize
[468.6s] that there are two systems of two types
[470.2s] of
[472.7s] wisdom we have the wisdom of the
[476.2s] Greeks and the wisdom of God
[479.6s] and we realize from The Book of Job
[481.2s] chter
[483.2s] 28 that no man knowe the price of
[487.1s] wisdom and verse 2 of told
[492.4s] us that the fear of the
[495.8s] Lord is is
[498.8s] wisdom and departing from
[502.6s] Evil is is understanding and therefore
[506.7s] when Jesus increased in wisdom
[510.7s] Christ was in a perfect system that God
[516.2s] designed you go to the
[524.6s] book says happy that
[530.0s] widom and the testimony continues by
[534.2s] saying that the system that God began in
[537.7s] theard of
[542.3s] is clearly
[544.1s] evident that wisdom is obtained through
[549.2s] ucation so
[553.8s] Christ for him to be increased in
[556.2s] knowledge and
[559.1s] wisdom
[563.0s] Christ and therefore we are told that we
[565.2s] are to follow the steps of
[568.4s] Christ are to acquire the same education
[570.9s] that Christ
[573.8s] acquired I pray that God may help
[577.3s] us to walk according to the steps of
[581.8s] Christ because it is the steps of
[586.2s] Christ that will lead us to
[589.2s] God I don't want to waste a lot of
[592.1s] time because today I want you to ask
[594.6s] questions and
[597.7s] comment I want us to to the book
[601.7s] desire I want us to look on how Christ
[604.8s] acquired
[607.4s] education then we connect to the book
[610.3s] first 2 ver
[614.0s] 21 that if Christ left for us
[618.1s] example that if we are to be follow the
[621.4s] lamp wherever he
[624.8s] go then ucation system will be should be
[628.2s] that of Christ
[631.6s] because whatever was perfect in
[634.6s] Christ should be made perfect in
[638.4s] us because the book
[642.7s] of
[644.4s] 15 my Bible tells me
[647.6s] something the Bible says that for we
[651.1s] have not an high priest which cannot be
[654.3s] touched with our which which cannot be
[657.4s] touched with the feelings of in
[660.8s] infirmities but was in all points
[663.4s] tempted like we are yet without
[676.0s] sin
[677.6s] hallelujah hallelujah that Christ was
[680.5s] temped even as we are
[683.4s] done that is touch
[689.9s] [Music]
[691.2s] that Christ became
[693.4s] man for us for him to understand what
[696.5s] man should
[699.8s] under and therefore whatever he
[703.1s] under we are to go through
[705.6s] that the
[709.8s] book this is p let me check the
[714.7s] page I'm reading from page six uh page
[718.9s] 16
[722.2s] paragraph the testimony says wonderful
[726.0s] in its
[729.8s] [Music]
[731.4s] significance in the brief record of his
[736.6s] life the
[737.9s] [Music]
[739.3s] child
[741.4s] and and works strong in
[745.1s] spirit filled with
[747.5s] wisdom that Christ was with
[750.4s] what how manying to be like
[753.7s] Christ we are to be filled with the
[755.8s] wisdom
[757.5s] of and therefore we are to walk as
[761.0s] Christ listen to this and the grace of
[765.0s] God was upon
[767.6s] him in the sunlight of his father's
[774.0s] countenance Jesus increased in wisdom
[776.7s] and
[783.6s] and in favor with God and
[789.6s] man his mind was active and
[794.7s] [Music]
[795.8s] penetrating with a thoughtfulness and
[798.0s] wisdom Beyond his
[803.2s] ears yet his character was beautiful in
[806.0s] symmetry
[809.5s] the power of Mind and
[813.7s] Body developed gradually in keeping with
[816.7s] the laws of
[821.7s] childhood I hope you are listening to
[823.7s] The Life of
[826.7s] Christ let me to this
[830.2s] paragraph This is now 69 paragraph
[836.8s] 29 it says from the earliest uh
[843.4s] times the faithful in Israel had given
[846.4s] much care
[851.8s] to one of the
[856.2s] things that very
[864.0s] and is the education of the
[867.3s] what the ucation of the
[872.8s] what we need to see as
[882.2s] most
[884.7s] by the Lord directed that even from
[890.6s] babyhood the children be taught his
[893.3s] goodness and greatness
[899.4s] especially red
[905.0s] in as shown in the history of
[909.3s] isra song and
[913.6s] prayer lessons from
[917.7s] scriptures were to be aded the opening
[922.8s] mind hallelujah amen what what what was
[926.2s] to be adapted as the opening mind of
[928.1s] baby a baby
[930.3s] child it is what and what song and
[932.9s] prayer song and pray prayer prayer and
[936.3s] lessons from the what the
[942.0s] scures
[945.4s] me what is made the opening the mind of
[948.6s] the children
[950.4s] today is it in prayer and L from the
[953.2s] scriptures
[954.5s] [Music]
[960.0s] you are cutting up
[976.9s] your he is confused in the
[980.6s] mind so that when you read ver9
[985.4s] [Music]
[989.1s] understand
[990.7s] that but this is what this is what God
[993.9s] designed and I think what God designed
[996.2s] is the best for the children
[999.4s] of and are to go to must go back to what
[1003.1s] God
[1007.6s] des and therefore
[1010.5s] today much we had G
[1014.5s] asay that our minds were not opened up
[1017.2s] by song prayer and listen from scripture
[1024.5s] the Lord has prepared to bring us back
[1027.9s] again so that if we listen to his
[1031.0s] voice come back to his perfect
[1035.6s] will then we are going to Beed of
[1040.0s] Heaven let me
[1041.9s] Contin fathers and
[1044.8s] mothers were instructed were to instruct
[1048.3s] their children
[1051.6s] that the Lord of God is an expression of
[1054.0s] his
[1056.4s] character in in the je
[1061.3s] economy who was to instruct the
[1064.8s] children who fathers and who
[1070.0s] mothers and therefore we realize that
[1072.7s] there age that a child should spend with
[1074.6s] parents
[1079.6s] that that is during the Hebrew
[1083.0s] economy before taken to the school of
[1095.2s] prophets children do not even take time
[1097.7s] with their
[1099.4s] parents that is why today it is very
[1102.0s] tough to do devotion with young young
[1104.4s] men like
[1107.8s] us and even as we try to be in
[1112.6s] devotions you realize that we are not so
[1115.7s] serious with it because we are not
[1117.7s] growing with
[1121.2s] it we are just trying because we have
[1124.3s] read and we we are trying that God may
[1126.3s] help us be of that
[1130.8s] character if we would be educated in
[1134.0s] this
[1135.8s] way then we will be in a perfect by the
[1138.5s] way
[1139.8s] we would be
[1141.0s] good but today we have problems in the
[1143.4s] Church of
[1145.6s] God because we were we were not taught
[1148.2s] in this
[1149.4s] life but there hope because God is
[1151.6s] calling us to back back to this
[1157.5s] program is prepared to receive
[1162.0s] us it continues by
[1165.8s] saying and that as they receive the prin
[1169.1s] OFW into
[1175.3s] the
[1179.7s] [Music]
[1183.8s] mind because we are told the system that
[1189.2s] designed was to bring back the image of
[1191.8s] God upon his
[1195.0s] children I don't know what kind of
[1197.1s] system education today that kind of
[1199.0s] system education we have
[1201.5s] today can it help to bring back theage
[1204.0s] of
[1205.9s] God take for example you are studying
[1209.0s] that Evolution
[1215.6s] the can you connect can that bring back
[1218.8s] the image of
[1221.4s] God see come back to the
[1226.2s] [Music]
[1228.8s] going to continue we are going to
[1231.0s] continue uh in the system of Education
[1233.7s] that we not bring back the image of
[1238.7s] God then there might not be Redemption
[1241.2s] for
[1242.5s] us because the book of
[1244.8s] Education
[1248.9s] says right you will use you will use
[1252.0s] Asing somewhere
[1260.7s] it says in the highest
[1264.2s] sense education and Redemption is one
[1268.2s] one maybe something like
[1271.4s] that
[1274.5s] because so is it in
[1278.8s] Redemption so we
[1283.9s] canot I
[1286.6s] someone can compare
[1297.4s] [Music]
[1305.3s] now
[1306.6s] question if we go in the system of wrong
[1309.5s] education are we going to be
[1314.6s] redeemed are we going to be redeemed
[1318.7s] come back to the principles
[1322.2s] friends listen to The Life of
[1325.2s] Christ in the days of
[1328.1s] Christ City that not provide for the
[1330.9s] religious instruction to the young wased
[1333.8s] C of
[1339.8s] God by the way this
[1343.1s] church if we don't train our children
[1346.0s] the right principles
[1356.2s] are we are told that the one thing that
[1359.2s] is seen as necessary
[1364.5s] is by the way by the way we are not
[1367.1s] teaching people not to go to
[1370.4s] school if I find somebody not going to
[1373.0s] school in this
[1375.3s] class I'll be the one to call the
[1377.4s] policemen to arrest him
[1381.4s] because we are the big supporters of
[1385.6s] UC education is
[1388.6s] redemption Hallelujah education is
[1392.4s] what and therefore what we need to
[1394.4s] support so much is the education of the
[1396.0s] youth and any other
[1400.1s] person now we need to be
[1403.8s] educated but which system ofation are
[1406.0s] you going to be educated in
[1409.2s] is it education that is going to bring
[1410.9s] back the image of God and to fulfill the
[1412.5s] Plan of
[1417.5s] Redemption or is it that education that
[1420.1s] will crowd the mind with unnecessary
[1422.4s] knowledge and lead to
[1425.0s] [Music]
[1429.0s] death now as never
[1433.6s] before we need to do
[1437.4s] what we
[1450.2s] [Music]
[1458.1s] fa may God really help
[1460.6s] us that we might come to principle and
[1463.6s] Beed of
[1468.9s] now listen to this yet the teaching had
[1471.6s] become
[1474.3s] foral tradition had
[1483.8s] inur are you seeing the apostasy that
[1487.2s] was found within the
[1490.4s] nation now tradition the
[1495.9s] scriptures no no
[1499.3s] now their system became this
[1503.9s] way children could do devotion for 10
[1509.2s] minutes but the other
[1513.0s] hours is me to learn traditions and
[1522.6s] theories by the way education by that
[1525.4s] time
[1528.7s] when tradition had supped the
[1538.3s] scriptures they
[1545.0s] justers but still they do exams
[1549.7s] on that is when tradition the
[1555.6s] scriptures I'm in the Life of Christ
[1565.7s] [Music]
[1571.8s] I don't know the exactag I am
[1576.0s] but
[1577.8s] theth uhuh it continues by saying true
[1581.6s] education will lead the
[1584.7s] [Music]
[1586.3s] youth to seek the
[1591.4s] Lord if happily they might feel after
[1597.1s] him and find
[1599.6s] him but the
[1602.8s] teachers gave attention to the
[1605.2s] ceremonies
[1608.0s] [Music]
[1625.3s] how many are seeing the system was
[1629.6s] corrupt that the materials that crowded
[1632.2s] the
[1634.1s] mind was worthless to the
[1637.3s] [Music]
[1639.0s] land I always use this
[1642.1s] example someone how many have G School
[1648.7s] just you have gone under
[1652.1s] that now are you able to
[1655.8s] apply IND andms in the Life
[1660.2s] Today
[1669.8s] Indi no it was to the Lear the
[1672.8s] Lear yeah someone is learning now now
[1676.4s] today you see
[1678.6s] that the world isg the kind of this that
[1682.1s] was
[1686.9s] corrupt ised with
[1693.9s] unnecessary canot
[1702.0s] apply
[1707.1s] m and we pray that God may help
[1710.4s] us so that we might come back
[1715.8s] topl let me continue by this we are
[1719.5s] looking upon the Life of
[1721.3s] Christ because we realize we need to
[1723.4s] uplift
[1724.6s] Christ The Gospel we
[1729.2s] are and first P 2: 21 told
[1734.0s] us that Christ suffer living example
[1741.6s] I'm now bringing you to the Life of
[1745.0s] Christ continues by
[1747.5s] saying
[1750.5s] uh the experience which is obtained
[1752.9s] through personal acceptance
[1762.4s] of's and that will not be recognized
[1765.2s] amen that is what I wanted
[1768.4s] [Music]
[1770.8s] let me just get that place I'm looking
[1772.7s] for
[1776.4s] it materals was worthless to the
[1783.3s] learner recognized in the schools of the
[1786.7s] in the
[1788.3s] higher that will not be recognized in
[1791.9s] the high school of
[1806.1s] not going to be accepted in
[1808.8s] heaven do you think is going to accept
[1811.4s] you in
[1814.0s] heaven if what we have learned is not
[1816.2s] going to be accepted in
[1821.2s] [Music]
[1824.0s] the I don't know how to explain this
[1828.4s] but
[1831.8s] USI AC of's
[1836.1s] [Music]
[1843.4s] word let me give you an
[1847.3s] example a young a young lady a young man
[1850.6s] accept the Sabbath as
[1858.2s] anding to keep theb should
[1862.2s] be can that be accepted in the UC system
[1865.1s] of the world
[1867.5s] today that is how the system of
[1872.7s] the look at this they they uh
[1878.4s] uhuh absorbed in the round
[1882.0s] of externals
[1885.7s] [Music]
[1889.2s] the students found no hours to spend
[1891.2s] with
[1895.1s] God they did not hear his
[1897.8s] voice speaking to the
[1900.0s] heart in in their
[1914.8s] search have you
[1927.1s] looking
[1928.1s] for they turned away from thece of
[1931.8s] wisdom who the source of
[1934.7s] wisdom is the corrup system
[1942.2s] of the system of the world
[1945.5s] education in search of knowledge
[1948.9s] people turn away from
[1951.2s] God in of
[1953.3s] knowled someone comes and say never
[1957.6s] cre
[1961.4s] some don't
[1970.4s] know break
[1974.7s] [Music]
[1980.2s] we
[1982.4s] have that is how
[1985.2s] people from the
[2002.7s] of and by the
[2004.8s] way by this time these people turned
[2007.2s] from the source of
[2010.1s] widom they still to be
[2013.8s] Christians one of the things
[2023.5s] that
[2032.3s] when you read of the
[2035.4s] Apostles you realized that in Act CH 6
[2038.6s] and chter S and chapter
[2043.2s] 8 Paul Wasing upon the
[2054.1s] of
[2060.8s] he convinced Paul that Christ was not
[2063.7s] the Son of God during the time ofan
[2074.8s] the book
[2077.4s] of this things this thinging
[2081.3s] says the great Essentials of the service
[2083.8s] of
[2086.8s] God were
[2088.8s] neglected the principles of law
[2091.9s] [Music]
[2109.5s] the
[2114.8s] Train the powers of the youth were were
[2118.5s] repressed
[2127.7s] [Music]
[2129.4s] don't
[2140.9s] exped so this is what the system
[2150.9s] did mind the mind of a preacher who is
[2154.0s] preaching this this message today here
[2156.5s] in front
[2164.4s] do you know why you can
[2182.6s] sleep hallelujah amen nowr our example
[2188.2s] we are to lift up
[2189.9s] Christ look listen this the Child
[2197.0s] Jesus re
[2205.2s] instruction are we calling our
[2209.2s] Christians are we following
[2212.4s] Christ Christ never received education
[2215.8s] in which schools
[2218.7s] now compare the system of the world
[2224.4s] today is it the same with the system
[2226.7s] that I was going among the
[2230.5s] Jews are they the
[2242.0s] same listen to what I come to end of
[2245.1s] this
[2256.0s] and from the Scrolls of the
[2262.0s] prophets he
[2270.6s] learn during the ministry
[2277.7s] this man
[2282.4s] us why do you think
[2284.8s] thews CHR someone was never never
[2291.3s] Lear someone from the congregation who
[2293.8s] was listening to the
[2298.3s] presentation
[2302.9s] yes he never went to
[2307.6s] when you were reading a quotation last
[2312.4s] class we realized that there education
[2315.1s] that is
[2318.3s] ESS and if people go to
[2321.7s] that the world
[2326.9s] them but was
[2330.8s] not the same thing is happening here
[2333.9s] today they look as Christ as someone
[2336.8s] someone who is not
[2340.1s] [Music]
[2341.5s] but those who are going to school and
[2343.4s] learning
[2352.6s] there they ask a
[2354.7s] question how is this person how know
[2357.9s] this letter having never
[2362.6s] learn you you see when you are in the
[2364.9s] school of Christ
[2368.1s] people will just be wondering at
[2371.7s] you when people sees you
[2376.9s] explaining they will be just looking at
[2378.9s] you and saying where is this
[2382.5s] person never saw this person going to
[2386.4s] school but this person is able to
[2388.6s] explain the Plan of
[2393.3s] Redemption this man is able to explain
[2395.5s] Daniel 7
[2398.2s] this man is able to help us understand
[2400.3s] is Revelation 6
[2404.4s] and that is when you are in the school
[2406.4s] of
[2409.0s] Christ are going to the education of
[2413.6s] Christ are going to the most WIS say
[2416.4s] Amen
[2418.6s] am because the Bible
[2421.5s] says Theus increased in knowled
[2428.9s] and had full
[2430.8s] understanding but he never went to
[2434.5s] Theo to
[2444.4s] is wisdom is
[2447.0s] from we have to come back to the true
[2449.3s] principles that God be
[2457.4s] no way you can simplify the
[2462.4s] message I don't know how to
[2471.7s] [Music]
[2476.3s] simplify I want to then I go to the book
[2479.5s] of ration then I give you
[2487.5s] amen since he gained knowled as many as
[2490.5s] we may
[2492.0s] [Music]
[2496.2s] do intimate theur shows how his early
[2500.5s] years were given to the stud of God
[2515.9s] [Music]
[2518.8s] says every child May
[2524.2s] Asus we try to become acquainted with
[2526.8s] our heavenly
[2531.5s] father through his

[2580.6s] proceed to the Book of Revelation I'm
[2582.5s] coming to the end of this
[2586.2s] lesson first Lon 2 first first I'm
[2592.4s] sorry 26 it says
[2598.3s] he in
[2601.5s] me himself also to walk even as he
[2605.0s] walked
[2608.4s] that we need to walk as Christ did
[2612.6s] what we know it is good to uplift Christ
[2616.3s] in the
[2619.5s] gospel it is good to talk of the
[2621.9s] humility of Christ
[2624.6s] amen it is good to talk about the self
[2627.7s] sacrificing of Christ in the
[2632.4s] gospel it is good to talk of Christ
[2635.4s] kindness
[2639.1s] but are we talking about the ucation of
[2642.5s] Christ because it is true we need
[2654.5s] to
[2657.9s] like we are to be
[2662.7s] like look the of
[2675.8s] that is true my
[2677.6s] friends I don't reject that but do we
[2690.7s] the people are to LIF
[2694.2s] Christ but the education of Christ is TR

[2841.3s] see it is p
[2843.8s] 081 pH 081
[2847.3s] p 3 it
[2850.4s] says it says command found in Revelation
[2857.2s] 184 come out of my
[2860.6s] people means to come out of those in
[2866.6s] institutions which will place in the
[2868.8s] minds of our young
[2872.3s] people principles which are up to make
[2875.8s] them join the class of
[2879.7s] worshipers of which we read in second
[2882.4s] Timothy
[2886.4s] 3: having a form
[2890.5s] ofl but deny the power
[2894.6s] there as faithful
[2898.8s] Watchmen we should be just as desires of
[2902.2s] getting our children out of the popular
[2904.4s] School
[2910.6s] as we are called to the to the older
[2913.6s] people out of the
[2923.8s] popular are only a a product of
[2940.8s] the command in Revelation 18 18
[2945.0s] [Music]
[2946.9s] ver4 we are calling old men from the
[2950.0s] Fallen
[2955.6s] churches it is the same way we need to
[2957.7s] call from the institions
[2963.5s] [Music]
[2966.8s] now if we caller Moses from popular
[2971.4s] churches then we leave Le in popular
[2973.8s] institions
[2983.6s] why it continues to
[2986.1s] read the the popular churches are only a
[2990.4s] product of world education
[3001.6s] so to get at the root of the
[3006.6s] matter we must separate ourself from
[3009.8s] from that which creates the
[3015.0s] [Music]
[3016.3s] condition in which all the religious
[3019.1s] world at present finds itself hallelujah
[3024.1s] amen how many understands that
[3027.6s] [Music]
[3038.3s] so if we have to get to the root of that
[3042.7s] problem for us to destroy the popular
[3047.8s] churches the populars must also be dest
[3062.8s] as an example
[3065.7s] now the same way should be called out
[3068.4s] from a popular
[3072.2s] school because if you don't call
[3075.5s] them then this church is going to be
[3080.0s] still it is because say
[3084.8s] [Music]
[3087.1s] school
[3093.1s] chular so this person is still going for
[3099.3s] popular our children still in
[3102.9s] popular if this old man
[3108.5s] dies which generation will remain the
[3111.8s] church the generation that was in
[3114.0s] popular
[3118.2s] and when they are from the popular
[3120.2s] Church education they will make the
[3122.0s] church to be a
[3126.3s] [Music]
[3127.9s] popular so if you
[3129.9s] don't understand the TR you can just go
[3132.2s] back thank
[3133.1s] you if we don't understand the
[3137.0s] [Music]

[3806.7s] things that you
[3811.2s] said
[3820.5s] but so what I wanted to
[3824.6s] emphasize that the first thing that we
[3827.0s] should do is to call people out of the
[3828.6s] popular schools
[3831.9s] [Music]
[3835.9s] the popular churches is that
[3840.7s] what they go but the first one is call
[3844.1s] them in fact you can better better
[3846.4s] better better you don't call them out of
[3848.4s] popular churches because that that is
[3851.2s] the product of what is in the popular
[3853.4s] school they go hand in hand now look the
[3855.4s] way we are today look the way we are
