[802.0s] the greatest care should be exercised
[804.8s] not to give credence
[806.7s] to the manifestation of noise loud
[809.1s] shouting hysterical gastric relations
[812.5s] and call this the Holy Ghost
[815.6s] it is the bodily exercise age which
[817.9s] profited nothing Salvation Army
[820.7s] it is not the loud shouting and the
[823.1s] bodily exercise of moving about and
[825.7s] throwing up the arms
[828.4s] and shouting to the top of the voice
[830.8s] that demonstrate pure and true holiness
[833.8s] I am instructed to say to you
[836.9s] that you are to carry the work of the
[839.4s] truth in clear elevated dignity
[842.2s] that it shall not have one trace of wild
[845.2s] fanaticism in it
[847.6s] you are giving encouragement to a mold
[850.4s] and face of experience that should never
[853.9s] be encouraged
[855.2s] and the church suppose it is the Holy
[857.8s] Ghost
[858.4s] the Holy Spirit does not thus
[860.5s] demonstrate itself
[862.1s] should you encourage this wild
[864.1s] excitement calling it The Holy Spirit
[869.1s] you are preparing yourself for one of
[871.9s] the greatest deceptions that can come
[874.5s] into the church the Salvation Army's
[877.7s] tactics
[878.9s] are not to be taken up by seventh day
[882.7s] Adventists
[884.6s] and their methods followed out and the
[888.1s] church become molded and fashioned to
[892.1s] run in the line of gesticulation and
[895.4s] Loud boisterous shouting and bodily
[899.2s] exercises shouting

[1230.0s] testimonies to ministers page 265
[1232.6s] paragraph one
[1234.6s] the world must not be introduced into
[1238.3s] the church and married to the church
[1248.7s] forming a bond of unity
[1251.4s] through this means
[1257.1s] the church will become indeed corrupt
[1261.3s] and as stated in Revelation
[1264.7s] a cage of every unclean and hateful bad
[1271.2s] ly young Titans
[1287.2s] foreign
[1314.2s] SDA
[1323.7s] is
[1333.7s] foreign
[1361.9s] foreign
[1384.1s] God has sent his servants to rebuke sin
[1387.4s] both in the world and in the church
[1397.0s] but the people desire smooth things to
[1399.7s] be spoken to them and the piwa and
[1402.6s] vanished truth is not acceptable many
[1405.2s] reformers in entering upon this work
[1408.3s] determined to exercise great Prudence in
[1411.7s] attacking the sins of the church and the
[1414.4s] nation
[1415.6s] foreign
[1450.8s] foreign
[1480.1s] foreign
[1490.0s] when the reformers preached the word of
[1492.6s] God they had no thought of separating
[1495.3s] themselves from the established church
[1498.5s] but the religious leaders would not
[1501.0s] tolerate the light vehicles
[1505.7s] and those who bought it were forced to
[1509.0s] seek another class who were longing for
[1512.1s] the truth
[1513.1s] in our day few of the professed
[1516.2s] followers of the reformers
[1518.4s] are actuated by their own
[1522.1s] light few are listening to the voice of
[1524.8s] God and ready to accept the voice of God
[1528.7s] in alsoever guys
[1531.0s] often
[1533.8s] those who follow in the steps of the
[1535.6s] reformers are forced to turn away from
[1538.6s] the churches they love in order to
[1541.2s] declare the plain teachings of the word
[1543.8s] of God
[1544.9s] and many a times those who are seeking
[1547.4s] for light are by the same teachings
[1549.2s] obliged to leave the church of their
[1552.0s] fathers in order to render
[1554.5s] obedience reformers
