in the book of hosea chapter number 6 let us go forth forward to know the lord good okay he shall come unto us as the rain as the latter rain oh so the lattering that causes the burden the manifestation of the holy spirit is the revelation of jesus so the holy spirit is the revelation of christ himself the holy spirit is not a third god called god the holy spirit it is christ himself the holy spirit is the spiritual nature the divine personality of christ himself his very life ohio it is not the third person god the holy spirit is psalm 72 verses number six that is why there is a lot of weakness because god's people want to among us it is the manifestation of christ himself that will cause the burden when god begins to take his work to another level psalms chapter 72 verses number six english and swahili psalm 72 verse 6 i'll be using two languages the awato as a color so that people may understand what i am talking about psalm 72 versus number six in fact for the purpose of context water to answer i acquaints psalm 72 verse 1 in assembler give the king thy judgment oh god and thy righteousness unto the king's son habakkuk [Music] all judgment has been given to the sun john chapter 5 verse 22. we have the king's son that has been given judgment verse 17 verse number six now you know the king's son jesus himself shall descend as rain that is the second time we'll see the bible giving us evidence that the holy spirit the manifestation of jesus himself his very life it is not a third personality to a god the holy spirit no it is the manifestation of jesus himself okay congratulations psalm 72 6. psalm 72 verse 6 psalm 72 6 and this is the greatest deception abayo says you see this is a deception of the highest order psalm 72 verse 6 in king james version psalm 72 verse 6 king james version says he referring to the king's son jesus he shall come down like rain upon the mount grass as showers that water there so who comes down as rain the spiritual reign the holy spirit it is jesus himself case closed we proceed we proceed so the bible teaches that aaron's road that murdered birding is caused by the latter rain when the showers begin and burning happens just before the harvest is now spiritual prophecy in one of the books he shall receive power receive power this is what ellen white says in this book called yrp is now connecting how the latter rain is to be revealed to god's people in these last i i can also read from another book because i've seen the same quotation in a book called uh we have so many compilations uh in the spirit of prophecy but uh for the purpose of record uh this is review and herald review and herald of april 21 1891 review and herald april 9 21 1891 paragraph 7 i think it says the latter rain is to fall upon the people of god for so a mighty angel is to come down from heaven and the whole earth is to be lighted with his glory are we ready to take part in the glorious work of the third angel there is a question so ellen white takes the latter rain and connects the latter in to the coming down of the mighty angel of revelation chapter 18. remember we are talking about the budding of aaron's road and how god will take forward his work from there hello it says the latter rain is to fall upon the people of god a mighty angel is to come down from heaven now this is revelation 18. we begin our series now let us begin our series because revelation 18 is the final laterin and la terrain revolves around that that fourth angel that angel is called the mighty angel that angel the fourth angel and by the way for your own information the fourth angel is the manifestation of the righteousness of christ himself let me build on this we are talking about the things that must transpire before jesus comes how the work of god must progress when the birding begins when the latter rain begins and this happens just before the harvest just before the harvest when god takes his own work in his own hands and there is a reason as to why god must do that we are reading from the book of habakkuk chapter 2 verse 14. habakkuk chapter 2 verses number 14. the bible says concerning revelation 18 the final budding the budding is caused by the latter rain aaron's road that budded is the final message to adventism before the harvest that they may read and understand how god's work is to be done in the last days god is to choose a leaders of his own heart to finish the work amen habakkuk chapter 2 verse 14. for the earth shall be filled with the knowledge of the glory of the lord as the waters fill the earth that is prophetic of revelation 18. revelation 18 shows how the mighty angel is to come down from heaven and by the way this mighty angel is christ himself because he is the one who is to initiate the budding and to choose the leaders in israel in these last days those whom he has appointed himself he must do that because kama yes so we cannot trust the leadership of this time among us god's people and there is a reason for that remember in the first session we are constantly on a combat the history of israel is a striking similarity of what adventism would be in the last days it is a striking similarity amen how let me just do a little recap because before we we tackle revelation 18 and show how the burden begins and then we go to history we show we show what what has happened we are in 2022. what has happened why is it there is much debating in adventism today on our foundational truths what is happening is it that god is taking his work to a next level and many do not realize like it happened in the jewish nation except you study the prophetic lines to understand these events let us progress the history of the israelites is the history of seventh-day adventism hosea chapter six micah chapter six verse four six verses number four maika chapter six verses number four the bible says biblionas for i brought thee up out of the land of egypt speaking of israel and i delivered thee from the house of bondage names and i sent forth moses haron and miriam to go before thee so israel as a nation they had three messengers to go before them it is only seventh day adventism that god has given us the fast angel's message revelation 14 verse six montgomery patriots moses patty at the second angel's message revelation 14 verse 8 haron god has given us the third angel's message miriam and it's so coincidence that cover miriam and ellen g white were both women they were both ladies it's very interesting because the rise of the third angel 1844 ellen g white is given the spirit of prophecy miriam but wait a minute they were not the messengers that took part in that very event of of taking the children of israel to the promised land it was joshua so joshua comes in as the fourth message and the fourth messenger revelation 18 is joshua the final attack on jericho i the babylon that must fall god's people must be prepared for that final work it must begin in israel israeli and joshua when joshua gets in by the way when joshua begins his work jesus himself speaks the bible says in the book of deuteronomy chapter number one deuteronomy chapter number one deuteronomy chapter number one bible says deuteronomy the bible says in the autonomy i and your money know most alien israeli water and hamburghani these are the ones that moses told the children of israel on the other side of the show of jordan and when moses had spoken those words of course he brought up joshua to take forth the bible continues to say joshua chapter number one joshua was told to be strong because the lord was going to be with him he should not fear uh the the reproach of the nations and even the israelites that is deuteronomy chapter one deuteronomy chapter two and after that moses dies and when we begin in the book of joshua we see the instructions given to joshua as plain and explicitly clear i want you to take the children of israel into the land of canaan the fourth message is the message that finishes the work this is the ministry of joshua the fourth angel revelation 18 that causes the burden and god must select leaders to guide his people you must elect god's leaders to guide these people back to go forth into there to the promised land into the promised land into the promised land now revelation 18 is the manifestation of jesus jesus himself manifests himself in the latter rain so the latter rain is the revelation that is a message that the bible teaches the latter rain is the manifestation of jesus rome takatifu when god pours forth his spirit he manifests he manifests his son christ jesus and his righteousness to his people that they may be prepared to stand in the trials that come but wait a minute is it true that jesus must come to try to awaken people that slumber in this in the ship yes and what is the purpose of the lottery what is the purpose of the burden remember who shall speak in behalf of israel god and to intervene god had to show openly through the body that this is the leader the tribe of levi i have chosen them because aaron's road has muttered let's go to matthew chapter 23 matthew chapter 23 jesus is the fourth messenger jesus is associated with number four remember the book of hosea says that hosea chapter 6 says is going forth is as the morning and it shall come to us as the rain as the as the latter rain when jesus revealed himself prophetically it is asked the morning good morning put that in your mind was this out here matthew 23 versus number 14 matthew 23 14 verse 23 matthew chapter 14 verses number 23 matthew chapter 14 verses number 23 the bible says when he had bid farewell to the to the multitudes ali panda murimani faraga nakuri when it was evening the ship was in the midst of the sea those who are looking at this prophetically we understand that the sheep is is is refers to the church that bears god's people the winds were blowing contrary so the ship was troubled in the midst of the sea that is what is happening to adventism because the sheep is being tossed to and fro by every wind of doctrine every weed of doctrine the bible continues to say in a sema heart in the fourth watch of the night jesus revealed himself to them in the fourth watch the bible is specific it was the fourth watch of the night that jesus revealed himself and manifested himself to his people that were in the ship to try to bring back their faith they are being tossed to and fro to and fro by the winds of false doctrines there is much to fear from within than from without there is much to fear from within the doctrines that are beating around god's people many of them are from within god's people have lost an anchor the bible is specific it was the fourth watch of the night that jesus manifested himself now maybe we should ask the bible able to listen bibilia what is the name given to the fourth watch of the night because jose chapter 6 verse 3 says when jesus manifest himself to his people in the latter end he's going forth is us the morning morning now let's see what is the name given to the fourth watch of the night mark chapter 13 verse 35 mark chapter 13 verses number that five mark chapter 13 verses number that five we are reading from the book of mark marico cominato natano listen very carefully the bible says the fourth watch of the night has a name mark chapter 13 verse at five the bible says in mark 13 verse 35 this is not the second coming of jesus this is the manifestation of jesus to his people his house the church the four watches of the night let me read in english watch ye therefore for ye no not when the ma when the master of the house cometh at even at midnight or at coke growing or in the morning so the fourth watch of the night is called the morning so this is the time period prophetically when jesus manifested himself to his people in the lettering hosea chapter six verse three and he shall come to us as the latter in his going forth is us the morning it is the morning prophetically to begin to we proceed when jesus manifested his himself to the people who were in the sheep at the fourth watch of the night peter thought that they had seen a ghost that is what they thought the first fulfillment of when jesus wanted to manifest himself to his people the first fulfillment occurred in 1888 let us see whether ellen white writes the same let's see whether he writes this the very first attempt was in 1888 by the way i'm just reading last day events page 210 paragraph nine last day events last day events page 210 paragraph uh paragraph two last day vince page 210 paragraph paragraph number lde 210 paragraph 2. she says there is to be in the seventh day adventist churches a wonderful manifestation of the power of god you see it is the power of god so the holy spirit is the power of god i hear so many arguments people say the holy spirit cannot be the power of god the holy spirit is a separate person from the father and from jesus is the third being separate from the father and the son that is what adventism believes that is what the world teaches but that is not what the bible and the spirit of prophecy teaches elenor says there is to be in the seventh day adventist churches a wonderful manifestation of the power of god we can show this from the bible that the holy spirit is the power of god we can show it luke chapter 1 verse 35 it's the power of god so you cannot separate the power of god and put god aside and put his power aside and say that is god and that is another god no i also have some power i can lift some heavy some heavy gadget can you separate my power from myself no it cannot happen you need one always that is false that is deception of the highest order and that is why satan has brought in his deception the last apostasy omega of apostasy that began with the kellogg is here with us and many adventists have never realized that today luke chapter 1 verse 35 before i read last event concerning the power of god the holy spirit is the power of god luke chapter 1 verse 35 the holy spirit is not a third god called god the holy spirit separate from god separate from christ no no no no even wrong luke chapter 1 verse 35 luke chapter 1 verse 35 i'm just showing you i love in the universe of kundalini the bible's by the way it's very easy the bible is very easy to understand luke chapter 1 verse 35 and the angel told mary that the holy spirit shall descend upon thee and the power of the most high shall be upon you so the holy spirit is the power of the most high now is there a possibility that the power of the most high is a different person from god or from christ himself no that is not true the power of god who is the power of god look at the book of first corinthians chapter 1 verse 24 first corinthians chapter one first corinthians the bible says who is the power of god we've seen it's very interesting so unto those who are called the jews and the greeks it is christ the power of god so the latter name the holy spirit is the manifestation of the power of god christ jesus is the power of god and to his people amen the bible has has never been this clear before bibili that is a deception last lastly events page 2 10 paragraph 1 the bible uh spiritual prophet says there is to be in the seventh-day adventist churches a wonderful manifestation of the power of god who is being manifested it is christ himself the power of god but it will not move upon those who have not humbled themselves before the lord and open the door of the heart by confession and repentance listen to this now in the manifestation of that power which lightens the earth with the glory of god oh so that power must lighten the earth with the glory of god okay put that in mind they will see something which in their blindness they will think dangerous like villa me too they they were in the ship when they saw the manifestation of jesus in the fourth hour fourth watch of the night they saw something dangerous this is the history of adventism 1888 something which will arouse their fears and they will brace themselves to resist it because the law does not work in accordance to their ideas and expectations they will oppose the work why they say should we not know the spirit of god when we have been in the work for so many years the third angel's message will not be understood or comprehended the light which will lighten the earth with the glory of god will be called a false light by those who refuse to walk in its advancing glory let us put things together now this is the history of adventism in 1888 wakati mungualiwatuma juana mewavili e.j wagona and jonas wakatuli letter message righteousness by faith the revelation of the righteousness of jesus in the latter rain it was not the revelation of god the holy spirit it was the revelation of jesus himself now wait a minute she says in the manifestation of that power which lightens the earth with the glory of god the glory of god who lightens the earth with the glory of god by the way let us go to revelation 18 verse one able to saw me revelation how can people say the holy spirit is a third god called god the holy spirit well the bible is clear it is the manifestation of christ himself and his character to his people revelation 18 started working relation 18 by the way seventh day adventism is in a great delusion even of even how how to receive the lettering it is a great delusion that is why people can go to weeks of prayer expecting some power some other power apart from christ and the father himself that is not true revelation 18 verse 1. after these things i saw another angel come down from heaven ah having great glory the glory of god and he cried mightily with a loud voice let us go to john chapter 11 to show that this is jesus this is the fourth angel must come to show his glory let us see remember lazaro lazarus had been dead for four days i'll come across by the way yes the fourth day to show his glory he came to manifest his glory on the fourth day listen very carefully i'm just showing you line up online that revelation 18 is the manifestation of jesus himself not god the holy spirit it is christ himself jesus christ himself and if you cannot understand that it is christ himself you cannot give the first angels message correctly because already you are showing the world that you are worshiping a different god than the father and the son the bible is clear and this is life eternal that they might know you the only true god and jesus christ whom that was sent we were not told to know an attack being i took one beauty what it is a deception john chapter 11 verses john chapter 11. the bible says in verses number 17 it was the fourth day when jesus arrived let me jump the history i'm going straight to the point from verses number 39 yes this is the fourth day your friend has been dead yes welcome here did i not tell you mata that if you believe thou shalt see the glory of god jesus came to reveal the glory of god to those who were surrounding and to his friend who was dead he came the fourth day basically yes verse 43 is very key jesus is there on the fourth day he is manifested he wants to manifest the glory of god look at verse 43. [Music] he cried with a loud voice revelation 18 and the mighty angel cried with a loud voice that is jesus himself we are done we are done that is christ himself aaron's wrote that burden when jesus begins to manifest himself to his people the very first attempt maria consider 1888 1888 the very first attempt 1888 and the leadership of god's people rejected the message where is the fourth angel if the leaders rejected the message of righteousness by faith the manifestation of the character of jesus has it ever been accepted no the only condition by which that message and that power would be upon god's people is a confession of sin kutubudabi general conference president now um that is what the bible teaches in the book of hosea chapter 5 verse 15. let me show you something that has never happened by the way hosea then we'll go to malachi as we begin to bring this slightly to an end hosea chapter 5 verse 15 hosea chapter 5 verse 15 this is prophetic of what happened or transpired in 1888 kitumbacho kilifanika 1888 the fourth angel nita kwandazangu i will now go forth and return back to my place nakuparudiyamapang when there is to be a corporate confession of the scene of 1888 the angel can go back to the general conference but if that will never happen the general conference can never be the recipient of the spiritual power in the last days that is to prepare god's people for the loud cry and to stand in the last days that one we should put in our minds now yes and this is why we'll begin to see how aaron's road begins to blossom by the way in the book of malachi chapter number three there's a whole topic in the book deserve ages that is called in his temple remember psalms 132 says that god shall shall cause the budding of the horn in the house of david israel christ will manifest himself in the ring malachi chapter 3. malachi chapter number three the bible says in malachi chapter number three verses number one the first prophetic fulfillment of the arrival of christ in history the bible says and the lord whom you seek shall suddenly come to his temple nam julem jumbo organo even the messenger of the covenant shall suddenly come to his temple the bible teaches that when jesus comes suddenly to his temple he shall sit as a refiner to refine his work will be to separate two classes of worshippers because he will come with power the very first fulfillment of this prophecy in his temple in afghanistan when jesus manifest himself the very first time to his people and this prophecy also can be connected with the prophecy of haggai chapter two chapter two and malachi chapter three due to ezekiel letter these prophetic lines pamoja remember this is the second part he'll come to kudua the purpose of this presentation is to let the people know the work of god in the final portion of this earth history in a fanika tv how does the work of god go forward in in a country again does god depend on the leadership that has apostatized will god use them anymore or will god show through the budding of the aaron's road that he has selected a new leadership for his people in the times of the body let's go to hagai hagai hagai the book of haggai chapter number two hagiai the book of hagiai hagiai chapter number two it depends on where you come from some people say hey some people say haggai hagai chapter 2 the bible says that the lord will suddenly come to his temple but who shall stand because when he cometh to his temple he is like a refiner he separates two classes of worshippers whether we are conscious or whether we are not conscious depending on whether we have received the light or whether we have rejected the light of the budding the burden forth the very message that jesus wants us to understand in these last days again chapter 2 this is a message that is very key speak unto the remnant of the children of israel saying amongst you who is left that saw this house in its initial glory adventism we are living in 2022. who saw adventism in 1840 1844 who saw it 1840-1844 is there anyone amongst us was there alive no we are the children of our father's faith israel who saw this house in its initial glory it was just powerful when god had laid the foundational truths and how do you see today we're going to answer the questions as we progress be a strong serum why is it that the lord is saying that they should be strong i'm reading verse 8. it says look at this versus number seven god will do something in israel when the burden begins when the prophecy of psalms chapter 132 begins to fulfill when when the burden when that horn wakati pembe israeli maria this is the first time before jesus comes back in revelation chapter 18 in the manifestation of that power of god the very first time is when jesus is born in bethlehem and is raised amongst his people and goes to his temple physically to his temple this is the very first time of the fulfillment of the prophecy of malachi chapter 3 and haggai chapter 2. the bible says the bible says and i will shake the the entire world the nations and the desire of nation shall come and i will fill this house with the glory of god amen the desire of ages is jesus before he comes there must be a shaking of the entire earth the message of his coming must shake the earth and that is why in the times of herod wakati herod the whole of jerusalem was troubled with the message because the message was coming from the east and the magaya uh they did not know the time of their visitation they did not know that god is coming to take his work to another level two classes of worshippers will develop those who will continue to stand firm in the platform that jesus stood pla farm for because jesus was the foundation of the jewish economy yes so jesus was coming back to manifest himself for the very first time and this is the purpose of the lettering even in the last days look at what spirit of prophet says she says look at this it says in the book called let me let me see this book uh i want to show you what jesus came to do his his very own revelation she says desire of ages page 288 listen very carefully desire of ages chapter 29 this is page 218 888 she says the savior had not come to set aside what the patriarchs and the prophets had spoken that was the foundation for he himself had spoken through these representative men all the truths of god's word came forth from him but these priceless gems had been placed in false settings their precious light had been made to minister to era while coming by you'll see your moonwale god desired them to be removed from their settings of error he had desired that israel be removed from their setting of error and and had replaced them with the framework he came to replace those errors in the framework of truth this work only a divine hand could accomplish by its connection with the error the truth had been serving the cause of the enemy god and of god and man christ had come to place it where it would glorify god and work the salvation of humanity amen eras that is the very essence of the lettering because the latter rain is the manifestation of jesus when jesus begins to bring the truth the leaders cannot accept the truth because the foundational truth thou jesus must begin another work he must begin a new work and let the blind leaders the blind guides to continue to think that they are the temple of god yes what our channel they rejected the truth the sun henry that is the history of the lattering it begins with the fss it goes forward to philadelphia by the way these three churches are very important when we study the history of the birding of aaron's road la zima to do history revelation chapter 18 he's only saying that the manifestation of the character of god to set back the foundational truths and to begin a work that many people will not understand let us let us read desire of aegis 232. when the latter rain begins jesus must take a new direction look at what happens in in israel when jesus manifestation manifested manifested the glory of god when he manifested the glory of god okay look at what happened look at what happened these are wages deserve ages desired of ages page 232. without wages page 200 and number 32 listen let's give zuri 232 paragraph one she says she says if the leaders in israel had received christ he would have honored them as his messengers to carry the gospel to the world at assassination allowed to cry we must have the burden jesus must be manifested again to his people fast fast but the message first goes to the leaders in israel if they had accepted christ if they had accepted the glory of god if they had accepted the angel of revelation 18 in a nutshell she says god would have honored them as his people to take the gospel to the world she says to them first was given the opportunity to become heralds of the kingdom of grace of god but israel knew not the time of her visitation the jealousy and distrust of the jewish leaders had ripened into open hatred and the hearts of the people were turned away from jesus so the leaders had the problem they did not want to go back to their foundational truths they do not want to accept the message that jesus had brought up that is the purpose of the to to put aside error and to cause the people of god to stand on the platform of eternal truth look at what happened sikhi aquititum the sun henry had rejected christ's message and was bent upon his death walitaka okay therefore jesus departed from jerusalem muji from the priests vyongoziwadini from the temple mariam bapu mung gariquanaka the religious leaders the people who had been instructed in the law and returned to another class to proclaim his message god had begun to collect a people that he can use to take his message while the leaders continued to think that they were still god's chosen messengers what a deception what a deception jesus went to gather out those who should carry the gospel to all nations listen now as we bring this for close listen very closely as the light and life of man was rejected jesus is the light and the life of men the holy spirit gives the life of jesus so the holy spirit again is the life of christ it is not god the holy spirit somebody separate and distinct from jesus it is the very life and the very nature of jesus himself that is what the spiritual prophet says yes as the light and life of man was rejected by the ecclesiastical authorities in the days of christ so it has been rejected in every succeeding generation tuna be upper again and again the history of christ's withdrawal from judea has been repeated when the reformers preach the word of god the foundational truth because the reformers have accepted that jesus is the foundation they have accepted not error but the truth they have accepted to return the people back to the platform of eternal truth they had no thought of separating themselves from the established church leaders would not tolerate the light and those who had the light were forced to seek another class who are longing for the truth in our day few of the prophets followers of the reformers are actuated by their own spirit few are listening for the voice of god are ready and ready to accept the truth and whatsoever guys it may be presented in reformers conference churches ambassador our next topic will be tackling what is the church canis aninini is the general conference they church we will begin by tackling the history of the latter rain and the fourth angel and we are going to understand what the church is and how god is to finish the work in the last days what would you want to say jesus sought another class he left the priest he left jerusalem he left the temple he left the religious leaders matthew chapter 13 verse 15. yes i kept let them alone that is matthew chapter 15 verse 13. iron throat that burden we have seen so far that when jesus manifest himself he manifests himself in the holy spirit to reveal the glory of god to his people so that god's people may be established in their foundational truths when we come to part three we are going to move forward to 1888 from 1888 2022 where is the fourth angel has jesus manifested himself to us today is the work of god taking a different dimension what work are we supposed to support in the last days how will we know that the work of god has taken a different dimension god bless you amina

[843.4s] shall come down like rain

[848.6s] water there
[849.8s] so who comes down as rain the spiritual
[852.5s] reign the holy spirit it is jesus
[854.5s] himself case closed we proceed
[858.9s] we proceed
[860.2s] so the bible teaches that aaron's road
[862.3s] that murdered birding is caused by the
[864.4s] latter rain
[865.5s] when the showers begin and burning
[868.2s] happens just before the harvest
[877.9s] is
[884.0s] now
[885.5s] spiritual prophecy
[888.2s] in
[889.0s] one of the books
[892.3s] he shall receive power
[898.0s] receive power
[902.5s] this is what ellen white
[906.2s] says
[908.2s] in this book called yrp
[916.2s] is now connecting
[918.0s] how the latter rain
[919.8s] is to be
[920.9s] revealed to god's people
[923.4s] in these last
[925.8s] i i can also read from another book
[927.8s] because i've seen the same quotation
[930.5s] in a book called uh
[941.4s] we have so many compilations
[944.4s] uh in the spirit of prophecy
[947.6s] but uh for the purpose of record
[951.6s] uh this is review and herald
[954.4s] review and herald of april 21 1891
[959.8s] review and herald
[961.7s] april 9 21 1891
[964.7s] paragraph 7 i think it says
[967.6s] the latter rain is to fall upon the
[969.4s] people of god
[970.9s] for so
[972.0s] a mighty angel is to come down from
[974.2s] heaven and the whole earth is to be
[976.2s] lighted with his glory are we ready to
[978.7s] take part in the glorious work of the
[980.4s] third angel there is a question
[982.6s] so ellen white
[984.6s] takes the latter rain and connects the
[987.0s] latter in to the coming down of the
[989.1s] mighty angel of revelation chapter 18.
[991.6s] remember we are talking about the
[993.0s] budding
[994.2s] of aaron's road and how god will take
[996.8s] forward his work from there
[1003.3s] hello it says
[1005.4s] the latter rain is to fall upon the
[1006.9s] people of god a mighty angel is to come
[1009.5s] down from heaven now this is revelation
[1011.3s] 18. we begin our series now
[1014.5s] let us begin our series because
[1016.3s] revelation 18 is the final laterin
[1019.9s] and la terrain
[1021.3s] revolves around that that fourth angel
[1025.1s] that angel is called the mighty angel
[1028.0s] that angel the fourth angel and by the
[1030.7s] way
[1031.9s] for your own information
[1035.4s] the fourth angel is the manifestation of
[1037.9s] the righteousness of christ himself
[1041.0s] let me build on this
[1045.0s] we are talking about
[1047.7s] the things that must transpire before
[1049.7s] jesus comes
[1051.1s] how the work of god must progress
[1054.0s] when the birding begins when the latter
[1056.6s] rain begins
[1057.8s] and this happens just before the harvest
[1060.6s] just before the harvest
[1063.1s] when god
[1064.3s] takes his own work in his own hands and
[1066.4s] there is a reason as to why
[1068.2s] god must do that
[1077.0s] we are reading
[1079.0s] from the book of
[1080.9s] habakkuk chapter 2 verse 14.
[1084.3s] habakkuk chapter 2
[1087.4s] verses number 14.
[1094.6s] the bible says concerning revelation 18
[1098.2s] the final budding
[1100.2s] the budding is caused by the latter rain
[1102.8s] aaron's road that budded
[1105.6s] is the final message to adventism before
[1108.6s] the harvest
[1109.8s] that they may read and understand how
[1112.3s] god's work is to be done in the last
[1114.1s] days
[1115.5s] god is to choose a leaders
[1118.2s] of his own heart
[1119.9s] to finish the work amen
[1122.4s] habakkuk chapter 2 verse 14.
[1131.0s] for the earth shall be filled with the
[1132.9s] knowledge of the glory of the lord as
[1134.9s] the waters fill the earth
[1137.0s] that is prophetic of revelation 18.
[1139.6s] revelation 18 shows how
[1142.7s] the mighty angel is to come down from
[1144.4s] heaven
[1145.5s] and by the way this mighty angel is
[1147.5s] christ himself because he is the one who
[1149.6s] is to initiate the budding and to choose
[1152.3s] the leaders in israel in these last days
[1155.5s] those whom he has appointed himself he
[1158.3s] must do that because kama yes
[1162.8s] so
[1164.9s] we cannot trust the leadership of this
[1167.4s] time
[1168.2s] among us god's people and there is a
[1169.8s] reason for that
[1171.0s] remember in the first session
[1173.9s] we are constantly on a combat the
[1175.7s] history of israel is a striking
[1178.6s] similarity of what adventism would be in
[1181.2s] the last days it is a striking
[1183.0s] similarity
[1184.3s] amen
[1185.5s] how
[1187.4s] let me just do a little recap because
[1189.8s] before we we tackle revelation 18 and
[1192.1s] show how the burden begins and then we
[1194.1s] go to history we show
[1196.1s] we show what what has happened we are in
[1198.5s] 2022. what has happened why is it there
[1201.0s] is much debating in adventism today on
[1204.1s] our foundational truths what is
[1205.6s] happening
[1206.6s] is it that god is taking his work to a
[1208.2s] next level and many do not realize
[1211.6s] like it happened in the jewish nation
[1219.0s] except you study the prophetic lines to
[1221.0s] understand these events
[1222.7s] let us progress
[1225.1s] the history of the israelites is the
[1227.0s] history of seventh-day adventism hosea
[1229.8s] chapter six
[1231.4s] micah chapter six verse four
[1236.3s] six verses number four
[1239.4s] maika chapter six verses number four
[1243.0s] the bible says biblionas
[1249.0s] for i brought thee up out of the land of
[1252.1s] egypt speaking of israel
[1257.4s] and i delivered thee from the house of
[1259.1s] bondage
[1260.4s] names
[1265.7s] and i sent forth moses haron and miriam
[1269.7s] to go before thee
[1271.4s] so israel as a nation they had three
[1273.4s] messengers
[1274.5s] to go before them it is only seventh day
[1276.5s] adventism
[1277.7s] that god has given us the fast angel's
[1280.2s] message revelation 14 verse six
[1282.2s] montgomery patriots
[1284.2s] moses
[1285.9s] patty at the second angel's message
[1287.5s] revelation 14 verse 8 haron
[1290.8s] god has given us the third angel's
[1292.6s] message
[1293.9s] miriam
[1295.3s] and it's so coincidence that cover
[1297.0s] miriam
[1298.4s] and ellen g white were both women they
[1301.1s] were both ladies
[1303.0s] it's very interesting because the rise
[1305.0s] of the third angel 1844 ellen g white
[1308.2s] is given the spirit of prophecy
[1313.9s] miriam
[1315.1s] but wait a minute
[1331.8s] they were not the messengers that took
[1334.3s] part in that very event
[1337.1s] of of taking the children of israel
[1340.6s] to the promised land it was joshua so
[1343.0s] joshua comes in as the fourth message
[1346.5s] and the fourth messenger revelation 18
[1349.8s] is joshua the final attack on jericho i
[1354.0s] the babylon that must fall
[1356.5s] god's people must be prepared for that
[1358.6s] final work it must begin in israel
[1362.2s] israeli and joshua when joshua gets in
[1365.4s] by the way
[1367.5s] when joshua begins his work
[1370.0s] jesus himself speaks
[1372.2s] the bible says in the book of
[1374.2s] deuteronomy chapter number one
[1376.9s] deuteronomy chapter number one
[1381.2s] deuteronomy chapter number one
[1385.4s] bible says deuteronomy
[1393.3s] the bible says in the autonomy
[1396.8s] i and your money know most alien israeli
[1399.0s] water and hamburghani these are the ones
[1400.8s] that moses told the children of israel
[1403.6s] on the other side of the show of jordan
[1407.0s] and when moses had spoken those words of
[1408.8s] course he brought up joshua to take
[1411.0s] forth
[1414.6s] the bible continues to say
[1418.4s] joshua chapter number one
[1423.8s] joshua was told to be strong
[1427.4s] because the lord was going to be with
[1429.7s] him
[1431.2s] he should not fear
[1433.6s] uh the the reproach
[1436.0s] of the nations
[1437.7s] and even the israelites that is
[1439.0s] deuteronomy chapter one
[1441.2s] deuteronomy chapter two
[1443.8s] and
[1445.1s] after that moses dies and when we begin
[1447.6s] in the book of joshua we see the
[1449.7s] instructions given to joshua as plain
[1452.4s] and explicitly clear
[1477.8s] i want you to take the children of
[1479.8s] israel into the land of canaan the
[1481.6s] fourth message
[1483.3s] is the message that finishes the work
[1486.1s] this is the ministry of joshua
[1488.5s] the fourth angel revelation 18 that
[1490.5s] causes the burden and god must select
[1493.5s] leaders to guide his people
[1498.6s] you must elect god's leaders
[1501.9s] to guide these people back
[1504.5s] to go forth into there
[1506.3s] to the promised land
[1508.5s] into the promised land
[1511.3s] into the promised land now
[1513.4s] revelation 18
[1515.0s] is the manifestation of jesus jesus
[1517.0s] himself
[1519.1s] manifests himself in the latter rain so
[1521.4s] the latter rain is the revelation
[1527.1s] that is a message that the bible teaches
[1529.3s] the latter rain is the manifestation of
[1531.0s] jesus
[1532.1s] rome takatifu when god pours forth his
[1534.4s] spirit
[1535.4s] he manifests he manifests
[1538.8s] his son
[1540.1s] christ jesus and his righteousness
[1542.4s] to his people that they may be prepared
[1544.4s] to stand
[1545.6s] in the trials that come but wait a
[1548.0s] minute
[1552.3s] is it true
[1553.5s] that jesus must come
[1556.3s] to try to awaken people that slumber in
[1558.9s] this in the ship
[1560.6s] yes
[1562.5s] and what is the purpose of the lottery
[1565.4s] what is the purpose of the burden
[1568.9s] remember
[1578.1s] who shall speak
[1579.8s] in behalf of israel
[1583.0s] god and to intervene god had to show
[1585.4s] openly through the body
[1587.4s] that this is the leader the tribe of
[1589.5s] levi i have chosen them
[1592.2s] because aaron's road has muttered
[1595.8s] let's go to matthew chapter 23
[1598.9s] matthew chapter 23
[1601.1s] jesus is the fourth messenger jesus is
[1603.2s] associated with number four
[1605.1s] remember the book of hosea says
[1608.6s] that
[1609.6s] hosea chapter 6 says
[1611.6s] is going forth
[1613.4s] is
[1614.7s] as the morning and it shall come to us
[1617.1s] as the rain as the as the latter rain
[1620.5s] when jesus revealed himself
[1622.3s] prophetically it is asked the morning
[1625.1s] good morning
[1626.6s] put that in your mind was this out here
[1631.1s] matthew 23
[1633.0s] versus number 14
[1635.7s] matthew 23
[1653.3s] 14 verse 23
[1655.0s] matthew chapter 14
[1657.0s] verses number 23
[1659.4s] matthew chapter 14
[1661.3s] verses number 23 the bible says
[1666.2s] when he had bid farewell to the to the
[1668.5s] multitudes ali panda murimani
[1671.1s] faraga
[1673.0s] nakuri
[1674.3s] when it was evening
[1680.7s] the ship was in the midst of the sea
[1683.2s] those who are looking at this
[1684.5s] prophetically we understand that the
[1686.3s] sheep is is is refers to the church that
[1690.2s] bears god's people
[1703.3s] the winds were blowing contrary so the
[1705.8s] ship was troubled in the midst of the
[1707.4s] sea that is what is happening to
[1709.5s] adventism
[1710.9s] because the sheep is being tossed to and
[1712.5s] fro
[1713.7s] by every wind of doctrine
[1715.9s] every weed of doctrine
[1718.4s] the bible continues to say
[1721.4s] in a sema
[1722.7s] heart
[1730.4s] in the fourth watch of the night jesus
[1733.0s] revealed himself to them
[1735.9s] in the fourth watch the bible is
[1738.7s] specific
[1739.8s] it was the fourth watch of the night
[1742.4s] that jesus revealed himself and
[1744.8s] manifested himself to his people that
[1747.4s] were in the ship to try to bring back
[1749.4s] their faith
[1752.2s] they are being tossed to and fro
[1755.0s] to and fro by the winds of false
[1756.7s] doctrines
[1757.9s] there is much to fear from within than
[1759.8s] from without
[1761.6s] there is much to fear from within the
[1763.2s] doctrines
[1764.7s] that are beating around god's people
[1768.6s] many of them are from within god's
[1770.6s] people
[1771.4s] have lost an anchor
[1774.2s] the bible is specific it was the fourth
[1776.5s] watch of the night
[1778.2s] that jesus manifested himself
[1780.6s] now maybe we should ask the bible able
[1782.6s] to listen bibilia what is the name given
[1786.2s] to the fourth watch of the night
[1791.1s] because jose chapter 6 verse 3 says when
[1793.4s] jesus manifest himself to his people in
[1795.5s] the latter end he's going forth is us
[1798.8s] the morning
[1801.2s] morning
[1806.9s] now let's see what is the name given to
[1809.3s] the fourth watch of the night
[1812.2s] mark chapter 13 verse 35
[1815.6s] mark chapter 13
[1817.6s] verses number that five
[1820.6s] mark chapter 13
[1822.9s] verses number that five
[1825.9s] we are reading from the book of mark
[1829.1s] marico cominato
[1835.4s] natano
[1837.3s] listen very carefully
[1839.2s] the bible says
[1841.1s] the fourth watch of the night
[1843.4s] has a name
[1845.5s] mark chapter 13 verse at five
[1849.4s] the bible says in mark 13 verse 35
[1860.4s] this is not the second coming of jesus
[1862.8s] this is the manifestation of jesus to
[1864.6s] his people his house
[1867.7s] the church
[1882.3s] the four watches of the night let me
[1884.3s] read in english
[1887.2s] watch ye therefore for ye no not when
[1890.1s] the ma when the master of the house
[1891.9s] cometh
[1893.0s] at even
[1895.0s] at midnight
[1896.8s] or at coke growing
[1899.0s] or in the morning so the fourth watch of
[1901.0s] the night is called the morning
[1902.8s] so this is the time period prophetically
[1904.9s] when jesus manifested
[1906.6s] himself to his people in the lettering
[1909.9s] hosea chapter six verse three
[1912.4s] and he shall come to us as the latter in
[1915.1s] his going forth is
[1917.6s] us the morning
[1919.2s] it is the morning prophetically
[1922.2s] to begin to
[1924.9s] we proceed
[1928.5s] when jesus manifested his himself to the
[1931.1s] people who were in the sheep
[1933.6s] at
[1935.9s] the fourth watch of the night
[1937.9s] peter thought that they had seen a ghost
[1941.6s] that is what they thought
[1943.7s] the first fulfillment of when jesus
[1947.6s] wanted to manifest himself to his people
[1950.6s] the first fulfillment
[1953.0s] occurred in 1888
[1955.5s] let us see whether ellen white writes
[1957.6s] the same
[1958.6s] let's see whether he writes this the
[1960.3s] very first attempt was in 1888
[1964.3s] by the way
[1965.5s] i'm just reading last day events page
[1967.1s] 210

[1996.2s] paragraph number
[2000.8s] lde 210 paragraph 2.
[2004.7s] she says
[2006.9s] there is to be in the seventh day
[2008.2s] adventist churches a wonderful
[2009.8s] manifestation of the power of god
[2012.9s] you see it is the power of god
[2015.3s] so the holy spirit is the power of god
[2019.0s] i hear so many arguments people say the
[2021.3s] holy spirit cannot be the power of god
[2023.6s] the holy spirit
[2025.0s] is a separate person from the father
[2027.5s] and from jesus is the third being
[2030.5s] separate from the father and the son
[2034.3s] that is what adventism believes that is
[2036.2s] what the world teaches but that is not
[2038.4s] what the bible and the spirit of
[2039.6s] prophecy teaches
[2041.6s] elenor says
[2043.2s] there is to be in the seventh day
[2045.0s] adventist churches a wonderful
[2046.7s] manifestation of the power
[2049.1s] of god
[2051.0s] we can show this from the bible that the
[2052.6s] holy spirit is the power of god we can
[2054.2s] show it luke chapter 1 verse 35
[2057.3s] it's the power of god so you cannot
[2059.3s] separate the power of god
[2061.1s] and put god aside and put his power
[2063.8s] aside and say that is god
[2066.1s] and that is another god no
[2068.8s] i also have some power i can lift some
[2071.0s] heavy some heavy gadget
[2073.5s] can you separate my power from myself no
[2075.8s] it cannot happen you need one
[2078.0s] always
[2081.2s] that is false that is deception of the
[2085.0s] highest order and that is why satan has
[2088.1s] brought in his deception
[2090.5s] the last apostasy omega of apostasy that
[2094.2s] began with the kellogg is here with us
[2097.4s] and many adventists have never realized
[2099.4s] that today luke chapter 1 verse 35
[2101.8s] before i read last event
[2103.6s] concerning the power of god
[2105.4s] the holy spirit is
[2107.4s] the power of god
[2109.8s] luke chapter 1 verse 35
[2112.9s] the holy spirit is not a third god
[2115.1s] called god the holy spirit separate from
[2117.8s] god separate from christ no no no no
[2120.2s] even wrong
[2122.2s] luke chapter 1 verse 35

[2133.4s] the bible is very easy to understand
[2137.9s] luke chapter 1 verse 35
[2150.3s] and the angel told mary
[2153.4s] that the holy spirit shall descend upon
[2155.8s] thee and the power of the most high
[2159.1s] shall be upon you so the holy spirit
[2162.2s] is the power of the most high
[2165.4s] now is there a possibility that the
[2167.0s] power of the most high is a different
[2168.5s] person from god or from christ himself
[2172.2s] no that is not true
[2174.1s] the power of god
[2176.1s] who is the power of god

[2190.2s] the bible says
[2195.0s] who is the power of god we've seen
[2198.2s] it's very interesting
[2215.0s] so unto those who are called the jews
[2217.2s] and the greeks it is christ
[2219.5s] the power of god
[2221.8s] so the latter name the holy spirit is
[2223.6s] the manifestation of the power of god

[2732.8s] bring this
[2734.1s] slightly to an end
[2736.4s] hosea chapter 5 verse 15
[2740.3s] hosea

[2778.3s] conference
[2779.9s] but if that will never happen
[2782.0s] the general conference can never be the
[2783.7s] recipient
[2784.9s] of the spiritual power in the last days
[2787.1s] that is to prepare god's people for the
[2789.2s] loud cry and to stand in the last days
[2792.2s] that one we should put in our minds
[2797.0s] now

[2844.0s] malachi chapter number three
[2847.8s] the bible says in malachi chapter number
[2849.7s] three
[2851.6s] verses number one the first prophetic
[2853.7s] fulfillment
[2855.5s] of the arrival of christ in history

[2932.8s] refiner
[2934.1s] to refine his work will be to separate
[2936.7s] two classes of worshippers
[2938.7s] because he will come with power
[2941.0s] the very first fulfillment of this
[2942.6s] prophecy in his temple in afghanistan
[2953.7s] when jesus manifest himself the very
[2955.4s] first time to his people and this
[2957.4s] prophecy
[2960.0s] also can be connected with the prophecy
[2962.1s] of haggai chapter two
[2965.8s] chapter two and malachi chapter three
[2967.5s] due to ezekiel letter these prophetic
[2969.4s] lines pamoja remember this is the second
[2971.8s] part

[2975.5s] presentation is to let the people know
[2978.6s] the work of god in the final portion of
[2981.4s] this earth history

[2997.3s] will god use them anymore or will god
[3000.0s] show through the budding of the aaron's
[3002.4s] road that he has selected a new
[3004.1s] leadership for his people

[3036.4s] the bible says
[3039.0s] that the lord will suddenly come to his
[3041.9s] temple
[3044.6s] but who shall stand
[3046.5s] because when he cometh to his temple
[3049.4s] he is like a refiner he separates two
[3052.2s] classes of worshippers whether we are
[3053.8s] conscious
[3055.1s] or whether we are not conscious
[3056.5s] depending on whether we have received
[3058.6s] the light or whether we have rejected
[3061.0s] the light of the budding
[3063.0s] the burden forth
[3065.4s] the very message
[3067.0s] that jesus wants us to understand
[3070.0s] in these last days
[3073.0s] again chapter 2
[3077.7s] this is a message
[3079.4s] that is very key
[3106.4s] speak unto the remnant
[3108.5s] of the children of israel saying
[3115.3s] amongst you who is left that saw this
[3118.5s] house in its initial glory
[3122.4s] adventism we are living in 2022. who saw
[3125.5s] adventism in 1840 1844
[3128.6s] who saw it 1840-1844
[3131.0s] is there anyone amongst us was there
[3133.4s] alive no
[3135.6s] we are the children
[3137.0s] of our father's faith
[3142.2s] israel who saw this house in its initial
[3145.5s] glory it was just powerful
[3149.8s] when god had laid the foundational
[3151.5s] truths
[3156.2s] and how do you see today we're going to
[3158.5s] answer the questions as we progress
[3162.7s] be a strong serum
[3172.4s] why is it that the lord is saying that
[3174.8s] they should be strong
[3176.4s] i'm reading verse 8.
[3179.2s] it says
[3180.5s] look at this
[3182.2s] versus number seven
[3184.8s] god will do something
[3187.5s] in israel when the burden begins
[3191.2s] when the prophecy of psalms chapter 132
[3193.2s] begins to fulfill
[3194.7s] when when the burden when that horn
[3197.5s] wakati pembe
[3201.8s] israeli maria
[3203.2s] this is the first time
[3205.2s] before jesus comes back in revelation
[3207.3s] chapter 18 in the manifestation of that
[3209.8s] power of god the very first time is when
[3212.6s] jesus is born in bethlehem and is raised
[3215.2s] amongst his people and goes to his
[3217.2s] temple physically
[3219.4s] to his temple this is the very first
[3221.2s] time of the fulfillment of the prophecy
[3223.3s] of malachi chapter 3 and haggai chapter
[3225.4s] 2. the bible says
[3238.6s] the bible says and i will shake the the
[3241.4s] entire world the nations
[3243.7s] and the desire of nation shall come
[3246.6s] and i will fill this house with the
[3248.6s] glory of god amen
[3251.6s] the desire of ages is jesus before he
[3254.0s] comes there must be a shaking of the
[3255.9s] entire earth the message of his coming
[3258.5s] must shake the earth and that is why in
[3260.6s] the times of herod wakati herod
[3265.1s] the whole of jerusalem was troubled with
[3267.2s] the message because the message was
[3269.0s] coming from the east
[3271.1s] and the magaya
[3272.8s] uh
[3280.6s] they did not know the time of their
[3282.2s] visitation
[3283.4s] they did not know that god is coming to
[3285.4s] take his work
[3286.8s] to another level
[3290.0s] two classes of worshippers will develop
[3293.0s] those who will continue to stand firm in
[3296.1s] the platform that jesus stood pla farm
[3298.7s] for
[3300.3s] because jesus was the foundation of the
[3302.8s] jewish economy yes
[3310.4s] so jesus was coming back
[3313.5s] to manifest himself for the very first
[3315.4s] time and this is the purpose of the
[3316.8s] lettering even in the last days look at
[3319.0s] what spirit of prophet says
[3325.6s] she says
[3327.3s] look at this
[3334.2s] it says in the book called
[3336.9s] let me let me see this book
[3340.0s] uh
[3342.5s] i want to show you what jesus came to do
[3345.6s] his his very own revelation
[3356.2s] she says
[3357.4s] desire of ages
[3359.1s] page 288
[3361.2s] listen very carefully
[3364.7s] desire of ages
[3366.8s] chapter 29
[3368.6s] this is page 218 888
[3372.2s] she says
[3374.1s] the savior had not come to set aside
[3376.3s] what the patriarchs and the prophets had
[3378.2s] spoken that was the foundation
[3381.3s] for he himself had spoken through these
[3383.3s] representative men
[3385.4s] all the truths of god's word came forth
[3388.7s] from him but these priceless gems had
[3392.7s] been placed in false settings
[3410.2s] their precious light had been made to
[3412.4s] minister to era
[3414.0s] while coming
[3416.2s] by you'll see your moonwale
[3418.2s] god desired them to be removed from
[3420.9s] their settings of error
[3425.1s] he had desired that israel be removed
[3428.8s] from their setting of error and
[3439.8s] and had replaced them
[3441.9s] with the framework
[3443.4s] he came to replace those errors
[3445.8s] in the framework of truth
[3448.0s] this work only a divine hand could
[3451.1s] accomplish
[3452.4s] by its connection with the error the
[3454.5s] truth had been serving the cause of the
[3456.4s] enemy god and of god and man
[3459.4s] christ had come to place it where it
[3461.7s] would glorify god and work the salvation
[3464.8s] of humanity amen
[3469.3s] eras
[3474.2s] that is the very essence of the
[3475.8s] lettering because the latter rain is the
[3477.8s] manifestation of jesus when jesus begins
[3480.6s] to bring the truth
[3482.4s] the leaders cannot accept the truth
[3485.2s] because
[3486.6s] the foundational truth thou
[3488.8s] jesus must begin another work he must
[3491.2s] begin a new work and let the blind
[3494.9s] leaders the blind guides to continue to
[3497.8s] think that they are the temple of god
[3500.0s] yes what our channel
[3508.6s] they rejected the truth the sun henry
[3512.0s] that is the history of the lattering it
[3514.6s] begins with the fss
[3516.6s] it goes forward to philadelphia
[3521.8s] by the way these three churches are very
[3523.8s] important when we study the history of
[3525.8s] the birding of aaron's road la zima to
[3528.6s] do history
[3543.0s] revelation chapter 18 he's only saying
[3545.0s] that the manifestation of the character
[3547.1s] of god to set back the foundational
[3549.5s] truths and to begin a work
[3552.6s] that many people will not understand let
[3554.8s] us let us read desire of aegis 232.
[3558.8s] when the latter rain begins
[3561.0s] jesus must take a new direction look at
[3563.8s] what happens
[3565.0s] in in israel when jesus manifestation
[3567.9s] manifested manifested the glory of god
[3571.8s] when he manifested the glory of god
[3574.6s] okay
[3575.9s] look at what happened
[3578.2s] look at what happened
[3580.6s] these are wages
[3584.4s] deserve ages
[3588.2s] desired of ages page 232.
[3593.0s] without wages
[3601.7s] page 200
[3604.2s] and number 32
[3607.0s] listen
[3608.4s] let's give zuri 232 paragraph one she
[3610.6s] says
[3614.5s] she says
[3616.3s] if the leaders in israel had received
[3618.3s] christ
[3619.3s] he would have honored them as his
[3620.8s] messengers to carry the gospel to the
[3622.4s] world at assassination allowed to cry
[3625.3s] we must have the burden jesus must be
[3627.4s] manifested again to his people fast
[3631.1s] fast
[3632.6s] but the message first goes to the
[3634.5s] leaders in israel
[3636.8s] if they had accepted christ if they had
[3639.4s] accepted the glory of god if they had
[3642.5s] accepted the angel of revelation 18
[3646.3s] in a nutshell
[3648.3s] she says
[3650.2s] god would have honored them as his
[3652.0s] people
[3653.2s] to take the gospel to the world
[3656.6s] she says
[3658.3s] to them first was given the opportunity
[3660.2s] to become heralds of the kingdom of
[3661.8s] grace of god
[3663.4s] but israel knew not the time of her
[3667.0s] visitation
[3668.4s] the jealousy and distrust of the jewish
[3671.8s] leaders had ripened into open hatred
[3676.1s] and the hearts of the people were turned
[3678.2s] away from jesus so the leaders had the
[3680.5s] problem they did not want to go back to
[3682.7s] their foundational truths
[3684.4s] they do not want to accept the message
[3686.0s] that jesus had brought
[3687.7s] up
[3695.1s] that is the purpose of the
[3697.8s] to to put aside error and to cause the
[3700.6s] people of god to stand on the platform
[3702.5s] of eternal truth
[3704.6s] look at what happened sikhi aquititum
[3708.5s] the sun henry
[3710.9s] had rejected christ's message
[3713.4s] and was bent upon his death walitaka
[3717.0s] okay
[3718.2s] therefore jesus departed from jerusalem
[3723.2s] muji
[3724.3s] from the priests vyongoziwadini
[3727.8s] from the temple mariam bapu mung
[3729.8s] gariquanaka the religious leaders the
[3733.0s] people who had been instructed in the
[3734.8s] law and returned to another class to
[3738.4s] proclaim his message
[3741.1s] god had begun to collect a people
[3745.4s] that he can use to take his message
[3748.4s] while the leaders continued to think
[3751.0s] that they were still god's chosen
[3752.7s] messengers what a deception
[3755.7s] what a deception
[3758.1s] jesus went to gather out those who
[3760.2s] should carry the gospel to all nations
[3762.2s] listen now
[3763.4s] as we bring this for close listen very
[3765.1s] closely
[3766.2s] as the light and life of man was
[3768.8s] rejected
[3770.6s] jesus is the light
[3772.2s] and the life of men
[3773.6s] the holy spirit gives the life of jesus
[3776.3s] so the holy spirit again is the life of
[3778.8s] christ it is not god the holy spirit
[3781.4s] somebody separate and distinct from
[3783.2s] jesus it is the very life and the very
[3785.6s] nature of jesus himself that is what the
[3787.8s] spiritual prophet says
[3791.8s] yes
[3792.8s] as the light and life of man was
[3795.3s] rejected
[3796.6s] by the ecclesiastical authorities in the
[3799.0s] days of christ so it has been rejected
[3802.6s] in every succeeding generation tuna be
[3805.8s] upper
[3822.7s] again and again the history of christ's
[3825.3s] withdrawal from judea has been repeated
[3828.8s] when the reformers preach the word of
[3830.6s] god the foundational truth because the
[3833.2s] reformers have accepted that jesus is
[3836.4s] the foundation they have accepted not
[3839.8s] error but the truth they have accepted
[3842.6s] to return the people back to the
[3844.1s] platform of eternal truth
[3847.4s] they had no thought of separating
[3849.0s] themselves from the established church
[3879.0s] leaders would not tolerate the light and
[3881.1s] those who had the light were forced to
[3883.2s] seek another class who are longing for
[3885.4s] the truth in our day
[3887.5s] few of the prophets followers of the
[3889.4s] reformers are actuated by their own
[3891.6s] spirit few are listening for the voice
[3895.0s] of god are ready and ready to accept the
[3897.8s] truth and whatsoever guys it may be
[3900.6s] presented
[3903.0s] in reformers
[3905.0s] conference churches ambassador
[3913.5s] our next topic will be tackling what is
[3916.6s] the church canis aninini
[3919.8s] is the general conference they church
[3922.3s] we will begin by tackling the history of
[3924.2s] the latter rain and the fourth angel
[3926.9s] and we are going to understand what the
[3928.6s] church is and how god is to finish the
[3931.4s] work in the last days
[3933.5s] what would you want to say
[3959.4s] jesus sought another class he left the
[3962.2s] priest he left jerusalem he left the
[3965.0s] temple he left the religious leaders
[3967.5s] matthew chapter 13 verse 15.
[3969.9s] yes
[3976.8s] i kept
[3979.7s] let them alone
[3981.0s] that is matthew chapter 15 verse 13.
[3985.8s] iron throat that burden
[3988.0s] we have seen so far
[3989.9s] that when jesus manifest himself
[3992.6s] he manifests himself in the holy spirit
[3994.4s] to reveal the glory of god to his people
[3996.7s] so that god's people may be established
[3999.8s] in their foundational truths
[4005.3s] when we come to part three
[4007.1s] we are going to move forward to 1888
[4010.2s] from 1888 2022 where is the fourth angel
[4014.7s] has jesus manifested himself to us today
[4018.7s] is the work of god taking a different
[4020.2s] dimension
[4022.7s] what work
[4024.0s] are we supposed to support in the last
[4025.7s] days
[4048.6s] how will we know that the work of god
[4051.3s] has taken a different dimension god
[4053.2s] bless you
[4101.1s] amina
