question is cousin who is here so I don't know yes foreign I thank God for this opportunity complete separation the Lord has separated us from the world and from its customs by a mighty Cleaver of Truth the messages of the past second and the third Angel's messages it is foreign [Music] what Wendy how I live yakumba is the professors of faith they are in carnal security Rafiki now Kwanzaa there was a common theme on any kind of combat they were speaking on the same line Egypt then separate Egypt was you then separation and then foreign it was the Devil Himself in fact let us begin in Exodus chapter 5. complete separation that is our topic complete separation that is the message that God wants us to bear and to carry to the world we are A peculiar people foreign foreign I do not know God neither will I let the children of Israel go who is God in fact foreign I didn't know that in Egypt there were so many gods in fact what a wonderful presentation foreign [Music] foreign as we begin this discourse healing Ezekiel 29 speak and say that says the Lord I am against thee or Pharaoh king of Egypt the great that great dragon that light in the midst of the rivers foreign foreign speaks of end time pharaoh amen amen amenities with this topic complete separation um foreign Lucifer was speaking through him I do not know the Lord that you know in in Exodus chapter one the Bible says there are rules another king that knew not Joseph foreign Exodus chapter one chapter one Genesis Exodus there is something that the devil had thought of doing okay it is [Applause] funny in the book of Exodus chapter one that is a pattern for all the other Generations the Bible says yeah foreign so in Exodus chapter 1 tonight okay and of course we have anti-babylon and enter in Egypt [Music] Exodus chapter one it doesn't foreign and Joseph died and all his Brethren and all that generation at the children of Israel who are fruitful and increased abadably whatever Israel okay okay no no so the more they would multiply the more is Chuck the Lesser his chances of succeeding is kingdom is always going down that is what he knew the Bible says exitingly Mighty and the land was filled with them foreign foreign foreign [Music] foreign you see when I came to adventism adventism is my friends foreign we took our time to study because I knew he didn't uh but one thing religious is a system of Truth yes the Lord has given us all the treasures of Truth at our Command amen amen and the wife knows it but the problem was our people Adventists imagine imagine foreign foreign so the king of Egypt akasema how about and they are mightier than us in terms of strength yeah I have to reformers they are stronger than us okay skills commonly wisdom in fact the king of Babylon said go to the Hebrews foreign he knows the Bible says in verses number 10 come on let us deal wisely with them to attend a quake yes they multiply and it came to pass that when they are failing out any War they join also unto our enemies and fight against us and so get them up out of the land ing tonight foreign that is the plan of the devil the last days I was surprised wakati president and neutral conference president moja police you know how many president Macaulay into religious councils of Kenya akiyambia was a battle where thank you foreign and that is the exact thing that happened in the times when Jesus was being born again same here Moses the devil wanted to reduce the numbers of the people when Jesus was being born the same scenario was happening again so it shall be in the last days haha getting the point so that is where the world is God's people should stand on the platform of Eternal truth you see God will only protect his people as we do everything in our powers to obey every lies that God has himself only those who are living up to the right they have will receive additional light is now the Lord has laid in his word the exact part that you would want his people to follow the path of self-denight the path of righteousness and holiness and to the Lord is misery now wow after the ten place they had witnessed the power and the Providence of God had wrote miraculously in their behalf Anya maku they had seen the ten plagues fall in Egyptians it was the greatest miracles of all miracles they had seen the sea coming together and cover their enemies what are the Miracles what they do it and the Bible is specific in the Book of Micah chapter 6 verse 4 let us begin our discourse now Micah chapter 6 verses number four Micah we are reading some will call it Mika or Mica Micah chapter six amen amen Micah chapter six verse verse 4 the Bible says for I brought thee up out of the land of egyptia and redeemed thee out of the house of servantsima and I sent before thee one Moses two Aaron three Miriam atinami ni katum God is a god of order amen one of USI but I know it says some have advanced the thought that as we near the close of this arts history every child of God will work independently of any religious organization but I have been told that nothing of the list of such consistency shall be it will not work who are pressed together people should press together and have an organization for carrying forward God's work amen foreign uh right now we are dealing with how to organize God's work Where We Gather some one true God will leave us together we are trying to organize God's work in Nairobi we've organized God's work and I pray that also these sides and kakamega we also organize God's work Bitcoin organizations because alone we must organize God's work amen amen amen there were these three Messengers to help them to organize God's work because the three Messengers foreign foreign to help us organize God's work you see yeah and the past history of God's people those messages because all our Pioneers are together and they organize God's work in a systematic manner amen are we together so the history [Applause] the early hours the Ali are the beginnings of God's work s Alias 80 s that is our adventism and that is how Israel established Illinois says Jesus was the foundation of the Jewish economy amen yes hello yes they have to have Miriam so the first second and third Angels messages had to go before them now when adventism was being organized I'm sorry to say their foundations how the Lord and led them you see this quotation about there is nothing to fear for them for the future except as we shall forget the way the Lord has led us and his teachings in our past history not not only see your village to establish the foundation of Israel The Ten Commandments the health message why don't you appoint others foreign are we together so Moses played the role Aaron played a role and Miriam also played a role in the establishment of the work and their Journey safariyao Kanan to the three Messengers foreign ERS the three messages the first second and third Angel's messages that God has given us to establish Us in the present truth 46 Exodus 24 15. to verses to The Last of Us the villain is 46. that is the same pattern when the Roman papacy was ruling 538 to 1798 the total of 60 period of Darkness spiritual Babylon that captivity foreign and then foreign that is John chapter 2 verse 19 amen yes for three days fast second and third Angels messages 1798 to 1844 46 years that is our foundation foundational truth of adventism should not be removed from those I saw somebody very high in the medical position man suggesting that the Timbers were laid longer haha Illinois says I Saw Three Steps one two three whoa and to anyone who shall remove D I saw some approaching the platform and they thought that the Timbers were later on adjusting that improvements would be made and be mentioned specifically in the same as somebody hi in the medical who was that yes the kind of crisis before I go back to AKA man so that is has has done what has sought to bring in the supposition that a great Reformation was to take place among Seventh-Day Adventists one SM two or four paragraphs and that this Reformation would consist in giving up the doctrines that stand as the pillars of our faith and engage in the process of re organization what is Reformation qualities things to take place go to the results the principles of truth that God in his wisdom has given to the remnant Church would be discarded our religion will be changed books of a new order will be a system of intellectual philosophy would be introduced a new organization would be established so clearly clear the steps that is why when Joshua Anna India because Moses did not did not participate in taking the children of Israel to Ghana's India because of the mistake and funny Moses Illinois says the Lord has showed me that the work of my husband is likened to Moses James White read the spiritual progress he was about them with the burden of the people [Music] James whites California Spalding and Madame collection you use such the work of my husband is likely to Moses James White did a lot in establishing the work at the beginning but guess what James White foreign but there were some issues which occurred later on in his ministry and that is why he used to be likened to Moses the pain of inspiration says that um stability but finally the work must progress God's people must go back you see even if Moses would strike the rock twice against God's will it does not mean that there are no faithful people still to carry forward God's word are we together yes when Illinois says let the Pioneer speak he knows she knows what she's saying because that history is very important but wait a minute Moses died the time to conquer the last enemies yes they had to be a fourth message apart from Moses hello Animalia goja to raise the fourth message to conquer now I've been interacting with many people the work of the fourth messenger first of all was to establish God's people in their Foundation experience in that's all foreign quiet look for the way marks us passing one by one look forward foreign [Music] [Music] eyes on the moon and that is what the Pioneers knew let us look at the remarks and let us be established in the truths that married as a people is let us not forget about the way much that is the autonomy chapter 31. [Music] now what your neighbor people how many years can you look at the content of their songs the contents none of them is singing our foundational truths you see the autonomy that one amen ities their song was specifically for their experience in their Journey the way the Lord had made it and his teachings in their past history that was the song God had designed the autonomy chapter number 30 [Music] verses number 19. the Bible says now therefore writing this who for you and teach it the children of Israel put it in their mouths that the soul may be a witness for me against the children of Israel I um foreign foreign [Music] corrupt yourselves and turn aside from the way which I have commanded you and evil will be for you in the latter days because he will do evil in the sight of the Lord to provoke him to anger through the work of your hands and most respect in the ears of the congregation of Israel the words of the song until they were ended Musa foreign [Music] our foundational truth foreign they didn't understand his work we are going to conquer the last City to India they need to know the work of Nehemiah Nehemiah was given the fourth degree amen the first decree was given under King Darius the second degree to rebuild Jerusalem Babylon was given under King Cyrus Ezra 6 14. the third degree and the success the city of Jerusalem was built under three degrees to come in foreign [Music] I'm trying to bring these things to attention to establish so that when we move forward in unison in one mind Ezra chapter 6 verse 14. amen are we together the Bible says on the Elders of the Jews build it and they Prosper until one of you both through the prophesying of haggai the prophet and Zechariah the son of edothada foreign [Music] God of Israel and to the command Cyrus and Darius and after success king of pasia one tattoo okay this is the only decrease that were given and were used to complete the building no pretty hard the declare of Nehemiah the 40 degree are we together the days of the himaya and it will trouble us times [Music] the walls shall be revealed in Travelers times foreign [Music] [Music] foreign and Nairobi Tuesday to make a maternal Nairobi Town City Center Grove today we want to evangelize the cities [Music] there's no money but azima to Japan let your Travelers times we are leading our times foreign we should earnestly pray like the pioneers God will literally bring angels to provide for the means the exact money that he needed for that food so we should pray tomorrow I'm reading the statements of Illinois she says the Lord has his money in the hands of politicians Governors they have his money and if these people would approached well Karma Waters we pray and approach them is drugs so we want to establish a center of influence away from another cities we take the young people away from that place restoration and healing and we train them for the gospel Ministries God has really assisted us the correct sitting MCA or you're white so you pray with us I I don't know how I forgot that prayer request but we really want to yes just remember you pray with us also we need um thank you okay yes now you see Illinois says in the hands of politicians with Patrick and others because it 31 billion Shilling dinner to raise money for his campaigns videos [Music] we should not lack faith in these last days we should pray and act hour okay that is what we are doing this is and we explain to them the great controversy and the urgency of the work angels will come literally [Music] go to your government and very fast which might it might mean we pray first due to end God is interested in those who give their all to Father his work so we take heart and after college we just they just sit there you can share some little tips but uh be assured God has a lot of money in the hands is and it will surprise you those who shall bring in money to sustain God's work in the last days and that's what I'm working towards traveler's times the walls were being rebuilt okay Nehemiah is the fourth messenger just like Joshua and in the times of Joshua their crisis all of Israel has sinned against me they are not fit for the loud Cry of the Guardian they have seen the corporate here [Music] foreign [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] at the second circumcision if the god of Israel is going to guide us to the final battle then we must understand him fully cowboy and the church adopted the Trinity God of Babylon watu wengi holy protest when the final Reformation of the first Angel's message is restoring back the worship of the true God God's people who are convicted in their hearts worry about what is they must accept baptism into the true worship of the Living God Joshua kasema watch anywhere foreign foreign thing for akan the son of karmi the son of zombie the son of Zera the tribe of Judah took the attached things and the anger of the Lord was kindled against the children of Israel and Joshua sent men from Jericho to I ate Yeshua um which is besides but the heaven on the east side of better go up and view the country and the man went up and they returned to Joshua and said unto him let not all the people go up on let me jump to verse 5 and the man of ice molded them about 30 and six men for they chased them from before the gates foreign foreign and Joshua say the last oh Lord God wherefore verse 7. [Applause] the amorites to be destroyed by them unto God we had been content and dwell on the other side of Jordan oh Lord what shall I say when Israel turneth their backs before their enemies what was the reason verse 10 the Lord said unto Joshua Yeshua get the up wherefore lies now that's upon thy face you know Israel Israel and they have also transgressed my Covenant which I commanded them for they have even taken off their casting I'm a Qatar neither will I be with you and I have also they have also stolen and dissembled also and they have put it even among their own staff you see total separation when God calls us to separate from sin and sinners he means it was do you see the formation is very great when the leaders of God's people the misery and to take even the education system of Egypt the end time reformers must restore every present Troop including education reform amen I think it scared the December church and state in our Uganda it's because of the education system of the state in the co-influenced the Roman purpose foreign they would find ways that means that is one of the reasons as to why organizations let the churches have their own School establish other churches and then sell them today what was the any idea chat School we have our church school yes we must do Reformation just bring it that is what people should understand you see akan had foreign [Music] foreign yes yes I will show the necessity of those who believe that they have the present true to be separate and distinct from those who are daily imbibing new heirs I saw that or old should attend their meetings or it was deadly and poisoned their souls that is why there is to be a total separation from Evil workers from sin from era guess what happened before I read this is yes it is under Joshua's Ministry that that that particular investigative judgment begins in the house of God every family must be investigated in the times of Joshua to fit them for the local families do you have any babylonious issues in your house what do you feel what do you watch foreign so that is why they have they have to be are an investigation of the families who profess the worship of the true God you know so only those who qualify this is we have a controversy with the leadership of admittism because they are not clear what part of Babylon is still alive they are not clear by the way are they clearly or not welcome clear no they are not clear you see Revelation 18 is a message that we should go to the world but first it must begin at home and that is what most Adventists will not accept Illinois says the work of these angels come in at the right time and joins in the voice of the third Angel to prepare God's people to start and thus God's people are prepared to stand in the hour of Temptation that is yes to come before them the work of this Angel this Angel the the message of the second Angel is repeated with the additional mention of the Corruptions that have been entering the various churches since 1844 so should we just speak of the Corruptions that were there then no we should continue with that I additional mental Corruptions infiltration additional mentions foreign foreign that was the mistake that is foreign [Music] only those who are the worshipers of the true God [Music] that is and that is why the true messages they can never be found in the leadership of all these people in this business foreign and the Catholic Bishops to bring them on board what part of Babylon is still alive is it fallen or there is some part which is still alive so the corporate Adventist is not sure whether Babylon is falling in short s [Music] to be honest and I say Ma I'm reading the last thoughts as we bring this to a close doesn't matter what God wants when I read this first in pamphlets ph081s now th is which these are publics yes yeah these are complexes zero eighty one I think it's series number eight one page that seven I read the paragraph two [Music] let me begin from paragraph one it says the early reformers amen this is a common quotation right this is the early reformers realized that they could not hope to succeed if their children were educated by the Roman Catholic teachers it requires faith and he was about to live I was also one of them are we a reformers children are being educated it's very sad the early reformers realized that they could not hope to succeed if their children were educated by the Roman Catholic teachers Luther says that the Bible must be studied teachers must be provided schools must be established he felt that to strengthen their information it was a requisite to work on the young to improve schools amen let us work on them let's put our energy our that is what we are told and to propagate through Christiano the knowledge necessary for the profound study of the Holy scriptures this accordingly was one of the objects of his life he saw it in particular at the period which we have reached and wrote the councilors of all the cities of Germany calling on them to found Christian Schools amen the early reformers found it necessary to have their own causes of study textbooks teachers methods principles Etc they separated themselves completely from the popular schools of the day it required courage and faith in those days to take such a stand and it will require even more courage and Faith for those who are preparing for translation to take the stand which the testimonies are pleading for them to take they knew that if their children should go to the schools where the popular education was given they would receive the mark of the beasts those who are leading up to the light at the present time will see even more clearly that if their children continue to go to these popular schools They will receive such principles as will compare them to assist in giving life to the image of the beasts anyone who has a knowledge of the third Angel's message and who will take the trouble to examine this and studies the methods of the popular systems of Education can see that the books are filled with those eras which will oblite those who are receiving their education from them to take the Dreadful step which will bring upon the world are religious and civil Darkness greater than has ever been known before as we continue to work on our information to establish of the present truth of the first second third Angel's message we should never forget of our children let us pray that God will open doors for us to establish our church school so that our children may be trained and taught by our own may the Lord bless us in Jesus name the way Max I don't know which number it was but five minutes look for the women's so brother it's here this idea we sing it unitedly then we'll need them as I pray rise up [Music] together [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] they are today [Music] Christ and is [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] way more foreign [Applause] [Music] foreign [Music] foreign foreign foreign foreign [Music] foreign

[1169.6s] happened in the times when Jesus was
[1172.3s] being born again
[1174.0s] same here Moses
[1178.3s] the devil wanted to reduce the numbers
[1180.2s] of the people
[1181.6s] when Jesus was being born the same
[1183.5s] scenario was happening again
[1192.9s] so it shall be in the last days
[1208.0s] haha
[1209.8s] getting the point so that is where the
[1212.3s] world is
[1222.6s] God's people should stand on the
[1225.5s] platform of Eternal truth you see God
[1227.9s] will only protect his people as we do
[1229.9s] everything in our powers
[1231.8s] to obey every lies that God has
[1234.6s] himself
[1247.1s] only those who are living up to the
[1249.5s] right they have
[1250.7s] will receive additional light
[1253.9s] is now
[1263.2s] the Lord
[1265.5s] has laid in his word
[1268.3s] the exact part
[1271.4s] that you would want his people to follow
[1273.4s] the path of self-denight
[1276.1s] the path of righteousness and holiness
[1279.7s] and to the Lord
[1282.6s] is misery

[1308.5s] and the Providence of God
[1312.1s] had wrote miraculously in their behalf
[1316.3s] Anya maku they had seen the ten plagues
[1320.2s] fall in Egyptians
[1326.0s] it was the greatest miracles of all
[1328.5s] miracles
[1330.7s] they had seen the sea coming together
[1333.9s] and cover their enemies
[1336.1s] what are the Miracles
[1338.0s] what they do it
[1341.9s] and the Bible is specific in the Book of
[1345.0s] Micah chapter 6 verse 4 let us begin our
[1347.4s] discourse now
[1349.6s] Micah chapter 6
[1352.0s] verses
[1353.6s] number four
[1360.0s] Micah

[1426.1s] one of USI
[1435.1s] but I know it says some have advanced
[1437.5s] the thought
[1438.5s] that as we near the close of this arts
[1440.9s] history every child of God will work
[1443.9s] independently of any religious
[1446.3s] organization
[1447.9s] but I have been told that nothing of the
[1451.5s] list of such consistency shall be it
[1454.6s] will not work
[1456.3s] who are pressed together
[1458.7s] people should press together and have an
[1462.3s] organization for carrying forward God's
[1464.7s] work amen

[1487.0s] and I pray that also these sides and
[1489.3s] kakamega we also organize God's work
[1491.9s] Bitcoin organizations because
[1500.0s] alone
[1505.2s] we must organize God's work amen
[1507.9s] amen
[1522.2s] amen there were these three Messengers

[1534.6s] foreign
[1535.8s] foreign
[1549.3s] to help us organize God's work
[1552.9s] you see yeah
[1555.9s] and the past history of God's people

[1565.7s] because all our Pioneers are together
[1567.9s] and they organize God's work in a
[1570.4s] systematic manner amen
[1572.6s] are we together so the history
[1576.1s] [Applause]
[1581.0s] the early hours the Ali are the
[1584.2s] beginnings of God's work
[1587.6s] s Alias 80 s
[1590.8s] that is our adventism
[1593.6s] and that is how Israel established
[1597.9s] Illinois says Jesus was the foundation
[1601.2s] of the Jewish economy
[1603.7s] amen yes
[1612.2s] hello
[1620.6s] yes they have to have Miriam
[1624.8s] so the first second and third Angels
[1627.9s] messages had to go before them now
[1632.5s] when adventism was being organized I'm
[1635.9s] sorry to say
[1639.4s] their foundations how the Lord and led
[1643.1s] them
[1644.7s] you see this quotation about
[1647.0s] there is nothing to fear for them
[1650.4s] for the future except
[1652.7s] as we shall forget
[1654.9s] the way the Lord has led us and his
[1658.7s] teachings in
[1661.2s] our past history
[1663.7s] not not only see your village
[1676.6s] to establish the foundation of Israel
[1682.6s] The Ten Commandments the
[1687.0s] health message
[1694.2s] why don't you appoint others foreign
[1703.4s] are we together so Moses played the role
[1706.7s] Aaron played a role
[1709.1s] and Miriam also played a role in the
[1711.5s] establishment of the work and their
[1713.1s] Journey safariyao
[1717.6s] Kanan
[1726.7s] to the three Messengers
[1730.0s] foreign
[1739.9s] ERS the three messages
[1742.2s] the first second and third Angel's
[1744.1s] messages
[1746.8s] that God has given us to establish Us in
[1751.1s] the present truth
[1760.0s] 46 Exodus 24 15.
[1765.1s] to verses to The Last of Us the villain
[1767.5s] is
[1778.6s] 46.
[1784.0s] that is the same pattern
[1787.6s] when the Roman papacy was ruling 538 to
[1791.7s] 1798 the total of 60 period of Darkness
[1797.5s] spiritual Babylon
[1799.9s] that captivity foreign
[1830.4s] and then foreign
[1844.2s] that is John chapter 2 verse 19 amen
[1852.7s] yes
[1856.2s] for three days fast
[1858.8s] second and third Angels messages 1798
[1863.8s] to 1844 46 years that is our foundation
[1869.8s] foundational truth of adventism
[1878.7s] should not be removed from those
[1882.4s] I saw somebody very high in the medical
[1887.8s] position man
[1889.8s] suggesting that the Timbers were laid
[1891.9s] longer
[1892.9s] haha Illinois says I Saw Three Steps one
[1897.6s] two three
[1899.5s] whoa and to anyone who shall remove
[1907.3s] D I saw some approaching the platform
[1909.3s] and they thought that the Timbers were
[1911.9s] later on
[1914.0s] adjusting that improvements would be
[1915.9s] made
[1917.3s] and be mentioned specifically in the
[1919.0s] same as somebody hi in the medical
[1922.7s] who was that
[1925.1s] yes the kind of crisis
[1928.8s] before I go back to AKA man
[1932.4s] so that is
[1943.7s] has has done what
[1946.6s] has sought to bring in the supposition
[1948.7s] that a great Reformation was to take
[1951.5s] place among Seventh-Day Adventists one
[1953.9s] SM two or four paragraphs and that this
[1957.0s] Reformation would consist in giving up
[1959.4s] the doctrines that stand as the pillars
[1961.9s] of our faith and engage in the process
[1964.8s] of re
[1965.9s] organization what is
[1972.4s] Reformation qualities things to take
[1975.4s] place go to the results the principles
[1977.9s] of truth that God in his wisdom has
[1980.1s] given to the remnant Church would be
[1981.7s] discarded
[1983.5s] our religion will be changed
[1986.5s] books of a new order will be
[1991.6s] a system of intellectual philosophy
[1994.0s] would be introduced
[1996.4s] a new organization
[1999.0s] would be established
[2001.5s] so clearly clear the steps that is why
[2005.4s] when Joshua Anna India because Moses did
[2009.8s] not did not participate in taking the
[2013.0s] children of Israel to Ghana's India
[2014.9s] because of the mistake and funny
[2017.9s] Moses
[2020.3s] Illinois says the Lord has showed me
[2022.5s] that the work of my husband is likened
[2024.6s] to Moses
[2026.4s] James White
[2028.3s] read the spiritual progress he was about
[2030.3s] them with the burden of the people
[2034.4s] [Music]
[2038.0s] James whites California
[2041.7s] Spalding and Madame collection you use
[2044.0s] such the work of my husband is likely to
[2046.9s] Moses
[2049.6s] James White did a lot in establishing
[2052.1s] the work at the beginning
[2053.6s] but guess what
[2058.6s] James White
[2061.1s] foreign
[2067.3s] but there were some issues which
[2068.9s] occurred later on in his ministry
[2071.9s] and that is why he used to be likened to
[2073.8s] Moses
[2075.8s] the pain of inspiration says that
[2079.1s] um
[2081.3s] stability
[2086.1s] but
[2088.2s] finally
[2089.9s] the work must progress
[2092.6s] God's people must go back you see even
[2095.3s] if Moses would strike the rock twice
[2098.4s] against God's will it does not mean that
[2101.8s] there are no faithful people still to
[2104.1s] carry forward God's word
[2113.8s] are we together
[2115.2s] yes
[2116.6s] when Illinois says let the Pioneer speak
[2119.1s] he knows she knows what she's saying
[2123.4s] because that history is very important
[2125.7s] but wait a minute
[2128.8s] Moses died
[2133.3s] the time to conquer the last enemies

[3484.9s] verse 7.
[3487.9s] [Applause]
[3497.7s] the amorites to be destroyed by them
[3502.0s] unto God we had been content and dwell
[3504.4s] on the other side of Jordan oh Lord what
[3507.3s] shall I say when Israel turneth their
[3509.2s] backs before their enemies
[3514.1s] what was the reason
[3516.1s] verse 10 the Lord said unto Joshua
[3519.1s] Yeshua get the up
[3521.5s] wherefore lies now that's upon thy face
[3526.1s] you know
[3528.0s] Israel
[3531.7s] Israel
[3534.1s] and they have also transgressed my
[3537.6s] Covenant which I commanded them for they
[3539.7s] have even taken off their casting
[3549.3s] I'm a Qatar
[3551.0s] neither will I be with you
[3554.1s] and I have also they have also stolen
[3556.4s] and dissembled also and they have put it
[3560.0s] even among their own staff
[3570.2s] you see total separation when God calls
[3572.8s] us to separate from sin and sinners
[3576.4s] he means it
[3579.9s] was
[3584.8s] do you see the formation is very great
[3590.3s] when the leaders of God's people
[3595.3s] the misery
[3598.6s] and to take even the education system
[3601.7s] of Egypt
[3603.9s] the end time reformers must restore
[3606.7s] every present Troop including
[3611.6s] education reform
[3614.5s] amen
[3623.7s] I think it scared the December
[3627.1s] church and state
[3630.4s] in our Uganda
[3634.6s] it's because of the education system of
[3637.2s] the state
[3639.0s] in the co-influenced the Roman purpose
[3646.4s] foreign
[3652.1s] they would find ways that means that is
[3655.0s] one of the reasons as to why
[3657.6s] organizations
[3660.4s] let the churches have their own School
[3670.4s] establish other churches and then sell
[3672.7s] them today what was the any idea
[3679.9s] chat School
[3683.2s] we have our church school
[3685.7s] yes
[3687.2s] we must do Reformation
[3695.7s] just bring it
[3697.1s] that is what people should understand
[3709.0s] you see akan had foreign
[3723.3s] [Music]
[3740.3s] foreign
[3745.0s] yes
[3748.4s] yes I will show the necessity of those
[3750.2s] who believe that they have the present
[3752.3s] true to be separate and distinct from
[3755.1s] those who are daily imbibing new heirs
[3760.9s] I saw that
[3762.5s] or old should attend their meetings or
[3766.4s] it was deadly and poisoned their souls
[3779.9s] that is why there is to be a total
[3783.1s] separation
[3785.0s] from Evil workers from sin from era
[3797.2s] guess what happened before I read this
[3800.6s] is
[3805.7s] yes it is under Joshua's Ministry
[3809.7s] that that that particular investigative
[3812.4s] judgment begins in the house of God
[3816.6s] every family must be investigated in the
[3820.4s] times of Joshua
[3822.4s] to fit them for the local families
[3830.4s] do you have any babylonious issues in
[3833.6s] your house
[3836.4s] what do you feel
[3839.0s] what do you watch
[3840.7s] foreign
[3872.3s] so that is why they have they have to be
[3875.2s] are
[3876.2s] an investigation
[3878.3s] of the families who profess the worship
[3881.7s] of the true God
[3883.6s] you know
[3886.0s] so only those who qualify
[3892.0s] this is
[3898.6s] we have a controversy with the
[3902.0s] leadership of admittism because they are
[3904.7s] not clear what part of Babylon is still
[3906.8s] alive they are not clear by the way are
[3908.9s] they clearly or not
[3911.3s] welcome clear
[3913.0s] no they are not clear
[3917.2s] you see Revelation 18 is a message that
[3920.7s] we should go to the world but first it
[3922.8s] must begin at home
[3924.4s] and that is what most Adventists will
[3926.2s] not accept
[3928.3s] Illinois says the work of these angels
[3931.0s] come in at the right time
[3933.8s] and joins in the voice of the third
[3937.7s] Angel to prepare God's people to start
[3940.4s] and thus God's people are prepared to
[3942.2s] stand in the hour of Temptation
[3944.6s] that is yes to come before them
[3950.3s] the work of this Angel this Angel the
[3953.6s] the message of the second Angel is
[3956.5s] repeated with
[3958.7s] the additional mention of the
[3962.2s] Corruptions that have been entering the
[3964.9s] various
[3966.6s] churches since
[3969.0s] 1844 so
[3974.5s] should we just speak of the Corruptions
[3976.8s] that were there then
[3978.4s] no we should continue with that I
[3981.2s] additional mental
[3984.2s] Corruptions
[3992.8s] infiltration
[4001.7s] additional mentions
[4004.5s] foreign
[4012.4s] foreign
[4039.9s] that was the mistake
[4042.2s] that is
[4050.8s] foreign
[4056.2s] [Music]
[4065.2s] only those who are the worshipers of the
[4067.9s] true God
[4068.5s] [Music]
[4075.3s] that is
[4076.9s] and that is why the true messages
[4080.5s] they can never be found in the
[4082.7s] leadership of all these people in this
[4084.2s] business
[4085.3s] foreign
[4114.1s] and the Catholic Bishops to bring them
[4116.5s] on board what part of Babylon is still
[4118.9s] alive
[4120.0s] is it fallen or there is some part which
[4122.7s] is still alive
[4125.5s] so the corporate Adventist is not sure
[4128.1s] whether Babylon is falling in short
[4132.2s] s
[4134.4s] [Music]
[4148.3s] to be honest
[4150.9s] and I say Ma
[4155.4s] I'm reading the last
[4158.1s] thoughts
[4164.5s] as we bring this to a close
[4171.8s] doesn't matter what God wants when I
[4174.3s] read this first
[4176.1s] in pamphlets ph081s
[4180.9s] now th is which these are publics
[4183.8s] yes
[4185.2s] yeah these are complexes
[4187.8s] zero eighty one I think it's series
[4189.5s] number eight one page that seven
[4191.7s] I read the paragraph two
[4196.2s] [Music]
[4197.4s] let me begin from paragraph one it says
[4200.3s] the early reformers amen
[4203.2s] this is a common quotation
[4207.2s] right this is
[4213.0s] the early reformers
[4215.7s] realized
[4219.4s] that they could not hope to succeed
[4222.1s] if their children were educated by the
[4224.2s] Roman Catholic teachers
[4232.7s] it requires faith
[4235.3s] and he was about to live
[4238.9s] I was also one of them
[4242.2s] are we a reformers
[4245.3s] children are being educated
[4249.7s] it's very sad
[4251.4s] the early reformers realized that they
[4254.4s] could not hope to succeed if their
[4256.0s] children were educated by the Roman
[4257.5s] Catholic teachers
[4259.3s] Luther says
[4261.1s] that the Bible must be studied teachers
[4264.0s] must be provided schools must be
[4266.4s] established he felt that to strengthen
[4269.7s] their information it was a requisite to
[4273.0s] work on the young to improve schools
[4275.6s] amen
[4284.6s] let us work on them
[4287.0s] let's put our energy our
[4289.6s] that is what we are told
[4292.6s] and to propagate through Christiano the
[4295.2s] knowledge necessary for the profound
[4296.8s] study of the Holy scriptures
[4298.9s] this accordingly was one of the objects
[4302.1s] of his life he saw it in particular at
[4305.2s] the period which we have reached and
[4307.9s] wrote the councilors of all the cities
[4309.9s] of Germany calling on them to found
[4312.7s] Christian Schools amen the early
[4316.6s] reformers found it necessary to have
[4318.3s] their own causes of study textbooks
[4321.0s] teachers methods principles Etc they
[4325.7s] separated themselves completely from the
[4327.9s] popular schools of the day it required
[4330.6s] courage and faith in those days to take
[4333.7s] such a stand and it will require even
[4336.8s] more courage and Faith for those who are
[4339.7s] preparing for translation to take the
[4342.6s] stand which the testimonies are pleading
[4345.5s] for them to take
[4347.5s] they knew that if their children should
[4351.3s] go to the schools where the popular
[4353.4s] education was given they would receive
[4355.9s] the mark of the beasts
[4359.1s] those who are leading up to the light at
[4361.3s] the present time will see even more
[4363.9s] clearly that if their children continue
[4366.0s] to go to these popular schools They will
[4368.7s] receive such principles as will compare
[4371.4s] them to assist in giving life to the
[4374.1s] image of the beasts anyone who has a
[4376.9s] knowledge of the third Angel's message
[4378.3s] and who will take the trouble to examine
[4380.9s] this and studies
[4382.8s] the methods of the popular systems of
[4385.6s] Education can see that the books are
[4389.4s] filled with those eras which will oblite
[4392.7s] those who are receiving their education
[4394.9s] from them to take the Dreadful step
[4397.9s] which will bring upon the world are
[4400.6s] religious
[4401.8s] and civil Darkness greater than has ever
[4405.3s] been known before
[4412.2s] as we continue to work on our
[4413.8s] information to establish of the present
[4416.3s] truth of the first second third Angel's
[4418.0s] message we should never forget of our
[4420.3s] children let us pray that God will open
[4422.6s] doors for us to establish our church
[4425.1s] school
[4426.0s] so that our children may be trained and
[4429.4s] taught by our own
[4432.9s] may the Lord bless us in Jesus name
