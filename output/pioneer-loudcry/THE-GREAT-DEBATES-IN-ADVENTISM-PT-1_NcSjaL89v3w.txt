be similar to that of the day of pentecost now look what the spiritual prophecy does she takes revelation chapter 18 the loud cry she links that to 1840 to 1844 then she concludes by pentecost three

darius are texas and nehemiah's time period those are four decrees tonight 1842 1844 to honor the first angel's message 1798 1798 is the first time period when the first angel's message came into the history great controversy great controversy i'm reading it says great controversy page page uh great controversy i'm reading page 356 paragraph two great controversy 356 paragraph true the main point here is to establish that the foundations of this spiritual house adventism must be laid under the first and the second angel's messages 1840 1844 in fact 1798-1844 that is the period of the first and the second angel's messages the bible say a spirit of prophet says concerning the apostle paul the apostle paul warned the church not to look for the coming of christ in his day that they shall not come says paul except there come inner falling away and that man of sin be revealed the son of perdition not until after the great apostasy and the long period of the reign of the man of sin can we look for the advent of christ the man of sin which is also styled the mystery of iniquity moana before the son of perdition and that wicked represents the papacy which as foretold in prophecy was to maintain its supremacy for 1260 years this period ended in 1798 the coming of christ could not take place before that time paul covers with his caution the whole of the christian dispensation down to the year 1798 it is this side of that time that the message of christ's second advent who can be proclaimed no such message has ever been given in the past ages paul as we have seen did not preach it concerning the message of judgement hakubi sayokum he pointed his brethren into the far distance future for the coming of the lord the reformers did not proclaim the judgment our message martin luther placed the judgment about 300 years in the future from his day but since 1798 upon an attack of shika point but since 1798 the book of daniel has been unsealed knowledge of the prophecies has increased and many have proclaimed the solemn message of the judgment near uni ujuba malay kawakwanza ana adventism god begins to lay the foundation when the fast angel's message arrives in history welcome abu hayao kamawaz mana tukidu ahivya kuramuta tutikisa if god lays the foundation of adventism when the first angel's message arrives in history 1798 to 1844 keeping the hitchhiker moving up to me matthew chapter 7 verse 21 matthew chapter 7 verses number 21. the bible teaches yes honorable matthew chapter seven was twenty-one appendix spiritual prophecy supplements what the bible actually it it gives light to what the bible already has written because let our foundation be in the bible first we will have a lot of peace and confidence in whatever we are we are believing or we are teaching matthew chapter 7 verses number 21 24 24 sorry it says he shall be likened unto a man that lays or build his house upon a rock so the foundation must be built upon the rock the rock who is christ himself okay why do we say the foundation must be built upon the rock and the rock is christ himself you see when the foundation zilianza coequa as earlier 1798 candela did you know that jesus himself came down to empower the movement movement chapter 10 verses number one philadelphian experience 1840-1844 revelation chapter 10 verses number one revelation chapter 10 verses [Music] his legs or his feet as the pillars of fire his face shone as the sun this mighty angel that came down from heaven the bible teaches also in verses number two he had a rainbow upon his head and the bible teaches in verses number two uh this mighty angel descends with a little book and the bible teaches that the mighty angel as a rainbow akona opindem 17 let's go to the book of matthew 17. the angel's face was shining like the sun that is what that angel's face usually does matthew chapter 17 verses chapter one to your universe i'll have to repel it to only accompanied foundations our foundations were laid upon the solid rock and that foundation that begins to build the house that is called adventism la simae revelation chapter 1 verses number 12 revelation chapter 1 verses number 12 unto the son of man he saw christ himself but look at the description of how john describes the son of man who is christ himself it says in verses it says in verses number 15 and his feet as as if they burnt in a furnace were as clean as though they were burning in a furnace his feet and that is what john says in revelation chapter 10 so this is christ himself and of course the rainbow was upon his his head when he came down this mighty angel okay so jesus is the foundation of adventism when the foundations were being laid missing bc bible commentary volume seven ana sema and i say maybe bible commentary volume bible uh seven bc nafkiri i'm a trasomata christian triumphant there are many books at an endicott seven bc about the economy the bible commentary volume 7 page 971 paragraph 3 she says the mighty angel who instructed john was no less a personage than jesus christ setting his right foot on the sea and his left foot upon the dry line shows the part which he is acting in the closing scenes of the great controversy with satan amen amen so the bible affirms that this is jesus 1840 august 11 1840 the mighty angel descends with a little book open the book of daniel and the great advent millerite movement is empowered because jesus is the foundation we will enter into a great period of debates in adventism do we stick to the foundations or do we destroy the foundations and begin rebuilding the walls anew okay this malachi chapter 3 the three comings of jesus to his temple malachi chapter 3 the bible says in malachi chapter 3 verses number one amen these are called biblical prophetic parallels ambassadors 1840 to 1844 the great advent movement the foundations of adventism while aids malachi chapter 3 the philadelphian experience the bible teaches malachi chapter 3 verse 1 the bible says and the lord whom you seek shall suddenly come to his temple so before the lord comes to his telephone there is a messenger or a message that is to prepare the people to welcome the lord to come to his temple appendocrine because jesus comes to his temple literally yes and we see john the baptist being the preparer of the way for the literal coming of christ to his literal temple whatever matthew chapter three the first fulfillment of malachi chapter three fulfills in matthew chapter two angali the first fulfillment me my concern is how does it fulfill in the philadelphia and experience me upon you nico okay matthew chapter 3 the bible says this was the voice that was crying in the wilderness prepare the world way of the lord the lord is suddenly coming to his temple and jesus came when jesus came to his temple he labored amongst his people they reject christ okay now that was the first time when jesus was coming to his temple that was literally yes in the book great controversy we have a whole topic called in his temple but what about the second time because this is john the baptist who is movement the philadelphian experience uh luke chapter one amen luke chapter one the first time jesus came to his temple was in the time of ephesus 1840 to 1844 mana you and your mother uh luke chapter one john came in the spirit and the power of elijah allahu spiritual prophecy naturally according to the great advent millerite movement you see a similarity luke chapter 1 and verses number 17. the bible says in luke chapter 1 verses number 17 amen luka modiakuminasa so john shall go before christ in the spirit and power of elijah that is the first time when jesus is coming in his temple the first time look at it the second time revelation chapter 10 yes he comes to empower that great advent movement 1842-1844 and that is the second time when jesus comes in his temple the second time skeletal spirit of prophet sinatra behave spirit of prophecy says in early writings 233 ali writings page 233 paragraph 1 early writings page 233 paragraph one look at what spiritual prophecy says concerning that movement she says she says when milarite movement was raised by god i saw that god was in the proclamation of the time in 1843 it was his design to arouse the people and bring them to a testing point were they where they should decide for or against the truth ministers were convicted of the correctness of the positions taken on the prophetic periods and some renounced for their pride and left their salaries and their churches to go forth from place to place to give the message but as the message from heaven could find a place in the hearts but of but a few of the professed ministers of christ the work was laid upon many who are not preachers some left their fields to sound the message in anywhere ministers laid aside this is paragraph three they are sanctarian views of and feelings and united in proclaim proclaiming the coming of jesus it continues those whose lives had been marked with dishonesty were anxious to make restitutions parents felt the deepest solitude for their children it was a period of repentance pointy anguish she says thousands were led to embrace the truth preached by william miller and the servants of god were raised up in the spirit and the power of elijah to proclaim the message like john the forerunner of jesus those who preached this solemn message felt compelled to lay the axe at the root of the tree and call upon men to bring forth fruits need for repentance so you see 1840 empowerments and his companions they were raised in the spirit and power of elijah wakapeleca amen this is the second time jesus comes to his temple okay these are called prophetic parallels yes his temple revelation 18 about angelia queso that mighty angel again must come down just before the final crisis three times jesus comes to his temple maratha anakulamaka temple yak in the times of john the baptist philadelphia fss in the times of philadelphia and the times of laura kia maratha three histories linked together that is why elenota nasima in great controversy 6 11 paragraph 1 the mighty angel that comes down to lighten the earth with his glory that final movement movement here mushroom will be likened to the movement of 1840 to 1844 amen amen amen amen yes matthew 7 24 that the house that is built upon the rock can not fall when the storm comes there is a crisis the san diego crisis is likened to the storm spiritual prophecies nasima as the storm approaches many who have professed faith in the third angels message and have not been sanctified by it they will abandon their positions and join ranks with the enemy what storm is coming apart from the sunderland crisis now yes when i say my number uh you what does the bible teach matthew chapter 7 verse 21 to summit the foundation is laid before the mighty angel comes down the foundation continues to be laid until 1844 s okay when the lord shall open the reigns the windows of heaven the great outpouring of the lattering that corinthians chapter 3 verses number 11. the bible says in first corinthians chapter 3 verse 11. the foundations are laid under the first message and the second message full stop those who go back to the foundations to find fault with the foundations can never receive the latter rain and work the final messages of the lovecraft that are dangerous now that can you very clearly and that is why we will have debates in adventism worldwide people will begin debating because they are those who are leaving the platform the foundations of adventism niko kartika first corinthians uh chapter number three verses number 11 first corinthians chapter 3 verse 11. so yes mr manuscript releases volume 15 15 mr she says 15 mr uh 15 mr page 317 paragraph 1 15 mr voluntary macondika manuscript releases volume 15. 15 mr page 317 okay we are reading from

not to hurt the the new converts by living irreligious lives temptations are being brought in by men who have been long in the truth the truth that we received in 1841 42 43 and 44 are now to be studied and proclaimed the messages of the first second and third angels will be in the future be proclaimed with a loud voice they will be given with ns determination and in the power of the spirit amen ametaji 1840 41 42 43 44. and here i'm reading from 2 21 mr manuscript releases volume 21 21 mr 21 mr and listen very carefully 21 mr page 437 21 mr page four that's seven and paragraph number one she says exclusively all the messages given from 1840 to 1844 are to be made forcible now for there are many people who have lost their very bearings abuse are your point blessed are your eyes for they see and your ears for they hear for verily i say unto you that many prophets and righteous men have desired to see those things which you have seen and they have not been able blessed are the eyes we saw the things which was seen in 1843 and in 1844 the message was given and there should be no delay in repeating the message 40 41 42 43 44 all the messages foundational truths the message was given and there should be no delay in repeating the message for the signs of the times are fast fulfilling the closing work must be done what is the closing work it is the loud cry of the third angel when revelation 18 comes to reality the closing work must be done a great work will be done in a short time a message will soon be given by god's appointment that will swell into a loud cry then daniel will stand in his lot to give his testimony california whatever point of doctrine you are controversing right now i want to find a debate it does not matter whether you are conscious or not whether you are debating these truths consciously or unconsciously people are taking positions do we return back to our foundational truths or do we remain on the platform that has been built on timbus writings that is where trouble began early writings let me search for early writings and then to rudy katkapibilia philadelphia experience 1842 1844 the foundation was laid by god himself uh another quotations ali writings that the vitelli on yeshua spiritual gifts spiritual gifts volume 1 of kiriko 1sg spiritual gifts volume 1 1 sg page 168 paragraph 2. okay spiritual gifts 258 paragraph three listen to how spiritual prophecies linking these prophetic lines spiritual gifts or ali writings 258.3 ali writings 258.3 she says i saw a company well guarded and farmed nikauna ki kunichawatumbacha waliku naimara omisimama giving no countenance to those who would unsettle the established faith of the body god looked upon them with a probation i was shown three steps the first second and the third angel's message said my accompanying angel woe unto him that shall move a block or star pin of these messages the true understanding of these messages is of vital importance the destiny of souls hangs in the balance in the manner in which these messages are received i was again brought down through these messages and so how dearly the people of god had purchased their experience what was reported experience yeah philadelphia experience it had been obtained through much suffering and severe conflict god had led them along step by step until he had placed upon them a solid immovable platform solid immovable yeah i saw individuals approach the platform and examine the foundation some with rejoicing immediately stepped upon it others commenced to find the fold with the foundation they wished improvements made and then the platform would be more perfect and the people much happier some stepped off the platform to examine it and declared it to be laid wrong the foundation was laid wrong let's step off the platform listen and the people must appear some step of the platform to uh to examine it and declared it to be laid wrong but i saw that nearly all stood upon the farm platform and exhorted those who had stepped off to seize their complaints for god was the master builder and they were fighting against him they recounted the wonderful work of god which had led them to the farm platform and in union raised their eyes to heaven and with a loud voice glorified god an honor then on a semi i was pointed back to the proclamation of the first advent of christ john was sent in the spirit and power of elijah to prepare the way for jesus those who rejected the testimony of jesus of john were not benefited by the teachings of jesus their opposition to the message that foretold is coming place them in a worst position where they could not really receive the strongest deletion so anatomy the immovable platform the bt 1840 to 1844 mungo america are debating our foundational truths just know something in your mind that platform is immovable it has been laid upon a solid foundation nada white and ander cosima the foundation of advertising adventism consists of truths okay concerning the truth in consoles on writers and editors cw page 29 paragraph one consoles and writers consoles to writers and editors cw page twenty nine paragraph one let the truths that are the foundation of our faith be kept before the people let the truths that are the foundation of our faith be kept before the people how could semia comba let theologians or some people go and examine the foundation and replace them and bring them before the people no no no no no no no no no no worldwide adventism there are so many people professing to be seventh-day adventism but when you begin to examine their foundation it is built upon sand it is built upon timbus they have left the platform of eternal truth 1798 to 1844 46 years letter the first angel's message the second annual message the third angel's message is john chapter 2 verse 19. i am not going to touch the 46 years but i'm going to rebuild it in three days three days 46 years the 46 years are there 1798 to 1844 but the three days now god brings the first angel's message the first day the second angel's message 1842 the second day then the third angel's message october 22 1844 the house begins to be built the foundations are laid and they are upon a solid platform let the truths that are the foundation of our faith be kept before the people some will depart from the faith giving heed to seducing spirits and doctrines of devils hajja say massam will depart from the church you can't be in the church but not in the faith of the first second and third angel you are not in the foundation and this is a difference that most adventists have never even realized in pakistan you see you can't be in the church but outside the faith that's why paul says in second corinthians thirteen verse one even appalling ana sema ii corinthians chapter 13. the bible says verses number five second corinthians 13 verse 5. the bible says yeah test yourselves whether you be in the faith not you've been the church you can't be in the church but not in the faith that faith that lays the foundations okay she says in cw 29.1 some will depart from the faith giving heed to say this in spirits and doctrines of devils they talk science and the enemy comes in and gives them an abundance of science but it is not the science of salvation it is not the science of humility of concentration or of the sanctification of the spirit we are now to understand what the pillars of our faith are the truth that have made us as a people what we are leading us on step by step amen amentopia review and herald of may 25 1905. that point is clear and that is why unapologetic let's go back to the bible when the children of israel came out of babylon and they went to rebuild the foundation okay there's something that happened very funny you see when you begin to lay another foundation it cannot be powerful or perfect as the first foundation that god laid i wish i can let's go to the book of hagai hagai they cry why do they cry kuan nino analia the reason is they they look at these foundations which are being led laid out and now let's go to haggai chapter hey chapter chapter chapter one the bible teaches in hege or hagai depending on how you'll pronounce it the bible says hagai chapter 2 we are in the book of hagai chapter 2 the bible says who amongst you saw the former house in its initial glory 1842 1844 and how do you see it now 2021 munao who can compare adventism 1840 to 1844 and now from 1888 to 2021 these are two different periods why because the foundation that was laid 1840 1844 at the foundation that was laid again during the time of reorganization are two different things now okay so my statement just one more time [Music] haggai is prophesying how god is going to shake the entire act so that the desire of nation jesus comes back to his temple the third time revelation 18 and that is the topic of tomorrow you see even if the house is inferior god still knows he must shake the heavens and the earth and the desire of nations christians the purpose of the fourth angel the purpose of the desire of nations to come back to his temple is to speak to the children of israel that they accept their foundations to be fit for the outcry of the tad angel selected messages book one page two or four one sm nini ko mi fanika page 204 okay paragraph one ninja fanica paragraph two one sm two four paragraph two selectors messages book one page two or four paragraph two skeletal the enemy of souls has sought to bring in the suppositions of it that a great reformation matanganeso was to take place among seventh-day adventists and that this reformation would consist in giving up the doctrines which stand as the pillars of our faith and engaging in a process of reorganization reorganization reorganization shikka your point wakati what um reorganization they have left the foundation and they cannot be fit for the loud cry of the third angel it means that god must raise a people to be fit for the louder of the third angels the temple of the lord the temple of the lord are we the temple of the lord the temple of the lord avi hawaii they engage in the process of reorganization why this reformation to take place what would result number one the principles of truth that god in his wisdom has given to the remnant church would be discarded our religion would be changed the fundamental principles that have sustained the work for the last 50 years would be accounted as error a new organization would be established shikha your point of visual a new organization seventh-day adventism worldwide church is operating under a new organization and by mccoy established books of a new order would be written a system of intellectual philosophy would be introduced the founders of this system would go into the cities and do a wonderful work the sabbath of course would be likely regarded as also the god who created it nothing would be allowed to stand in the way of this new movement chica your point the leaders who teach that virtue is better than vice but god being removed shekel your point god being removed they would place their dependence on human power which without god is worthless their foundation would be built on sand tonight matthew 7 24 and the storm and the tempest would sweep away the structure then she says who has an authority to be in such a movement we have our bibles we have our experience attested by the miraculous working of the holy spirit we have a truth that admits of no compromise shall living out repediate me to the iceberg there you are won't got track sequencer ana sema uh philadelphian experience revelation chapter 3 we go back there relation chapter 3 philadelphia experience we must put on christ's righteousness we must accept christ as the rock the foundation we must accept and go back to the foundational truths that christ placed in the time period of philadelphia that is the experience that is to give the loud cry now quotations are quotation okay skeleton let us first read philadelphia revelation chapter three the bible says in verses number eight behold i give thee those who are of the synagogue of satan so those who will go back to the philadelphia experience flock nataka spirit of prophet who are the synagogue of satan mana took akubali kurudi to the experience to the experience of philadelphia of obviously philadelphia experience word to the little flock word to the little flock wlfw lf uh let me just search it wlan wlf page 12 paragraph 2 fica pali page 12 paragraph 2 listen to what she says okay she says you think that those who worship before the saints feet revelation 3 9 will at last be saved for god showed me that this class were professed adventists okay these class were professed adventists who had fallen away and crucified themselves the son of god afresh and put him to an open shame and in the hour of temptation sunderland crisis in the hour of temptation which is here to come to show out everyone's true character they will know that they are forever lost and overwhelmed with the anguish of spirit they will bow at the saints feet whether these are professed adventists how was he watching redeemed they cannot they cannot be in the lottery the loud cry they cannot partake of the righteousness of christ god cannot trust them with his message okay they had built upon timber and sands that is very unfortunate many shall come to me saying lord lord have we not eaten with you have we not done have you not done then christ will say to them away from me i never knew you that is how serious it is even if you live catechalia the lord came down to establish their faith upon an immovable rock an

1903 sorry of april 6 1903 paragraph 35 i'm repeating write this gcb general conference bulletin of april 6 1903 paragraph 35 she says the warning has come you see it begins with a warning i don't know those who are stepping off the foundation what they're thinking whatever truth god gave us between 1798 and 1844 when we step off that foundation debates will come in adventism debates so debates that is the purpose of god you are trying to show people the warning has come nothing is to be allowed to come in nothing is to be allowed to come in that will disturb the foundation of the faith upon which we have been building ever since the message came in 1842 1843 and in 1844 i was in this message i was in this message and ever since i have been standing before the world true to the light that god has given us amen we do not propose to take our feet off the platform on which they were placed as day by day we sought the lord with earnest prayer seeking for light skriza will anasema do you think that i could give up the light that god has given me it is to be asked the rock of ages amen it is to be asked the rock of ages those the foundational truths are the rock of ages it has been guiding me ever since it was given brethren and sisters god lives and reigns and works today his hand is on the wheel and his providence he is turning the wheel in accordance to his own will because those foundational truths are the rock of ages okay kamata the rock of ages god will qualify you to give the loud cry of the third angel that is why jeremiah says to his people jeremiah stand in the crossroads and see and ask the ancient parts where is the way okay okay if you remove the platform we are doing harm it is to be as the rock of ages the rock of ages the rock of ages amen amen amen amen amen the rock of ages so when god laid that foundation and funny enough in the philadelphia experience illinois says the mighty angel who is to unite with the third angel in the work of the loud crave the third angel is to unite with the third angel for the last work then she says the advent movement of 1842-44 was a glorious manifestation of the power of god people were united brethren they were united in the truth nobody was opposing the truth that god had laid so loud has fallen into deep apostasy and blindness because they have stepped up the platform one may talk about there is no other foundation that can be laid apart from that which has already been laid that which is christ himself the last of us we are ready tonight and i pray that you will consider these things even as we

[1028.8s] great controversy 356 paragraph true
[1031.9s] the main point here is to establish that

[1036.0s] of this spiritual house adventism must
[1039.0s] be laid under the first and the second
[1041.5s] angel's messages 1840 1844 in fact

[1118.6s] the coming of christ could not take
[1120.4s] place before that time paul covers with
[1123.3s] his caution the whole of the christian
[1126.0s] dispensation down to the year 1798
[1130.9s] it is this side of that time that the
[1133.4s] message of christ's second advent who
[1135.8s] can be proclaimed
[1137.7s] no such message has ever been given in
[1139.8s] the past ages

[1734.7s] setting his right foot on the sea and

[1739.0s] shows the part which he is acting in the
[1742.2s] closing scenes of the great controversy

[1748.0s] affirms that this is jesus
[1751.1s] 1840 august 11 1840
[1754.9s] the mighty angel descends with a little
[1757.0s] book open the book of daniel

[1861.3s] while aids
[1863.5s] malachi chapter 3
[1865.9s] the philadelphian experience the bible
[1868.1s] teaches
[1869.9s] malachi chapter 3 verse 1 the bible says
[1884.0s] and the lord whom you seek shall
[1886.3s] suddenly come to his temple
[1890.7s] so before the lord comes to his
[1892.2s] telephone

[1897.6s] people to welcome the lord to come to
[1900.0s] his temple
[1903.0s] appendocrine
[1905.3s] because jesus comes to his temple
[1907.5s] literally yes
[1913.3s] and we see john the baptist being the
[1915.4s] preparer of the way
[1917.4s] for the literal coming of christ to his

[1974.7s] his temple and jesus came
[1978.2s] when jesus came to his temple
[1980.6s] he labored amongst his people
[2012.9s] they reject christ
[2014.6s] okay
[2015.7s] now that was the first time when jesus
[2017.4s] was coming to his temple that was
[2019.4s] literally yes
[2025.6s] in the book great controversy we have a
[2027.2s] whole topic called in his temple

[2080.6s] spirit and the power of elijah
[2082.9s] allahu
[2083.9s] spiritual prophecy naturally according
[2086.1s] to the great advent millerite movement
[2088.0s] you see a similarity
[2091.0s] luke chapter 1
[2092.7s] and verses number 17.
[2095.4s] the bible says in luke chapter 1 verses
[2097.6s] number 17 amen
[2100.6s] luka modiakuminasa
[2117.4s] so john shall go before christ in the

[2124.2s] coming in his temple the first time
[2126.8s] look at it the second time

[2178.2s] of the time
[2179.5s] in 1843
[2181.3s] it was his design to arouse the people
[2183.2s] and bring them to a testing point were
[2186.3s] they where they should decide for or
[2189.0s] against the truth
[2190.8s] ministers were convicted of the
[2192.5s] correctness of the positions taken on
[2194.4s] the prophetic periods
[2196.2s] and some renounced for their pride and
[2198.6s] left their salaries and their churches
[2200.6s] to go forth from place to place to give
[2202.4s] the message
[2203.6s] but as the message from heaven could
[2205.2s] find a place in the hearts but of but a
[2207.1s] few of the professed ministers of christ

[2253.5s] and the power of elijah to proclaim the
[2256.9s] message
[2257.8s] like john the forerunner of jesus those
[2261.3s] who preached this solemn message felt
[2264.0s] compelled to lay the axe at the root of
[2267.4s] the tree and call upon men to bring
[2270.4s] forth fruits

[3043.8s] consciously or unconsciously people are
[3046.6s] taking positions do we return back to
[3049.0s] our foundational truths or do we
[3051.3s] remain
[3052.4s] on the platform that has been built on
[3054.7s] timbus
[3084.1s] writings
[3088.2s] that is where trouble began
[3094.2s] early writings
[3097.3s] let me search for early writings and
[3099.0s] then to rudy katkapibilia philadelphia

[3195.4s] said my accompanying angel
[3198.0s] woe unto him that shall move a block or
[3200.4s] star pin of these messages
[3203.4s] the true understanding of these messages
[3205.4s] is of vital importance
[3207.7s] the destiny of souls hangs in the
[3209.8s] balance
[3211.0s] in the manner in which these messages
[3213.2s] are received
[3214.5s] i was again brought down through these
[3216.9s] messages and so how dearly the people of
[3219.1s] god had purchased
[3221.2s] their experience what was reported
[3223.5s] experience yeah philadelphia experience
[3227.2s] it had been obtained through much
[3229.0s] suffering and severe conflict
[3231.2s] god had led them along step by step
[3234.8s] until he had placed upon them a solid
[3238.7s] immovable
[3240.4s] platform
[3243.4s] solid immovable yeah
[3257.0s] i saw individuals approach the platform
[3259.4s] and examine the foundation
[3261.8s] some with rejoicing immediately stepped
[3263.9s] upon it
[3265.0s] others commenced to find the fold with
[3267.4s] the foundation
[3268.6s] they wished improvements made and then
[3271.3s] the platform would be more perfect
[3273.6s] and the people much happier some stepped
[3276.3s] off the platform to examine it and
[3278.8s] declared it to be laid
[3281.6s] wrong
[3292.7s] the foundation was laid wrong let's step
[3295.1s] off the platform
[3302.2s] listen
[3304.3s] and the people must appear some step of
[3306.5s] the platform to uh
[3308.1s] to examine it and declared it to be laid
[3311.3s] wrong but i saw that nearly all stood
[3313.7s] upon the farm platform and exhorted
[3316.6s] those who had stepped off to seize their
[3319.8s] complaints for god was the master
[3322.6s] builder and they were fighting against
[3324.7s] him they recounted the wonderful work of
[3327.0s] god which had led them to the farm
[3329.4s] platform and in union raised their eyes
[3332.1s] to heaven and with a loud voice
[3333.7s] glorified god
[3335.5s] an honor then on a semi i was pointed
[3338.2s] back to the proclamation of the first
[3339.8s] advent of christ
[3346.7s] john was sent in the spirit and power of
[3348.7s] elijah to prepare the way for jesus
[3351.9s] those who rejected the testimony of
[3353.6s] jesus
[3354.6s] of john were not benefited by the
[3356.4s] teachings of jesus
[3358.1s] their opposition to the message that
[3360.2s] foretold is coming place them in a worst
[3362.7s] position where they could not really
[3364.8s] receive the strongest deletion
[3367.7s] so anatomy the immovable platform
[3371.4s] the bt
[3372.6s] 1840 to 1844 mungo america
[3382.4s] are debating our foundational truths
[3384.8s] just know something in your mind
[3387.1s] that platform is immovable it has been
[3390.6s] laid upon a solid foundation nada white
[3394.2s] and ander cosima
[3396.1s] the foundation of advertising adventism
[3398.2s] consists of truths
[3400.6s] okay
[3415.1s] concerning the truth

[3424.5s] consoles and writers consoles to writers

[3430.4s] paragraph one
[3434.0s] let the truths that are the foundation
[3437.7s] of our faith be kept before the people
[3441.0s] let the truths
[3442.6s] that are the foundation of our faith be
[3446.3s] kept before the people how could semia
[3448.6s] comba let
[3450.6s] theologians or some people go and
[3453.2s] examine the foundation and replace them
[3455.6s] and bring them before the people no no
[3457.4s] no no no no no no no no
[3462.2s] worldwide adventism there are so many
[3464.2s] people professing to be seventh-day
[3465.5s] adventism but when you begin to examine
[3467.8s] their foundation it is built upon sand
[3471.0s] it is built upon
[3472.7s] timbus they have left the platform of
[3475.7s] eternal truth 1798 to 1844 46 years
[3489.0s] letter the first angel's message the
[3490.4s] second annual message the third angel's
[3492.0s] message
[3494.8s] is
[3501.3s] john chapter 2 verse 19. i am not going
[3503.6s] to touch the 46 years but i'm going to
[3505.8s] rebuild it in three days
[3508.2s] three days 46 years the 46 years are
[3510.8s] there 1798 to 1844 but the three days
[3514.4s] now god brings the first angel's message
[3516.6s] the first day the second angel's message
[3518.8s] 1842 the second day then the third
[3521.0s] angel's message october 22 1844 the
[3524.2s] house
[3525.7s] begins to be built the foundations are
[3528.0s] laid and they are upon a solid
[3531.7s] platform
[3535.7s] let the truths that are the foundation
[3538.3s] of our faith be kept before the people
[3541.6s] some will depart from the faith giving
[3544.6s] heed to seducing spirits and doctrines
[3546.7s] of devils hajja say massam will depart
[3548.9s] from the church
[3555.4s] you can't be in the church but not in
[3558.0s] the faith of the first second and third
[3560.3s] angel you are not in the foundation and
[3563.0s] this is a difference
[3564.9s] that most adventists have never even
[3567.1s] realized in pakistan
[3573.2s] you see
[3574.5s] you can't be in the church but outside
[3577.0s] the faith
[3578.3s] that's why paul says in second
[3579.8s] corinthians thirteen verse one even
[3581.4s] appalling
[3584.0s] ana sema
[3590.6s] ii corinthians chapter 13.
[3593.8s] the bible says
[3595.3s] verses number five
[3597.4s] second corinthians 13 verse 5.
[3600.7s] the bible says
[3608.3s] yeah
[3610.6s] test yourselves whether you be in the
[3612.6s] faith not you've been the church you
[3614.3s] can't be in the church but not in the
[3615.7s] faith
[3618.2s] that faith
[3621.0s] that lays the foundations
[3623.8s] okay
[3625.0s] she says in cw 29.1 some will depart
[3628.6s] from the faith giving heed to say this
[3631.0s] in spirits and doctrines of devils
[3634.2s] they talk science and the enemy comes in
[3636.4s] and gives them an abundance of science
[3639.3s] but it is not the science of salvation
[3641.6s] it is not the science of humility of
[3643.9s] concentration or of the sanctification
[3646.6s] of the spirit
[3647.9s] we are now to understand what the
[3650.4s] pillars of our faith are
[3652.8s] the truth that have made us as a people
[3656.9s] what we are leading us on step
[3660.9s] by step amen
[3663.0s] amentopia review and herald of may 25
[3666.5s] 1905.
[3668.2s] that point is clear and that is why
[3671.3s] unapologetic
[3673.2s] let's go back to the bible
[3675.0s] when the children of israel came out of
[3677.0s] babylon
[3678.6s] and they went to rebuild the foundation
[3681.0s] okay
[3683.7s] there's something that happened
[3686.0s] very funny
[3687.3s] you see when you begin to lay another
[3688.7s] foundation it cannot be
[3691.7s] powerful or perfect as the first
[3694.1s] foundation that god laid i wish i can
[3705.4s] let's go to the book of hagai
[3709.4s] hagai
[3721.8s] they cry why do they cry kuan nino
[3724.8s] analia the reason is
[3728.1s] they they look at these foundations
[3729.8s] which are being led laid
[3731.8s] out
[3744.1s] and now let's go to haggai chapter
[3747.4s] hey
[3749.2s] chapter
[3751.6s] chapter chapter one
[3761.5s] the bible teaches in hege
[3764.4s] or hagai
[3766.0s] depending on how
[3767.6s] you'll pronounce it
[3775.7s] the bible says
[3780.2s] hagai chapter 2
[3785.0s] we are in the book of hagai chapter 2
[3788.4s] the bible says
[3826.3s] who amongst you saw the former house in
[3829.8s] its initial glory
[3831.7s] 1842 1844 and how do you see it now 2021
[3836.5s] munao
[3838.6s] who can compare adventism 1840 to 1844
[3841.9s] and now
[3843.0s] from 1888 to 2021 these are two
[3846.4s] different periods
[3848.1s] why
[3849.1s] because the foundation that was laid
[3850.8s] 1840 1844 at the foundation that was
[3854.2s] laid again during the time of
[3856.2s] reorganization
[3857.9s] are two different things
[3863.8s] now okay so my statement
[3920.2s] just one more time
[3938.3s] [Music]
[3949.0s] haggai is prophesying how god is going
[3951.2s] to shake the entire act so that the
[3953.3s] desire of nation jesus comes back to his
[3955.4s] temple
[3957.1s] the third time
[3958.7s] revelation 18 and that is the topic of
[3961.3s] tomorrow
[3962.6s] you see even if the house is inferior
[3965.1s] god still knows
[3970.2s] he must shake the heavens and the earth
[3972.6s] and the desire of nations
[3975.9s] christians
[3998.3s] the purpose of the fourth angel the
[4000.2s] purpose of the desire of nations to come
