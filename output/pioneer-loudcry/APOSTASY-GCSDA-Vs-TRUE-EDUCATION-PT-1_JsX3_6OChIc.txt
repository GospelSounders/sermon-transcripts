raised and this sabbath things are going to be on a behind us just behind you there is a toilet you can see it is under construction and we are going to continue the construction after few understandings they're seeing some few paperworks and all these Landers you're seeing the donor gave it someone gave it up so that we may build at her own supervision she want to see the work go forward she want to see that this land is to be made use of to give God glory god is going to come down and give and and Crown duties and Crown our efforts that we commit unto him all this land has been given behind the toilet as you see there is a land go there is a line of demarcation down to defend and there is another line behind the toilet up just up there is an arboretum as you see that is our Sanctuary up up four to the fast forward to the fence on top we are going to ask them that are of good ability come in and come in and build that which the Lord is saying that we should call people out of institution popular schools as well as we are calling them from churches that are falling let us see is that a quote Oh the second quote tells us as the time comes to call people from Fallen churches there are no names if you want General Conference we are going to prove that general conference is amongst those churches right now we have we don't want crutch no one is we want to establish that the truth right now taking place is to call people from foreign churches and to call people from Fallen popular schools adapting purple Supremacy principles principles that are in concluding to children in order to obey the mark of the beast and the image of the Beast listen I'm going to read from I'm going to read from this book called pamphlet again once more I already eat in the past uh in the past in the Past clip video clip I'm going to read from the book called pamphlets listen carefully the work of true education it's not like you're seeing it in the present true uh present schools that are popular there is look at those syllabus while you are in Kenya in Kenya I'm sad to say this that people who are in Kenya there is a syllabus called cre look at behind look behind Beyond of the textbook down there it is just it has been published it has been printed by Catholics what is what has Catholic to do with the Protestant School what has Catholic Education to do with a Christian Catholic we know it's plainly paganism the worship statue who has names pretentiously he then statues you can't pretend it's time we have to speak up look at this book this book is called pamphlets and uh it's a bit far it's just a bit far out from my reach uh yeah it is the book called pamphlets volume it's called p h 0 8 1. volume 81 let me call it like that pamphlet volume 81. page uh we're going to read from page uh page 37 let us read page yes page 38.1 I'm going to read I'm going to read again the first quotation told us that true education is to be established in the future and there is a work to be done in connection to it that has not been done in the past all right so our ow those people want the truth all right those people want the truth will be added with angels in order to accomplish God's God's Duty on behalf of those children or those parents who want to come out from Babylon churches and Babylon schools all right let's see pamphlets h081 38.1 it says this the command found in Revelation 18.18 verse 4 quote come out of how my people means to come out of those institutions which will place in the minds of our young people principles which are apt to make them join the class of worshipers of which we read in second Timothy 3 5. quit having a form of godliness but denying the power thereof they call themselves Christians but they are weaked wheat you are taking the customs of the world and placing them in the church and having sympathy with them those are two people in the general conference SDA all right they are sympathizing with the world Revelation I mean Romans chapter 12 verse 2 says be a transformed change from the ugliness worldly behaviors and be confirmed be it transformed by the grace of God from the ugliness and be be not conformed do not conform do not do not wear as cats as a man don't teach them to wear trouser there should be a distinction all right all right I'm sorry to say that you're doing it so you are doing great General Conference you are doing that I'm sorry because you're doing it all right you have no Heaven no no place in heaven you are not putting any distinction between true worshipers and false worshipers let's see it is saying we should be just as desires of getting our children out of the popular schools out of the popular school as we are to call the older people out of the popular churches as we are calling the older people from the popular churches we should desire to call to take our children out of popular schools I was reading we are going to put this picture I'm going to put all those pictures in that section comment section you're going to see by own two eyes just what I mean schools in Kenya they are preaching and teaching baptism by water on top of a small baby infant baptism on a small bucket with the reason and Water by there I was baptizing Catholic in 1992. I was just smaller as a baby I'm so sad by these things general conference is just making alliance with those people who have who made us suffer spiritually I don't know why I don't know how it can take place but listen mystery of iniquities taking place in the schools there is something to that is to be done by we who are walking in the vineyard what is the vineyard where the vine is growing some people think the vineyard is the church no the finance is the world where that Believers will gather that is where we call vinyl we are going to study a lot of things Peter prophecy one two three quotations speaking of the same thing Christ is saying the world is the field all right let's see this now we are not in that subject the subject is true education at what point in time to education at what point in time we are seeing that the popular churches are only a product of worldly education so to get at the root of the matter we must separate ourselves from that which creates the condition it creates the condition schools create the condition of Babylon Fallen schools create the condition of Babylon of hidden the hidden School make the hidden Church the Christian School make the Christian Church through education makes the true church principles that are true we have them in the true church when you interpret the Bible correctly in the school you will admin you will fully preach it correctly in the church so listen listen up let's see the background history of schools welcome to the next part I want to have a short video short short video you watch and live on do your duty welcome you know a short video thank you so much

[299.2s] preach to those who are dwelling upon
[300.6s] the Earth those who have cultures those

[581.9s] past so in the future there is a work
[585.3s] that is to be done in connection to the
[587.6s] true education that had begun so those
[590.8s] people know how to wait to wait unto the
[593.9s] Lord they have to know the time
[597.5s] 2001 was the time we're going to
[600.4s] establish that just give us time now we

[621.1s] people have to be taught how to live
[623.2s] how to depend on themselves how to be
[626.0s] morally upright how to be spiritually
[628.5s] strength stronger how to be physically
[632.0s] fit how to be knowledgeable in all
[636.1s] things
[637.0s] reason

[642.8s] will unite to employ a humble
[646.0s] God-fearing teacher to give the parents
[649.3s] the help that is needed in educating

[662.6s] see anything there that
[667.4s] schools shall be established in the
[670.0s] future
[671.3s] all right when the first Angels come
[673.1s] down there is a class of work to be done
[676.0s] in connection with them there is a class
[679.4s] of work in connection to be done in
[682.7s] connection with them that has not been
[685.5s] done in the past
[687.5s] in 1840 1844 1888 or 1870 or 1900 it has
[694.4s] not been done but it shall be done in
[696.5s] the future

[1078.9s] verse 4 quote come out of how my people
[1084.1s] means to come out of those institutions
[1089.1s] which will place in the minds of our
[1091.8s] young people
[1093.5s] principles which are apt to make them
[1097.3s] join the class of worshipers of which we
[1100.2s] read in
[1101.2s] second Timothy 3 5. quit having a form
[1105.1s] of godliness but denying the power
[1107.6s] thereof they call themselves Christians
[1109.8s] but they are weaked wheat you are taking
[1112.5s] the customs of the world and placing
[1114.4s] them in the church and having sympathy
[1115.9s] with them those are two people in the
[1118.4s] general conference SDA
[1121.0s] all right they are sympathizing with the
[1124.2s] world Revelation I mean Romans chapter
[1126.6s] 12 verse 2 says be a transformed change
[1131.2s] from the ugliness worldly behaviors and
[1135.5s] be confirmed

[1169.2s] distinction between true worshipers and
[1173.2s] false worshipers let's see
[1176.5s] it is saying we should be just as
[1178.9s] desires of getting our children out of
[1181.9s] the popular schools out of the popular
[1185.2s] school as we are to call the older
[1189.7s] people out of the popular churches as we
[1192.9s] are calling the older people from the
[1194.7s] popular churches we should desire to
[1196.6s] call to take our children out of popular
[1199.2s] schools I was reading we are going to
[1202.0s] put this picture I'm going to put all
[1203.8s] those pictures in that section comment
[1206.7s] section you're going to see by own two
[1208.9s] eyes just what I mean
[1211.6s] schools in Kenya they are preaching and
[1214.3s] teaching baptism by water on top of a
[1218.3s] small baby infant baptism on a small
[1222.3s] bucket with the reason and Water by
[1225.1s] there I was baptizing Catholic in 1992.

[1232.6s] conference is just making alliance with
[1236.1s] those people who have who made us suffer
[1239.4s] spiritually I don't know why I don't
[1242.1s] know how it can take place but listen
[1245.0s] mystery of iniquities taking place in
[1247.3s] the schools there is something to that
[1249.3s] is to be done by we who are walking in
[1253.0s] the vineyard what is the vineyard where
[1255.2s] the vine is growing some people think
[1256.9s] the vineyard is the church no the
[1259.1s] finance is the world where that
[1261.7s] Believers will gather that is where we
[1263.8s] call vinyl we are going to study a lot
[1265.6s] of things Peter prophecy one two three
[1268.3s] quotations speaking of the same thing
[1270.1s] Christ is saying the world is the field

[1278.1s] is true education at what point
[1281.1s] in time to education at what point in
[1285.2s] time we are seeing
[1287.2s] that the popular churches are only a
[1290.2s] product of worldly education so to get
[1292.9s] at the root of the matter we must
[1295.5s] separate ourselves from that which
[1297.1s] creates the condition it creates the
[1299.5s] condition schools create the condition
[1302.2s] of Babylon Fallen schools create the
[1304.9s] condition of Babylon of hidden the
[1309.1s] hidden School make the hidden Church the
[1312.3s] Christian School make the Christian
[1315.5s] Church through education makes the true
[1318.9s] church principles that are true we have
[1322.2s] them in the true church when you
[1324.9s] interpret the Bible correctly in the
[1327.7s] school you will admin you will fully
[1330.6s] preach it correctly in the church so
