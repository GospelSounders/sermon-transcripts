[252.1s] tomorrow we will get our final product
[256.6s] okay thank
[258.4s] you hi everyone welcome back to our
[263.8s] simple avocado oil
[266.5s] extraction this is our day three you can
[270.1s] see the outcome of what you were drying
[274.0s] all the moisture is gone now we left
[276.4s] with just some
[278.2s] black substance of
[281.7s] avocado let's see our next step is will
[284.7s] not be now to squeeze off the oil from
[289.7s] this product that we have here I'm not
[292.3s] so sure of it yet cuz it's a it's our
[294.6s] first trial but I'm sure the consequent
[303.2s] consequent uh ones should be a bit
[307.4s] sucessful so we're going to use a cheese
[309.4s] cloth or a sheer
[312.2s] cloth and um somewhere where we can
[315.4s] extract the oil into a dish or something
[321.6s] then you scoop
[323.0s] our avocados little by little
[327.0s] [Music]
[332.0s] yes we hopeful to get as much oil as
[336.3s] possible from our
[337.8s] little
[339.6s] trial
[341.7s] experiment let's see if oil is going to
[344.0s] come out of this clothes or the PES are
[347.1s] too big we'll see let's
[349.4s] see yeah there you go see our oil is
[352.9s] coming out
[354.0s] nicely see our oil is coming out nicely
[357.8s] able to see the oil is coming out
[360.8s] so
[362.6s] nice
[363.8s] [Music]
[365.1s] green
[367.8s] oil
[379.2s] wow
[381.2s] M Can See Clearly the oil
[401.7s] yeah I think there's more and more and
[404.2s] more can see our
[406.8s] oil just come out nicely still love more
[410.4s] to squeeze but I think
[412.7s] this not not yet exhausted to exhaust it
[417.4s] more that you can have Max maimum amount
[421.1s] of oil coming out of
[423.8s] it and yeah that is my hand is so
[431.0s] oily let's put the
[435.6s] next this I think has has more can can
[439.2s] be squeezed further what do you think my
[442.1s] co-
[444.6s] producer can it be squeezed farther no
[447.8s] it can yes it can be squeezed f father
[450.7s] these are these are from three medium
[454.0s] avocados that
[456.1s] we prepared for this purpose think if
[460.7s] you have more and more avocado we have
[462.4s] more
[464.0s] oil the more
[466.0s] avocado the more oil you
[470.6s] get wow

[555.4s] more results yes I hope everyone can try
[558.8s] this at home when the avoc season is is
[561.4s] is there people can make use of that
[563.2s] season and make oil enough even for to
[566.0s] go for a year yes even the the the
