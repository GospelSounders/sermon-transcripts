work is being carried forward in these last days because there are very many notions among us god's people watu among konami zamot of aouti kusiyanankazi yamungo kippendi misho as we continue to tackle this series what does it symbolize we have seen already that the birding is caused by the latter rain and the latter rain must only begin in the closing scenes of this earth's history india in this third part we are going to look at the second coming of christ in the history we are not talking of the second appearing of jesus in the clouds of heaven that glorious appearance is uh or rain is the manifestation of christ and his righteousness to his own people and uh the book of malacca malachi to ambition john the baptist is the messenger that prepares the way for the manifestation of christ to his people yes yes it is because of the burden the burden is the revelation of jesus nick chapter 27 verses number six isaiah chapter 27 verses number six museum the birding king james version i saw 27 versus number six the prophetic parallels of the bible you can never understand what kind of work is taking place right now in this art history what's it called isaiah 27 6 the bible says he shall cause them that come of jacob to take root israel shall blossom and bird and fill the face of the whole world with the fruit israeli itachi the horn of salvation samsung 32-17 allah psalms 132 verses number 17 psalms 132 verses number 17. there will i make the horn of david too bad i have ordained a lamp for my mind anointed is the messenger that is to prepare the way for the burden in israel yes amen we have that wonderful topic that is called in his temple when jesus arrived physically for the very first time for the very first time to bring light now the purpose of jesus coming to israel was to put down errors the rubbish of errors that have been heaping for generations and to replace back the truth in the framework of truth singing but what happened the leaders in israel could not tolerate the light and we are told in the pain of inspiration dessert of ages page 200 and 32 desire of ages page 200 and 332 and i say maybe listen carefully this is history that repeats in every succeeding generations whenever jesus will be revealed again yes because right now we are going to the military to see when the birding began again wakati machipu the same history was being repeated she says if the leaders in his israel had received christ he would have honored them as his messengers to carry the gospel to the world to them first was given the opportunity to become heralds of the kingdom of grace of god but israel knew not the time of her visitation the jealousy and distrust of the jewish leaders had opened it ripened had ripened into open hatred at the hearts of the people were turned away from jesus the sun henry yong goziwadini kosovo they had rejected christ's message and was bent upon his death therefore shikaya points to india we are taught therefore jesus departed from jerusalem jesus the presence of jesus was no longer in jerusalem he departed from jerusalem number one number two from the priests young ghost wadding number three from the temple hekalo number four the religious leaders the people who had been instructed in the law and turned to another class to proclaim his message and to gather out those who should carry the gospel to all nations luke chapter 6 verse 12. they have rejected the foundation of the jewish economy jesus was the foundation jesus came to bring back the truth to those who would have accepted them like anyway pinga luke chapter six versus number twelve lucas emma lucas coomba aka kesha we have the title of the of a wonderful topic that is called the ordained twelfth jesus began to obtain the twelve to establish his church what we had the religious leaders the temple services and jesus began to ordain a ministry to carry for the work those who would accept his message remember those who accepted the message of john the baptist accepted christ those who accepted the second message with christ as the light and life of man was rejected by the ecclesiastical authorities in the day in the days of christ so it has been rejected in every succeeding generation again and again the history of christ withdrawal from judea has been repeated they had no thought of separating themselves from the established but the religious leaders would not tolerate the light and those who had the light were forced to seek another class who were longing for the truth in our day few of the professed followers of the reformers are actuated by the spirit in a minute the bible says history must repeat and the pain of inspiration says that history of jesus withdrawing from judea will be repeated to the close of time now let's go to the second history to megalith of israel we will be revisiting that history as we move forward now let's go back to malachi chapter three to angola yes by the way malachi says the lord whom you suddenly seek shall come to his temple the first temple was in jerusalem now we are looking at the second temple before we look at the second temple maybe let's look at the book of joel chapter 2 verse 23 it will form the basis of understanding how many times rain has fallen in the uh in this earth history before jesus returns back for his people joel chapter 2 verse 23 joel chapter 2 joel chapter 2 and rejoice in the lord your god for he had given you the former reign moderately at me only and he will cause to calm down for you the rain involved the rain the rain the the former rain the rain of the latter the former rain the rain and the la terrain is three let us repeat the book of malachi we want to establish the three reigns in the history the first one begins at pentecost the last one is in our time period in the time period of revelation 18 the loud cry of the third angel where we repeat again the bible says behold i will send my messenger and he shall prepare the way before me jesus speaking and the lord whom you will and the lord whom you seek shall suddenly come to his temple even the messenger of the covenant whom you delight in behold he shall come save the lord of hosts but who may abide in the day of his coming and you shall stand when he appear it for he is like the refiners fire and like the fuller soap and they shall sit as a refiner and a purifier of silver and he shall purify the sons of levi and purge them as gold silver that they may offer unto the lord an offering in righteousness jesus will begin to separate two classes of worshippers depending on those who have accepted the whole truth their foundational truths or those who have rejected two classes of worshippers now when does this happen then a second time we go to the history of the philadelphian church revelation chapter 10 the second time that jesus appears to his people yes philadelphia is the great advent millerite movement and i want to show you from the pane of inspiration great controversy you read first the book of great controversy she says great controversy great controversy great controversy she says she she she merges three histories and a letter is to riha tatu zawat to a she says great controversy 6 11. great under the topic the final warning abusive villain if you cannot understand the prophetic parallels you will never understand god's work in the last days that is why there's a lot of trouble in adventism today or people have failed to understand the prophetic parallels of the bible and the spirit of prophecy look at this listen very carefully she says great controversy 6 11. the angel who unites in the proclamation of the third angel's message is to lighten the art with his glory future revelation 18 revelation 18 the final outpouring of the holy spirit in the lottery she begins with that final movement a work of worldwide extent and unwanted power is here for told also listen to where she goes next secure my liana power and elia go to formula and i say maybe the advent movement of 1840 to 1844 was a glorious manifestation of the power of god the first angel's message was carried to every missionary station in the world and in some countries there were the greatest religious interests which has been witnessed in any land since the reformation of the 16th century but these are to be far exceeded by the mighty movement by the mighty movement under the last warning of the third angel there is to be a mighty movement and at the last warning amazon at the mighty movement revelation 18 and rudy 18 40 to 1844. there was also a glorious manifestation of the power of god the holy spirit was powered the ring now she goes back now the work will be similar to that of the day of pentecost full stop case closed revelation 18 1842 1844 pentecost joel chapter 2 verse 23 the lord has given us for moraine pentecost the reign 1840-1844 the latter rain revelation chapter 18 three histories joel chapter 2 verse 23 now we had finished or we that we had accomplished to show how there was a separation of classes when jesus manifested himself fast in the jewish time period to memories that led to pentecost now we are moving on to the second history the reign revelation chapter 10 verse 1. as we continue to tackle this subject the budding of aaron's road and the remnant part three we go to the second history tonight revelation chapter 10 verses number one eighteen forty to eighteen forty four revelation chapter ten tonight revelation eight uh ten eighteen forty twenty two vote forty four in a foreign revelation chapter 18 will be the same relationship to 10 verses number one economical the bible says the angel descends from heaven a rainbow is above his head and his face shineth as the as the sun the bible says and in his hand he had a little book open and when he had cried the seven thunders uttered their voices now who is this angel uh and the bible says the bible is specific in asema there is a rainbow and the sun the rainbow and the sun what else that does does not miss there was rain in this time period the angel's face is like the sun matthew chapter 17 verses number one matthew chapter 17 verses number one matthew chapter 17 verses number one the bible says in matthew 17 15 as the sun that is jesus the bible says in revelation chapter 10 that he had a a rainbow over his head that is jesus jesus was sin and his feet as the pillars of fire let us go to revelation chapter 1 verse 12 revelation chapter 1 verse 12 just to show that this is jesus jesus himself descended not physically of course it was the power of god and this is another instant that we see the holy spirit manifestation it is jesus himself the holy spirit is not a third god called god the holy spirit it is the manifestation of christ jesus himself to his people and we are going to show this again for those who believe that there is there is another god yes that is deception of the highest order i'm going to show again the bible says in revelation chapter 1 verses number 12 revelation chapter 1 verses number 12 revelation 1 verse 12 to see the voice that speak with me john says when john saw jesus his feet were asked the burning furnace that is revelation chapter 10 the angel that descended his feet were as pillars of fire that furnace that burnt that was jesus himself and spiritual prophecy also shows that it was christ it was the manifestation of jesus great controversy 6 11 says the advent movement of 1840 to 1844 was a glorious manifestation of the power of god so jesus descending is the power of god the power of god is the holy ghost luke chapter 1 verses number 35. it is the power of god and it is jesus manifesting himself therein when the angel came to to to to mary wakati malayaca it shall be called the son of god so jesus came down the spirit of prophecy also confirms bible commentary volume 7. bible commentary uh we can also read last day events uh commenting on revelation chapter 10 verses 5. bible commentary volume 7 7 bc you can read pages 972 paragraph 1 she says the mighty angel who instructed john was no less a personage than jesus christ setting his right foot on the sea and his left foot upon the dry line it shows the part which he is acting in the closing scenes of the great controversy with satan this position denotes his supreme power and authority over the old earth so it was jesus who descended okay yes in that movement having that little book of daniel abaya kofunua now revelation chapter 10 is very interesting listen very carefully remember malachi chapter 3 says before the messenger of the covenant is revealed there is always a messenger that is to prepare the people listen grace controversy let us see great controversy again very carefully in that history what happened uh we can read these from spiritual gifts vol 1 page 233 when that angel descended and william miller began to preach the first angels message wakati william miller alianza copianos because he was the messenger of the messenger that was prepared the people mila took the position of john the baptist listen very carefully schizophrenia is about she says i saw that god was in the proclamation of the time in 1843 it was designed it was his design to arouse the people and bring them to a testing point where they should decide for or against the truth listen very carefully in the time of jesus wakati movement people had to decide for or against the truth two classes of worshippers look at the times of miller himself god had designed that that movement be raised when jesus descended august 11 1840 wakati there was rain listen very carefully listen very carefully listen very carefully i wanted to listen very carefully what happened she continued saying ministers laid aside their secretarian sectarian views and feelings and united in proclaiming the coming of jesus wherever the message was given it moved the people sinners repented wept and prayed for forgiveness and those who survived lives had been marked with dishonesty were anxious to make restitutions parents felt the deepest solicitude for their children those who received the message labored with their unconverted for their unconverted friends and relatives and with their souls bowed with the weight of the solemn message warned and entreated them to prepare for the coming of the son of man those cases were most hardened that would not yield to such a weight of evidence set home by heartfelt warnings anasema one led to embrace the truth preached by miller william and servants of god who are raised up in the spirit and power of elijah to proclaim the message like john the forerunner of jesus those who preached this holy message felt compelled to lay the axe at the root of the tree and call upon men to bring forth fruits meat for repentance [Music] movement i'm buying it with the great advent nailerite movement full stop able to anglia kamakuna two classes of worshippers and they embraced the truth that miller and his associates were proclaiming in the time period of 1840 to 1844. abu tahangali what led to the movement of 1840-1844 look at this uh great controversy great controversy uh great controversy page 335 controversy page 335 she says in the year 1840 another remarkable fulfillment of prophecy excited a widespread interest two years before miya kamivili kabbalah josiah leach one of the leading ministers preaching the second advent published an exposition of revelation chapter nine predicting the fall of the ottoman empire and specifying not only the year but the very day on which this would take place according to his exposition management accounting the ottoman empire italian goku according to his exposition which was purely a matter of calculation and on the prophetic periods of scripture the turkish government would surrender its independence on the eleventh day of august 1840. chica your point 11 of august 1840 the prediction was widely published and thousands watched the course of events with eager interest at the very time specified turkey through her ambassadors accepted the protection of the allied powers of europe and thus placed herself under the control of christian nations uni great controversy tonight the event exactly fulfilled the prediction when it became known multitudes were convinced of the correctness of the prophetic principles in term of interpretation adopted by miller and his associates and a wonderful power a wonderful impetus was given to the advent movement men of learning and position united with miller both in preaching and publishing his views and from 1840 to 1844 the work rapidly extended william miller possessed a strong mental power governing eighteen forty to eighteen forty four able to anglican yesterday there was a separation of classes of when jesus left the temple the synagogue the priests the people he began a ministry a movement a movement that was to be free of errors a movement that was to be free from human dogmas to to prepare the people for the ali rain pentecost look at what happened during the times of of william was it a history repeat yes it says great controversy page 375 paragraph one grace controversy we are reading the book great controversy uh let me begin by great controversy three eight point one she says listen carefully she says great controversy 379 and 380 paragraph number three 379.3 great controversy search for the blessed results experienced by those who accepted the advent message they came from different denominations and their denominational barriers were held instead of following the truth people will be clinging to their denomination and their denominational dogmas while the voice is crying into the wilderness a voice will be crying into the wild from the wilderness to prepare way for the second coming of christ people will be leaving their denominations to join the remnant to stand in the platform of eternal truth we'll come to part 4 and 5 of the same message listen very carefully they came from different denominations and the denominational barriers were held to the ground conflicting creeds were shivered to atoms creed the unscriptural hope of the temporal millennium was abandoned false views of the second advents were corrected pride conformity to the world was swept away wrongs were made right hearts were united in swedish fellowship and love and joy reigned supreme in this doctrine did this if this doctrine did this for the few who did receive it it would have done the same for all if if all had received it but the churches generally did not accept the warning mechanism unto the house of israel should have been the first to decide to discern the tokens of jesus's coming had failed to learn the truth either from the testimony of the prophets or from the signs of the times ativiangosiwadini they had failed to learn the truth either from the testimony of the prophets or from the signs of the times as worldly hopes and ambitions filled the hearts love for god and faith in his word had grown cold and when the advent doctrines was was presented it only arouse their prejudice and unbelief because god was bringing back the foundational truths god was bringing additional light mongolian letters the fact that the message was to a great extent preached by laymen was argued as an instrument against it preachers see your theologians go preachers in every part of god's history god's work lay men are always the people that have been chosen of god to carry the message they are not proud when the message comes they will accept it they have no certificates to show that they have studied were the ones that were used by god to proclaim the message in the times of miller and layman they had accepted the message the times of jesus it was the same it was the same jesus told the pharisees that i tell you uh let me read matthew chapter 8 matthew 8. matthew chapter number eight let me see the bible says uh what says number matthew chapter 8 verses number 11. she says speaking of the centurion of bible says i say unto you that many shall come from the east and the west and shall sit down with abraham and isaac and jacob in the kingdom of heaven but the children of the kingdom shall be cast out into the outer darkness there shall be weeping and gnashing of truth at one hour to point a wakati what wenge why she says the bible says uh because they have they had accepted the truth readily let me read in uh matthew yes yes chapter 11 from verse 16 but i but where and too shall i liken this generation nitapan anisha kizaziki nanini it is like unto children sitting in the marketplace and calling unto their fellows and saying we have piped unto you and you have not danced we have moaned unto you and you have not lamented verse 18. for john came neither eating and drinking and they say he had the devil i only wanted me the son of man came neither eating nor drinking they came eating and drinking and they said behold a man glut on us and one bible and a friend of publicans and sinners but wisdom is justified in our children she says ah verse 25 and at that time jesus answered and said i thank thee o father lord of heaven and earth because thou has heed these things from the wise and the prudent and has revealed them unto babes on a masters in theology nikon a doctorate in philosophy in in in in religion because of their their their wisdom they want to embarrass the fact that this message was to a greater extent preached by laymen was an argument against it you'll see jimbo queen and so it will be today in the times of miller when that angel descended when there was rain the first angels message again there was a separation of worshippers those who took the message the bible says revelation chapter 10 verse 10. shall that message was sweet god was gathering a people to give the message in the last days and now to napoleon de leon that is the history that must repeat illinois says again and again the history of christ withdrawal from judea has been repeated when the reformers we must understand that history very well so that we may be able to stand on the platform of truth on the platform of eternal truth we have established that there was rain in the time of the milarites in the time of the milorites we have established to me the angel the messenger of the covenant was christ himself descended william miller took the position of john the baptist again and now as we progress i want to show that the different denominations did not accept the message of miller the different denominations we are reading tuna summer uh kitab we need to uh uh live sketches this is live sketches of james white and ellen g white live sketches of ellen white ls page 27 the advent course in portland maine in june of 1842 mr miller gave his second course of lectures at the casco street church in portland i felt it a great privilege this is ellen white to attend these lectures because people who are coming out of the various denominations we're going to finish our creeds we're going to talk about water william put these things in mind even as we move with history because the same history is going to repeat again she says for i had fallen under discouragement i did not prepare to meet my savior this second course created much more excitement in the city than the first with few exceptions the different denominations closed the doors of their churches against miller did not do that mila went to seek for another class who would obey the truth and he established places of worship what like in the times of jesus she says in desire of ages 232 paragraph 1 that when jesus left the temple the religious leaders a people in whom was given the message he went to another class those who rejoiced in the truth yes self-supporting ministries independent churches on assembly offices they don't even they they don't even understand the definition of a church people think that their denominations made that is a fatal deception even the jewish nation the jewish leaders by the way jesus left the structures jesus left the priest jesus left the temple and jesus went to another class how do you define the church is the church the structure is the church the denominational priests no the church cannot be those who have rejected the truth the church is always and will always be those who advance in the light and those who remain in their foundational truths those who follow the light where it is that is always the church that is the church manuscript releases volume 17. listen to this nissan general conference okay general conferences are posterized and small the church is not babylon which church which church is not babylon is it the general conference that is uniting with the prophecy that is that has formed a new organization do you still call that the church or what is your definition of a church what is your definition of a church because the church cannot fall the the church will remain there are tears and wheat in the near compare tears and wheat has has to do with apostasy tears and weeds has to do with sins not up not open apostasy open up posters apostasy has nothing to do with the tears and wheat being in the church tears and wheat have nothing to do with tears and wheat have nothing to do with open apostasy tears and wheat only tears and wheat have nothing to do with open apostasy tears and wheat have to do with scenes character nashanga watch on a quote spiritual prophecy i am afraid there are tears and wheat in the church which church what is the definition of a church is the church that group of people in open apostasy from their truth or is the church the group of individuals who have accepted to follow on the lord and to remain in their foundational truths amidst them they are wheat and tears 17 mr these are the things we are going to put in record straight as we continue with this presentation it is no that is not true 17 mr 81.4 she says god has a church in the last days god has a church it is not the great cathedral neither is it the various denominations canis it is the people who love god and keep his commandments where two or three are gathered together in my name there i am in the midst of them where christ is even among us the humble few this is christ's church for the presence of the high and the lofty one alone that inhabited eternity can alone constitute a chat you can see me quest why do you even have as we move forward to look at the last history in our time period we are going to look carefully because aaron's road is too bad in the time period when jesus is still in the most holy place by the way listen very carefully as we bring this rock to a close revelation chapter 10 and revelation chapter 18 is the same angel by the way revelation chapter 10 and revelation chapter 18 is the same angel revelation chapter 10 and revelation chapter 18 they are both mighty angels revelation chapter 10 the mighty angel revelation chapter 18 the mighty angel revelation chapter 10 the revelation chapter 18 that mighty angel cries with a loud voice it is the manifestation of christ himself now as we come to our time period look at this something that adventists many adventists have never realized that when the latter end begins in our time period we go back to malachi chapter 3 that the messenger of the covenant must prepare people to to for the revelation of jesus to come suddenly to his temple maybe as we introduce revelation chapter 18 we have seen that the very first attempt when god attempted to bring revelation chapter 18 the latter in loud cry was in 1888 that is the final time their final attempt their final work of god revelation 18 when that work begins two classes of worshippers again there are those who will establish themselves in the in their foundational truths they are those who are going to reject they are those who are going to stick to their denominations they are those who are going to follow christ the voice that will be crying the wilderness there are those who are going to be establishing god's people in the foundational truths there are those who are going to reject their truths two classes of worshipers you must understand where you belong when that work begins officially by the way israel is let us go to jeremiah chapter 3 and see how this happened jeremiah number fifteen when aaron's road budded god declared plainly the kind of leaders that he had chosen himself jeremiah chapter three verses number thirteen jeremiah chapter 3 jeremiah chapter 3 verses number 13 jeremiah 3 verses number 13 jeremiah chapter 3 verses number 10 the bible says so and repent and accept that thou has apostasized children that have apostasized this is a plea that god is saying that is the first message that god gives his children those who have apostasized from the truth that is was what israel had done returning return eo backsliding children listen very carefully to um let me read in english jeremiah chapter 3 verse 15 this is prophetic jeremiah 3 verse 15 jeremiah chapter 3 verse 15 says verse 14 turn over sliding children say the lord for i am married unto you and i will take you one of a city and two of a family and i will bring you unto zion verse 15 and i will give you pastors according to mine heart which shall feed you with knowledge and understanding this is prophetic there is a time period in history when god brings pastors whom he has chosen himself when the burden begins god chooses leaders those who have rejected the truth they will never know when god is choosing leaders to direct his people they will never understand when miller began his work and when god began to bring people out of the denomination of churches when people began to preach the first angels message when god began to establish leaders to feed people with the present truth the churches did not know the pharisees did not know and so it will be today the churches will not know including those who have said that they are god's people they will not know wakati muchipuko tanza when god will be selecting leaders leaders who are qualified by the spirit of god leaders who have accepted the truth god will empower his people to begin the work in israel return back to your foundational truths all backsliding children rudini katika missing go back to the foundational truth the first second and third angels message a total separation from sin and sinners a total separation from babylon babylon is still alive let us know to be in deception in the last work that is going on as god chose aaron through the burden when the burden begins we're cutting establish we need to foreign god let me read the last statement the last statement from the spirit of prophecy the last statement the last statement from the spirit of prophecy manuscript releases volume 13 13 mr 13 mr page 336 13 mr page 336 page 330 let me see 13 mr yes 336 she says i stated that i was a stockholder writing after the aftermath of 1888 he says and i could not let the resolution pass that there was to be special light for god's people as they neared the closing scenes of this earth's history special light another angel was to come down from heaven with a message and the whole earth was to be lighted with his glory it would be impossible for us to state just how this additional light would come it might come in a very unexpected manner in a way that would not agree with the ideas that many have conceived it is not all unlikely or contrary to the ways and works of god to send light to his people in unexpected ways we are coming back to revelation 18 we began with jesus coming to his temple in the times of the jewish nation two classes of worship us we went to the millerite experience the philadelphian church miller and his associates two classes of worshippers we are coming to tackle revelation 18 nasa to king part four part five we are coming to understand things how they are we are going to plainly speak of the spirit of prophecy and how god wants us to understand what constitutes his church is to fall upon god's people a mighty angel is to come down from heaven that is revelation chapter 18 when it begins god is to take his work to another level many will not understand the great debates will begin in adventism when the birding begins and god chooses leaders to feed his people with the truth and the pure truth we thank you for these messages bless us till the next presentation bless everyone now to bariki arjuna yes amen son

[449.6s] called in his temple when jesus arrived
[452.7s] physically for the very first time
[455.9s] for the very first time
[457.9s] to bring light
[459.9s] now the purpose of jesus coming to
[462.2s] israel
[463.3s] was to put down errors
[465.8s] the rubbish of errors that have been
[467.4s] heaping for generations
[469.2s] and to replace back the truth in the
[471.4s] framework of truth
[475.8s] singing
[484.9s] but what happened the leaders in israel
[486.9s] could not tolerate the light
[489.4s] and we are told in the pain of
[490.9s] inspiration dessert of ages
[493.6s] page 200
[495.3s] and 32
[497.1s] desire of ages
[499.1s] page
[500.0s] 200
[501.4s] and 332
[504.6s] and i say maybe
[507.7s] listen carefully this is history that
[509.4s] repeats in every succeeding generations
[512.1s] whenever jesus will be revealed again
[515.0s] yes
[516.4s] because right now we are going to the
[517.5s] military to see when the birding began
[520.6s] again wakati machipu
[522.7s] the same history was being repeated
[525.9s] she says
[527.0s] if the leaders in his israel had
[528.8s] received christ he would have honored
[530.7s] them as his messengers to carry the
[532.2s] gospel to the world to them first was
[534.6s] given the opportunity to become heralds
[536.4s] of the kingdom of grace
[538.1s] of god but israel knew not the time of
[540.9s] her visitation
[542.4s] the jealousy and distrust of the jewish
[544.4s] leaders had opened it ripened had
[547.1s] ripened into open hatred
[549.2s] at the hearts of the people were turned
[550.9s] away from jesus
[552.6s] the sun henry
[554.1s] yong goziwadini
[556.2s] kosovo
[557.4s] they had rejected christ's message and
[559.8s] was bent upon his death therefore
[562.6s] shikaya points to india we are taught
[565.8s] therefore jesus departed from jerusalem
[575.1s] jesus
[576.1s] the presence of jesus was no longer in
[579.4s] jerusalem he departed from jerusalem
[582.4s] number one
[583.6s] number two from the priests young ghost
[586.4s] wadding
[589.0s] number three from the temple hekalo
[592.3s] number four
[593.8s] the religious leaders the people who had
[596.1s] been instructed in the law
[597.9s] and turned to another class to proclaim
[601.9s] his message
[603.2s] and to gather out those who should carry
[606.1s] the gospel to all nations
[612.0s] luke chapter 6 verse 12.
[619.0s] they have rejected the foundation
[621.4s] of the jewish economy jesus was the
[623.4s] foundation
[624.7s] jesus came to bring back the truth
[627.4s] to those who would have accepted them
[629.8s] like anyway pinga
[643.9s] luke chapter six versus number twelve
[646.9s] lucas
[650.2s] emma
[651.8s] lucas
[657.1s] coomba
[658.6s] aka kesha
[673.0s] we have the title of the of a wonderful
[676.2s] topic that is called
[678.3s] the ordained twelfth jesus began to
[680.6s] obtain
[682.5s] the twelve to establish
[685.6s] his church
[686.7s] what
[689.0s] we had the religious leaders the temple
[691.6s] services and jesus began to ordain
[695.0s] a ministry to carry for the work those
[697.7s] who would accept his message remember
[700.9s] those who accepted the message of john
[702.5s] the baptist accepted christ those who
[705.3s] accepted the second message with christ
[738.8s] as the light and life of man was
[740.4s] rejected by the ecclesiastical
[742.1s] authorities in the day in the days of
[743.7s] christ
[751.4s] so it has been rejected in every
[754.9s] succeeding generation
[761.8s] again and again
[763.3s] the history of christ withdrawal from
[765.4s] judea has been repeated
[794.6s] they had no thought
[796.2s] of separating themselves from the
[798.6s] established
[816.2s] but the religious leaders would not
[818.1s] tolerate the light and those who had the
[820.9s] light were forced to seek another class
[823.1s] who were longing for the truth in our
[825.3s] day
[826.1s] few of the professed followers of the
[827.8s] reformers are actuated by the spirit in
[831.5s] a minute
[838.2s] the bible says history must repeat
[840.7s] and the pain of inspiration says that
[843.3s] history of jesus withdrawing from judea
[846.4s] will be repeated to the close of time
[850.0s] now let's go to the second history
[852.7s] to megalith
[853.9s] of israel
[860.3s] we will be revisiting that history as we
[862.2s] move forward now
[864.4s] let's go back to malachi chapter three
[866.0s] to angola yes
[868.7s] by the way
[873.5s] malachi
[875.0s] says the lord whom you suddenly seek
[877.4s] shall come to his temple the first
[879.9s] temple was in jerusalem now we are
[882.1s] looking at the second temple
[885.0s] before we look at the second temple
[886.4s] maybe
[887.7s] let's look at the book of joel chapter 2
[889.4s] verse 23
[890.7s] it will form the basis of understanding
[894.0s] how many times rain
[896.0s] has fallen in the uh in this earth
[898.1s] history before jesus returns back for
[900.5s] his people
[907.7s] joel chapter 2 verse 23
[911.0s] joel chapter 2
[913.9s] joel
[916.2s] chapter 2
[939.2s] and rejoice in the lord your god for he
[942.1s] had given you the former reign
[944.6s] moderately at me
[950.2s] only
[951.7s] and he will cause to calm down for you
[955.2s] the rain
[958.9s] involved
[964.1s] the rain
[994.6s] the rain
[996.8s] the the former rain
[1000.3s] the rain
[1002.8s] of the latter
[1004.6s] the former rain
[1006.2s] the rain
[1007.4s] and the la terrain is
[1050.3s] three
[1059.8s] let us repeat the book of malachi we
[1061.4s] want to establish
[1063.2s] the three reigns in the history the
[1066.4s] first one
[1067.6s] begins at pentecost the last one
[1072.0s] is in our time period in the time period
[1074.4s] of
[1075.3s] revelation 18 the loud cry of the third
[1077.8s] angel where
[1086.2s] we repeat
[1087.6s] again
[1089.7s] the bible says
[1091.4s] behold i will send my messenger and he
[1094.4s] shall prepare the way before me
[1097.2s] jesus speaking
[1098.6s] and the lord whom you will and the lord
[1101.0s] whom you seek
[1102.8s] shall suddenly come to his temple
[1106.0s] even the messenger of the covenant whom
[1108.3s] you delight in
[1110.1s] behold he shall come save the lord of
[1111.9s] hosts but who may abide in the day of
[1114.2s] his coming and you shall stand when he
[1117.1s] appear it
[1118.3s] for he is like the refiners fire and
[1120.7s] like the fuller soap and they shall sit
[1123.3s] as a refiner
[1125.1s] and a purifier of silver and he shall
[1127.8s] purify the sons of levi and purge them
[1130.6s] as gold
[1131.8s] silver that they may offer unto the lord
[1134.4s] an offering in righteousness
[1148.5s] jesus will begin to separate two classes
[1150.8s] of worshippers depending on those who
[1153.0s] have accepted the whole truth their
[1155.0s] foundational truths
[1156.9s] or those who have rejected two classes
[1158.9s] of worshippers now
[1161.2s] when does this happen then a second time
[1164.4s] we go to the history of the
[1165.8s] philadelphian church
[1168.1s] revelation chapter 10
[1170.7s] the second time that jesus appears to
[1172.5s] his people

[1181.4s] millerite movement
[1182.8s] and i want to show you from the pane of
[1184.3s] inspiration great controversy

[1239.7s] great under the topic the final warning
[1242.7s] abusive villain
[1244.7s] if you cannot understand the prophetic
[1246.8s] parallels you will never understand
[1249.0s] god's work in the last days
[1252.2s] that is why
[1253.4s] there's a lot of trouble in adventism
[1255.4s] today
[1260.6s] or
[1266.2s] people have failed to understand the
[1267.9s] prophetic parallels of the bible and the
[1270.4s] spirit of prophecy look at this listen
[1272.9s] very carefully
[1275.6s] she says
[1276.6s] great controversy 6 11.

[1316.2s] listen to where she goes next secure my
[1318.6s] liana power and elia go to formula and i
[1321.4s] say maybe the advent movement of 1840 to
[1325.5s] 1844 was a glorious manifestation of the
[1329.5s] power of god
[1331.4s] the first angel's message was carried to
[1333.3s] every missionary station in the world
[1335.4s] and in some countries there were the
[1337.5s] greatest religious interests
[1340.3s] which has been witnessed in any land
[1342.5s] since the reformation of the 16th
[1344.2s] century
[1345.6s] but these are to be far exceeded by the
[1348.7s] mighty movement
[1351.7s] by the mighty movement under the last
[1354.0s] warning of the third angel there is to
[1355.7s] be a mighty movement

[1413.6s] fast
[1414.8s] in the jewish time period
[1416.9s] to memories

[1511.0s] little book open and when he had cried
[1515.0s] the seven thunders uttered their voices
[1517.4s] now who is this angel
[1519.8s] uh

[1582.8s] jesus the bible says in revelation
[1585.3s] chapter 10 that he had a a rainbow over
[1588.3s] his head that is jesus jesus was sin
[1591.2s] and his feet
[1592.9s] as the pillars of fire let us go to
[1595.8s] revelation chapter 1 verse 12
[1598.9s] revelation chapter 1 verse 12 just to
[1600.8s] show that this is jesus jesus himself
[1603.1s] descended not physically of course it
[1605.7s] was the power of god and this is another
[1609.0s] instant that we see the holy spirit
[1611.7s] manifestation it is jesus himself the
[1614.6s] holy spirit is not a third god called
[1616.9s] god the holy spirit
[1618.6s] it is the manifestation of christ jesus
[1621.0s] himself to his people and we are going
[1622.8s] to show this again
[1624.9s] for those who believe that
[1626.8s] there is there is another god
[1631.8s] yes
[1636.5s] that is deception of the highest order
[1639.2s] i'm going to show again
[1641.3s] the bible says
[1642.9s] in revelation chapter 1 verses number 12
[1646.6s] revelation chapter 1 verses number 12
[1650.7s] revelation 1 verse 12
[1664.6s] to see the voice that speak with me john
[1666.7s] says
[1711.7s] when john saw jesus his feet were asked
[1714.3s] the burning furnace that is revelation
[1717.0s] chapter 10 the angel that descended his
[1719.9s] feet were as pillars of fire that
[1722.6s] furnace that burnt that was jesus
[1725.0s] himself and spiritual prophecy also
[1727.4s] shows that it was christ
[1729.7s] it was the manifestation of jesus great
[1732.1s] controversy 6 11 says the advent
[1734.7s] movement of 1840 to 1844 was a glorious
[1740.4s] manifestation of
[1742.7s] the power of god
[1745.2s] so jesus descending is the power of god
[1749.7s] the power of god is the holy ghost luke
[1752.0s] chapter 1 verses number 35.
[1761.7s] it is the power of god and it is jesus
[1764.0s] manifesting himself therein when the
[1766.4s] angel came to to to to mary wakati
[1768.7s] malayaca

[1860.4s] and his left foot upon the dry line it
[1863.0s] shows the part which he is acting in the
[1865.7s] closing scenes of the great controversy
[1868.2s] with satan

[1872.5s] and authority over the old earth

[2697.7s] grown cold and when the advent doctrines
[2700.8s] was was presented it only arouse

[2804.6s] they have no certificates to show that
[2806.6s] they have studied

[3006.2s] the son of man came neither eating nor
[3008.6s] drinking
[3009.7s] they came eating and drinking and they
[3012.2s] said behold a man glut on us and one

[3034.6s] i thank thee o father lord of heaven and
[3036.9s] earth because thou has heed these things
[3039.5s] from the wise

[3053.5s] doctorate in philosophy
[3056.1s] in in in in religion
[3060.3s] because of their
[3061.8s] their their wisdom
[3065.3s] they want to embarrass
[3068.2s] the fact that this message
[3070.6s] was to a greater extent
[3073.4s] preached by laymen
[3075.8s] was an argument against it you'll see
[3078.6s] jimbo queen
[3080.4s] and so it will be today in the times of
[3083.0s] miller
[3084.0s] when that angel descended when there was
[3086.5s] rain
[3093.6s] the first angels message
[3095.5s] again there was a separation of
[3096.9s] worshippers
[3120.7s] those who took the message
[3135.1s] the bible says
[3136.9s] revelation chapter 10 verse 10.
[3149.0s] shall
[3154.6s] that message was sweet
[3156.8s] god was gathering a people
[3159.2s] to give the message
[3161.0s] in the last days
[3162.5s] and now
[3164.0s] to napoleon de leon
[3166.2s] that is the history
[3169.1s] that must repeat
[3171.2s] illinois says again and again the
[3173.1s] history of christ withdrawal from judea
[3175.9s] has been repeated
[3178.2s] when the reformers
[3212.8s] we must understand
[3214.9s] that history
[3216.3s] very well
[3217.5s] so that we may be able to stand on the
[3219.4s] platform of truth
[3221.2s] on the platform of eternal truth
[3223.6s] we have established that there was rain
[3225.8s] in the time of the milarites
[3228.0s] in the time of the milorites
[3230.6s] we have established to me
[3233.2s] the angel the messenger of the covenant
[3235.5s] was christ himself descended william
[3238.1s] miller took the position of john the
[3240.4s] baptist again
[3242.6s] and now as we progress
[3244.9s] i want to show
[3246.6s] that the different denominations did not
[3249.0s] accept the message
[3253.6s] of miller
[3257.8s] the different denominations
[3269.7s] we are reading tuna summer uh kitab we
[3272.2s] need to uh

[3292.5s] the advent course in portland maine
[3295.8s] in june of 1842 mr miller gave his
[3298.9s] second course of lectures
[3300.7s] at the casco street church in portland
[3303.8s] i felt it a great privilege this is
[3305.9s] ellen white to attend these lectures
[3309.1s] because people who are coming out of the
[3310.9s] various denominations
[3315.2s] we're going to finish our creeds
[3317.5s] we're going to talk about water william
[3329.8s] put these things in mind even as we move
[3332.2s] with history because the same history is
[3334.7s] going to repeat again
[3337.2s] she says
[3338.8s] for i had fallen under discouragement
[3341.5s] i did not prepare to meet my savior
[3344.3s] this second course created much more
[3347.1s] excitement
[3348.5s] in the city than the first
[3350.8s] with few exceptions
[3353.3s] the different denominations
[3355.8s] closed the doors of their churches
[3359.7s] against miller
[3378.4s] did not do that
[3379.8s] mila went to seek for another class who
[3382.6s] would obey the truth and he established
[3385.2s] places of worship
[3388.9s] what
[3394.2s] like in the times of jesus
[3396.6s] she says in desire of ages 232 paragraph

[3454.6s] leaders by the way

[3480.2s] the light and those who remain in their
[3482.2s] foundational truths those who follow the

[3602.7s] the definition of a church is the church
[3606.2s] that group of people in open apostasy
[3609.4s] from their truth
[3612.3s] or is the church the group of
[3614.6s] individuals who have accepted to follow
[3617.7s] on the lord and to remain in their
[3619.4s] foundational truths amidst them they are
[3622.2s] wheat and tears
[3625.7s] 17
[3626.8s] mr these are the things we are going to
[3629.1s] put in record straight as we continue
[3632.2s] with this presentation it is
[3648.5s] no that is not true
[3650.7s] 17 mr 81.4
[3654.0s] she says
[3658.6s] god has a church
[3661.4s] in the last days
[3662.7s] god has a church
[3665.7s] it is not the great cathedral
[3689.6s] neither is it the various denominations
[3693.3s] canis
[3703.4s] it is the people who love god and keep
[3706.7s] his commandments where two or three are
[3709.7s] gathered together in my name there i am
[3712.9s] in the midst of them where christ is
[3715.8s] even among us the humble few
[3718.0s] this is christ's church
[3721.3s] for the presence of the high and the
[3723.0s] lofty one alone
[3724.6s] that inhabited eternity can alone
[3727.0s] constitute a chat you can see me
[3732.7s] quest
[3737.4s] why do you even have as we move forward
[3739.4s] to look at the last history in our time
[3741.3s] period we are going to look carefully
[3744.2s] because aaron's road is too bad in the
[3746.6s] time period when jesus is still in the
[3748.5s] most holy place
[3754.5s] by the way
[3755.7s] listen very carefully as we bring this
[3757.8s] rock to a close
[3760.1s] revelation chapter 10 and revelation
[3761.9s] chapter 18 is the same angel
[3764.9s] by the way revelation chapter 10
[3767.1s] and revelation chapter 18 is the same
[3768.9s] angel
[3770.1s] revelation chapter 10
[3771.8s] and revelation chapter 18 they are both
[3773.9s] mighty angels revelation chapter 10 the
[3776.6s] mighty angel revelation chapter 18 the
[3778.7s] mighty angel revelation chapter 10 the
[3786.6s] revelation chapter 18 that mighty angel
[3788.6s] cries with a loud voice
[3791.2s] it is the manifestation of christ
[3792.7s] himself
[3796.3s] now as we come to our time period
[3800.4s] look at this something that adventists
[3803.2s] many adventists have never realized
[3806.0s] that when the latter end begins in our
[3807.9s] time period we go back to malachi
[3809.5s] chapter 3
[3811.1s] that the messenger of the covenant must
[3813.8s] prepare people
[3815.8s] to to
[3816.9s] for the revelation
[3818.5s] of jesus to come suddenly
[3821.8s] to his temple
[3827.2s] maybe as we introduce revelation chapter
[3829.0s] 18
[3832.2s] we have seen that the very first attempt
[3834.7s] when god attempted to bring revelation
[3836.5s] chapter 18 the latter in loud cry was in
[3839.3s] 1888
[3840.8s] that is the final
[3842.6s] time their final attempt their final
[3845.8s] work of god revelation 18 when that work
[3849.1s] begins
[3850.7s] two classes of worshippers again
[3853.6s] there are those who will establish
[3854.9s] themselves in the in their foundational
[3856.8s] truths they are those who are going to
[3858.6s] reject
[3859.7s] they are those who are going to stick to
[3861.0s] their denominations they are those who
[3862.7s] are going to follow christ
[3864.6s] the voice that will be crying the
[3866.2s] wilderness there are those who are going
[3868.0s] to be establishing god's people in the
[3869.8s] foundational truths
[3871.8s] there are those who are going to reject
[3873.2s] their truths two classes of worshipers
[3876.0s] you must understand where you belong
[3878.4s] when that work begins officially by the
[3881.1s] way
[3883.7s] israel
[3885.2s] is
[3886.9s] let us go to jeremiah chapter 3
[3889.0s] and see how this happened
[3892.8s] jeremiah number fifteen
[3895.4s] when aaron's road budded god declared
[3898.3s] plainly
