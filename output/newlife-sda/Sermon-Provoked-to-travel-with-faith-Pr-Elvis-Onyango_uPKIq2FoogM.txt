God is good all the time all the time. Yes. And you say I am the testimony. The last part of it. God is good all the time. All the time. The last part of it. I am the testimony. Ah let us repeat because we are dealing with children and uh the difficult children are big children. God is good all the time all the time. God is good. Okay. Let us rest it there. I'm pastor Elvis Onyango the way I've been introduced uh married to burial uh he she's joining us uh online and I can say say hi you are not the one uh we are blessed with uh three children the last One is called Phillip Guy. Philip Guy is my fellow minister. He weded us. So we said we will name our last born after him. And together they in the house. I'm privileged to have the two of them, two of our children here. Adassa uh who is the second born and uh Isaac who is the first born and because of time I may not call them over when we shall be complete I will introduce them once and for all to the congregation. uh because of time I want us to go to the word but before that I want to thank God this far he has brought me when I came to Nairobi this was my first church and uh when I was introduced to New Life Church I worshiped here as a Sabbath school member Then I joined the Zimman Sabbath school which was attached to new life. And the last time I woripped here, the pullpit was on the other side and we were looking this side to put this kind of structure. And this structure was a temporary structure to allow us bring something there. If I'm not wrong, that was the vision. But in 20 207, I moved to Rangai after hope uh after Safari Africa. There I found a church which is a Sabbath school like New Life and I want to thank God for evangelism that you are doing. I stayed in Lisa uh from 207 up to 20 23. I served there as a Pathfinder director from almost 207 up to 2017 sharing with other colleagues and uh between 2016 to 2017 I served there as an elder ordained And before I got married and then there I got my wife also then I moved to theology school and they supported me. I'm here because of their courtesy and I'm thankful for those who supported me to go for theology. Before that one, I was a cameraman and hope 2010. If you remember hope 2010, I was in part of the team that made this podium. It was in bamboo if you remember. And what I used to do, I could only come closer there. That is where I could reach. And these cables, I really lined them very well. So I was behind the camera dealing with the cables. But today by God's grace, they say I am from darkness and to his marvelous light. And I want to thank God and I know he has traveled with you and this song inspires me. I may not sing it all but the chorus is goes. There is no secret what God can do. He has done for others. He'll do for you. With arms wide open, he'll pardon you. There is no secret. What God? What God? What God? Yes. We are going to read from the book of Hebrews. My sermon is based on the book of Hebrews chapter 11 and 1 Samuel. That is where they derived travel with faith. Travel with faith. But the subtopic for us this morning is provoked provoked provoked to travel with faith. And uh take note that it is not traveling in faith and it is not traveling by faith but it is traveling with faith. That conjunction with emphasizes our theme with make faith to be an experience. That is where the dim lies. Yes, you can travel by faith. You can travel in faith. But as as adventurers for 36 years, we want to celebrate God that we have traveled with faith. We have experience with him. We can testify that he's a good God. Traveling with faith means we can trust him. Even if I put mic down. Cinema Malisa. Okay, let me put a rider in Hebrews 11. We will start from 4 up to 13. I'm I'm interested in 13. So let's read together. And as we read, I remember to bring the greetings of my senior pastor. Uh we were told he's ministering in Rangai Central. He said, "When you go there, kindly greet them and remind the youths that in the afternoon you have a program upstairs in that building." Do you receive? Yes. Let us read now. By faith, Abel offered to God a more excellent sacrifice than Cain, through which he obtained witness that he was righteous. God testifying of his gifts, and through it he being dead, still speaks. By faith, Enoch was taken away so that he did not see death and was found because God had taken him away. For before he was taken, he had this testimony that he pleased God. But without faith, it is impossible to please him. For he who comes to God must believe that he is and that he is a rewarder of those who diligently seek him. Congregation, join me in reading verse 7. By faith, Noah, being divinely warned of things not yet seen, moved with godly fear, prepared an ark for the saving of his household, by which he condemned the world, and be uh became hair of the righteousness, which is according to faith. Verse eight, by faith Abraham obeyed when he was called to go out to the place which he will receive as inheritance. And he went out not knowing where he was going. By faith he dwelt in the land of promise as in a foreign country, dwelling in tents with Isaac and Jacob and hes with him of the same promise. For he waited for the city which has foundations, whose builder and maker is God. By faith, Sarah helped herself also received strength to conceive seed. And she bore a child when she was past the age because she judge judged him faithfully who had promised. Therefore from one man and him as good as dead were born as many as the stars of the sky in the multitude innumerable and as the sand which is by the seash. Lastly, verse 13. This all died. D died where? These all died in, not having received the promises, but having seen them far off, were assured of them, embraced them, and confessed that they were strangers and pilgrims on the earth. Let's pray. Our loving father, we are pilgrims and you have called us in a pilgrimage that we may travel in a holy place, a holy land. Travel with faith. Lord, it is not secret what you can do to your children. If we read your word, Lord, we have seen that you have traveled with thy children. There is somebody here that needs to experience you aresh. This is why we seek the power of the Holy Spirit that Lord through the Holy Spirit you may abide with us the way you promised that you will be with us until the end of time. With the power of the Holy Spirit, we seek the mighty angels that help us to capture this congregation that the power of the devil may be put at bay. that Lord one word may inspire your children to launch into your promise. For this we pray in Jesus name. Amen. Thank you. The Bible tell us that all these people died in faith. Our theme this morning can rhyme with all these pilgrims. At a point in their life, they were provoked to take a new path. They were provoked to look a new way. They were provoked to start a fresh. They were provoked to make a step of faith. The way we started with Abel, the first of our first prayer, Abel was provoked to worship God in the right way. He was provoked to sacrifice in the right manner. Yes, he could understand that Eve and Adam lost God's grace, God's cover, God's path. And when he was born, he was hope to the family because Eve and Adam was always looking to a seed that will save them. The promise was that there will be a seed of a woman that will save you from the curse of sin. So every day as they walk, as they travel with faith, they were looking forward for a seed, a child that will be born of a woman to help them in the journey to rescue them when the path is too hilly to climb. When Abel uh before Abel when K arrived there was hope in the family of the first parents and they put a lot of pressure on K. They carried K as the savior. They carried Kane as a seed that will redeem the world. That burden was too heavy. Even like today the parents are loading a lot on the children. They expect them to behave like adults especially the firstborns. They carry some of the responsibilities of the parents. kind was overloaded and in that he rebelled. He rebelled from the parents. If we lord adventurers, if we lord our little children, we give them the responsibilities that we need to take, they will reach a point that they will rebel. and bringing them back may not be easy because if they travel without faith, if they travel without the experience of God, when they stray, bringing them in will be difficult. Now, the way they handle K was different the way they handle Abel. But there was hope for K because when he was provoked to kill Abel because of the the the jealousy and the burden when God descended and ask of him Kane, Kane, Ken, where is your brother? The Bible tell us that Abel died in righteousness, in faith, but his blood was still speaking. God himself refers and says the blood of your brother is still speaking. Where is your brother? Do you know you can be kind inside here? Yes, you are comfortable but you are lost within because the blood of somebody is crying over your head. Somebody needs to hear this gospel. But you are comfortable. Somebody need to travel with hope. But there is nobody to go and tell them there is Jesus. There is somebody yearning to hear from you. There is somebody looking that you hold their hands. There is somebody looking for you to to cry with them. There is somebody looking for you to stretch your hands and guide them. Abel traveled with with faith and died in faith provoked. Yes. But he took a good path to worship God and sacrifice to God. But kind took the wrong turn. Enoch walked with God. There is a stage that he was provoked to start a new walk, a new chart, a new path to launch into the purpose of men. Our purpose is to worship God, to glorify him, to acknowledge him in our lives. Enoch, like all of us, was born in sin. with sinful generation. And when he came, sin was forcing him to bend towards evil. But he made a right decision. He was provoked in thought and he choose to do right. The Bible tell us that he walked with faith and died in faith. And he says Enoch pleased God and there was a rider that you can never please God without faith. So faith is crucial. Noah was provoked to take and chart a new path. being divinely warned. He rose up to condemn the world. He rose up to preach the gospel. Yes, he was provoked to divinity. He was provoked to reach the arms of faith. He was provoked to the impossible, the impossibility world. He was provoked to attain high standard that without faith you cannot grasp. Noah was called to divinity that he must collabor collaborate with divine and the Bible says to condemn the world and build an ark that will save the entire world. And for 120 years he traveled with faith and he saved his family. And Jesus is telling us that our time the end time it will be as the time of Noah. What Noah did he traveled with faith. Yes. provoked with men and women was laughed and people were saying are you mad? Have you seen rain? It was impossible thing but he traveled with faith day by day not losing hope but at last he saved his pathfinders and his adventurers and God desires that we walk like that to save our family. Yes, you can walk with faith, but it will be painful if you lose the young ones because the question will be where are the young ones I gave you. Abraham traveled to the promised land and when he reached there Abraham could not settle in the promised land. The Bible says that he was dwelling in tents with Isaac and Jacob but he was in the promised land. I don't know if you have reached in your life. I don't know if you have reached your promised land in this side of heaven. I don't know where you are but if you have reached your promised land then you need to walk in tent with your children. You need not to settle in one place. You need to tell them the wonders of God. You need to travel with them with faith. Abraham was traveling and each station he was building an altar for worship and sacrifice. And Isaac took that trend and Isaac passed it to Jacob. Yes, they were called to the promised land. But when they reached, they could not settle. Abraham was wealthy. Abraham could break build for God a cathedral. Abraham could settle in Kanan Cananan and and build a house permanent. But the Bible tell us that he opted for tent. Knowing that he was a pilgrim, knowing that he was a passerby, knowing that he will travel with God but not here until eternity. So he could not settle. He was a missionary. God is looking for you. God is looking for this church that we cannot settle in our promised land. This this yonder. This is why we need to be provoked to move to a higher purpose to move to a higher calling to move to a higher greatness. We need not to be contented with where we are. We need not to be contented with this promised land this time. Moses wanted to settle there. But God said, Moses, I have a better one. We are looking for that better land. Because the Bible tell us that all these people, yes they traveled with faith, died in faith, but they were looking for a city, a city that is not built by human hands. That is where we need to focus. And our theme this year is be not be not be dismayed. Be not be troubled. Be not be troubled with the cares of the world. Jesus said, "I'm going to prepare a place for you." That city that his maker he its builder is God himself. That is where we need to focus. That is where we need to travel with faith with our children guiding them to a city that is not made by human hands. I'm looking forward for that city the way the pilgrims look forward for that city that I want to walk and travel with faith and I'm inviting God that every stage that I stepped in, I settled in, he has established me in. And I want to slumber there. I want to feel at ease there. I want to feel contented. I want to fill and attract the pride of life, the lust of the body, and the lust of the eye. The Bible says those three are sins that easily beset us when we are in our comfort zone. I pray to God that whenever I get into that mode that he may send somebody something another hand to provoke me to another level. And thus we are turning to 1 Samuel where our key text lies. Faith of our fathers living still. We will be true till death. that what will be our children's fate. Our prayer this morning that we travel with faith that our children may travel with faith that when they will reach the end of this life they will die in faith like our fathers. that when their time will reach, maybe when we shall not be there, that they be in the hands of God, they travel with faith. Then when their time comes, they die in faith. That when my time shall arrive, I die in faith. Just like the pilgrims, just like our fathers, this family of Elcana was provoked to a higher level. Elcana Elcana is a man of God. If you read the introduction of 1 Samuel, Samuel is writing about his father. He does not give us a lot about his father. But when we received travel with faith, the book is 1 Samuel, I looked into some qualities of Elcana. And when I was going through, I found that Elcana was a man of faith just like Abraham. He was a man of faith just like Enoch. He was a man of faith just like Abel. Though he had his own flaws, though he had his own failures, but he was also a man of faith provoked to travel with faith like others. Elcana, the father to Samuel, the first pro uh the the one of the judges, the first prophet to anoint the first king of Israel, the father of somebody important in the life of Israelites. That Elcana was a Levite. And as a Levite, he was supposed to be serving God in his temple. And as usual, the Levites were never given a portion of land in Israel. They were told that choose a dwelling place. Choose where you can stay and you serve God. And especially if you are not in retune service in the temple. So Elcana chose a place in Ephraim. Ephraim is in the mountain. This is where elites were being buried. People like Joshua were buried there and other kings were being buried in the mountain of Ephraim. But this is this was a community of the Ephraim, the son of Joseph. And I want to connect it with the last sermon last Sabbath who was which was talking about Dan. Dan and Ephraim had something in common because Dan and Ephraim they are missing in the last list of the gate. Though Ephraim was having a gate before the destruction of Jerusalem before it was built again with Nemiah and his team. Ephraim. There was a gate of Ephraim, but they joined and teamed up with Dan. And we learned last Sabbath that Dan was excommunicated from the list uh of the the children of Israel that were numbered and were given a gate because he fell into idolatry. But not only in idolatry. Uh he rebelled against the Israel. The Bible says that Dan was like a snake. So Ephraim joined with Dan and they were like one team. Ephraim also they rebelled against God. Ephraim also they welcomed idolatry. And this is where Elcana chose to settle the [Music] way Lot chose to settle near Sodom. And we know that Lot lost the young adventurers. Lot lost pathfinders. Lord lost his young ones by the end of it all. This is where Elcana also settled. And the Bible says that he could travel from Ephraim to Shilo. That tell us that Elcana was a man of means. Elcana was wealthy. Elcana could afford to embark on a pilgrimage. If you ask the Muslims, it is a mandatory if you are a Muslim to travel to Mecca. But only those who are of means will travel. So Elcana was of means to make a pilgrimage to travel with faith year after year to go to Shilo to offer worship and sacrifice to God. Even though he set he settled in Ephraim, he was provoked and he realized his duties. Though he fell, but he could still cling to the faith of his fathers. Yes, he fell by settling in Ephraim. Yes, he fell by embracing Ephraim. Yes, he fell by neglecting his duty as a Levite. Yes, they were to worship and sacrifice. They were to be in the temple. But Ephraim lost that. He lost the privilege to serve. He lost the privilege to walk and travel with God morning after morning in the temple. Like other Levites, Elcana lost was he he was pushed the way Abraham was was pushed. He could not wait the promised seed. He had a common character with Abraham. Abraham also was rich, was wealthy, but he was not having an heir. Elcana also was wealthy. A Levite was in his world, promised land, but he was not having an heir. And they lived with Anna looking for an heir, looking for adventurer, looking for a pathfinder, looking for a child to match the way these adventurers are matching. When it travel to Shilo, he could desire to hold off adventurer. And for a long time the Bible tell us that they could not get a child because God closed the womb of Anna and Elcana lost the touch with his calling. He lost the way. He lost his purpose. But at long last, he was provoked to realize his calling. He was provoked to realize his purpose. He was provoked to realize that he can make it even though he has fallen. The Bible tells and remind us, "Though you have fallen seven times, rise up again. Lest the spirit of God provoke you again to make a fresh start. In Lu there is a writing that says chaka chaka y just start doesn't matter where you will start but just start and make a step forward and Elcana by faith moved yes is he was struggling in the family yes he had contracted panina yes he had lost hope of having another child. So he he contracted Panina to bear other children. But his hope was still with Anna because Anna was a blessing to Elcana. And the name Anna means grace. When God give you grace, you can never switch it for another thing. When God's handed hand hands over to you favor, you need not to switch it. You need not to seek to replace it. So Elana though Anna was having challenges but he said Anna we will walk though I will contract another marriage. I will contract penina but I will walk side by side and we will travel to Shilo. We will still seek the face of God. We will not lose hope. We will not be comfortable that we cannot bear a child. In the old age they could agree with the wife before contracting another marriage. It was not like today you are with your partner but he's having a side chick or she is having a side chick without you knowing. In the old times, they could sit and agree the way Abraham and Sarah did, the way Jacob and who they agreed, Rachel and the rest. But as they were traveling, the Bible says that they made various trips every year, a trip of hope. They were traveling with faith. But at long last one day when the Lord had blessed them with children through Penina, the Bible tell us that as they were worshiping day by day and as they were carrying the sacrifice. Thank you. Ellie did not leave Anna. They walked. They traveled with faith with Anna. And one of the occasions they reach as they always worship God and offer sacrifice as they retune and the Bible tell us that Ellie was purpose in his actions and he could give sacrifice to everyone. He could give sacrifice to Panina and her children. And when it was time for Anna, he he could give Anna sacrifice to offer and double it. And this is where Panina comes in. And Panina said, "I don't like this routine. I see Anna is comfortable. I see Anna losing faith. I see Anna not striving to unlock her purpose in life. I see a potential in Anna but she's sleeping in her potential now through God. Panina comes in and ask Anna this question. You mean you are comfortable with a double portion of Elcana? You mean you are comfortable with this that when my children are sacrificing and as we have been given a portion a time to sacrifice now you are happy because Elanak will give you a double portion wake up you barren woman wake up you need to sacrifice with your children wake up from slumber and the Bible tell in verse six that and her rival also provoked her severely to make her miserable because the Lord had closed her womb. Because the Lord had closed her home. You know, God did it for a purpose. God did it with a reason. God did it so that when he comes when when Anaku realize his goal and his purpose and his mission in life and unlock it, it will be a launching pad to our greatness. Anna will be the bearer of Samuel, a child who will judge Israel. Anna will give birth to a child that will sacrifice on behalf of Israel. Do you see you are sleeping on your potential? Do you see that you need to be provoked to travel with f with faith in God? Do you see that you need to be provoked? I don't know where your where your panina will come from. I don't know whether he's sitting next to you because you know your panina can be your husband. Your penina can be your wife. Your penina can be your boss. Your penina can be that person that is your neighbor. But God is looking into your life and is ready to send Penina your way to unlock your potential to push you to another level. We are new as servants of God. And maybe God has send us in this church with Panina's message that we need to provoke you with such messages for you to make right decisions for you to choose to write to walk right with God. For you to pick up your responsibility and train his children. for you to bring your children for blessings, for you to help others train their children. Because if Anna could never be provoked, Ellie could not have gotten a job to train Samuel. If Anna could have not been provoked, then there will be no person that Ellie could instruct and say to a young man, Samuel that when he calls, when he calls, just say, say yes, Lord. When he calls, just say yes, Lord. We need early in this congregation when our young ones will run to and direct them that when God calls you. Yes. Adventurer just say yes Lord. We need an elder in this church that when the adults run to them, then they will direct them to say yes to God. This is what Anna was sleeping on, was contented with it. She she had indifferent life but Penina was not indifferent. Penina had she had to speak. She had to provoke her miserably so that she can come into reality. And the Bible tell us that when she was provoked, she stood up. Anna stood up and started one step after another to travel with faith in God. And after that she stood up and she went where she will seek the face of God. She went where Ellie could see her. She went there and kneel before God. She wept. She claimed her territory. She claimed her promises. She prayed vently with purpose and the Lord had a prayer. Lord blessed her with Samuel. How I pray that when something is provoking you, take it positive. Take it positive. It can be a window for you to another level. When you are not being promoted, take it positive. God is preparing another level. When you are being provoked left and right, take it positive. There is something that God wants to do in your life. God can only allow temptations that we can overcome to come our way. He will never allow any temptation that you cannot overcome to come your way. When he closed the womb of Anna, God knew that Anna when provoked she can unlock her potential. Any temptation that comes your way, know that it is opportunity for you to launch to to greatness. It is opportunity to realize your purpose. It is opportunity to seek divinity. It is opportunity to grasp the hands of faith. How I pray that we may take it positive whenever we are provoked the way Anna did. And when Samuel was there, the Bible tell us that Elcana went to Anna and ask Anna, "Anna, can we go to Shilo and worship God and sacrifice to him the way we used to go?" The Bible says that Anna said, "No, I will not go. I will not travel with you. I will not walk side by side with Penina. Yes, Panina did something in my life, but I will never walk side by side with Penina. Give me time. Give me time to win my son. This is where I call the young parents just like me that don't just walk to Shilo with Panina without winning your son. Without winning your son because if you walk to Shilo without winning your son, Penina can just inject your son with jealousy. Penina can teach your son wrong teachings. Panina can provoke your son to turn his way our way in a negative way. This is where we are needed to nurture our children first. Parents are the first priest. Parents are the first teachers. Parents are the ones that needs to provoke their children not to wrath but to purpose. Instill in them faith of our fathers. When Moses was given to the mother before he was winded, the mother pumped everything, provoked Moses to explained everything to Moses, created a vision and Moses could know that these people are our enemies. He created she she created jealousy in Moses that when Moses came to age, he could not live live in the palace. This is where we are called as a church that let nurture the young ones. Let's nurture our adventurers. Let's nurture our pathfinders. Let's nurture our youths. Some of them may be struggling but this is the place to nurture them. This is the place to cause them. I want to pray with someone. I want to pray with someone that could hold their child and walk to this altar the way Anna did. And when the time was ripe, Anna walked with Elcana side by side and they walked to that altar and they brought Samuel to God. The Bible tell us in Romans 12 verse one that be a living sacrifice. You can hold the hands of your son. You can hold the hands of your daughter. You can hold the hands of somebody and walk them to the altar and pray to God. God travel with them. Travel with them. Walk with them in faith. Travel with them, oh Lord, in every step. Hold them that one day they will live for their purpose. One day they will make it to a city built with God's own hands. I want you to just hold the hands of your son, your daughter, your youth. If there is one of your blood, walk them to this altar. And as you come, there are things here. Don't break them, but walk into this altar. Walk with faith. Travel with purpose. May this message provoke you the way it did to Anna and Elcana. At last, Elana and Anna walked with Samuel to the altar and they left Samuel in the hands of God. If your child is there, walk them as chisters are doing the last closing song. Walk them, walk them to the altar, present them to God today again as we celebrate 36 years of adventurers. Walk them, hold their hands, come with them, make a prayer of commitment to your children the way Anna and Elana did. You came to worship God. You came to sacrifice the way Anna did and Elcana. Walk your children wherever they are. Walk with them. God is faithful to steer them. God is faithful to look up to up to them. God is faithful to guide them the way he did for all the pilgrims. That one day he will launch us to a city that is foundation is built by God himself. where my children are, please come. I want to get the holds the hands of my son Isaac also and Adasa kindly let them come as we pray. Song number 100. Great is thy faithfulness, oh God, my father. Let's all rise. Let's all rise with song number 100, our closing song. [Music] [Applause] Great is thy faithfulness, oh God. My father there is a shadow of thee. Thou changes [Music] [Applause] like thou forever. [Music] Great is thy faithfulness. Great is thy faithfulness. Morning by morning. You are the singing. [Music] Great is thy faithfulness, Lord, and to [Music] me. [Music] Heat. Heat. [Music] Some [Music] wind [Music] joy might Lord to thy [Applause] greatfulness. Great is thy faithfulness. Great is thy faithfulness. Glory my glory. Heat. Heat. and all my gr is thousand. [Music] and God is looking up to you to provoke somebody to spiritual breakthrough. Provoking also can mean partnering with God spiritually to unlock the potential of somebody. Support those around you in their walk with God. Even if it means sacrifice, we want to thank God for his faithfulness. The way he has traveled with you, you are the one who knows the hills and the valleys. But indeed, you can stand the way you are and testify that he is Ebenezar. this far the Lord has brought you. How I pray that commit once again that you will travel with faith in God until the last breath that you will walk with him just like the pilgrims and die in faith never to depart from faith. But if you have to depart that God may bring you in with all means. Even if bringing Panina, may he bring Panina in your life to bring you back to the true faith. Our loving father, we thank you this hour as we celebrate 36 years of adventure adventuring with God. You have traveled with many people in their lives. The way you did to great men of faith the way you did to encounter family. Lord, you can do it to us again. There is nothing new under the sun. And Lord, we pray that truly you can provoke us positively that we may travel with faith in you. Lord, there are people who are contented in their situation. How I pray that you may push them to realize their purpose in life, to realize their potential in life. And Lord, there are children that have walked into this altar with their parents. It is a bold step that Encana and Anna did when they took hands of Samuel and they brought him into the altar and they committed his life into your hands. They trusted you with the life of Samuel. They believed in you that Lord, even if they were going back empty again, that you will favor them along the way. That you will provide again. That you will open the womb of honor and produce again. And indeed, you bless them with five children, a symbol of grace again. Lord, how I pray that these children may be left in your hands and as parents will go back, they will go back with your favor and everyone as we leave this service that Lord, we may be provoked to look for a city built with God's hands. in Jesus name I pray. Amen.

[157.0s] uh because of
[159.6s] time I want us to go to the word but
[163.8s] before that I want to thank God this far
[167.7s] he has brought
[169.9s] me when I came to Nairobi this was my
[173.4s] first
[175.2s] church and uh when I was introduced to
[179.6s] New Life
[181.0s] Church I worshiped here as a Sabbath
[183.8s] school member
[186.2s] Then I joined the Zimman Sabbath school
[191.1s] which was attached to new
[193.9s] life. And the last time I woripped
[198.0s] here, the pullpit was on the other
[202.3s] side and we were looking this side to
[206.1s] put this kind of
[209.4s] structure. And this structure was a
[212.2s] temporary
[213.6s] structure to allow us bring something
[217.0s] there. If I'm not wrong, that was the
[221.5s] vision. But in 20 207, I moved to
[227.3s] Rangai after hope uh after Safari
[230.6s] Africa.
[233.6s] There I found a church which is a
[237.8s] Sabbath school like New Life and I want
[240.8s] to thank God for evangelism that you are
[245.6s] doing. I stayed in Lisa
[250.2s] uh from
[253.4s] 207 up to
[257.2s] 20 23.
[262.7s] I served there as a Pathfinder
[266.0s] director from almost
[268.8s] 207 up to
[272.8s] 2017 sharing with other
[278.0s] colleagues and
[279.9s] uh
[281.4s] between 2016 to
[284.5s] 2017 I served there as an
[290.1s] elder ordained And
[293.0s] before I got
[296.4s] married and then there I got my wife
[300.5s] also then I
[302.9s] moved to theology
[306.0s] school and they supported me. I'm here
[310.5s] because of their courtesy and I'm
[313.4s] thankful for those who supported me to
[316.2s] go for
[319.2s] theology. Before that
[321.8s] one, I was a
[326.5s] cameraman and hope
[329.6s] 2010. If you remember hope
[333.6s] 2010, I was in part of the team that
[337.6s] made this
[339.2s] podium. It was in
[341.5s] bamboo if you
[343.9s] remember. And what I used to
[346.8s] do, I could only come closer there. That
[351.5s] is where I could
[353.2s] reach. And these
[355.4s] cables, I really lined them very well.
[359.3s] So I was behind the
[361.0s] camera dealing with the
[363.4s] cables. But today by God's
[366.9s] grace, they say I am from darkness and
[371.1s] to his
[372.1s] marvelous
[374.7s] light. And I want to thank God and I
[378.6s] know he
[379.8s] has traveled with
[382.3s] you and this song inspires me. I may not
[388.2s] sing it
[389.3s] all but the chorus is
[393.7s] goes. There is no
[397.6s] secret what God can
[401.3s] do. He has done for
[405.3s] others. He'll do for
[409.2s] you. With arms wide
[413.3s] open, he'll pardon you.
[418.4s] There is no
[421.7s] secret. What
[425.0s] God? What
[428.2s] God? What
[431.2s] God?
[434.2s] Yes. We are going to
[438.8s] read from the book of Hebrews.
[444.4s] My sermon is based on the book of
[447.6s] Hebrews chapter
[450.7s] 11 and 1
[455.8s] Samuel. That is
[457.9s] where they
[460.1s] derived travel with
[463.5s] faith. Travel with
[467.3s] faith. But the
[470.7s] subtopic
[472.4s] for us this
[477.7s] morning is
[481.4s] provoked
[483.3s] provoked
[485.5s] provoked to travel with
[491.0s] faith. And uh take note that it is not
[496.1s] traveling in
[498.3s] faith and it is not traveling by
[502.7s] faith but it is
[506.0s] traveling with
[509.8s] faith. That conjunction
[514.0s] with emphasizes our
[517.8s] theme with make faith to be an
[524.6s] experience. That is
[527.2s] where the dim
[530.1s] lies. Yes, you can travel by
[533.2s] faith. You can travel in faith. But as
[537.7s] as adventurers for 36
[542.0s] years, we want to celebrate God that we
[545.8s] have traveled with faith. We have
[549.4s] experience with him. We can testify that
[553.6s] he's a good God. Traveling with faith
[557.3s] means we can trust him.
[562.3s] Even if I put mic down. Cinema
[566.3s] Malisa. Okay, let me put a
[572.3s] rider
[573.9s] in
[578.0s] Hebrews
[582.8s] 11. We will start from
[586.4s] 4 up
[588.8s] to 13. I'm I'm interested in
[592.9s] 13. So
[595.2s] let's read
[597.6s] together. And as we read, I remember to
[601.9s] bring the greetings of my senior pastor.
[605.9s] Uh we were told he's ministering in
[609.4s] Rangai Central. He said, "When you go
[612.4s] there, kindly greet them and remind the
[615.4s] youths that in the afternoon you have a
[618.4s] program upstairs in that building." Do
[622.5s] you
[623.5s] receive? Yes. Let us read now.
[627.8s] By faith, Abel offered to God a more
[631.1s] excellent sacrifice than
[634.2s] Cain, through which he obtained witness
[638.8s] that he was righteous. God testifying of
[643.0s] his gifts, and through it he being dead,
[646.8s] still speaks. By faith, Enoch was taken
[651.4s] away so that he did not see death and
[655.5s] was found because God had taken him
[658.8s] away. For before he was taken, he had
[662.5s] this testimony that he pleased God. But
[666.7s] without faith, it is impossible to
[669.8s] please him. For he who comes to God must
[674.0s] believe that he is and that he is a
[678.2s] rewarder of those who diligently seek
[682.2s] him. Congregation, join me in reading
[685.6s] verse 7. By faith, Noah, being divinely
[689.7s] warned of things not yet seen, moved
[693.2s] with godly fear, prepared an ark for the
[697.9s] saving of his household, by which he
[701.4s] condemned the world, and be uh became
[705.0s] hair of the righteousness, which is
[708.1s] according to faith. Verse eight, by
[712.1s] faith Abraham obeyed when he was called
[715.5s] to go out to the place which he will
[718.8s] receive as inheritance. And he went out
[723.2s] not knowing where he was
[726.3s] going. By faith he dwelt in the land of
[729.8s] promise as in a foreign country,
[732.4s] dwelling in tents with Isaac and Jacob
[736.1s] and hes with him of the same promise.
[741.1s] For he waited for the city which has
[745.8s] foundations, whose builder and maker is
[749.2s] God. By faith, Sarah helped herself also
[755.0s] received strength to conceive seed. And
[759.2s] she bore a child when she was past the
[763.0s] age because she judge judged him
[766.5s] faithfully who had
[768.4s] promised. Therefore from one man and him
[772.7s] as good as dead were born as many as the
[777.1s] stars of the sky in the multitude
[781.3s] innumerable and as the sand which
[784.9s] is by the seash.
[789.7s] Lastly, verse
[793.4s] 13. This
[796.7s] all
[798.7s] died. D died where?
[801.9s] These all died in,
[806.5s] not having received the promises, but
[810.0s] having seen them far off, were assured
[814.6s] of them, embraced them, and confessed
[819.1s] that they were strangers and
[823.2s] pilgrims on the
[826.5s] earth. Let's
[828.5s] pray.
[831.7s] Our loving
[836.1s] father, we are
[840.0s] pilgrims and you have called us in a
[844.8s] pilgrimage that we may travel in a holy
[848.3s] place, a holy
[849.7s] land. Travel with faith.
[854.6s] Lord, it is not secret what you can do
[857.5s] to your
[859.2s] children. If we read your
[862.3s] word, Lord, we have seen that you have
[865.4s] traveled with thy
[868.1s] children. There is somebody
[871.2s] here that needs to experience you aresh.
[876.6s] This is why we seek the power of the
[878.4s] Holy Spirit that Lord through the Holy
[882.7s] Spirit you may abide with us the way you
[885.7s] promised that you will be with us until
[888.1s] the end of
[889.4s] time. With the power of the Holy Spirit,
[893.3s] we seek the mighty angels that help us
[897.8s] to capture this congregation that the
[900.6s] power of the devil may be put at bay.
[903.9s] that Lord one word may inspire your
[907.1s] children to launch into your promise.
[910.4s] For this we pray in Jesus name.
[915.8s] Amen. Thank
[917.7s] you. The Bible tell us that all these
[921.6s] people died in
[924.3s] faith.
[926.0s] Our theme this
[930.7s] morning can rhyme with all these
[935.2s] pilgrims. At a point in their
[939.9s] life, they were provoked to take a new
[945.4s] path. They were provoked to look a new
[949.7s] way.
[951.4s] They were provoked to start a fresh.
[955.2s] They were provoked to make a step of
[958.8s] faith. The way we started with
[962.8s] Abel, the first of our first
[966.4s] prayer, Abel was provoked to worship God
[971.2s] in the right way. He was
[974.4s] provoked to sacrifice in the right
[977.8s] manner. Yes, he could understand that
[982.2s] Eve and
[984.3s] Adam
[986.0s] lost God's grace, God's cover, God's
[990.8s] path. And when he was
[993.7s] born, he was hope to the
[998.2s] family
[999.7s] because Eve and Adam was always looking
[1004.2s] to a seed that will save them. The
[1007.6s] promise was that there will be a seed of
[1010.6s] a woman that will save you from the
[1014.0s] curse of sin. So every day as they walk,
[1017.7s] as they travel with faith, they were
[1021.0s] looking forward for a seed, a child that
[1024.6s] will be born of a woman to help them in
[1027.9s] the journey to rescue them when the path
[1032.3s] is too hilly to climb.
[1036.0s] When Abel uh before Abel when K
[1039.8s] arrived there was hope in the family of
[1043.8s] the first
[1045.4s] parents and they put a lot of pressure
[1048.5s] on K. They carried K as the savior. They
[1053.3s] carried Kane as a
[1055.4s] seed that
[1058.0s] will redeem the world.
[1061.8s] That burden was too heavy. Even like
[1064.8s] today the parents are loading a lot on
[1068.2s] the
[1069.3s] children. They expect them to behave
[1073.2s] like
[1074.9s] adults especially the
[1077.9s] firstborns. They carry some of the
[1081.0s] responsibilities of the parents.
[1085.1s] kind was
[1087.2s] overloaded and in that he
[1091.6s] rebelled. He rebelled from the
[1094.8s] parents. If we lord
[1097.8s] adventurers, if we lord our little
[1100.5s] children, we give them the
[1103.5s] responsibilities that we need to
[1106.8s] take, they will reach a point that they
[1109.6s] will
[1110.6s] rebel. and bringing them
[1113.3s] back may not be easy because if they
[1117.0s] travel without
[1119.4s] faith, if they travel without the
[1122.2s] experience of
[1124.2s] God, when they stray, bringing them in
[1129.7s] will be
[1132.0s] difficult. Now, the way they
[1134.4s] handle K was different the way they
[1137.9s] handle Abel.
[1143.0s] But there was hope for
[1148.0s] K because when he was provoked to kill
[1153.3s] Abel because of the the the jealousy and
[1157.1s] the
[1160.8s] burden when God
[1163.7s] descended and ask of
[1166.6s] him
[1169.3s] Kane,
[1171.3s] Kane, Ken, where is your
[1175.0s] brother? The Bible tell us that
[1179.2s] Abel died in righteousness, in faith,
[1183.4s] but his blood was still speaking.
[1189.2s] God himself refers and
[1192.8s] says the blood of your brother is still
[1199.0s] speaking. Where is your
[1201.4s] brother? Do you know you can be kind
[1205.1s] inside
[1206.2s] here? Yes, you are comfortable but you
[1209.8s] are lost
[1210.8s] within because the blood of somebody is
[1215.0s] crying over your head.
[1217.4s] Somebody needs to hear this gospel. But
[1220.6s] you are
[1222.0s] comfortable. Somebody need to travel
[1224.3s] with hope. But there is nobody to go and
[1227.0s] tell them there is
[1230.0s] Jesus. There is somebody yearning to
[1233.6s] hear from you. There is somebody looking
[1237.4s] that you hold their hands. There is
[1239.8s] somebody looking for you to to cry with
[1243.4s] them.
[1245.5s] There is somebody looking for you to
[1247.8s] stretch your hands and guide
[1255.1s] them.
[1257.7s] Abel traveled with with
[1262.1s] faith and died in
[1265.3s] faith
[1267.3s] provoked. Yes. But he took a good path
[1272.2s] to worship God and sacrifice to God. But
[1276.2s] kind took the wrong
[1279.5s] turn. Enoch walked with God.
[1284.5s] There is a stage that he was
[1288.0s] provoked to start a new walk, a new
[1291.6s] chart, a new path to launch into the
[1296.8s] purpose of men. Our purpose is to
[1300.3s] worship God, to glorify him, to
[1302.9s] acknowledge him in our
[1306.1s] lives. Enoch, like all of
[1309.9s] us, was born in sin.
[1314.0s] with sinful
[1316.2s] generation. And when he
[1319.2s] came, sin was forcing him to bend
[1323.1s] towards evil. But he made a right
[1326.4s] decision. He was provoked in thought and
[1330.2s] he choose to do right. The Bible tell us
[1333.6s] that he walked with faith and died in
[1338.5s] faith. And he says Enoch pleased
[1344.1s] God and there was a rider that you can
[1347.6s] never please God without
[1349.6s] faith. So faith is
[1354.8s] crucial.
[1356.5s] Noah was
[1358.8s] provoked to take and chart a new path.
[1366.2s] being divinely
[1369.3s] warned. He rose up to condemn the world.
[1373.4s] He rose up to preach the
[1377.5s] gospel. Yes, he was provoked to
[1382.6s] divinity. He was provoked to reach the
[1385.8s] arms of
[1387.3s] faith. He was provoked to the
[1391.2s] impossible, the impossibility world.
[1394.6s] He was provoked to
[1397.6s] attain high standard that without faith
[1401.5s] you cannot
[1403.8s] grasp. Noah was called to
[1408.5s] divinity that he must collabor
[1412.3s] collaborate with
[1416.5s] divine and the Bible says to condemn the
[1419.8s] world and build an ark that will save
[1424.0s] the entire world. And for 120 years he
[1429.1s] traveled with
[1432.6s] faith and he
[1435.2s] saved his family. And Jesus is telling
[1439.5s] us that our time the end time it will be
[1445.0s] as the time of
[1447.2s] Noah. What Noah did he traveled with
[1450.5s] faith. Yes. provoked with men and women
[1454.5s] was laughed and people were saying are
[1457.5s] you mad? Have you seen
[1460.2s] rain? It was impossible
[1463.2s] thing but he traveled with faith day by
[1466.6s] day not losing hope but at last he saved
[1471.4s] his pathfinders and his
[1474.0s] adventurers and God desires that we walk
[1477.8s] like that to save our family. Yes, you
[1482.2s] can
[1483.2s] walk with faith, but it will be painful
[1487.6s] if you lose the young
[1491.6s] ones because the question will be where
[1495.1s] are the young ones I gave you.
[1501.9s] Abraham
[1503.4s] traveled to the promised land and when
[1506.8s] he reached there Abraham could not
[1509.7s] settle in the promised land. The Bible
[1512.4s] says that he was dwelling in tents with
[1515.8s] Isaac and
[1517.6s] Jacob but he was in the promised land. I
[1521.6s] don't know if you have
[1523.0s] reached in your life. I don't know if
[1526.0s] you have reached your promised land in
[1528.7s] this side of heaven. I don't know where
[1531.1s] you are but if you have reached your
[1534.0s] promised land then you need to walk in
[1537.0s] tent with your
[1538.7s] children. You need not to settle in one
[1541.4s] place. You need to tell them the wonders
[1544.8s] of God. You need to travel with them
[1547.8s] with faith. Abraham was traveling and
[1551.8s] each station he was building an altar
[1554.9s] for worship and sacrifice.
[1558.6s] And Isaac took that trend and Isaac
[1562.9s] passed it to Jacob. Yes, they were
[1567.3s] called to the promised land. But when
[1569.7s] they reached, they could not
[1573.2s] settle. Abraham was
[1576.0s] wealthy. Abraham could break build for
[1579.4s] God a cathedral.
[1581.6s] Abraham could settle in Kanan Cananan
[1585.1s] and and build a house
[1587.5s] permanent. But the Bible tell us that he
[1590.8s] opted for
[1592.8s] tent. Knowing that he was a pilgrim,
[1596.6s] knowing that he was a passerby, knowing
[1599.0s] that he will travel with
[1602.0s] God but not here until
[1606.4s] eternity. So he could not settle.
[1610.5s] He was a missionary. God is looking for
[1614.2s] you. God is looking for this church that
[1617.4s] we cannot settle in our promised land.
[1621.1s] This this yonder. This is why we need to
[1624.1s] be provoked to
[1626.8s] move to a higher purpose to move to a
[1631.0s] higher calling to
[1633.1s] move to a higher greatness.
[1637.0s] We need not to be contented with where
[1640.2s] we are. We need not to be contented with
[1643.0s] this promised land this
[1645.6s] time. Moses wanted to settle there. But
[1649.5s] God said, Moses, I have a better
[1654.0s] one. We are looking for that better
[1656.7s] land. Because the Bible tell us that all
[1660.0s] these people, yes they traveled with
[1663.0s] faith, died in faith, but they were
[1665.8s] looking for a city, a city that is not
[1669.9s] built by human
[1672.2s] hands. That is where we need to
[1676.1s] focus. And our theme this year
[1681.2s] is be
[1684.7s] not be not be dismayed. Be not be
[1692.4s] troubled. Be not be troubled with the
[1695.3s] cares of the world. Jesus said, "I'm
[1700.1s] going to prepare a place for you." That
[1704.1s] city that his maker he its
[1708.4s] builder is God
[1710.7s] himself. That is where we need to focus.
[1714.9s] That is where we need to travel with
[1717.7s] faith with our children guiding them to
[1721.8s] a city that is not made by human hands.
[1727.5s] I'm looking forward for that city the
[1730.4s] way the pilgrims look forward for that
[1733.4s] city that I want to walk and travel with
[1736.9s] faith and I'm inviting God that every
[1740.3s] stage that I stepped in, I settled in,
[1745.2s] he has established me in. And I want to
[1748.2s] slumber there. I want to feel at ease
[1750.9s] there. I want to feel contented. I want
[1754.3s] to
[1756.1s] fill and attract the pride of
[1760.9s] life, the lust of the body, and the lust
[1765.0s] of the eye. The Bible says those three
[1768.5s] are sins that easily beset us when we
[1771.9s] are in our comfort zone.
[1774.6s] I pray to God that whenever I get into
[1779.0s] that mode that he may send somebody
[1783.1s] something another hand to provoke me to
[1786.8s] another
[1791.4s] level. And
[1796.8s] thus we are
[1801.0s] turning
[1803.7s] to 1 Samuel where our key text
[1812.1s] lies. Faith of our fathers living
[1815.6s] still. We will be true till death.
[1823.9s] that what will be our children's
[1828.2s] fate. Our prayer this
[1831.6s] morning that we travel with faith that
[1835.8s] our children may travel with
[1838.4s] faith that when they will reach the end
[1841.1s] of this
[1842.3s] life they will die in faith like our
[1848.8s] fathers. that when their time will
[1852.1s] reach, maybe when we shall not be there,
[1856.1s] that they be in the hands of God, they
[1858.8s] travel with
[1860.9s] faith. Then when their time
[1863.6s] comes, they die in
[1867.3s] faith. That when my time shall arrive, I
[1870.8s] die in faith. Just like the
[1874.0s] pilgrims, just like our
[1880.0s] fathers, this family of
[1883.1s] Elcana was provoked to a higher
[1888.3s] level.
[1894.0s] Elcana
[1896.8s] Elcana is a man of
[1899.8s] God. If you read the introduction of 1
[1905.5s] Samuel, Samuel is writing about his
[1909.3s] father. He does not give us a lot about
[1913.0s] his father.
[1915.8s] But when we
[1917.6s] received travel with faith, the book is
[1921.4s] 1
[1924.0s] Samuel, I looked into some qualities of
[1930.0s] Elcana. And when I was going
[1932.8s] through, I found that Elcana was a man
[1936.2s] of faith just like
[1938.6s] Abraham. He was a man of faith just like
[1942.2s] Enoch. He was a man of faith just like
[1946.6s] Abel. Though he had his own flaws,
[1950.0s] though he had his own failures, but he
[1953.0s] was also a man of faith provoked to
[1955.8s] travel with faith like others.
[1961.4s] Elcana, the father to Samuel, the first
[1965.4s] pro uh the the one of the
[1968.8s] judges, the first prophet to anoint the
[1972.2s] first king of
[1974.0s] Israel, the father of somebody important
[1977.9s] in the life of
[1979.9s] Israelites. That
[1982.4s] Elcana was a
[1984.3s] Levite. And as a Levite, he was supposed
[1987.5s] to be
[1988.6s] serving God in his
[1992.7s] temple. And as usual, the Levites were
[1997.6s] never given a portion of land in Israel.
[2001.2s] They were told that choose a dwelling
[2003.6s] place. Choose where you can stay and you
[2007.2s] serve God. And especially if you are not
[2010.9s] in retune
[2013.3s] service in the
[2015.4s] temple. So Elcana chose a place in
[2019.5s] Ephraim. Ephraim is in the mountain.
[2022.7s] This is where elites were being buried.
[2026.4s] People like Joshua were buried
[2029.2s] there and other kings were being buried
[2032.5s] in the mountain of Ephraim.
[2035.3s] But this is this was a community of the
[2039.0s] Ephraim, the son of
[2043.5s] Joseph. And I want to connect it with
[2046.5s] the last sermon last
[2049.8s] Sabbath who was which was talking about
[2053.4s] Dan. Dan and Ephraim had something in
[2057.8s] common because Dan and Ephraim they are
[2062.1s] missing in the last list of the gate.
[2067.1s] Though
[2068.8s] Ephraim was having a gate before the
[2072.5s] destruction of Jerusalem before it was
[2075.3s] built again with Nemiah and his team.
[2079.2s] Ephraim. There was a gate of Ephraim,
[2083.3s] but they joined and teamed up with Dan.
[2087.8s] And we learned last Sabbath that Dan was
[2091.9s] excommunicated from the list
[2095.7s] uh of the the children of Israel that
[2099.9s] were numbered and were given a gate
[2102.8s] because he fell into
[2106.4s] idolatry. But not only in idolatry. Uh
[2110.4s] he rebelled against the Israel. The
[2114.1s] Bible says that Dan was like a snake. So
[2117.0s] Ephraim joined with Dan and they were
[2119.9s] like one team. Ephraim also they
[2122.6s] rebelled against God. Ephraim also they
[2125.6s] welcomed idolatry. And this is where
[2129.4s] Elcana chose to
[2132.8s] settle the
[2134.2s] [Music]
[2135.3s] way Lot chose to settle near Sodom. And
[2140.6s] we know that Lot
[2144.7s] lost the young adventurers. Lot lost
[2149.3s] pathfinders. Lord lost his young
[2153.1s] ones by the end of it all.
[2157.0s] This is where Elcana
[2159.9s] also
[2163.4s] settled. And the Bible says that he
[2166.8s] could travel from Ephraim to Shilo. That
[2171.5s] tell us
[2173.8s] that Elcana was a man of means. Elcana
[2178.6s] was
[2179.5s] wealthy. Elcana could afford to embark
[2183.9s] on a pilgrimage.
[2186.9s] If you ask the Muslims, it is a
[2190.2s] mandatory if you are a Muslim to travel
[2192.8s] to
[2193.8s] Mecca. But only those who are of means
[2197.4s] will
[2198.3s] travel. So Elcana was of means to make a
[2202.4s] pilgrimage to travel with faith year
[2206.0s] after year to go to Shilo to offer
[2211.0s] worship and sacrifice to God. Even
[2214.4s] though he set he
[2217.5s] settled in Ephraim, he was
[2221.1s] provoked and he realized his duties.
[2224.9s] Though he fell, but he could still cling
[2228.8s] to the faith of his fathers. Yes, he
[2231.9s] fell by settling in Ephraim. Yes, he
[2239.9s] fell by embracing Ephraim.
[2244.0s] Yes, he fell by neglecting his duty as a
[2248.4s] Levite. Yes, they were to worship and
[2252.6s] sacrifice. They were to be in the
[2254.6s] temple. But Ephraim lost
[2258.2s] that. He lost the privilege to serve. He
[2262.1s] lost the privilege to walk and travel
[2265.4s] with God morning after morning in the
[2268.8s] temple. Like other
[2272.8s] Levites, Elcana
[2275.3s] lost was he he was pushed the
[2280.6s] way Abraham was was
[2285.2s] pushed. He could not
[2288.0s] wait the promised
[2290.5s] seed. He had a
[2294.6s] common
[2296.1s] character with Abraham.
[2299.5s] Abraham also was rich, was
[2303.0s] wealthy, but he was not having an
[2307.5s] heir. Elcana also was wealthy. A
[2311.8s] Levite was in his world, promised land,
[2316.2s] but he was not having an heir.
[2319.9s] And they lived with
[2322.0s] Anna looking for an heir, looking for
[2327.4s] adventurer, looking for a pathfinder,
[2331.5s] looking for a child to match the way
[2334.6s] these adventurers are matching. When it
[2337.8s] travel to Shilo, he could
[2340.8s] desire to hold off
[2343.4s] adventurer. And for a long
[2345.8s] time the Bible tell us that they could
[2348.8s] not get a child because God closed the
[2352.1s] womb of
[2356.1s] Anna and Elcana
[2359.7s] lost the touch with his calling. He lost
[2364.0s] the way. He lost his
[2367.6s] purpose. But at long last, he was
[2371.2s] provoked to realize his calling. He was
[2374.6s] provoked to realize his purpose. He was
[2377.8s] provoked to realize that he can make it
[2381.4s] even though he has fallen. The Bible
[2384.1s] tells and remind us, "Though you have
[2386.6s] fallen seven times, rise up
[2389.6s] again. Lest the spirit of God provoke
[2393.0s] you again to make a fresh start.
[2399.2s] In Lu there is a writing that says chaka
[2402.6s] chaka y just
[2405.2s] start doesn't matter where you will
[2408.0s] start but just start and make a step
[2412.7s] forward and Elcana by faith
[2416.4s] moved yes is he was struggling in the
[2420.4s] family yes he had contracted panina yes
[2425.2s] he had lost hope of having another
[2428.2s] child. So he he contracted Panina to
[2431.3s] bear other
[2432.4s] children. But his hope was still with
[2436.2s] Anna because Anna was a blessing to
[2441.2s] Elcana. And the name Anna means grace.
[2444.1s] When God give you grace, you can never
[2447.4s] switch it for another thing. When God's
[2450.3s] handed hand hands over to you favor, you
[2453.7s] need not to switch
[2455.7s] it. You need not to seek to replace it.
[2460.7s] So
[2462.4s] Elana though Anna was having
[2465.5s] challenges but he said Anna we will walk
[2469.2s] though I will contract another marriage.
[2472.4s] I will contract
[2474.0s] penina but I will walk side by side and
[2477.8s] we will travel to Shilo. We will still
[2481.8s] seek the face of God. We will not lose
[2485.3s] hope. We will not be comfortable that we
[2489.8s] cannot bear a
[2491.5s] child. In the old age they could agree
[2495.0s] with the wife before contracting another
[2498.5s] marriage. It was not like
[2501.6s] today you are with your partner but he's
[2505.0s] having a side chick or she is having a
[2508.4s] side chick without you knowing.
[2513.0s] In the old times, they could sit and
[2516.1s] agree the way Abraham and Sarah did, the
[2521.6s] way
[2522.8s] Jacob
[2524.4s] and
[2526.2s] who they
[2529.0s] agreed, Rachel and the
[2533.3s] rest. But as they were
[2536.0s] traveling, the Bible says that they made
[2539.2s] various trips every year, a trip of
[2541.9s] hope. They were traveling with
[2544.8s] faith. But at long
[2547.2s] last one
[2549.4s] day when the Lord had blessed them with
[2553.3s] children through
[2555.6s] Penina, the Bible tell us that as they
[2559.7s] were worshiping day by day and as they
[2562.6s] were carrying the sacrifice.
[2568.4s] Thank
[2584.1s] you.
[2586.1s] Ellie did not leave Anna. They walked.
[2590.5s] They traveled with faith with
[2593.6s] Anna. And one of the
[2596.4s] occasions they
[2598.4s] reach as they always worship God and
[2602.5s] offer
[2603.5s] sacrifice as they retune and the Bible
[2607.2s] tell us that Ellie was purpose in his
[2611.4s] actions and he could give sacrifice to
[2615.3s] everyone. He could give sacrifice to
[2618.1s] Panina and her
[2620.8s] children. And when it was time for Anna,
[2624.6s] he he could give Anna sacrifice to offer
[2628.0s] and double
[2629.9s] it. And this is where Panina comes in.
[2633.9s] And Panina said, "I don't like this
[2637.9s] routine. I see Anna is
[2642.4s] comfortable. I see Anna losing faith.
[2647.3s] I see Anna not striving to unlock her
[2651.6s] purpose in life. I see a potential in
[2655.2s] Anna but she's sleeping in her potential
[2660.2s] now through
[2661.5s] God. Panina comes in and ask Anna this
[2666.4s] question. You mean you are comfortable
[2670.1s] with a double
[2671.5s] portion of Elcana?
[2674.9s] You mean you are comfortable with this
[2677.4s] that when my children are sacrificing
[2679.8s] and as we have been given a portion a
[2682.6s] time to sacrifice now you are happy
[2685.2s] because Elanak will give you a double
[2689.8s] portion wake
[2691.6s] up you barren woman wake
[2694.8s] up you need to sacrifice with your
[2697.8s] children wake up from
[2701.5s] slumber and the Bible tell
[2705.7s] in verse six that and her
[2711.8s] rival also provoked her
[2715.5s] severely to make her
[2718.2s] miserable because the Lord had closed
[2721.3s] her
[2722.8s] womb. Because the Lord had closed her
[2725.9s] home. You know, God did it for a
[2729.9s] purpose. God did it with a reason. God
[2734.7s] did
[2735.6s] it so that when he comes when when Anaku
[2740.8s] realize his goal and his purpose and his
[2743.4s] mission in life and unlock it, it will
[2746.6s] be a launching
[2748.0s] pad to our
[2750.0s] greatness. Anna will be the bearer of
[2753.9s] Samuel, a child who will judge Israel.
[2758.5s] Anna will give birth to a child that
[2762.3s] will sacrifice on behalf of
[2767.5s] Israel. Do you see you are sleeping on
[2771.3s] your
[2772.1s] potential? Do you see that you need to
[2775.3s] be provoked to travel with f with faith
[2779.0s] in God? Do you
[2781.5s] see that you
[2784.0s] need to be provoked?
[2787.4s] I don't
[2789.0s] know where your where your panina will
[2792.2s] come
[2793.2s] from. I don't know whether he's sitting
[2797.0s] next to you because you know your panina
[2800.7s] can be your husband. Your penina can be
[2803.4s] your wife. Your penina can be your boss.
[2807.5s] Your penina can be that
[2811.2s] person that is your neighbor.
[2815.2s] But God is looking into your life and is
[2820.2s] ready to send Penina your way to unlock
[2823.8s] your
[2825.6s] potential to push you to another level.
[2830.4s] We are
[2831.6s] new as servants of God. And maybe God
[2837.0s] has send us in this church with Panina's
[2840.1s] message that we need to provoke you with
[2843.4s] such messages for you to make right
[2846.0s] decisions for you to choose to
[2850.2s] write to walk right with
[2853.1s] God. For
[2855.3s] you to pick up your responsibility and
[2859.0s] train his children. for you to bring
[2862.2s] your children for
[2864.1s] blessings, for you to help others train
[2868.1s] their
[2869.2s] children. Because if Anna could never be
[2873.4s] provoked, Ellie could not have gotten a
[2876.4s] job to train Samuel.
[2881.0s] If Anna could have not been
[2883.6s] provoked, then there will be no
[2887.8s] person that Ellie could instruct and say
[2892.9s] to a young man, Samuel that when he
[2896.4s] calls, when he
[2898.4s] calls, just say, say yes,
[2902.6s] Lord. When he calls, just say yes, Lord.
[2908.0s] We need early in this
[2912.5s] congregation when our young
[2914.8s] ones will run to and direct them that
[2918.6s] when God calls you. Yes. Adventurer just
[2923.4s] say yes
[2925.8s] Lord. We
[2927.7s] need an elder in this church that when
[2931.4s] the adults run to
[2934.0s] them, then they will direct them to say
[2937.8s] yes to
[2940.0s] God. This is what Anna was sleeping on,
[2946.5s] was contented with it.
[2951.2s] She she had indifferent life but Penina
[2955.8s] was not
[2956.8s] indifferent. Penina had she had to
[2962.2s] speak. She had to provoke her miserably
[2967.9s] so
[2969.6s] that she can come into
[2973.6s] reality. And the Bible tell
[2977.1s] us
[2979.1s] that when she was
[2982.8s] provoked, she stood
[2986.7s] up.
[2988.2s] Anna stood
[2990.6s] up and
[2993.1s] started one step after another to travel
[2997.6s] with faith in God. And after that she
[3001.7s] stood up and she
[3007.1s] went where she will seek the face of
[3011.4s] God. She went where Ellie could see her.
[3016.6s] She went there and kneel before God. She
[3020.9s] wept. She claimed her territory. She
[3024.1s] claimed her promises. She prayed
[3028.1s] vently with
[3032.0s] purpose and the
[3034.0s] Lord had a
[3036.2s] prayer. Lord blessed
[3039.0s] her with
[3044.3s] Samuel. How I
[3047.2s] pray
[3048.9s] that when something is provoking
[3052.7s] you, take it positive.
[3056.4s] Take it
[3057.6s] positive. It can be a window for you to
[3061.4s] another level. When you are not being
[3066.3s] promoted, take it positive. God is
[3069.4s] preparing another level. When you are
[3072.2s] being provoked left and
[3074.3s] right, take it positive. There is
[3077.6s] something that God wants to do in your
[3079.9s] life.
[3082.5s] God can only allow temptations that we
[3085.6s] can overcome to come our way. He will
[3088.8s] never allow any temptation that you
[3091.8s] cannot overcome to come your way. When
[3094.6s] he closed the womb of Anna, God
[3098.1s] knew that
[3100.1s] Anna when provoked she can unlock her
[3104.4s] potential. Any temptation that comes
[3107.8s] your way, know that it is opportunity
[3111.2s] for you to launch to to greatness. It is
[3114.0s] opportunity to realize your purpose. It
[3116.8s] is opportunity to seek divinity. It is
[3120.7s] opportunity to grasp the hands of
[3125.4s] faith. How I pray that we may take it
[3129.4s] positive whenever we are provoked the
[3131.7s] way Anna did.
[3135.8s] And when Samuel was there, the Bible
[3140.2s] tell us that Elcana went to Anna and ask
[3146.1s] Anna, "Anna, can we go to Shilo and
[3150.4s] worship God and sacrifice to him the way
[3153.9s] we used to go?" The Bible says that Anna
[3157.4s] said,
[3158.4s] "No, I will not go.
[3161.8s] I will not travel with you. I will not
[3165.1s] walk side by side with Penina. Yes,
[3170.4s] Panina did something in my life, but I
[3173.6s] will never walk side by side with
[3176.1s] Penina. Give me time. Give me time to
[3180.8s] win my son.
[3183.4s] This is where I call the young parents
[3186.8s] just like me that don't just walk to
[3190.0s] Shilo with Panina without winning your
[3194.0s] son. Without winning your son because if
[3198.0s] you walk to Shilo without winning your
[3202.3s] son, Penina can just inject your son
[3206.0s] with jealousy.
[3208.0s] Penina can teach your son wrong
[3211.2s] teachings. Panina can provoke your son
[3216.2s] to turn his way our way in a negative
[3219.4s] way. This is where we are needed to
[3222.8s] nurture our children first. Parents are
[3226.6s] the first priest. Parents are the first
[3229.5s] teachers.
[3231.7s] Parents are the ones that needs to
[3235.0s] provoke their children not to
[3238.2s] wrath but to
[3241.1s] purpose. Instill in them faith of our
[3245.0s] fathers. When Moses was
[3248.6s] given to the mother before he was
[3253.6s] winded, the mother pumped everything,
[3257.1s] provoked Moses to explained everything
[3261.0s] to
[3262.5s] Moses,
[3265.9s] created a vision and Moses could know
[3270.0s] that these people are our enemies.
[3274.4s] He created she she created jealousy in
[3278.6s] Moses that when Moses came to
[3282.3s] age, he could not live live in the
[3285.9s] palace. This is where we are called as a
[3288.6s] church that let nurture the young ones.
[3292.5s] Let's nurture our adventurers. Let's
[3295.4s] nurture our pathfinders. Let's nurture
[3298.0s] our youths. Some of them may be
[3300.2s] struggling but this is the place to
[3302.6s] nurture
[3303.6s] them. This is the place to cause
[3310.1s] them. I want to pray with someone.
[3317.9s] I want to pray with
[3322.3s] someone that could hold their
[3326.7s] child and
[3329.3s] walk to this altar the way Anna
[3333.2s] did. And when the time was
[3336.7s] ripe, Anna walked with
[3340.0s] Elcana side by
[3343.6s] side and they walked to that
[3347.3s] altar and they brought
[3350.2s] Samuel to God.
[3353.7s] The Bible tell us in Romans
[3357.3s] 12 verse
[3360.0s] one that be a living
[3364.8s] sacrifice. You can hold the hands of
[3368.1s] your son. You can hold the hands of your
[3371.4s] daughter. You can hold the hands of
[3374.1s] somebody and walk them to the
[3377.7s] altar and pray to God. God travel with
[3383.8s] them. Travel with
[3386.3s] them. Walk with them in faith. Travel
[3390.6s] with them, oh Lord, in every
[3392.8s] step. Hold
[3394.8s] them that one
[3397.4s] day they will live for their purpose.
[3401.8s] One day they will make it to a
[3405.7s] city built with God's own hands. I want
[3409.7s] you to just
[3412.8s] hold the hands of your son, your
[3416.1s] daughter, your youth. If there is
[3420.7s] one of your
[3422.8s] blood, walk them to this
[3425.8s] altar. And as you
[3428.7s] come, there are things here. Don't break
[3432.8s] them, but walk into this altar.
[3436.7s] Walk with faith. Travel with purpose.
[3441.3s] May this message provoke you the way it

[3818.1s] and God is looking up to you to provoke
[3823.7s] somebody to spiritual
[3827.2s] breakthrough. Provoking also can mean
[3830.8s] partnering with God
[3833.2s] spiritually to unlock the
[3836.4s] potential of
[3838.9s] somebody.
[3840.6s] Support those around you in their walk
[3844.2s] with God.
[3847.4s] Even if it means
[3850.4s] sacrifice, we want to thank God for his
[3854.8s] faithfulness. The way he has traveled
[3857.8s] with
[3858.6s] you, you are the one who knows the hills
[3862.7s] and the
[3863.9s] valleys. But indeed, you can stand the
[3867.5s] way you are and testify that he is
[3871.1s] Ebenezar.
[3872.9s] this far the Lord has brought you. How I
[3876.5s] pray that commit once again that you
[3880.4s] will travel with faith in God
[3884.7s] until the last breath that you will walk
[3889.1s] with him just like the pilgrims and die
[3893.4s] in faith never to
[3895.6s] depart from faith. But if you have to
[3899.6s] depart that God may bring you
[3902.8s] in with all
[3905.3s] means. Even if bringing
[3909.9s] Panina, may he bring Panina in your life
[3913.4s] to bring you back to the true
[3916.6s] faith. Our loving
[3920.8s] father, we thank you this
[3924.5s] hour as we celebrate 36 years of
[3928.7s] adventure adventuring with
[3931.3s] God. You have traveled with many people
[3934.6s] in their
[3936.0s] lives. The way you
[3938.4s] did to great men of
[3941.2s] faith the way you did to encounter
[3946.4s] family. Lord, you can
[3949.5s] do it to us again. There is nothing new
[3953.7s] under the sun. And
[3956.8s] Lord, we
[3958.9s] pray that truly you can provoke us
[3963.5s] positively that we may travel with faith
[3967.3s] in
[3969.1s] you. Lord, there are
[3971.6s] people who are contented in their
[3975.2s] situation. How I pray that you may push
[3978.8s] them to realize their purpose in life,
[3982.6s] to realize their potential in life.
[3986.0s] And
[3987.6s] Lord, there are
[3990.6s] children that have
[3993.3s] walked into this altar with their
[3997.0s] parents.
[3999.4s] It is a bold
[4000.7s] step that
[4002.8s] Encana and Anna
[4005.2s] did when they took hands of
[4010.5s] Samuel and they brought him into the
[4014.4s] altar and they committed his
[4018.7s] life into your hands. They trusted you
[4023.1s] with the life of Samuel. They believed
[4026.5s] in you that Lord, even if they were
[4029.5s] going back empty
[4031.2s] again, that you will favor them along
[4033.9s] the way. That you will provide again.
[4037.4s] That you will open the womb of honor and
[4041.4s] produce
[4042.4s] again. And indeed, you bless them with
[4046.3s] five children, a symbol of grace again.
[4051.3s] Lord, how I pray that these children may
[4055.4s] be left in your hands and as parents
[4058.2s] will go back, they will go back with
[4061.4s] your favor and everyone as we leave this
[4066.7s] service that Lord, we may be provoked to
[4073.1s] look for a
[4075.4s] city built with God's hands. in Jesus
[4079.9s] name I pray. Amen.
