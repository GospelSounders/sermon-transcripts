We have Henry Mogera who is the secretary and in that committee we also have consultants. We have two consultants. I think one of them is uh not here with us. She'll be coming shortly. Marci and we have Elder Isaac. So members of the council please you can come up front. The strategy of New Life 7th Day Adventist Church marks a significant milestone in our journey of faith and service. This plan is a product of prayerful reflection, broad consultation, and a shared desire to advance God's mission in these end times. It seeks to align our church's ministries with the global mission of the 7th Day Adventist Church and the contextual realities of our community. In developing this plan, we have considered the spiritual, the social, economic, technological dynamics that shape our environment. We have identified the strategic priorities, actionable objectives that will guide our worship, outreach, education, family life, stewardship and the infrastructural development efforts for the church. The document is not an end but a living framework that is designed to inspire, to guide and unify our ministry efforts. It invites every member of our church to be actively involved in God's mission, spreading the everlasting gospel and preparing a people for Christ's soon return. um the elder in charge of the council, Elder Tomura. We appreciate you because of your leadership. Since last year, we have come this far and today the committee is here to share with you the framework that is for sure to advance the mission of New Life SDA church of the I will go ministry. We want to say that we have built on the successes of the previous plans opportunities provided by the existing and future internal environments and the new plan is here today and we want to ask prayerfully as we publicly share it to all of us that we can be able to take it forth, read it and implement with fidelity. Um as a church we have been called to have the clearly inspired plan to make it to make sure that it is communicated publicly and this is the essence of today's dedication. allow me to request the leadership of the church. And we are glad that today we have our incoming pastors to come to be able to um dedicate this strategic plan for the use of God's mission. So I'll ask Pastor Mo, our first elder and the members that I had requested beforehand to come. that is the leader of personal ministries, the leader of uh the Adventist men. Yes, please come. The Adventist women's leader, the children, we have several of them. We have the children, please come. And then we also have the deconet leadership and of course our church cler and um the communications team who have been behind the success of where we are today. Uh without much ado, um as the council just unveils the plan, I want to point out that um you will pastor, you will take this. Uh make a nice line. Make a nice line. And uh pastor, I will come here. I want to mention that this strategic plan has six strategic pillars that will guide us in the next five years. What do we say our theme is strategic 2025 2029 thriving through faith fellowship and mission. We want to present pastor to you from the council and the leadership of the church with the representatives who are here. This is the plan. This is the vision. It is a framework that still we will give members a chance to go through it in the next one month. Then we can conclude so that come July 1, it's a blueprint we'll use for the next four and a half years. Allow me to present it in this way. Thank you. Happy Sabbath, church members. Happy Sabbath again. The Lord is good at all the time. I want to thank the team that has done this immense work for the last few months and probably few uh weeks. This is not easy to come with such a document because it engulfves a lot of stuff that each one of us are going to get hold of and implement in our own ways. I like the fact that the theme says thriving through faith, fellowship, and what mission. The Bible says in Hebrews 11:6, without faith, we cannot please who? God. We are building on the faith of our fathers. And we thank God for the faith principle. Number two, it says fellowship. It says we've got to build ourselves in fellowship as we grow one with another in the various groups that we shall be having in our children, prison ministry, chaplain ministry, our ammo, WM, and all other departments. I believe that fellowship as we spar one another will grow from one level to another. And finally through mission. May I say this brothers and sisters, I'm a mission student. That's what I did in my doctoral studies. That's the place where I will now focus on. My desire is as you come in through that gate, come in as a disciple, go out as a missionary. Did you all hear that? You come in as a what? Disciple. You go out as a what? Missionary. So thank you very much team for making this possible and I'm praying to God that he may give us the favor all of us together and my colleagues who are here I'm going to call them shortly so we all can dedicate this together but as I say this allow me to request all the heads of department to be upstanding kindly all the heads of department please if you could be up on your feet where you are all the heads of department. All right. Thank you very much. And so with the grace of God and with the blessings of God and with the leading of the Holy Spirit, I want now to declare the strategic plan for Fifth Gong Avenue uh New Life 7th Day Adventist Church officially launched. [Music] So this is the document we have here. What do we say church members? Thank you very much. Allow me to call my colleagues, Pastors Elvis and Pastor Polica, we're going to commit it into the Lord in prayer. Uh Pastor Lo, you could join with us, please. Pastor Lo, join with us as we check. Thank you. as we commit this document to the Lord and ask of him put this team together with all of us to put in here that it may be to us from July 1 the blueprint by the which we shall run. So I pray to God that uh as you look at it from our various departments thank you for sitting department heads we'll again put a little bit input panel beat it so that by the time they're bringing us out the final document will have a pedestal by the which we shall be moving forward. May God bless each one of us. Allow me to ask the first elder the elder in charge of strategic department to come up front please and uh sister thank you and yourself elder. Yes. All right. You can put your Bible up front, my elder. Yes. And put your strategic plan on top of it. The Bible says in Proverbs 29, verse 18, where there's no vision, my people do what? Perish. Thank God we have a vision plan here. And our prayer is that God may lead us to fulfilling this to the glory of his name. I'm going to request Pastor Elvis. All right. You'll come up front, pastor. And as we lay our hands on this, the three of us, Pastor Alo and Pastor Polyup, Pastor Elvis will commit this to them in prayer. Our loving father, we thank you this hour and this minute. You are alpha and omega, the beginning and the end. You are not bound with time, but as men we are bound with time. And now Lord, we have launched a strategy for the next five years. And Lord, we know you are already existing in in the end of five year term. Now we request you because you are there that you lead us as a church. We seek the power of the Holy Spirit. Lord, without uh the power of the Holy Spirit, we cannot make it to the end because it was even prudent for heaven for Jesus to go for the release of the Holy Spirit. Father, we seek in humility that the Holy Spirit may take charge and lead us through each step of the way. Father, we thank you for the blood of Jesus. And we seek that precious blood to cover us all as we come in as disciples and we go out as miss missionaries. Lord, we seek thy face as a community of believers. That Lord, let us fellowship together and many will come and to thy fold. Jesus, we know time is nearing. And Lord, we need to commit more to thy gospel. Now bind us with your love, with your unity and love and Lord perseverance and that peace that will help us to cross Jordan when the waters are high. For this we pray in Jesus name. Amen. All right. Thank you very much. Thank you my elder and thank you uh the team. I want to invite us.

[499.8s] Thank you. Happy Sabbath, church

[508.7s] I want to thank the team that has done
[510.9s] this immense work for the last few
[512.9s] months and probably few uh weeks. This
[517.0s] is not easy to come with such a document
[520.6s] because it engulfves a lot of stuff that
[523.7s] each one of us are going to get hold of
[526.7s] and implement in our own ways. I like
[529.4s] the fact that the theme says thriving
[531.9s] through faith, fellowship, and what
[534.6s] mission. The Bible says in Hebrews 11:6,
[537.5s] without faith, we cannot please who?
[540.1s] God. We are building on the faith of our
[543.1s] fathers. And we thank God for the faith
[545.4s] principle. Number two, it says

[561.4s] believe that fellowship as we spar one
[563.6s] another will grow from one level to
[565.4s] another. And finally through mission.
[568.1s] May I say this brothers and sisters, I'm
[570.6s] a mission student. That's what I did in
[572.2s] my doctoral studies. That's the place
[573.8s] where I will now focus on. My desire is
[577.1s] as you come in through that gate, come
[579.4s] in as a disciple, go out as a
[581.8s] missionary.
[583.4s] Did you all hear that? You come in as a
[585.9s] what? Disciple. You go out as a what?
[588.6s] Missionary. So thank you very much team

[776.6s] men we are bound with time. And now
[779.9s] Lord, we have launched a strategy for
[782.6s] the next five years. And Lord, we know
[786.8s] you are already existing in in the end
[790.8s] of five year term.
[793.4s] Now we request you because you are there
[797.1s] that you lead us as a church. We seek
[800.7s] the power of the Holy
[803.2s] Spirit. Lord, without uh the power of
[806.2s] the Holy Spirit, we cannot make it to
[809.1s] the end because it was even prudent for
[813.3s] heaven for Jesus to go for the release
[816.8s] of the Holy Spirit. Father, we seek in
[820.8s] humility that the Holy Spirit may take
[824.3s] charge and lead us through each step of
[827.7s] the way. Father, we thank you for the
[831.0s] blood of Jesus. And we seek that
[833.8s] precious blood to cover us all as we
[837.6s] come in as disciples and we go out as
[841.0s] miss missionaries. Lord, we seek thy
[844.3s] face as a community of believers. That
[848.5s] Lord, let us fellowship together and
[852.2s] many will come and to thy fold. Jesus,
[856.3s] we know time is nearing. And Lord, we
[860.2s] need to commit more to thy gospel. Now
[864.0s] bind us with your love, with your unity
[867.7s] and love and Lord
[870.4s] perseverance and that peace that will
[873.8s] help us to cross Jordan when the waters
[878.5s] are high. For this we pray in Jesus
[881.6s] name. Amen.
[884.6s] All right. Thank you very much. Thank
[885.9s] you my elder and thank you uh the team.
[888.7s] I want to invite us.
