FULL TRANSCRIPT:
[Music] Um, the Lord is good all the time and all the time. The Lord is good. We want to thank God for giving us an opportunity to come back home. It feels nice to come back. Yeah. as your pastor has introduced me. I maybe forgot to say that I'm your one of your former pastors. Yeah, that is very important to note that I'm one of your former pastors. It it feels nice to be a former pastor on your far to be a former. It is it is quite uh humbling to be here once again. uh I don't need to remember so much introducing myself because here is home. New life is home and uh still I know the streets of New Life. So I'm not new to you. uh maybe for the benefit of those who are watching online as pastor said I'm pastor Yanote Ezra uh formerally serving here in your life but now currently serving in Rangai West District having said that in the interest of time I will just go right to our sermon of the hour um our sermon Today is entitled gratitude. Gratitude. Gratitude is our sermon title. Today we read from the book of Proverbs chapter 17 verse 13 uh which says that whoever rewards evil for good. Evil will not depart from his house. Let's pray. Gracious Father, God divine, in the mighty name of our Lord and Savior Christ Jesus, we now invite thy presence in our midst. God, use me as you may sit well that your word may find a further ground in our hearts today. In Christ's name we pray. Amen. Amen. Whoever rewards evil for good, evil will not depart from his house. Allow me say Christians that there is a tendency and a norm of people from all walks of life to reward you or to reward any person with evil after goodness has been served to them. And I'm tempted to say that it can be a human weakness, but it is something that we can learn to outdo. It is something that the Bible clearly speaks against that it is always good. It is Christian to reward good with good. Allow me uh remind ourselves when we hear of the word gratitude because it is a term that we are very much aware of but again living to its standard sometimes it is not in us. Let me remind us that gratitude is a quality of being thankful. Readiness to show appreciation for and to return kindness. And in my submission of this message today, I will consider the book of 1 Samuel chapter 25. The book of 1 Samuel chapter 25. My message will be coming from the first verse up to the 10th verse of the book of 1 Samuel chapter 25. Now as usual I will read for you as you follow with your respective fashions but my fashion of use today is King James version unless announced otherwise. The Bible reads then Samuel died and the Israelites gathered together and remed for him and parted him at his home in Rama. Children of God, the book of First Samuel begins with bad news. It begins with telling us that the servant of the Lord Samuel had died. And you know, death will never and has never been entertained or wellceived in the history of mankind. The Bible goes on saying, "And David arose and went down to the wilderness of Baron." There is a very close relationship between the two events that are happening in the first verse of the book of 1 Samuel chapter 10 where the Bible says that the servant of the Lord Samuel prophet Samuel had died and the Bible says that when Samuel had died then King David but then he was since he has not been crowned as the king of Israel officially. But again, the Bible says that David went to the wilderness of Baron. In the Bible, wilderness experience are characterized by hardship. They are characterized by testing and reliance on God, but also by define encounter and spiritual growth. That is to say that it was a place of both physical and spiritual desolation. Yet also it was a space where God refilled himself and prepared individuals to the next chapter of life. Wilderness is often portrayed as a harsh barren environment where limited resources like food and water are in scars. And in the Bible we have some few examples which I will remind you of though this is not my focus but I will remind you because this finds and forms my basis of the message today. We know and remember that the servant of the Lord Moses after freeing each pit, he spent 40 years in the wilderness of Midian tending sheep. And this was a time of exile and obscurity, but also this was a period and a time that God had to prepare Moses for leadership. We also are reminded of the case of the children of Israel that also when the children of Israel were moving from the land of slavery to the promised land. The Bible is very clear when it says that they spent 40 years in the wilderness. And in the wilderness, they learned to trust upon the Lord's providence. And God was able to provide for them in the wilderness. We are also reminded of the prophet of the Lord by the name prophet Elijah that while facing threats from Jezebel, Elijah fled to the wilderness where he experienced both despair and a divine encounter. He was strengthened by God and met him in a still small voice. We also are reminded of the case of that in the book of Genesis, you know, when he she had been sent away from the family of Abraham, Hegger had also this wilderness experience. But again amidst this particular experience, God was able to provide her. We are also reminded of the case of John the Baptist that when John the Baptist began his ministry, we all know that he also began it from the wilderness. That's why we hear of the phrases like the voice of the one calling in the wilderness make the way of the Lord straight. Second, last we are also aware of the case of Christ Jesus that when Jesus Christ began his earthly ministry also he began it from the wilderness where you know uh for 40 days and nights in the wilderness fasting and being tempted by the by Satan. This experience prepared Christ Jesus you know for his ministry. And lastly, my point of focus and interest, King David. That during the time of vegetative, King David spent time in the wilderness of Judea, escaping from his son Abselum and running away from the rage of King Saul. You know children of God, it becomes so awkward and so weird when a father runs away from his son. Why? Because the son is after the life of his father. Now children of God, something that I want us to take home from here is that children of God, there is always situations in our life which might be more or less like the wilderness experiences that I've just mentioned here. But but again, the good news we find here is that God was able to lead them. The presence of the Lord always was with them in the wilderness. That is why the book of Isaiah chapter 41 and verse 8 says, "I the Lord will open livers in high places and a fountain in the midst of Faris. I'll make the wilderness a pool of water and the dry land a spring of water as well." Meaning that even when these servants of the Lord and even when Christ Jesus himself was in the wilderness, the presence of God was there with them. Let me take you back to where we are supposed to be. The second verse 1st Samuel chapter 25 the Bible says and there was a man in me whose possession were in Camel and the man was great and very rich. and he heard 3,000 sheep and a thousand goats. Bible goes on saying and he was sharing his sheep in coming. If you forget everything that I have spoken of here, don't forget this statement because our entire sermon is here. Let me repeat that. and he was sharing his ship in coming. Child of God, the choice choice of words in this particular verses is just intentional. The Bible begins by saying that uh uh this man by the name Nebal, you know, he was very rich. And there is a very close connection between richness and arrogance and not forgetting pride. That is why when you find people are doing well in terms of what they possess, if they are not proud then they are arrogant. Bible goes on saying that uh this man was doing sheep sharing in K. Child of God. Let me remind you that even during the time of Christ Jesus, you remember when the disciples of Christ Jesus came to him and they were like Jesus, you know, uh when Jesus had rebuked, you know, the young man who came to him and asking him this question that master what thing must I do to inhale eternal life. Then Jesus Christ gave him the prerequisite of attaining eternal life. Then the discussion goes on and on. Then at some point the disciples then came to him and asked this question then Jesus who will be saved. But again prior to that Jesus made a statement by saying that it is difficult you know it is easier for the camel to go through the needle's eye than the rich man going where to heaven maybe something of another day but again Jesus was very categorical here but again I want to remind you that there's is also something that King Solomon speaks of richness, pride and arrogance. The book of Proverbs chapter 31 where King Solomon knew the danger of richness if not watched out. You know, get me right here because some of you may come out of this this church and say, "Pastor was preaching against richness. No, no, no, no, no. I want also to be rich. But again, I'm forming a point here by saying that when richness are not kept under check, there is a danger if not watched out properly. So proverb, you know, uh Solomon because he knew this, he came and wrote some beautiful lines in verse 8 and verse 9 of Proverbs chapter 30 where he says, "Lord, remove far from me and rise." And he says, "Give me neither poverty nor riches. Feed me with food convenient for me." Praise the Lord. You know there are prayers that I find in the inspired word of God that I feel so excited about. Like it is somebody who knew that if what he possessed was not blessed within reach then it can be the beginning of his downfall. He goes on verse 9 and says, "Rest I be full and deny you and say, who is the Lord? Oh, lest I be poor and steal and take the money and take the name of God in vain." You know, you know, poverty is a party thing. That is why King Solomon knew to say that God kindly puts and place me within check. Don't make me poor nor make me too rich because I may forget you. Back to where we are supposed to be. The third verse of 1 Samuel chapter 29. Babel says, "Now the name of the man was Nebal, and the name of his wife was Abigail, and she was a woman of good understanding and of a beautiful countenance, but the man was harsh and evil in his doing, and he was from the house of color." The Bible is trying to paint more car and a more picture of who Nebal was. The Bible says that this man Nebal was a man who was coming from the house of Kalb. You know the name Kalb as we know it from the old scriptures. Calb was a man of good reputation. You remember when spies were needed to go and spy the land of Canaan, it was only Calab amongst the others who brought a good report. So the Bible is saying that Nepal was not only rich. Nepal was not only arrogant, harsh and evil in his dream but Nebal was also coming from the household of Calip. You know this one changes everything here. Let me let me let me come closer to us by saying this. You know the families where we come from there is family norms and there are some behaviors which you cannot expect to find in some families. I beg you a bon here. The way our family have been brought up, there are some behaviors. I don't know what what are some of the behaviors which are known in your family. There are families which are known to be extremely ordered and there are family which are known to be chaotic and there are there are some peers when you hear them being mentioned of then a certain family comes to your mind. Bible says that this man was from the house of Kum. Emmy said that it was not expected of Nebal anyway, you know, to be a man who was extremely harsh, a man who was evil because of the family where Nebal was coming from. There's a song we were singing here saying that we are a family. Praise the Lord. I was reminding some pastors by telling them you know those who don't hear you will see me after this that's a church member is one meaning you cannot separate church members when we sing that we are a family then this tells us as a family there are norms. There is a way we are supposed to do things and there is a way we are supposed to behave. So when a member of our family misperfs then that change the name of our family. Children of God let me remind you that Adventism is a family. Advent is a family. Bible goes on saying that and David heard in the wilderness that Nebal did she share his sheep. And David sent out 10 men, 10 young men. And David said unto the young men, get you up to Camel and go to Neba and greet him in my name. goes on saying, "And thus say to him that liveth in prosperity that peace be to you and the peace be to your house and the peace be unto all that you possess." you know uh human beings I don't know whether this god-given ability but when when we want some privileges when we want some some favors from somebody we know how to appease. So, King David, you know, heard that Nebal was shearing his sheep. And remember where I began from by saying that King David was in the wilderness. And I told you that there are some characteristics that you expect to find in the wilderness. And one of them in the wilderness there is no life. In the wilderness there is no water and in the wilderness there is no food. So the servant of the Lord David finds himself in the wilderness. And I'm tempted to say that the move of David I suspect was informed by anger that was in the wilderness. You you guys have you ever suffered some hunger? You know there are some things I may be preaching from here and to some of you can be something that you have never experienced. Let me let me say that hunger is bad. Verse seven, Bible says, "Now I've heard that you have shears us. Remember your shepherds were with us, and we did not heard them, nor was there anything missing from them all the while they were in. Ask your young men and they will tell you, "Therefore, let my young men find favor in your eyes. For we come on a feast day. Please give whatever comes to your hand, to your servant, and to your son David." You know, David is doing a perfect timing. And remember, I've told you that the move that David did from the wilderness of Baron, it it is a move that I suspect was informed by anger. So you know David comes through his young men and comes to Nebal and you know he he he gives Abraham he gives some introduction you know some rhiness which will enable Nebal to have some favor upon the servant of the Lord. And you know he tells him you know remember Nebal when you are young men who are in the wilderness we did them justice. When you are young men who are taking care of your sheep in the wilderness we serve them justice. And he tells him that this is a time to pay back. He says, "A time to pay back had come. An opportunity to do good." But what does Nebal did? Children of God, let me say that things which happens in God's children and per say in your life, there is some goodness that will ever come to your life. But there is always a time to pay back. Listen to what this man says here. Verse 10. And when David is young man came to speak to Neb according to all these words in the name of David and ceased. And Nebal asked answered David his servants and said, "Who is David? And who is the son of Jesse? There be many servants nowadays that break away every man from his master. Shall I then take my bread and my water and my flesh and have that have killed for my shears and give it unto men that I don't know where they are coming from. Child of God, there is some arrogance here which is being seasoned with pride. Get me right. There are some responses you may give to somebody even if they are too religious, even if they are too holy. that will generate some negative respons. You know the Bible is very clear by saying that David was the servant of the Lord. But again here what Nabal is responding to David. You know sometimes we are tempted to think and say that as long as you are Christian you can pay any form of mistreatment. But again I'm finding David here being agitated by the response given by the carous man by the name Neb. And he's asking you know who is Neba? You know who is David and who is the son of Jesse. Let me let me let me Christian paint a picture here briefly a picture uh of sheep sharing. Maybe this will probably make us understand more what I'm trying to illustrate here. That ship sharing in the Bible times was a very significant event both socially and economically and it was also a time of feasting and celebration. The Bible leverances sharing as a time when people often gathered and often in following hospitality and in following feasting. Additionally, ship sharing served as a powerful metaphor in scripture representing submission, representing sacrifice, representing the severed frog relationship. So this was not just ship sharing but again it had a lot of you know uh significance attached to this. It also exited some love and some care amongst God's people. So the book of 1st Samuel chapter 25 we find Neb sharing his sheep in camel and David now is sending his messengers to receive some some hospitality to receive some food. This was also a moment which could easily generate conflict as we see also in this particular chapter. But let me let me take you a notch higher by saying that sheep sharing also pointed to the frog shepherd relationship. The imagery of the sheep and the shepherd is preferent in the Bible. I writing the relationship between God and his people and Jesus as the good shepherd. That is why the Bible says in the book of John chapter 10 and verse 11 that I am the good shepherd. The good shepherd giveth his life for the folk. Let me go to verse 10 which said, "And Nebal answered David and said, who is David and who is the son of Jesse?" Child of God, let me say that I am sure that David must have been driven by hunger from him to for him to come to Baran requesting for food. But Near's response is quite unreasonable. Child of God, let me say that hunger is a is a party thing and it can make you go to places where you could not have gone. Anger as well can cause you to do things you could not have done. David's revenge mission in the 13th verse of this particular chapter you know all informs us that the move that David took was agitated by the response that Nebal gave and anger can cause some people to enter into some quagmas which cannot be explained why they are there as Christians. Why? Because David was a servant of the Lord anyway. And David was not expected to launch out a revenge mission to Nebat. But again because of the agitation of this man David moved out. Child of God, in the world where we live today, all around us, even including the child of God, I see and experience the spirit of Nebal today that David here in this particular discourse serves here to represent God. He serves here to represent God and his goodness. to humanity. And Nebal in this particular context here stands to represent the response of mankind towards the goodness of the Lord. But again here a character that is not my focus today. Abigail who stands here to represent the mission that Jesus Christ always does in trying to unite unreasonable mankind and listenable Christians who are too busy to pay goodness with goodness. That is why the book of 2 Timothy chapter 3 serves to remind us that but know this that in the last days it will be various times. For men will be lovers of themselves. Men will be lovers of many. Men will be posters. Men will be proud. Men will be you know uh you know uh disobedient to their parents. But more importantly where my focus here is men will be unthankful. Unthankful child of God. The song that we find in the book of Isaiah chapter 5 and verse four tells it all that God has done all to us. But my question here today is how has been our lepos? If today you were given an opportunity to count the goodness of the Lord to count how many times God has been too good to you children of God it is numerous times but again how has been our response. The fourth verse of Isaiah chapter 5 says that what more could I have done to my vineard that I have not done to it? Why then when I expected it to bring forth good grapes did it bring forth what kind of grapes? Wild grapes. children, child of God, as neighbor more than once we have served God with disgrace. We have served God with a lot of unkindness. You know, in you know, in relation to what God has done to us. But do you remember and know that the devil always is in need of us? that the devil is fighting day and night to have you. One of the book of first Peter 5:8 says that be sober and be vigant because you are divers. The devil walks about like a roaring lion seeking whom to devil. I wish we knew that we are the target of the devil. That is why also in the book of Luke chap 22:31 you know Jesus comes to Simon and tells him Simon Simon you know the devil is in need of you but I have prayed for you that your faith does what faith not and he says that when you are converted strengthen your brothers. Let me say that children of God in church and outside church we are the target of the enemy. We are the target of the enemy now. New life the nine levers in the book of Luke chapter 17 who came to Jesus to say thank you and extend their gratitude for hearing their leprosy. Today we your former pastors stand here today in solidarity with them and against the spirit of Nebal and say thank you New life for the respect and love that you expressed to us during our pastoral service here in New Life. We say thank you for giving us a platform as pastor Haro you come for giving us a platform to exercise our pastoral calling today we say thank you new life for opening your doors for us to visit with you and pray with you today new life we say thank you for the support the care and the help you gave us today.

May now this be your experience as a church and as a leadership of this church. In the name of God the Father, God the Son, and God the Holy Ghost. Fair thee well new life. I request my colleague pastor to over a closing prayer. Uh what do you say? We are saying what? Thank you. I will request the entire church to be up on feet even as we we pray together. Let us pray.

But above all, Lord, may you prepare us your soon return that when you shall come the second time, all of us will be able to exclaim this is our Lord. We have waited for him. As we begin the PCM today, we have powerful messages in the afternoon from 3 to 5. Father, I'm praying that this powerful week will draw your children closer to you than before. If anyone is sick, Father, they are healed in Jesus name. If anyone is discouraged, Father, their hopes are restored in Jesus' name. If there's someone going through a painful divorce experience, bring this to a stop in Jesus' name because you are a powerful God. Keep us together. Help us to hold hands together. Help us to pray for one another. Help us, Jesus, to visit one another. Help us to speak kind words to one another because Lord, you desire that your children will be forever united. I'm pretty looking forward to that time when every child here, a young person here, women in this church, men in this church will see the sky open and the son of man will come down and all of us will say hallelujah because the savior has come down. Be with us now and forever for I plead in Jesus name. Amen. [Music]

[39.6s] Yeah, that is very important to note
[41.8s] that I'm one of your former pastors. It
[45.0s] it feels nice to be a former pastor
[48.8s] on your far to be a former.
[52.2s] It is it is quite uh humbling to be here
[55.0s] once again.
[57.0s] uh I don't need to remember so much
[59.4s] introducing myself because here is home.
[62.8s] New life is home and uh still I know the
[68.1s] streets of New Life.
[70.6s] So I'm not new to you.
[73.6s] uh maybe for the benefit of those who
[75.9s] are watching online as pastor said I'm
[78.8s] pastor Yanote Ezra
[81.4s] uh formerally serving here in your life
[84.8s] but now currently serving in Rangai West
[88.1s] District
[91.0s] having said that in the interest of time
[94.6s] I will just go right to our sermon of
[98.2s] the hour
[101.3s] um our sermon Today is entitled
[105.7s] gratitude.
[107.2s] Gratitude.
[110.2s] Gratitude is our sermon title. Today
[116.9s] we read from the book of Proverbs
[120.1s] chapter 17 verse 13
[123.6s] uh which says that whoever
[126.6s] rewards evil for good.
[130.4s] Evil will not depart from his house.
[136.8s] Let's pray. Gracious Father, God divine,
[139.8s] in the mighty name of our Lord and
[141.3s] Savior Christ Jesus,
[143.6s] we now invite thy presence in our midst.

[157.4s] pray. Amen. Amen.
[159.8s] Whoever rewards evil for good, evil will
[163.6s] not depart from his house.
[167.4s] Allow me say Christians that there is a
[170.6s] tendency
[172.2s] and a norm of
[175.8s] people from all walks of life
[179.4s] to reward you or to reward any person
[184.3s] with evil after goodness has been served
[189.0s] to them.
[192.4s] And I'm tempted to say that it can be a
[195.4s] human weakness, but it is something that
[198.6s] we can learn to
[202.0s] outdo. It is something that the Bible
[205.4s] clearly speaks against
[207.9s] that it is always good.
[211.1s] It is Christian
[213.5s] to reward good with good.
[219.7s] Allow me uh remind ourselves when we
[223.1s] hear of the word gratitude because it is
[225.7s] a term that we are very much aware of
[229.8s] but again living to its standard
[232.5s] sometimes it is not
[235.8s] in us.
[237.8s] Let me remind us that gratitude
[240.6s] is a quality of being thankful.
[245.8s] Readiness to show appreciation
[248.8s] for and to return kindness.
[258.1s] And in my submission of this message
[260.4s] today, I will consider the book of 1
[264.2s] Samuel chapter 25.
[268.6s] The book of 1 Samuel chapter 25.
[272.8s] My message will be coming from the first
[275.4s] verse up to the 10th verse of the book
[279.1s] of 1 Samuel chapter 25.
[284.3s] Now as usual I will read for you as you
[287.8s] follow with your respective fashions but
[291.1s] my fashion of use today is King James
[294.9s] version unless announced otherwise. The
[298.1s] Bible reads then Samuel died
[301.8s] and the Israelites gathered together and
[304.3s] remed for him and parted him at his home
[308.7s] in Rama.
[311.8s] Children of God, the book of First
[313.7s] Samuel begins with bad news.
[319.1s] It begins with telling us that the
[322.3s] servant of the Lord Samuel had died.
[327.4s] And you know, death will never and has
[330.6s] never been entertained or wellceived
[335.3s] in the history of mankind.
[339.0s] The Bible goes on saying, "And David
[341.7s] arose and went down to the wilderness of
[345.6s] Baron."
[347.4s] There
[349.1s] is a very close relationship between the
[353.0s] two events that are happening in the
[356.0s] first verse of the book of 1 Samuel
[358.7s] chapter 10 where the Bible says that the
[361.9s] servant of the Lord Samuel prophet
[365.4s] Samuel had died
[368.1s] and the Bible says that when Samuel had
[370.5s] died then King David but then he was
[374.0s] since he has not been crowned as the
[376.9s] king of Israel officially. But again,
[378.9s] the Bible says that David went to the
[382.3s] wilderness of Baron.
[385.6s] In the Bible, wilderness experience
[389.2s] are characterized by hardship.
[393.0s] They are characterized by testing
[396.9s] and reliance on God,
[400.2s] but also by define encounter and
[404.8s] spiritual growth.
[407.1s] That is to say that it was a place of
[410.9s] both physical and spiritual desolation.
[416.1s] Yet also
[418.5s] it was a space where God refilled
[421.8s] himself and prepared individuals to the
[426.2s] next chapter of life.
[430.7s] Wilderness is often portrayed as a harsh
[435.0s] barren environment where limited
[438.0s] resources like food and water
[442.5s] are in scars.
[446.4s] And in the Bible we have some few
[449.6s] examples which I will remind you of
[451.9s] though this is not my focus but I will
[455.5s] remind you because this finds and forms
[458.2s] my basis of the message today.
[461.7s] We know and remember that the servant of
[464.0s] the Lord Moses after freeing each pit,
[467.8s] he spent 40 years in the wilderness of
[471.1s] Midian tending sheep. And this was a
[475.7s] time of exile and obscurity,
[479.9s] but also this was a period and a time
[484.6s] that God had to prepare Moses for
[488.6s] leadership.
[492.8s] We also are reminded of the case of the
[496.3s] children of Israel
[499.0s] that also when the children of Israel
[501.0s] were moving from the land of slavery to
[504.4s] the promised land. The Bible is very
[506.7s] clear when it says that they spent 40
[510.2s] years in the wilderness.
[513.4s] And in the wilderness, they learned to
[517.5s] trust upon the Lord's providence.
[520.9s] And God was able to provide for them in
[525.0s] the wilderness.
[527.2s] We are also reminded of the prophet of
[530.6s] the Lord by the name prophet Elijah
[534.4s] that while facing threats from Jezebel,
[539.7s] Elijah fled to the wilderness where he
[543.2s] experienced both despair and a divine
[547.0s] encounter.
[548.7s] He was strengthened by God and met him
[553.0s] in a still small voice.
[557.4s] We also are reminded of the case of
[561.4s] that in the book of Genesis, you know,
[565.0s] when he she had been sent away from the
[569.0s] family of Abraham, Hegger had also this
[573.4s] wilderness experience. But again amidst
[576.7s] this particular experience, God was able
[580.2s] to provide her.
[582.9s] We are also reminded of the case of John
[586.0s] the Baptist
[587.8s] that when John the Baptist began his
[590.7s] ministry, we all know that he also began
[594.4s] it from the wilderness.
[596.7s] That's why we hear of the phrases like
[599.0s] the voice of the one calling in the
[602.1s] wilderness make the way of the Lord
[606.2s] straight.
[608.2s] Second, last we are also aware of the
[611.3s] case of Christ Jesus that when Jesus
[614.4s] Christ began his earthly ministry also
[617.6s] he began it from the wilderness
[623.3s] where you know uh for 40 days and nights
[627.8s] in the wilderness fasting and being
[630.6s] tempted by the by Satan. This experience
[634.6s] prepared Christ Jesus you know for his
[638.2s] ministry.
[640.9s] And lastly, my point of focus and
[643.5s] interest, King David.
[647.4s] That during the time of vegetative,
[651.6s] King David spent
[654.1s] time in the wilderness of Judea,
[658.0s] escaping from his son Abselum and
[663.3s] running away from the rage of King Saul.
[668.4s] You know children of God, it becomes so
[670.6s] awkward and so weird when a father runs
[675.8s] away from his son. Why? Because the son
[680.0s] is after the life of his father.
[685.0s] Now children of God, something that I
[687.2s] want us to take home from here is that
[690.7s] children of God, there is always
[692.6s] situations in our life which might be
[697.9s] more or less like the wilderness
[701.4s] experiences that I've just mentioned
[704.0s] here.
[705.7s] But but again, the good news we find
[708.0s] here is that God was able to lead them.
[713.0s] The presence of the Lord always was with
[716.2s] them in the wilderness.
[718.5s] That is why the book of Isaiah chapter
[721.0s] 41 and verse 8 says, "I the Lord will
[725.8s] open livers in high places and a
[729.5s] fountain in the midst of Faris. I'll
[733.0s] make the wilderness a pool of water and
[736.2s] the dry land a spring of water as well."
[741.3s] Meaning that even when these servants of
[744.5s] the Lord and even when Christ Jesus
[747.8s] himself was in the wilderness, the
[751.0s] presence of God was there with them.
[756.0s] Let me take you back to where we are
[757.8s] supposed to be. The second verse 1st
[761.6s] Samuel chapter 25 the Bible says and
[765.0s] there was a man in me
[768.2s] whose possession were in Camel
[771.8s] and
[773.6s] the man was great
[778.9s] and very rich.
[781.7s] and he heard 3,000 sheep and a thousand
[787.3s] goats.
[789.5s] Bible goes on saying and he was sharing
[794.4s] his sheep in coming. If you forget
[797.0s] everything that I have spoken of here,
[799.0s] don't forget this statement because our
[801.8s] entire sermon is here. Let me repeat
[804.7s] that. and he was sharing his ship in
[808.8s] coming.
[812.2s] Child of God, the choice choice of words
[816.7s] in this particular verses is just
[819.8s] intentional. The Bible begins by saying
[822.4s] that uh uh this man by the name Nebal,
[829.9s] you know, he was very rich.
[833.8s] And there is a very close connection
[836.4s] between richness
[839.6s] and arrogance
[841.8s] and not forgetting pride.
[845.0s] That is why when you find people are
[847.4s] doing well in terms of what they
[850.5s] possess, if they are not proud then they
[854.7s] are arrogant.
[857.4s] Bible goes on saying that uh
[862.2s] this man was doing sheep sharing in K.
[867.8s] Child of God. Let me remind you that
[869.8s] even during the time of Christ Jesus,
[872.6s] you remember when the disciples of
[875.4s] Christ Jesus came to him and they were
[879.6s] like Jesus, you know, uh when Jesus had
[882.9s] rebuked, you know, the young man who
[885.9s] came to him and asking him this question
[888.5s] that master what thing must I do to
[891.8s] inhale eternal life. Then Jesus Christ
[895.0s] gave him the prerequisite of attaining
[899.2s] eternal life. Then the discussion goes
[901.8s] on and on. Then at some point the
[904.6s] disciples then came to him and asked
[907.8s] this question then Jesus who will be
[911.3s] saved. But again prior to that Jesus
[914.2s] made a statement by saying that it is
[917.0s] difficult
[919.2s] you know it is easier for the camel to
[923.0s] go through the needle's eye
[926.2s] than the rich man going where to heaven
[932.0s] maybe something of another day but again
[936.6s] Jesus was very categorical here but
[939.8s] again I want to remind you that there's
[942.0s] is also something that King Solomon
[944.4s] speaks of richness, pride and arrogance.
[951.7s] The book of
[954.9s] Proverbs chapter 31 where King Solomon
[959.5s] knew the danger of richness
[962.6s] if not watched out. You know, get me
[964.8s] right here because some of you may come
[966.6s] out of this this church and say, "Pastor
[969.2s] was preaching against richness.
[971.8s] No, no, no, no, no. I want also to be
[973.8s] rich. But again, I'm forming a point
[977.4s] here by saying that when richness are
[981.3s] not kept under check, there is a danger
[986.1s] if not watched out properly. So proverb,
[989.7s] you know, uh Solomon because he knew
[991.8s] this, he came and wrote some beautiful
[994.7s] lines in verse 8 and verse 9 of Proverbs
[998.4s] chapter 30 where he says, "Lord,
[1002.0s] remove far from me and rise." And he
[1007.0s] says, "Give me neither poverty nor
[1010.8s] riches.
[1012.4s] Feed me with food convenient for me."
[1016.1s] Praise the Lord. You know there are
[1018.2s] prayers that I find in the inspired word
[1022.2s] of God that I feel so excited about.
[1025.8s] Like it is somebody who knew that if
[1029.0s] what he possessed was not blessed within
[1032.8s] reach then it can be the beginning of
[1036.3s] his downfall. He goes on verse 9 and
[1039.0s] says, "Rest I be full and deny you and
[1044.2s] say, who is the Lord? Oh, lest I be poor
[1048.9s] and steal and take the money and take
[1052.5s] the name of God in vain."
[1055.8s] You know, you know, poverty is a party
[1058.0s] thing.
[1060.6s] That is why King Solomon knew to say
[1063.3s] that God kindly puts and place me within
[1068.0s] check. Don't make me poor nor make me
[1072.8s] too rich because I may
[1076.0s] forget you. Back to where we are
[1077.9s] supposed to be. The third verse of 1
[1080.8s] Samuel chapter 29.
[1083.2s] Babel says, "Now the name of the man was
[1087.6s] Nebal, and the name of his wife was
[1090.7s] Abigail, and she was a woman of good
[1094.2s] understanding and of a beautiful
[1097.0s] countenance, but the man was harsh and
[1101.6s] evil in his doing, and he was from the
[1106.1s] house of color."
[1108.3s] The Bible is trying to paint more car
[1112.2s] and a more picture of who Nebal was. The
[1115.9s] Bible says that this man Nebal was a man
[1120.5s] who was coming from the house of Kalb.
[1124.6s] You know the name Kalb as we know it
[1126.6s] from the old scriptures. Calb was a man
[1130.2s] of good reputation. You remember when
[1134.1s] spies were needed to go and spy the land
[1137.7s] of Canaan, it was only Calab amongst the
[1142.9s] others who brought a good report.
[1146.3s] So the Bible is saying that Nepal was
[1149.8s] not only rich.
[1152.6s] Nepal was not only arrogant, harsh and
[1157.3s] evil in his dream but Nebal was also
[1161.9s] coming from the household of Calip. You
[1165.0s] know this one changes everything here.
[1168.2s] Let me let me let me come closer to us
[1170.0s] by saying this. You know the families
[1173.3s] where we come from there is family norms
[1177.8s] and there are some behaviors which you
[1180.3s] cannot
[1182.2s] expect to find in some families. I beg
[1185.7s] you a bon here.
[1188.6s] The way our family have been brought up,
[1192.3s] there are some behaviors. I don't know
[1195.0s] what what are some of the behaviors
[1197.2s] which are known in your family. There
[1200.4s] are families which are known to be
[1202.2s] extremely ordered and there are family
[1205.2s] which are known to be chaotic and there
[1208.6s] are there are some peers
[1212.1s] when you hear them being mentioned of
[1214.9s] then a certain family comes to your
[1216.8s] mind.
[1219.3s] Bible says that this man was from the
[1222.1s] house of Kum. Emmy said that it was not
[1225.9s] expected of Nebal anyway, you know, to
[1230.3s] be a man who was extremely harsh,
[1235.1s] a man who was evil because of the family
[1239.8s] where Nebal was coming from.
[1246.6s] There's a song we were singing here
[1248.4s] saying that we are a family. Praise the
[1250.8s] Lord. I was reminding some pastors by
[1253.9s] telling them you know
[1258.4s] those who don't hear
[1260.9s] you will see me after this
[1264.2s] that's a church member is one
[1268.2s] meaning you cannot separate church
[1270.8s] members
[1273.8s] when we sing that we are a family then
[1277.3s] this tells us as a family there are
[1280.9s] norms.
[1282.6s] There is a way we are supposed to do
[1286.7s] things and there is a way we are
[1288.8s] supposed to behave. So when a member of
[1292.3s] our family misperfs
[1294.7s] then that change the name of our family.
[1298.8s] Children of God let me remind you that
[1300.6s] Adventism is a family.
[1304.2s] Advent is a family. Bible goes on saying
[1307.7s] that
[1309.4s] and David heard in the wilderness that
[1312.0s] Nebal did she share his sheep.
[1316.8s] And David sent out 10 men,
[1320.6s] 10 young men. And David said unto the
[1324.4s] young men, get you up to Camel and go to
[1329.4s] Neba and greet him in my name. goes on
[1334.2s] saying, "And thus say to him that liveth
[1338.8s] in prosperity
[1340.9s] that peace be to you and the peace be to
[1345.4s] your house and the peace be unto all
[1349.0s] that you possess." you know uh human
[1352.6s] beings I don't know whether this
[1354.5s] god-given ability but when when we want
[1357.4s] some privileges
[1359.5s] when we want some
[1362.2s] some favors from somebody we know how to
[1365.5s] appease.
[1367.7s] So, King David, you know, heard that
[1371.9s] Nebal was shearing his sheep.
[1376.8s] And remember where I began from by
[1379.4s] saying that King David was in the
[1382.2s] wilderness. And I told you that there
[1385.2s] are some characteristics that you expect
[1388.7s] to find in the wilderness. And one of
[1391.5s] them in the wilderness there is no life.
[1395.1s] In the wilderness there is no water and
[1398.2s] in the wilderness there is no food.
[1403.0s] So the servant of the Lord David finds
[1406.2s] himself in the wilderness. And I'm
[1409.4s] tempted to say that the move of David I
[1413.0s] suspect was informed by anger that was
[1417.9s] in the wilderness.
[1422.5s] You you guys have you ever suffered some
[1425.8s] hunger?
[1429.4s] You know there are some things I may be
[1431.5s] preaching from here and to some of you
[1434.4s] can be something that you have never
[1436.1s] experienced.
[1438.0s] Let me let me say that hunger is bad.
[1448.4s] Verse seven, Bible says,
[1451.8s] "Now I've heard that you have shears us.
[1456.8s] Remember your shepherds were with us,
[1461.2s] and we did not heard them, nor was there
[1465.4s] anything missing from them all the while
[1469.5s] they were in.
[1471.9s] Ask your young men and they will tell
[1474.6s] you, "Therefore, let my young men find
[1479.3s] favor in your eyes. For we come on a
[1483.5s] feast day.
[1486.3s] Please give whatever comes to your hand,
[1490.6s] to your servant, and
[1494.0s] to your son David."
[1497.5s] You know, David is doing a perfect
[1500.6s] timing.
[1503.0s] And remember, I've told you that the
[1506.2s] move that David did from the wilderness
[1509.4s] of Baron,
[1511.2s] it it is a move that I suspect was
[1514.4s] informed by anger. So you know David
[1517.6s] comes through his young men and comes to
[1523.0s] Nebal and you know he he he gives
[1526.2s] Abraham he gives some introduction
[1529.4s] you know some rhiness which will enable
[1533.2s] Nebal to have some favor upon the
[1536.3s] servant of the Lord. And you know he
[1538.6s] tells him you know remember Nebal when
[1541.8s] you are young men who are in the
[1544.1s] wilderness we did them justice.
[1548.1s] When you are young men who are taking
[1550.8s] care of your sheep in the wilderness we
[1555.1s] serve them justice.
[1557.8s] And he tells him that this is a time to
[1562.2s] pay back.
[1564.6s] He says, "A time to pay back had come.
[1569.7s] An opportunity to do good."
[1576.7s] But what does Nebal did?
[1580.2s] Children of God, let me say that things
[1583.7s] which happens in God's children and per
[1587.8s] say in your life,
[1589.9s] there is some goodness that will ever
[1592.6s] come to your life.
[1595.1s] But there is always a time to pay back.
[1601.0s] Listen to what this man says here. Verse
[1603.8s] 10. And when David is young man came to
[1607.1s] speak to Neb according to all these
[1609.6s] words in the name of David and ceased.
[1612.0s] And Nebal asked
[1614.5s] answered David his servants and said,
[1617.7s] "Who is David?
[1620.9s] And who is the son of Jesse?
[1624.5s] There be many servants nowadays that
[1628.2s] break away every man from his master.
[1632.6s] Shall I then take my bread and my water
[1635.5s] and my flesh and have that have killed
[1639.3s] for my shears and give it unto men that
[1642.7s] I don't know where they are coming from.
[1647.0s] Child of God, there is some arrogance
[1648.9s] here which is being seasoned with pride.
[1654.9s] Get me right. There are some responses
[1660.6s] you may give
[1663.6s] to
[1665.3s] somebody even if
[1668.6s] they are too religious, even if they are
[1672.2s] too holy. that will
[1676.0s] generate
[1678.5s] some negative respons.
[1682.4s] You know the Bible is very clear by
[1684.4s] saying that David was the servant of the
[1686.6s] Lord. But again here what Nabal is
[1690.4s] responding to David.
[1693.4s] You know sometimes we are tempted to
[1697.0s] think and say that as long as you are
[1699.4s] Christian you can pay any form of
[1702.8s] mistreatment.
[1705.3s] But again I'm finding David here being
[1708.2s] agitated
[1710.5s] by the response given by the carous man
[1715.0s] by the name Neb. And he's asking you
[1717.4s] know who is Neba? You know who is David
[1721.3s] and who is the son of Jesse. Let me let
[1724.7s] me let me Christian paint a picture here
[1727.8s] briefly
[1729.4s] a picture uh of sheep sharing. Maybe
[1733.4s] this will probably make us understand
[1735.6s] more what I'm trying to illustrate here.
[1738.3s] That ship sharing in the Bible times was
[1742.1s] a very significant event both socially
[1746.6s] and economically
[1748.6s] and it was also a time of feasting and
[1752.6s] celebration.
[1754.2s] The Bible leverances sharing as a time
[1758.0s] when people often gathered and often in
[1762.2s] following hospitality and in following
[1766.6s] feasting. Additionally, ship sharing
[1770.3s] served as a powerful metaphor in
[1774.1s] scripture representing submission,
[1777.7s] representing sacrifice, representing the
[1781.4s] severed frog relationship.
[1785.3s] So this was not just ship sharing but
[1790.0s] again it had a lot of you know uh
[1793.0s] significance attached to this.
[1797.5s] It also exited some love and some care
[1802.8s] amongst God's people.
[1806.1s] So the book of 1st Samuel chapter 25 we
[1810.4s] find Neb sharing his sheep in camel and
[1815.4s] David now is sending his messengers to
[1819.0s] receive some some hospitality to receive
[1824.0s] some food.
[1827.8s] This was also a moment which could
[1831.1s] easily generate conflict as we see also
[1834.9s] in this particular chapter.
[1838.0s] But let me let me take you a notch
[1839.8s] higher by saying that sheep sharing also
[1843.5s] pointed to the frog
[1847.2s] shepherd
[1848.8s] relationship.
[1850.3s] The imagery of the sheep and the
[1852.8s] shepherd is preferent in the Bible. I
[1856.9s] writing the relationship between God and
[1859.8s] his people and Jesus as the good
[1863.1s] shepherd.
[1864.6s] That is why the Bible says in the book
[1867.0s] of John chapter 10 and verse 11 that I
[1870.1s] am the good shepherd. The good shepherd
[1873.9s] giveth his life for the folk.
[1879.7s] Let me go to verse 10 which said, "And
[1881.7s] Nebal answered David and said, who is
[1884.9s] David and who is the son of Jesse?"
[1889.3s] Child of God, let me say that I am sure
[1891.9s] that David must have been driven by
[1895.2s] hunger
[1896.9s] from him to for him to come to Baran
[1900.8s] requesting for food. But Near's response
[1904.4s] is quite unreasonable.
[1908.4s] Child of God, let me say that hunger is
[1910.5s] a is a party thing
[1914.6s] and it can make you go to places where
[1918.0s] you could not have gone.
[1920.9s] Anger as well can cause you to do things
[1925.2s] you could not have done.
[1928.3s] David's revenge mission in the 13th
[1931.1s] verse of this particular chapter you
[1934.5s] know all informs us that the move that
[1938.7s] David took was agitated
[1943.5s] by the response that Nebal gave
[1948.8s] and anger
[1956.2s] can cause some people to enter into some
[1960.2s] quagmas which cannot
[1963.3s] be explained why they are there as
[1965.8s] Christians.
[1967.5s] Why? Because David was a servant of the
[1970.2s] Lord anyway. And David was not expected
[1973.8s] to launch out a revenge mission to
[1976.6s] Nebat.
[1978.4s] But again because of the agitation of
[1982.0s] this man David moved out. Child of God,
[1986.9s] in the world where we live today,
[1990.6s] all around us, even including the child
[1993.8s] of God, I see and experience the spirit
[1998.2s] of Nebal today
[2001.7s] that David here in this particular
[2004.2s] discourse serves here to represent God.
[2010.6s] He serves here to represent God and his
[2013.5s] goodness.
[2017.0s] to humanity. And Nebal in this
[2020.1s] particular context here stands to
[2022.2s] represent
[2025.2s] the response of mankind towards the
[2029.5s] goodness of the Lord.
[2032.0s] But again here a character that is not
[2034.7s] my focus today. Abigail who stands here
[2038.2s] to represent
[2040.6s] the mission that Jesus Christ always
[2044.1s] does
[2046.3s] in trying to unite unreasonable mankind
[2051.0s] and listenable Christians
[2053.4s] who are too busy
[2057.1s] to pay goodness with goodness.
[2061.0s] That is why the book of 2 Timothy
[2063.5s] chapter 3 serves to remind us that but
[2066.7s] know this that in the last days
[2070.6s] it will be various times.
[2073.3s] For men will be lovers of themselves.
[2077.8s] Men will be lovers of many. Men will be
[2082.6s] posters. Men will be proud. Men will be
[2087.4s] you know uh you know uh disobedient
[2090.7s] to their parents. But more importantly
[2094.2s] where my focus here is men will be
[2097.8s] unthankful.
[2099.9s] Unthankful
[2103.0s] child of God. The song that we find in
[2105.4s] the book of Isaiah chapter 5 and verse
[2108.6s] four tells it all that God has done all
[2113.4s] to us.
[2115.2s] But my question here today is how has
[2118.6s] been our lepos?
[2121.0s] If today you were given an opportunity
[2123.0s] to count the goodness of the Lord
[2127.1s] to count how many times God has been too
[2130.6s] good to you
[2133.0s] children of God it is numerous times but
[2136.6s] again how has been our response.
[2140.6s] The fourth verse of Isaiah chapter 5
[2143.9s] says that what more could I have done to
[2147.8s] my vineard that I have not done to it?
[2151.2s] Why then when I expected it to bring
[2153.9s] forth good grapes did it bring forth
[2157.7s] what kind of grapes? Wild grapes.
[2162.2s] children, child of God, as neighbor more
[2165.4s] than once we have served God with
[2169.2s] disgrace.
[2170.8s] We have served God with a lot of
[2173.4s] unkindness.
[2175.1s] You know, in you know, in relation to
[2178.0s] what God has done to us. But do you
[2181.2s] remember and know that the devil always
[2183.6s] is in need of us?
[2186.2s] that the devil is fighting day and night
[2190.6s] to have you.
[2193.0s] One of the book of first Peter 5:8 says
[2196.2s] that be sober and be vigant because you
[2199.6s] are divers. The devil walks about like a
[2203.2s] roaring lion seeking whom to devil. I
[2206.6s] wish we knew that we are
[2210.2s] the target of the devil. That is why
[2213.4s] also in the book of Luke chap 22:31
[2217.0s] you know Jesus comes to Simon and tells
[2219.6s] him Simon Simon you know the devil is in
[2223.0s] need of you but I have prayed for you
[2226.3s] that your faith does what faith not and
[2230.7s] he says that when you are converted
[2234.8s] strengthen your brothers. Let me say
[2237.5s] that children of God in church and
[2240.6s] outside church we are the target of the
[2243.4s] enemy.
[2246.9s] We are the target of the enemy
[2252.8s] now. New life
[2257.7s] the nine levers
[2260.6s] in the book of Luke chapter 17
[2265.5s] who came to Jesus to say thank you and
[2269.7s] extend their gratitude for hearing their
[2272.4s] leprosy.
[2273.9s] Today we
[2276.8s] your former pastors
[2279.2s] stand here today in solidarity
[2282.7s] with them and against the spirit of
[2285.4s] Nebal and say thank you New life
[2290.6s] for the respect and love that you
[2293.7s] expressed to us during our pastoral
[2296.9s] service here in New Life. We say thank
[2299.9s] you
[2301.9s] for giving us a platform as pastor Haro
[2305.4s] you come for giving us a platform to
[2308.6s] exercise our pastoral calling today we
[2312.4s] say thank you new life for opening your
[2317.0s] doors for us to visit with you and pray
[2322.6s] with you today new life we say thank you
[2326.2s] for the support the care and the help
[2329.6s] you gave us today. We say thank you new
[2333.2s] life for the counsel and advice and for
[2338.3s] the respect you exhibited today. We say
[2342.6s] thank you new life. Nevertheless,
[2347.2s] we cannot shy away from apologizing.
[2352.0s] Where we might have messed up and did
[2355.7s] not measure up to your expectation, we
[2359.2s] as well today apologize.
[2363.0s] Now for all this we say,
[2367.8s] may God bless you and keep you.
[2372.3s] May God grant you the desires of your
[2376.2s] hearts.
[2378.2s] May God bless your families with good
[2381.4s] health and long life.
[2384.2s] May he guard and guide you as you come
[2387.2s] in and as you go out.
[2390.8s] May you find him while you seek him. And
[2395.2s] more importantly, may he retain your
[2398.7s] names in the book of life.
[2401.4s] May you be part of those who will
[2405.1s] welcome him when he comes in the mid in
[2408.2s] the in the midst of the crowd. This is
[2411.8s] our prayer.
[2413.8s] This is our wish. This is our desire and
[2419.1s] this is our blessing to you. May now
[2423.2s] this be your experience as a church and
[2426.1s] as a leadership of this church. In the
[2428.5s] name of God the Father, God the Son, and
[2432.3s] God the Holy Ghost. Fair thee well new
[2436.5s] life.
[2438.9s] I request my colleague pastor to over a
[2441.7s] closing prayer.
[2444.8s] Uh what do you say? We are saying what?
[2448.2s] Thank you. I will request the entire
[2450.5s] church to be up on feet even as we we
[2453.6s] pray together.
[2458.7s] Let us pray.
[2461.0s] Eternal Father divine, indeed you have
[2464.2s] been powerful. You've been mighty. The
[2466.9s] powerful things that you made possible
[2469.5s] and bestowed upon each and every one of
[2471.5s] us. Today we say thank you to New Life
[2474.9s] Church for the wonderful years we share
[2477.3s] together. And Father, we are praying
[2479.2s] that each and everyone of us will
[2481.7s] experience peace in their marriages in
[2484.0s] Jesus' name. Father, we are praying even
[2486.6s] as we say thank you that the young
[2488.6s] people will grow up brilliant,
[2490.7s] intelligent and wise in Jesus' name.
[2493.9s] Father, we are praying that young
[2495.6s] professionals, the youths, the women and
[2498.2s] men will grow up in wisdom in Jesus'
[2500.9s] name. But father, even as we say thank
[2503.1s] you, we know some of us are in hostels,
[2506.2s] some of us are sick, some of us have
[2508.7s] lost their loved ones. Father, I'm
[2510.5s] praying that the showers of peace will
[2512.6s] reign supreme in Jesus' name. We want to
[2515.4s] thank you for the wonderful elders at
[2517.2s] New Life SDA Church, the ones that serve
[2520.0s] together with us. We learned so much
[2522.1s] from them. Father, I'm praying that your
[2524.2s] blessings will be bestowed upon each and
[2526.3s] every one of them in Jesus' name. You
[2528.6s] want to pray for the ED elders who serve
[2531.0s] together with us. We want to pray for
[2533.0s] Elder Tich. We are praying that you
[2534.7s] bless him. You want to pray for Elder
[2537.1s] Mura. We are praying that you bless him.
[2539.6s] We are praying for elder. Bless these
[2542.0s] powerful elders in Jesus name. But
[2544.6s] father we also want to remember the
[2546.6s] pastors who serve together with us. We
[2549.0s] want to pray that you bless pastor
[2550.9s] Samuel Mang in Jesus name. We are
[2553.6s] praying that you bless pastor Keti who
[2555.7s] has always guided us in Jesus name.
[2558.3s] Bless pastor Akali Jakob AO and the
[2561.6s] entire family for the love and for the
[2564.1s] wisdom in Jesus name. Bless pastor
[2566.6s] Emanuel Tes for I'm praying that to you
[2568.9s] to bless his family. Bless him in Jesus
[2572.0s] name. Bless pastor Ezra Yanote who has
[2575.1s] fed us with a powerful message. A
[2577.3s] reminder that all of us we need to say
[2579.6s] thank you. Father I'm praying that you
[2581.8s] bless him in Jesus name. Bless the
[2584.5s] powerful choirs that have served over
[2586.6s] the time here with us. The church choir,
[2589.1s] the holy new life church choir. I pray
[2591.7s] that you bless them in Jesus name. Bless
[2595.0s] the redemption choir. Bless the
[2597.2s] chisters. Bless the youth choir. Bless
[2599.8s] the children choir, the proactive choir.
[2602.4s] Father, I'm praying that you bless this
[2604.5s] entire church. The friends who have
[2606.3s] visited together with us today and those
[2608.7s] who have been watching online. We are
[2610.8s] here to say thank you. We messed up
[2613.4s] sometimes because we are human beings.
[2615.6s] Father, I'm praying that they forgive us
[2617.6s] in Jesus name. Walk with us. Bless our
[2620.9s] families. But above all, Lord, may you
[2623.3s] prepare us your soon return that when
[2625.4s] you shall come the second time, all of
[2627.4s] us will be able to exclaim this is our
[2630.1s] Lord. We have waited for him. As we
[2632.8s] begin the PCM today, we have powerful
[2635.8s] messages in the afternoon from 3 to 5.
[2639.7s] Father, I'm praying that this powerful
[2641.8s] week will draw your children closer to
[2644.1s] you than before. If anyone is sick,
[2646.5s] Father, they are healed in Jesus name.
[2649.0s] If anyone is discouraged, Father, their
[2651.6s] hopes are restored in Jesus' name. If
[2654.2s] there's someone going through a painful
[2655.8s] divorce experience, bring this to a stop
[2658.7s] in Jesus' name because you are a
[2660.9s] powerful God. Keep us together. Help us
[2663.8s] to hold hands together. Help us to pray
[2666.4s] for one another. Help us, Jesus, to
[2668.8s] visit one another. Help us to speak kind
[2671.7s] words to one another because Lord, you
[2674.6s] desire that your children will be
[2676.4s] forever united. I'm pretty looking
[2678.4s] forward to that time when every child
[2680.6s] here, a young person here, women in this
[2683.6s] church, men in this church will see the
[2685.9s] sky open and the son of man will come
[2688.5s] down and all of us will say hallelujah
[2691.1s] because the savior has come down. Be
[2693.4s] with us now and forever for I plead in
[2696.0s] Jesus name. Amen.
