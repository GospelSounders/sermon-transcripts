FULL TRANSCRIPT:
[Music] Uh good morning church and morning, afternoon, evening uh viewers depending on where you're watching us from. My name is uh Victor Okod, a member of uh New Life SDA charge 5th Gong Avenue. Uh and today I want to take us through the health nuggets and this month we are looking at drug and substance abuse. So the power of choice and uh last week we went through uh an introduction of this topic and today we want to look at dangers of drug and substance abuse among youth and young adults. So let's pray as we begin. Our kind and loving father in heaven, we thank you for the opportunity that you've assembled us together as your children. We thank you for the gift of the Sabbath as we get into this program. Father, we pray for your blessings. May it uh enrich us. May it be a blessing to a viewer or anyone in the audience uh for your glory. Above all, prepare us for thy second coming. This is our prayer in Jesus' name. Thank you. So in our introduction last week I believe we looked at the drugs and the introduction of it drugs and substance abuse and you were saying that it's not food. It's not food. It's any substance uh other than food which by its chemical reaction or nature affects uh structure and function of uh living organisms or you and I can be affected by drugs. other than this is not food. Now uh today we want to look at uh certain statistics that we have the national authority for the campaign uh against alcohol and drug abuse that is NADA in their survey in 2023 we are told that one out of six Kenyans aged between 15 and 65. What did I say? One out of six of every Kenyan uh I don't know what the population statistics was then but uh one out of six then uh were using at least one drug or substance uh of abuse. And if we look at the total population uh for that category it was 4,733 people which means essentially we are talking of about 5 million 5 million Kenyans using at least one drug or uh substance abuse then in 2023 I don't know about last year's data uh and out of this population of close to 5 million. Uh we see 3,700 and uh 83,854 were males. Out of 5 million, we've broken it down to close to 4 million. These were males. And then if you compare to their female counterparts, we find that we had 949,298. This is nada data, survey data. So that's close to a million. Yeah. So as you can see, there's already a problem amongst us that needs to be addressed. And so we need to up the game and see where the challenge is, where the gap is and how we can address this. Uh further on we find that one out of 11 youths aged 15 to 24. The other data was uh all Kenyans about 15 to 65 years, but now this one breaks it down to uh youths. One out of 11 youths aged between 15 and 24 years. That's about 632 846 were using at least one drug or substance of abuse. Then the next uh report that we had was the drug and substance use that is the DSU report that's 2024 last year and it indicates that 8% of university students are supposed to be in rehabilitation. That's concerning. 8% of our university students need to be in rehab and this is nothing but drug. So what are the causes of drug and substance abuse? We find that uh our youths and young adults get into this because there's access easy access easy access to drugs and alcohol. So uh probably it's at home, maybe it's where they go to. And so there's ease access to these drugs and there's peer pressure. Okay. uh my friends, my colleagues, uh my workmates, uh the schoolmates etc. uh they put pressure on me and I get myself uh using or desiring to use drugs or any other substance. Other things that we look at here is poverty uh poverty and and so there's uh we don't have jobs in Kenya. the situation at hand. Currently, we don't have jobs. And so, if I don't have income, I end up being idol and and not engaging in other activities. And when I'm idle, I'm lured into getting into drugs and substance abuse, poverty. Other things could also be media influences. There's a lot that goes on in the screens, in our TV uh rooms. We see so many things that lead us. We think that drinking is something good. Depending on the adverts that we see, we have gadgets on our phones and so uh we end up uh getting into drugs and substance abuse. The other thing could be poor parenting and role modeling. So the expectation from our youths and young adults is that uh we become good role models uh to our children and uh sometimes broken traditional values. Uh now we are talking about dangers and so I'll look at uh effects of drug and substance abuse. Uh if we look at the social uh aspect in terms of education performance for our youth and uh and uh young adults, we see that there are school dropouts. We find poor grades just because we are getting involved into drugs and substance abuse, unskilled uh youths. So even our country in terms of its development, we cannot uh progress, we cannot grow. uh there's lack of objectivity uh in terms of relations, lack of meaningful meaningful relations amongst our youth and young adults. We see teenage pregnancies, abortions etc. In terms of public safety, uh there's criminal activities going around just because we are getting into drugs and abusing uh uh substances. There's stigma also that's associated with it. And so there's shame and guilt amongst our youth. So we can avoid that as youths and get uh better practices uh and better engagement. In terms of mental health issues, we can see anxiety, depression, uh personality disorders, uh attempts for suicide and and actually suicide uh occasionally. uh psychologically in terms of decision uh making this is a challenge when we use drugs and physically there's increased risk of ill health. So uh we become sick when we use drugs and reduced immunity and damaged uh organs. In terms of interventions as I wind up uh we need to accept and acknowledge that there's a problem. If we don't accept and acknowledge there's a problem, then we cannot we cannot help our youth and young people. So we need to accept first and then provide safe space for our children allowing free sharing and interaction with our children. Uh this would eliminate fear. It would also improve trust amongst the youth and young adults. Uh we can also encourage support systems. We have the support groups. We also have professionals who can advise uh counselors and things like that so we can reach out to them and then we need to have improved parenting. Uh I I know sometimes parents feel like yes uh we don't have that script but we can always look around and uh borrow a leave from other parents or probably books and uh professional advice and guidance so that we become good role models. So if we turn to the book of Matthew 17:21 and Mark 9:29, it reminds that us that it's important as an intervention that we pray and fast. Some of these things you cannot eliminate without prayer and fasting as a believer. So other than doing all that, we also need to pray and fast. And may the Lord bless you even as you think, picture, ponder, and think about what we have shared in Jesus' name. Thank [Music] you. God is good. [Music]

[0.8s] [Music]
[14.7s] Uh good morning
[16.8s] church and morning, afternoon, evening
[21.0s] uh viewers depending on where you're
[22.9s] watching us from. My name is uh Victor
[25.7s] Okod, a member of uh New Life SDA charge
[29.8s] 5th Gong Avenue. Uh and today I want to
[34.6s] take us through the health nuggets and
[37.4s] this month we are looking at drug and
[40.6s] substance abuse. So the power of choice
[44.6s] and uh last week we went through uh an
[47.7s] introduction of this topic and today we
[50.3s] want to look at dangers of drug and
[53.9s] substance abuse among youth and young
[58.3s] adults. So let's pray as we
[61.0s] begin. Our kind and loving father in
[63.4s] heaven, we thank you for the opportunity
[65.4s] that you've assembled us together as
[67.8s] your children. We thank you for the gift
[70.2s] of the Sabbath as we get into this
[72.5s] program. Father, we pray for your
[74.1s] blessings. May it uh enrich us. May it
[77.3s] be a blessing to a viewer or anyone in
[80.4s] the audience uh for your glory. Above
[82.7s] all, prepare us for thy second coming.
[84.9s] This is our prayer in Jesus'
[87.7s] name. Thank you. So in our introduction
[90.5s] last week I believe we looked at the
[93.0s] drugs and the introduction of it drugs
[96.1s] and substance abuse and you were saying
[98.4s] that it's not food. It's not food. It's
[101.4s] any substance uh other than food which
[105.1s] by its chemical reaction or nature
[108.5s] affects uh structure and function of uh
[113.8s] living organisms or you and I can be
[116.5s] affected by drugs. other than this is
[119.3s] not food. Now uh today we want to look
[123.0s] at uh certain statistics that we have
[126.2s] the national authority for the campaign
[129.7s] uh against alcohol and drug abuse that
[133.3s] is NADA in their survey in
[136.8s] 2023 we are told that one out of six
[141.5s] Kenyans aged between 15 and 65. What did
[145.9s] I say?
[148.2s] One out of six of every Kenyan
[153.0s] uh I don't know what the population
[154.7s] statistics was then but uh one out of
[158.9s] six then uh were using at least one drug
[163.3s] or substance
[165.2s] uh of abuse. And if we look at the total
[169.0s] population uh for that category it was
[175.9s] 4,733
[177.5s] people which means essentially we are
[180.2s] talking of about 5 million 5 million
[184.6s] Kenyans using at least one drug or uh
[189.3s] substance abuse then in 2023 I don't
[192.8s] know about last year's data uh and out
[195.9s] of this population of close to 5
[198.5s] million. Uh we see
[202.6s] 3,700 and uh
[207.8s] 83,854 were males. Out of 5 million,
[211.9s] we've broken it down to close to 4
[214.4s] million. These were males. And then if
[217.8s] you compare to their female
[219.0s] counterparts, we find that we had
[224.5s] 949,298. This is nada data, survey data.
[229.2s] So that's close to a million. Yeah. So
[232.6s] as you can see, there's already a
[234.4s] problem amongst us that needs to be
[236.8s] addressed. And so we need to up the game
[239.8s] and see where the challenge is, where
[241.5s] the gap is and how we can address
[244.5s] this. Uh further on we find that one out
[247.9s] of 11 youths aged 15 to 24. The other
[251.5s] data was uh all Kenyans about 15 to 65
[256.3s] years, but now this one breaks it down
[258.6s] to uh youths. One out of 11 youths aged
[262.2s] between 15 and 24 years. That's about
[267.3s] 632
[269.3s] 846 were using at least one drug or
[274.3s] substance of abuse.
[276.3s] Then the next uh report that we had was
[280.2s] the drug and substance use that is the
[282.6s] DSU report that's 2024 last year and it
[286.2s] indicates that
[288.0s] 8% of university students are supposed
[291.7s] to be in
[293.3s] rehabilitation. That's concerning. 8% of
[296.7s] our university students need to be in
[299.1s] rehab and this is nothing but drug. So
[302.0s] what are the causes of drug and
[304.3s] substance
[306.4s] abuse? We find that uh our youths and
[310.6s] young adults get into this because
[312.3s] there's access easy access easy access
[315.8s] to drugs and alcohol. So uh probably
[319.8s] it's at home, maybe it's where they go
[322.2s] to. And so there's ease access to these
[325.1s] drugs and there's peer pressure. Okay.
[328.6s] uh my friends, my colleagues, uh my
[331.0s] workmates,
[332.9s] uh the schoolmates etc. uh they put
[337.4s] pressure on me and I get myself uh using
[341.6s] or desiring to use drugs or any other
[345.5s] substance. Other things that we look at
[347.8s] here is poverty uh poverty and and so
[352.0s] there's uh we don't have jobs in Kenya.
[355.3s] the situation at hand. Currently, we
[357.4s] don't have jobs. And so, if I don't have
[359.8s] income, I end up being idol and and not
[363.0s] engaging in other activities. And when
[365.4s] I'm idle, I'm lured into getting into
[368.7s] drugs and substance abuse,
[372.3s] poverty. Other things could also be
[374.7s] media influences. There's a lot that
[377.2s] goes on in the screens, in our TV uh
[381.0s] rooms. We see so many things that lead
[383.6s] us. We think that drinking is something
[386.4s] good. Depending on the adverts that we
[388.5s] see, we have gadgets on our phones and
[391.6s] so uh we end up uh getting into drugs
[394.9s] and substance abuse. The other thing
[398.2s] could be poor parenting and role
[401.0s] modeling. So the expectation from our
[403.4s] youths and young adults is that uh we
[406.3s] become good role models uh to our
[409.1s] children and uh sometimes broken
[412.9s] traditional
[416.1s] values. Uh now we are talking about
[419.4s] dangers and so I'll look at uh effects
[423.0s] of drug and substance abuse. Uh if we
[426.9s] look at the social uh aspect in terms of
[430.8s] education performance for our youth and
[433.3s] uh and uh young adults, we see that
[436.6s] there are school dropouts. We find poor
[440.2s] grades just because we are getting
[442.2s] involved into drugs and substance abuse,
[445.4s] unskilled uh youths. So even our country
[449.3s] in terms of its development, we cannot
[452.1s] uh progress, we cannot grow. uh there's
[455.3s] lack of objectivity uh in terms of
[459.2s] relations, lack of meaningful meaningful
[462.0s] relations amongst our youth and young
[464.4s] adults. We see teenage pregnancies,
[467.8s] abortions etc. In terms of public
[470.7s] safety, uh there's criminal activities
[473.5s] going around just because we are getting
[475.8s] into drugs and abusing uh uh
[480.3s] substances. There's stigma also that's
[482.5s] associated with it. And so there's shame
[485.0s] and guilt amongst our youth. So we can
[487.5s] avoid that as youths and get uh better
[490.8s] practices uh and better engagement. In
[494.5s] terms of mental health issues, we can
[497.4s] see anxiety, depression, uh personality
[500.8s] disorders, uh attempts for suicide and
[504.7s] and actually suicide uh occasionally. uh
[509.6s] psychologically in terms of decision uh
[512.2s] making this is a challenge when we use
[515.5s] drugs and physically there's increased
[518.4s] risk of ill health. So uh we become sick
[522.7s] when we use drugs and reduced immunity
[525.7s] and damaged uh organs. In terms of
[529.4s] interventions as I wind up uh we need to
[533.8s] accept and acknowledge that there's a
[535.7s] problem. If we don't accept and
[537.2s] acknowledge there's a problem, then we
[540.0s] cannot we cannot help our youth and
[542.2s] young people. So we need to accept first
[545.1s] and then provide safe space for our
[547.8s] children allowing free sharing and
[550.2s] interaction with our children. Uh this
[552.4s] would eliminate fear. It would also
[554.6s] improve trust amongst the youth and
[556.6s] young adults. Uh we can also encourage
[559.8s] support systems. We have the support
[562.2s] groups. We also have professionals who
[564.7s] can advise uh counselors and things like
[567.2s] that so we can reach out to them and
[570.6s] then we need to have improved parenting.
[573.1s] Uh I I know sometimes parents feel like
[575.5s] yes uh we don't have that script but we
[578.4s] can always look around and uh borrow a
[581.0s] leave from other parents or probably
[583.5s] books and uh professional advice and
[586.6s] guidance so that we become good role
[589.0s] models. So if we turn to the book of
[591.7s] Matthew
[593.1s] 17:21 and Mark 9:29, it reminds that us
[598.1s] that it's important as an intervention
[600.6s] that we pray and fast. Some of these
[603.1s] things you cannot eliminate without
[605.5s] prayer and fasting as a believer. So
[608.8s] other than doing all that, we also need
[610.6s] to pray and fast. And may the Lord bless
[613.3s] you even as you think, picture, ponder,
[616.5s] and think about what we have shared in
[619.3s] Jesus' name. Thank
[624.7s] [Music]
[631.2s] you. God is good.
