TIMESTAMPED TRANSCRIPT:
[1.6s] [Music]
[11.1s] happy Sabbath church happy day happy day
[15.4s] happy my name is Israel jnel and I'm
[18.2s] going to present the children's sermon
[19.8s] today our children's sermon comes from
[23.0s] the book of Genesis 11 verse 1-9 and the
[27.3s] title is United for the wrong reason
[31.1s] imagine imagine a time when the world
[33.5s] was full of people who spoke the same
[35.4s] language they live together in harmony
[38.4s] these people were Advanced and ambitious
[41.1s] so they decided to build a tower that
[43.9s] would reach the heavens they thought
[46.2s] that by doing so they could make a name
[48.8s] for themselves and show the world what
[51.7s] they were capable
[53.4s] of Genesis
[56.0s] 11:4 the Bible says then they said come
[59.7s] let let us build ourselves a city with
[61.8s] our tower that reaches the heavens so
[64.4s] that we may make a name for ourselves as
[67.3s] they began building the tower they they
[70.3s] imagined the glory they would receive
[72.2s] once it was completed they thought that
[74.8s] they would become so great that even God
[77.2s] would be impressed by their achievements
[80.1s] but God saw their pride and arrogance
[82.3s] and knew that it was not a good thing he
[85.0s] decided to intervene in a way that would
[87.6s] teach them a lesson they would never
[90.8s] forget as Genesis chapter 11:6 the Bible
[96.2s] says the Lord said if as one people
[99.1s] speaking the same language they have
[101.9s] begun to do this then nothing they plan
[104.6s] to do will be impossible for them in
[108.0s] this verse God observed that the people
[110.9s] building the Tower of Babel were one
[113.6s] people they and they had all one
[117.2s] language and that if they continued in
[119.5s] this
[120.7s] nothing they purpose would be impossible
[123.4s] for
[125.7s] them one day the people woke up to find
[128.6s] they could no longer communicate with
[130.6s] one another they tried to speak but
[133.2s] their words came out in a jumbled mess
[135.9s] the builders couldn't understand the
[137.6s] Masons the Masons couldn't understand
[139.9s] the camp campers the work on the Tower
[143.2s] came to a hold and the people were left
[146.1s] confused the confusion in language
[148.5s] caused chaos and the people were no
[150.6s] longer able to work together the once
[154.0s] unified Community became divided and the
[157.5s] builders could no longer cooperate the
[160.2s] work on the tower stopped it was never
[163.1s] completed the Tower of Babel is a story
[166.8s] that reminds us the importance of
[169.0s] humility and also a powerful reminder of
[172.6s] the importance of unity in accomplishing
[175.6s] what we plan to do Church what are our
[178.5s] motives in what we do
[180.4s] do we come together for the right or
[182.2s] wrong reasons when we choose to unite
[184.8s] for the right reasons in our homes
[187.0s] schools churches and in the and Society
[190.6s] they will become better places for all
[192.6s] of us children let us learn to be United
[196.4s] for the right reasons the Lessons
[198.4s] Learned are God wants us to be United
[201.1s] for the right reasons and when we are
