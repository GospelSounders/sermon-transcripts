And I hope your week has been a fantastic week. And if at all maybe your week wasn't the best, we hope you'll find your joys during this Sabbath day. Now I must confess this week has been a very busy week for the 7th day Adventist church globally because the se 62nd global general conference session of the 7th day Adventist church has been launched and it was launched on the 3rd of July 2025 in St. Louis Missouri in the United States of America. And I know you've heard so much about it during the week. And I'm sure you are also so excited to watch whatever is going on there because over 2,800 delegates and over 100 people were present in those in the session and it's going on for the next week. So we hope you will find time and joining us as we are having this session online and we hope you will enjoy it. There's so much happening there in the United States of America and I'm glad to share with you that two of our members from our church Elder Pere and um sister have joined them there physically. So if at all you don't have time to if you if you are like us who didn't have time to make it there maybe you could join us on the YouTube channel the 2CBN YouTube channel as well where we we'll have the live sessions being held well away from the international news here at New Life Church today is a very special Sabbath as well we are launching the crystal fountain sanctuary here in New Life Church. Many of us know that this structure was temporary for us and we are being led by the scripture of Exodus 25:8 where God asked them the Israelites to make a sanctuary for them and we're launching this special structure today. So it is a very blessed Sabbath day and I know many of us were expecting to have holy communion because it is also the first Sabbath of the quarter but that will happen next week.
