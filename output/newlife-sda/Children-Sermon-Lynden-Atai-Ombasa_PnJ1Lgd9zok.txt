FULL TRANSCRIPT:
[Music] Happy day. My name is Linda Numbasa. I'm going to say the children's story. Uh our topic comes our topic is Jesus. God still loves us sin no more. The key text comes from the book of John 4:14. And it says, "Whoever drinks the water that I give give him will never be thirsty again." The story of we we will learn the story of the Samaritan woman. It comes from the book of John chapter 4 verse 1-42. One day Jesus and his disciples were walking from Judea to Galilee. They had to pass through Samaria. Samaritans and Jews were enemies. They were not mixed up. Jesus and his disciples stopped near Jacob's well, which he dug up. It was around noon. At that time, Jesus asked his disciples to go and buy food. As soon as they left, there came a Samaritan woman to draw water from the well. Jesus asked her, "Can you give me some water?" The Samaritan woman replied, "How can you a Jew ask me for water? And I am a Samaritan woman." Those days women came to draw water from the well in groups at a time where the sun is not hot. But this Samaritan woman did lots of sin. So she did not have friends. The Samaritan was a woman and Jesus was a Jewish man. It will be difficult to talk to each other when it is a man and a woman from different tribes. Jesus said to her, "If you knew who I who you are speaking to and who I am, you will be asking me for living water. What is this living water? The Samaritan woman couldn't understand. So she said, "You don't have a bucket and this well is deep. Are you greater than our ancestor Jacob? How can you get this living water?" Jesus said, "Anyone who drinks from this well will soon be thirsty again. But anyone who drinks from my water will never become thirsty again. They will also become a fountain of living water sprouting forever." The woman was amazed on what Jesus was talking about. The Samaritan woman asked Jesus for this living water so that she can never be coming again at the well to draw water. Jesus asked her to call her husband. The Samaritan woman became sad and said, "I don't have a husband." Jesus said, "That's right. You do not have a husband, but you have had five husbands." This man you live with now is not your husband. The Samaritan woman said, "I see you are a prophet. You do not know me, yet you know everything about me. We say we should worship at this very mountain. But you Jews say the right place to worship is at the temple of Jerusalem." Jesus said, "You Samaritans know little about the God you are worshiping. While we Jews know the God we are worshiping, for salvation comes from the Jews. But a time is coming that when true worshippers will worship the father in spirit and truth. Those are the ones God is looking for." And indeed the time is now. The woman was still confused and said, "The Messiah, also called the Christ, is coming and he will explain everything to us." Jesus told her that he is the Messiah, the one you have been waiting for. The Samaritan woman ran and dropped her bucket and went to the village and told everyone to see a man who told her everything she ever did. Must this be the Messiah? The Samaritans came to Jesus and he preached to them and they were amazed by his teaching. The disciples came and asked Jesus to eat. Jesus said, "I have food that you do not know. My food is to do my father's will. You say that harvest is in 4 months, but I say the fields are ready for harvest." What does Jesus mean by by his that his food is doing his father's will? He meant that doing God's will is more important than food. What did he mean that the fields are ready for harvest? Jesus did not want to be a farmer. He he meant that the people he preached to, they were they were ready to hear the good news and share it to other people. Amen. Amen. Jesus is not faced by our sin. Jesus alone is our living water that fills our void. Our life should overflow into ex into into the exaltation of the Messiah. Worship God in spirit and truth. Be ready to share the good news at any time and any place. Jesus might find us when we least expect it. Amen. Amen. Christ presence exposes sin and makes people quirim but he can forgive sins and give new life. The location of worshippers is not nearly important as the attitude of worshippers. It doesn't matter that you come to church but what matters is how you worship God. The living word, Jesus Christ, and the written word, the Bible, can satisfy our hungry and thirsty souls. As our bodies hunger and thirst, so do our souls. It needs spiritual food and water. Amen. Amen. I I welcome the chistas to come sing song number 493. Like the woman at the well. Stanza one and two. Stanza one and the chorus only. [Music]

TIMESTAMPED TRANSCRIPT:
[0.0s] [Music]
[0.7s] Happy day.
[4.1s] My name is Linda Numbasa. I'm going to
[7.0s] say the children's story.
[9.7s] Uh our topic comes our topic is Jesus.
[15.8s] God still loves us sin no more.
[20.2s] The key text comes from the book of John
[24.2s] 4:14. And it says, "Whoever drinks the
[28.8s] water that I give give him will never be
[33.6s] thirsty again."
[36.8s] The story of we we will learn the story
[40.9s] of the Samaritan woman. It comes from
[44.2s] the book of John chapter 4 verse 1-42.
[59.0s] One day Jesus and his disciples were
[62.1s] walking from Judea to Galilee. They had
[65.4s] to pass through Samaria. Samaritans and
[69.0s] Jews were enemies. They were not mixed
[71.9s] up.
[73.0s] Jesus and his disciples stopped near
[75.7s] Jacob's well, which he dug up.
[79.5s] It was around noon. At that time, Jesus
[83.2s] asked his disciples to go and buy food.
[87.0s] As soon as they left, there came a
[90.2s] Samaritan woman to draw water from the
[93.1s] well. Jesus asked her, "Can you give me
[97.5s] some water?" The Samaritan woman
[100.4s] replied, "How can you a Jew ask me for
[104.1s] water? And I am a Samaritan woman."
[109.0s] Those days women came to draw water from
[112.2s] the well in groups at a time where the
[115.5s] sun is not hot.
[118.2s] But this Samaritan woman
[121.7s] did lots of sin. So she did not have
[125.1s] friends. The Samaritan
[128.4s] was a woman and Jesus was a Jewish man.
[131.2s] It will be difficult to talk to each
[133.8s] other when it is a man and a woman from
[136.7s] different tribes.
[141.0s] Jesus said to her, "If you knew who I
[145.1s] who you are speaking to and who I am,
[150.0s] you will be asking me for living water.
[153.1s] What is this living water?
[156.0s] The Samaritan woman couldn't understand.
[159.4s] So she said, "You don't have a bucket
[163.2s] and this well is deep. Are you greater
[166.4s] than our ancestor Jacob?
[170.0s] How can you get this living water?"
[175.1s] Jesus said, "Anyone who drinks from this
[178.3s] well will soon be thirsty again. But
[181.9s] anyone who drinks from my water will
[184.8s] never become thirsty again. They will
[188.1s] also become a fountain of living water
[191.3s] sprouting forever."
[194.2s] The woman was amazed on what Jesus was
[196.9s] talking about.
[199.1s] The Samaritan woman asked Jesus for this
[201.9s] living water so that she can never be
[204.4s] coming again at the well to draw water.
[208.6s] Jesus asked her to call her husband. The
[211.8s] Samaritan woman became sad and said, "I
[215.4s] don't have a husband." Jesus said,
[218.4s] "That's right. You do not have a
[221.2s] husband, but you have had five
[223.7s] husbands."
[227.4s] This man you live with now is not your
[230.9s] husband.
[232.4s] The Samaritan woman said, "I see you are
[236.2s] a prophet. You do not know me, yet you
[239.8s] know everything about me. We say we
[243.2s] should worship at this very mountain.
[246.8s] But you Jews say the right place to
[249.8s] worship is at the temple of Jerusalem."
[253.7s] Jesus said, "You Samaritans know little
[257.9s] about the God you are worshiping.
[261.0s] While we Jews know the God we are
[263.9s] worshiping, for salvation comes from the
[267.0s] Jews. But a time is coming that when
[272.7s] true worshippers will worship the father
[275.5s] in spirit and truth. Those are the ones
[280.0s] God is looking for." And indeed the time
[283.2s] is now. The woman was still confused and
[287.0s] said, "The Messiah, also called the
[290.7s] Christ, is coming and he will explain
[294.6s] everything to us." Jesus told her that
[299.3s] he is the Messiah,
[301.7s] the one you have been waiting for. The
[305.1s] Samaritan woman ran and dropped her
[308.5s] bucket and went to the village and told
[311.9s] everyone to see a man who told her
[315.6s] everything she ever did. Must this be
[318.8s] the Messiah?
[320.9s] The Samaritans came to Jesus and he
[324.0s] preached to them and they were amazed by
[326.6s] his teaching. The disciples came and
[329.2s] asked Jesus
[331.2s] to eat. Jesus said, "I have food that
[335.3s] you do not know. My food is to do my
[338.9s] father's will. You say that harvest is
[343.0s] in 4 months, but I say the fields are
[346.1s] ready for harvest." What does Jesus mean
[350.2s] by by his that his food is doing his
[354.3s] father's will? He meant that doing God's
[357.4s] will is more important than food. What
[360.6s] did he mean that the fields are ready
[363.9s] for harvest? Jesus did not want to be a
[367.0s] farmer. He he meant that the people he
[371.8s] preached to, they were they were ready
[374.8s] to hear the good news and share it to
[377.0s] other people. Amen. Amen.
[380.6s] Jesus is not faced by our sin. Jesus
[384.6s] alone is our living water that fills our
[388.2s] void. Our life should overflow into ex
[391.8s] into into the exaltation of the Messiah.
[395.4s] Worship God in spirit and truth.
[399.4s] Be ready to share the good news at any
[401.8s] time and any place.
[410.5s] Jesus might find us when we least expect
[413.6s] it.
[415.2s] Amen. Amen. Christ presence exposes sin
[419.5s] and makes people quirim but he can
[422.7s] forgive sins and give new life. The
[425.7s] location of worshippers is not nearly
[428.4s] important as the attitude of
[430.7s] worshippers.
[432.2s] It doesn't matter that you come to
[434.3s] church but what matters is how you
[436.9s] worship God.
[440.1s] The living word, Jesus Christ, and the
[443.4s] written word, the Bible, can satisfy our
[446.4s] hungry and thirsty souls. As our bodies
[450.5s] hunger and thirst, so do our souls. It
[453.9s] needs spiritual food and water.
[457.4s] Amen. Amen. I I welcome the chistas to
[463.4s] come sing song number 493.
[467.3s] Like the woman at the well. Stanza one
[469.4s] and two. Stanza one and the chorus only.
