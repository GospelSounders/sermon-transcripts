TIMESTAMPED TRANSCRIPT:
[5.0s] Happy Sabbath. Happy day. Happy day.
[8.2s] Happy. My name is Al Madiba and I'm
[11.5s] going to tell the children's story for
[13.4s] today. But before, let's pray. Dear
[16.7s] Lord, thank you for this day. Thank you
[18.6s] for the gift of life. Lord, as we want
[20.9s] to hear the story, may it guide us
[22.7s] through our lives. In Jesus name we
[24.6s] pray. Amen.
[27.2s] The title of my story for today is
[29.6s] entitled Friends of the
[33.6s] Blacksmith. Once upon a time, a
[36.9s] blacksmith lived in his house in a
[39.0s] village on top of a hill. Every morning,
[42.5s] the children would stop by to see him on
[44.7s] their way to school because he loved
[47.5s] children very much. Each afternoon on
[50.6s] their way home from school, they stepped
[53.7s] by to see him again. He called them his
[57.7s] friends and they had many happy visits.
[60.9s] One day he heard his little friends cry
[63.8s] out on the hillside. Whatever can be the
[66.6s] trouble, he asked himself, "My little
[69.3s] children do not cry unless something is
[72.0s] in the matter. I will go and see what I
[75.3s] can see." He took his hammer with him
[77.7s] and started up the hill. The children
[80.4s] were still crying. I wonder who is
[83.0s] beating my friends. He said as he
[85.9s] hurried along. Then he looked down the
[89.4s] hill. His little friends were running
[92.0s] this way and that way. They was crying
[95.2s] very loudly. When he got closer, he saw
[98.7s] a great lion chasing them. "I must
[101.4s] hurry," he said as he ran with his
[103.8s] hammer. He ran towards the lion as fast
[107.0s] as he could run. Quickly he hit it hard
[110.6s] with the hammer. The lion fell down and
[113.7s] died. Now the children were not crying
[116.8s] anymore. They were ever so happy. They
[120.4s] threw their arms around the blacksmith
[122.9s] and said, "Oh, you are best friend. You
[126.5s] saved our lives. You saved our lives."
[129.4s] That evening in many homes around the
[132.1s] village there was great joy. How
[134.8s] thankful the parents were, how happy the
[137.4s] children were. There is another friend
[140.0s] whom we all know. His name is Jesus. We
[143.9s] are his little children. We are his
[146.3s] friends. He is our
[148.3s] friends. Whenever we want to go
[150.7s] somewhere or do something, we should
[153.1s] talk to him about it. Just as the little
[156.3s] children visited their friends the
[158.8s] blacksmith each morning again at the end
[162.0s] of the day we should tell him what we
[165.2s] did. There is another lion. His name is
[168.9s] Saturn. He often runs after us. But if
[172.7s] we cry to our friend Jesus, he will come
[175.8s] and save us. He is our He is always
[179.2s] ready to come fight Satan for us. for he
[183.0s] has power to overcome. Amen. Amen. Boys
[186.8s] and girls, let us always have Jesus as
[189.8s] our
[191.2s] friend. The memory verse for today is
[195.4s] coming from the book of John 15:14. And
[198.6s] it says, "You are my friends if you do
[202.0s] what I command." Amen. Amen. Let's pray.
[206.4s] Dear Lord, thank you for this day. Thank
[208.6s] you for the gift of life as we
[212.4s] As we know our friend is Jesus, may this
[215.2s] help us in our lives and run to him
[217.4s] whenever Satan comes for us. For it is
[219.7s] in Jesus name we pray. Amen. Amen.
