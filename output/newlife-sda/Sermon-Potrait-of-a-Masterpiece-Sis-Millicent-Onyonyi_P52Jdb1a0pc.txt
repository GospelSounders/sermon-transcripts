FULL TRANSCRIPT:
Happy Sabbath. Happy day. Happy Sabbath again. Happy day. It's a beautiful day. We thank God for his goodness and we thank God that you're all here today. The church is so full. Um during the week we we had a we had good church by by any stretch of the imagination. And I know we had a number of people watching, but today there's a number of you. So I'm quite encouraged by that. Thank you so much for coming uh to to this wonderful service that the Lord has given us. We have been talking about us being a masterpiece that God made us as a masterpiece and he has even made us a new he has actually even in in our destruction in our breaking. Um yes I want to make sure that we are in sync with the people up there. Okay. So, you can see me. Yeah, you don't see my slides. So, hopefully we'll see the slides in a minute. I think there's benefit in um in using multiple senses. At least I like the idea of using pictures. So, that's where I share it. I believe it benefits it benefits us all. Okay. So, the communication team, please assure me that uh we can see the slides. Sister Vain really wanted to come and introduce me. So, let me help her. My name is Millie Centoni. I have two beautiful daughters, a son-in-law and a very handsome grandson. So, I thank God for that. And I keep telling Sister Vain that the rest of it young people and these days on the phone you will quickly Google and find out more about me. So that's who I am. I love the Lord because he's good. He's been good to me and I will sing of his mercies forever and I will tell generations to come of the goodness of the Lord. So I don't see the slides and I don't see corros. So I don't know what that means. Uh I'm trying not to be anxious for anything [Laughter] but uh and I'm praying uh and trying to stay calm but uh my message is so dependent on these pictures that I will be a bit discombobulated if I uh I don't see them. So is it me? Um, is Koros here today now that he's my crutch? Okay. So, I've done something that he kept telling me to do. So, I hope that will help. Okay. Okay. Let me in the interest of time, let me let me keep going. But the first I can I can describe it and hopefully you will use your God-given imagination. Um let us pray together. Thank you Jesus so much for your goodness, for your mercy, for your love, for your grace for this week of emphasis when we have learned more about women and we've seen your hand. I pray Lord that as we finalize you will encourage our hearts, lift us up, draw us close to you, make yourself clear that we will not fear of anything but we will go forth because we can call you father daddy you have adopted us into your kingdom. Accept our prayer, accept our service today is my prayer in Jesus name. Amen. Yeah. So the first slide I have actually is is um God molding us as he is the porter like the song that we sang for we are God's own handiwork and even the children's sermon was based on it Ephesians 2 uh verse 10 I hope that the whole of this week and you can go and and and and look at the the the on YouTube you will see that we have emphasized and re-emphasized that we are God's handiwork you know create creat created in Christ Jesus, born a new. We have been born again, that we may do those good works which God predestined. That is, he planned beforehand. I'm reading from the amplified version for us, taking paths which he prepared ahead of time, that we should walk in them, living the good life which he pre-arranged and made ready for us to live. He has made a good life for us to live. He has made us to do good works and and and we should we should feel like a masterpiece. And today that's what we are going to dwell on. I just want to quickly run through what we talked about during the week. We talked about letting your light shine. We are the salt. We are the light. And I and I saw Dr. Wangai and I wanted to testify. I wanted to give him his flowers. Many people don't know that actually I became an Adventist out of his ministry. I was a young girl in form three and Dr. Wangai came all the way to Kenya girls in Ambu. A lot of you may not even know where Kenya girls is. Those days the road was not as good. Somebody's waving. The roads was they were not as good as you see them today. It was a long way away and Dr. Wangai and some other uh friends of his in a group of ministry were ministering in school and that is how I became an Adventist. Let your light shine. When you go out to these schools, you don't know who is coming forth. Let your light shine. You are the salt of the earth. Do not be intimidated. The Lord has made you an Esther for such a time as this. Thank you so much, Berea, for for making us feel like Jesus has risen in your song. Let your light shine. Thank you so much, Kanyaka. I'm trying to deal with this international part. But thank you for being international, for deciding that you are international. We praise God for that and and and for for for uh reminding us not to let our hearts be troubled even when we see locals as international. So you know and and thank you also for the mass choir for the for the women ministry choir bile si nishiko kono let your light shine the one of the ladies there was sitting uh next to me and she told me that this week I used to be one of them who was so afraid of going in front to do something but now I'm encouraged. This little light of mine I'm going to let it shine. It is in the shining of the little one that you grow to this big one. And I wish I had the slides but we will move on. God is good. Then we talked about identity and we said that we are saved by grace. This Ephesians 2:10 actually the best part to read it is from 8, you know 8 9 and 10. For we are saved by grace, not of works, lest any man should boast. Because God has made us, we are his handiwork. He has made us a new to do good works. So we the stamp upon us is that we are saved by grace. Here come the people who know what to do. While some of us may Isn't it this one? It's this one. No. Okay, it's the one. Say that again. Don't worry. We are the network is with us. So he said the network is poor. But the good thing is the network is is with me. Okay. So we are saved by grace. We talked we talked about Rahab. Pastor Pastor G was telling me yesterday that when you are preaching, make sure you have your sermon in three places. So don't worry, I have the sermon. Ah, and then we talked about being intentional. Being intentional and today I can actually see the women ministry are intentional. They are so smartly dressed. All I want to say that let it not just be outward. Let it also be inward. Let let us let us let us see that beauty coming out. You know, it's so beautiful. I said to myself, my goodness, I need to go and look for my my blue outfit, my white shirt, my beret. So that when I'm invited in these places, I look the part. You look good. You do look good. But find your purpose. Find your purpose like Mary, the mother of Jesus. And then we talked about intimacy. Can your children call you blessed? Can your children call you blessed? Are you allowing your children to become what God has prepared them to be? Or you want them to become what you wanted to become? Let me not even say that what you want them to become. What you wanted because when you grew up, everybody had to be a doctor like one guy. So I don't know who was going to be the nurse, who was going to be the receptionist, who was going to clean the doctor's office. So our children need to go the way God wants them to go that they may call us blessed and also that our husbands may praise us. And I tell you yesterday as we were leaving I heard Elder Lumumba praising his wife Vain. Vain, by the way, you're an amazing woman. Because I was telling my sister that, you know, uh she she said she knows my other sister and I was telling her that, "Oh, you know, Vain is the leader of women ministry, new life." And she said, "Oh my goodness, Vain is a very classy woman." I said, "Oh, have you visited Vin's house?" Because in Proverbs, we said, "Your husband will praise you if you're a good homemaker." If we come to your house, we can tell why your husband may not praise you. We will not in USA. But I want to tell you that yesterday, Elder Lubmba was saying to us, Sister Roslin, that you know, I was just telling Rosaline that my wife reminds me of my late mother. Do you know that is the height of a compliment from a man? What do you remind your husband of Then we talked about growing in faith and we said um you know let's take uh when we talked about Joabed and the initiative she took to put her son in the um in the river and we said just be calm, celebrate God's goodness, ask for God's help, let God be God and meditate on good things. And I wanted to say by the way uh on the intimacy part to thank my husband who took some time to come and worship with us. He's away in the village so he's not able to attend with us today. But my sister in talking about intimacy and relationships, my sister was with me through the week. It encouraged my heart. Today she's with her daughter Subira. she's serving uh uh in music there and uh also with our friend Mary. So, thank you so much for coming to be with me at this time. I appreciate it. And then finally we talked about legacy and the the text that we came out with is a beautiful text in Proverbs 29:2 which we should all highlight that when the godly are in authority the people rejoice but when the wicked are in power they groan. Hey, hey, hey. You should see old people when they are suffering it and young people too. And authority is in your house. Authority is in your office. Authority is in your church office. Authority is everywhere. Are people groaning or people rejoicing under your watch? And we talked about Deborah. Today we are going to look at a portrait of a masterpiece Abigail. And the the lady who gave the children's sermon, she talked about a the the the masterpiece being like a picture and you know there are few masterpieces in the world. They are few. They are held in museums you know. So there there is there is there is uh some great masterpieces by Michelangelo in Italy. You know there is some great paintings in in uh uh the Louv in Paris. These they are they are rare. This is what and this is what God is putting on us stamping on us as a masterpiece. You are rare. You are special. You are made a new even even in your brokenness. God has made you a new. We talked about Rahab and the scarlet the scarlet um rod that she put out to accept what God had given us. I am a masterpiece. It is interesting how it is very difficult for us to understand the grace of God that makes us a masterpiece. It is not of yourself. It is not of anything that you have done. It is not of anything that you will ever do. It is an assurance from our God that you are a masterpiece. I only wish you could see the picture. Oh dear. Uhhuh. Are you coming to try and so that they can see the portrait? Uhhuh. So you want to save uh this is uh okay. So bear with us uh because he needs to save the the presentation so that we can get that will be of good because you can see the pictures. The pictures are uh um it's beautiful. I'm conscious of your time. So just allow you will allow us to how much time will you need? It's done. We'll ask the musical team, why don't you play have thine own way so that our hearts don't worry so much about technology. Yeah, we're good. I think I am [Music] just I have it here, but I hope I will lose it today. But I have it here. Don't worry. Okay. Okay. That is the masterpiece of our young people. You know, we thank God for them. They are techsavvy. They will sort us out. But in the meantime, we are all masterpieces in our own way. So don't worry. We said during the week that however much effort you make as a bass, you can't sing supran. So don't worry about somebody else's masterpiece, isn't it? However much effort you make, the violin cannot become the the trumpet, the clarinet, the saxophone. My niece is looking at me like really? So everybody has a part that they that they play. So our key text is uh in uh 1st Samuel 25:33. Our masterpiece portrait is going to be Abigail. I hope I said that right. My daughter was like, "Mommy, is is it Abigail or is it Abigail?" Let's stick with that big guy. So, 1 Samuel 25:33 in the Amplified Bible, it says, "And blessed be your discretion and your discernment, and blessed be you who has kept me from bloodshed this day, and from avenging myself by my own hand." So, in 1 Samuel 25, 1 Samuel 25, just go and read it. It's only one chapter. It's very short. I I was thinking of reading it, but no, I want to wet your appetite to go and read it. It is there are three characters. Nabal, Abigail, and David. And the setting now just just just use your God-given imagination. The setting is in a wilderness. And I just want to give you Okay, I just want to give you David's um I mean Nabal's the profile of Nabal and the profile profile of of David. Okay, so I'm losing it as we go, but let me read it for you. So Nabal, the Bible says Nabal was very rich. The Bible doesn't say he was rich. It actually says he was very rich. Okay, you can go and do the math. But it's interesting the Bible says imagine if somebody said like now Vain was coming to introduce me this is the introduction or this is the introduction that somebody's send you your profile cuz they always say when you're speaking please send us your profile. Nebul was very rich. He was rough. He was insolent. He was evil. He was sirly and mean. He was a fool. He was arrogant. He was unapproachable. He was defiant. He was greedy. Do you know somebody like that? Are they sitting next to you? Don't look at them. David in the same context. David was the anointed king. At that time, he was already anointed king. He was a fugitive running away from soul. Vain and elder. Just relax. Don't worry. We will by the time they sort it out, maybe we'll show the picture at the Oh, look at that. There you go. Wonderful. Thank you for uh hustling for me. Thank you, David. David's profile, David. In the meantime, he was an anointed king already. He was a fugitive, but he's kind. He has an army of 600 but he's tenderhearted and he's humble. Okay. David was king at by this point vers chapter 25. It is in chapter 17 uh uh uh that he had actually already killed Goliath. So people are already talking about David. David was big. Okay. But David was hungry, angry, lonely and tired. So when you're in this whole situation, be very very very careful because a hungry man normally is an angry man. Okay? He was lonely because the Bible starts by saying that the the the the prophet had died. Okay? Prophet Samuel who anointed David had died. So, and if if you read if you know the story of David, uh uh Samuel was like his mentor. So, Samuel has died. He has been buried. He's in Saul is chasing him. He's in some wilderness. He's taking care of Nabel's property. And this is how things are going. So, he sends his men, 10 men. He sends only 10 men to go to Nabal's place and tell Nabal, "Please, we have been taking care of your things, but now it is harvest time. We hear you sharing goats. Please send us something so that we can share with you." Naniabal Nani, you know what he said? Who is David? Who is David? who David Nani we have heard of so many servants masquerading here this is surely you think that the whole of Israel did not know what had happened between David and Goliath and Nabal he's rude he's foolish he's all these things and that is how he responds in the meantime nothing is said of Abigail in that story until that time and then we come upon Abigail. Okay. So we move to the the the the portrait now of the masterpiece. What does the masterpiece look like? Abigail. So I'll give you the D's of the masterpiece. Abigail is discerning. Abigail is discreet. Abigail is decent. Abigail is a diffuser. And Abigail is deure. M now the young people I'm giving I'm giving something isn't it my niece will say yes you're giving vocabulary yes you also come to church to improve your vocabulary yes so Abigail is discerning what does it mean to be discerning oh there you go let's go to the next one does it mean to be discerning. Yeah. The Bible actually even says that she shows good judgment. Abigail shows good judgment. She is careful. She has keen insight and she is thoughtful and evaluates the subtleties, those things which are not said. And and good judgment is is common sense. Yet you can imagine how sometimes common sense is so uncommon. Uh David has been taking care those days there was no army as such. So David's army was taking care of the area where Nabal lived. And the servant actually goes and says to to to uh Abigail that e my mistress or Abigail, do you know that when we were with David and his men, they took care of us. We had nothing to worry about. But they have come to Nabal and asked him to give him something and he he was rude. He was insolent and said he doesn't want to hear them. Please, please, please do something because David is going to finish us. But not a big guy. Who are you? What kind of person are you when there is in times of trouble? Do you show excuse me, do you show good judgment? Are you able to sense that this person has been good to me? Let me reciprocate. Let me talk to relatives. So sometimes it's interesting how relatives can turn against their own relatives, especially the ones who have been good to them. I guess that is not Christian. That is that is foolishness. That is how the Bible describes Nabal. But look at Abigail. She has keen insight. Insight. It is not just information. She's able to know what to tell uh Nabal and what not to tell him. So she decides, eh, I better go and sort this thing out before things go bad. She is careful. She is careful. She's discerning. Even her her servant says to her, "Please consider otherwise we might be in trouble." and she is thoughtful. She evaluates the subtleties. She knows that this situation can escalate. Nobody has told her, by the way. She she's just been told that David is out there with many warriors. But she can be able to tell the subtleties to know that David has just killed Goliath. What about me and my house? I better quickly go and sort this thing out before it escalates. She is discerning. Then she is discreet. She is discreet. The next the next slide. What does it mean to be discreet? She is subtle. She is subtle. You know the Bible says she's married to the very rich man. When the servants told her she could have ordered them all to come and let us go and see. But it's very interesting what Abigail does. Abigail says she puts the things together. She loads them to the serpents. Then she says, "You guys go ahead. I am coming." She's coming alone in a dunkey. Some of us we are very rich and everybody must know. So when we arrive, no not Abigail, not this masterpiece. She is subtle. She's relying on herself and the the the the the the wisdom that God is going to give her to deal with with David. She is tactful and diplomatic. H you should go and read this chapter 25. Very tactful. When she talks to David, she says, "Hey King, surely are you going to mess up your whole legacy because of a foolish neighbor? She doesn't go there and say, "Hey, I know it's bad. I know it's this. I know." No, no, no, no, no, no, no. She's tactful and diplomatic. She says, "Surely you are already king. Don't mess up yourself because of a foolish Nabal." She encourages him and reminds him of his assignment. He says, "You know, my God has already given you such a great assignment. Don't mess it up." How tactful and diplomatic. She's careful in speech. Look at her. She goes and says, "I I I was not aware that this was happening." She doesn't go there and say, "Forget my stupid husband." Although she does say that, by the way, don't worry. He's a fool. But that's not what she leads with. She says, "I was not aware that this is what happened. Please, please, please forgive us. I am now here." Okay, she's careful in speech. And then she's she's aware of the social cues. She's aware that David is mourning. She's aware that David's ego has been injured. She's aware that that David has power that if it is not tamed, they can be destroyed. But above all, somebody who is discreet is respectful. I wish you could just show them um slide 10. If you could show slide 10 just for you to see the portrait, the picture that represents how uh Abigail approaches approaches uh the situation. If you find slide uh 10, that will be useful. Okay. Yes. Yes. Yes. Just look at that. In fact, in some place I'm going to the Bible is very interesting. The Bible says that she even curtsies. Curtsy. You know Katsy when you think Katsy you think what? Royal that is how diplomatic she is. She's married to a very rich man. It is not beneath her to show humility. That is that is just just picture the situ. David has arrived. By the way, it says David arrived with 400 men. 400 men. That is can what what can happen when you're upset? He is annoyed. He is like, "God, help me. If there's any man in that family that is going to survive. Can you imagine how annoyed somebody can get if you are not discerning? It can go by." He arrives. He had sent only 10 by the way. Only 10. By the way, if you read the Bible, it says when he sent the 10, he said, "Peace, peace be with you, Naba." When they brought the message back, he was like, "Who? Me? David, who killed Goliath with 600 men? You 200 remain here. Take care of the things." 420. This is what Abigail was facing. So this is why when we are saying that she is discerning, she's discreet, she's decent. Let's look at the the part where we talking about her decency. Let's look at the part where we're now talking about her decency. What is a decent person? She is kind. She is kind. And her kindness can be seen in the way she's dealing with the servants. Which servant can come and tell you that your home is about to be destroyed if you are not kind? If you are unkind, the servant will be like, "Finally, the Lord has done it for me." Isn't that so? That is the way some of us treat our servants and the day of danger they will say finally. But no, Abigail is decent. She is kind. The servant runs to her and says, "Please, please, please, please, please, I know you can do this." But apart from that, when she packs the food, she packs food not only for the king. Some of us are only just concerned about the powers that be. But she packs food even for the kings. Man, it reminds you of Rebecca, isn't it? She's like, I will not only give water to you, but I will also give to your your animals. She's kind. She's empathetic. She is like, I need to rush to diffuse this situation so that my family is not destroyed. But most importantly, a decent person is generous. I hope you're going to read this just at lunchtime. Will you? She is hasty. The Bible says she she takes haste. She's quick. She puts 200 loaves. 200 loaves. I wonder when I don't know when she's baking this woman. Hey, can we readily find 200 loaves even in my house? In case of Vita, she has 200 loaves. Her husband is very rich. Two skins of wine, five sheep, five measures of grain, 100 clusters of raisins, 200 cakes of figs. Sheep. She's like, e, let me go and pacify him with generosity. When was the last time you were you even gave a bottle of water? We are not asking for 200 loaves. I've heard them saying that now it is one offering that covers everything. Hallelujah. I used to be in charge of stewardship and it was not easy. Every department wanted to come to the pull pit. Now we collect everything and we divide it. She was generous. She was civil. She was civil. She was civil. She was she she she she knew that the right thing to do was to reciprocate when somebody has helped you. Am I civil? When somebody has helped you, when somebody has raised you, you came from, you know, somebody has raised you with his wife and you have now become this grace great person. Are you civil? Are you able to reciprocate? Or when you are told, hey, so and so's child is having trouble. Who is so and so? Who is so and so? I've heard even some people say, what's what's the big deal? These days we are equal. Really, that is a bad attitude and is not the portrait of a masterpiece. Then she's a diffuser. She's a diffuser. No, there are so many ways of thinking of a diffuser. Even that, you know, it's just somebody who who cools things off, isn't it? She's a diffuser of good vibes. If you if you go to Google, she tell you a diffuser of good vibes. She's she's positive. Her humility, her kneeling, it just it just calmed a very escalated situation. She avoids escalation. When she arrives, she's beautiful. The Bible says she's beautiful. She arrives. She she she she cuts. She falls before him. Even the king is like go cho. You know there's a way you can arrive and people are like okay. The man has 400 warriors with him. She's calm. She is emotionally controlled. A masterpiece. She doesn't panic. I love it. She doesn't panic when she's told that eh things are bad or even when she sees imagine if you go and find that the person you were thinking was going to help you have he has 400 men 400 some of us would be like wait where do I start she is calm she is calm and she avoids escalation she's able to resolve the conflict with diplomacy by appealing to the greatness of David. She is a diffuser. And finally, young people, she is deure. She is demure. If you read uh uh if you go to uh you search, the word deure was used a lot to describe young ladies. Okay. Now, some people are saying that you know when you say that we are modest, maybe you are putting us down. Uh-uh. But Abigail is demure. She is modest. She is modest despite the fact that she has so much wealth around her. She decides to to to ask the servants to go away ahead of ahead of her so that she doesn't come out arrogant. She doesn't come out rich. She doesn't come out as a showoff. She moves gently. She moves quietly. Our young people, everything that happens in your life, we know. Even when you have gone to a hotel which doesn't belong to anybody you ever heard of, you want to show us that your life is over there. Please be a masterpiece. Move quietly. Move silently. Be deure. Have some discretion. Let us find out what is going on in your in your life. She is humble. She is humble. I've already shown you her humility. She actually the Bible says in in in um amplified she says she she fell on her face and did an obeisance which is really curtsy. Wow. Wow. This is the humility that diffuses a hot temper. She is observant. She's observant. She's conscious of what is going on around her. She knows what is happening with David. And she knows that this his fuse is very small and it can blow up. And finally, she's sensitive to she's sensitive to others. She's sensitive to Nabal. She doesn't tell Nabal what is going on because she doesn't know what will happen. When she comes back, she finds Nabal in a party drinking so drunk. She decides, "Mm- let me not say anything." She waits until the following day when she tells Nabal what happened. Nabal just collapses. He gets a stroke. True story. 10 days later, he dies. Go and read the end for yourself. a portrait of a masterpiece. When we introduce you, what profile are we going to talk about? Are we going to say you're discerning, you're discreet, you're decent, you're a diffuser, you're demand. And how then can I become a masterpiece? How then can I become a masterpiece? And thanks to the the the the ladies at the general conference who wrote our material for this week. Abide abide a always seek God's presence. Believe in his promises intimately walk with him intimately. intimately. Read his word. Study it constantly. Remained plugged in. Depend on his strength. Just know that God is always working behind the scenes. Oh, we saw him working. We saw him working. He goes ahead of Abigail. He goes ahead of Joabed. He goes ahead of Mary. He goes ahead of Esther. Our God is always working behind the scenes. Depend on his strength and endure in faith in this world. We will have trouble. Not we might. We will. John 16:33. We will have it. What will make us a masterpiece is our ability to endure. So finally once again let's remind ourselves as we close for we are God's own handiwork. I am God's own handy work his workmanship recreated in Christ Jesus born and new that we may do those good works. We may do those good works. We may do those good works. Which good works? We may show discernment. We may be discreet. We may be decent. We may be diffusers. We may be demure. I mean Abigail that is where our our text came from. Abigail was able to say, "Make David say, "Wow, blessed be your discretion and discernment and blessed be you who has kept me from bloodshed." Can you imagine the ability to stop an angry man with 400 men backing him up? That is good works which God created in Abigail and she is now doing it. So may God help us to to remember that we should walk in these good works living the good life which he pre-arranged and made ready for us to live. And surely we cannot close the weak without asking. Who then wants to stand and say, "Lord, make me a new and help me to live like your masterpiece." Please stand as we pray together. Let us pray. Dear Jesus, thank you. Thank you for this beautiful stories that fill the Bible, that remind us again and again of your glory, of your goodness, of your greatness, of the good works that you predestined for us to do. Thank you for the promise that you have made us a new. We are your workmanship. We are a masterpiece. Please help us not to have a profile like Nbles of foolishness, of meanness, of greed, of everything wrong that is possible. Help us Lord not to be given up to our sin but save us and make us like Abigail decent discerning discrete demure that when you come again for us Lord you will say to us well done good and faithful servant we long for that day because it's our prayer in Jesus name amen God bless you thank Thank you communication team.

[69.3s] don't see my slides. So, hopefully we'll
[71.4s] see the slides in a minute.
[73.8s] I think there's benefit in um in using
[77.4s] multiple senses. At least I like the
[79.4s] idea of using pictures. So, that's where
[81.7s] I share it. I believe it benefits it
[84.1s] benefits us all.
[87.1s] Okay. So, the communication team, please
[90.0s] assure me that uh
[92.7s] we can see the slides.
[101.8s] Sister Vain really wanted to come and
[103.4s] introduce me. So, let me help her. My
[107.2s] name is Millie Centoni.
[111.0s] I have two beautiful daughters, a
[113.4s] son-in-law and a very handsome grandson.
[117.0s] So, I thank God for that. And I keep
[119.5s] telling Sister Vain that the rest of it
[122.4s] young people and these days on the phone
[124.6s] you will quickly Google and find out
[126.6s] more about me. So that's who I am. I
[130.1s] love the Lord because he's good. He's
[133.7s] been good to me and I will sing of his
[138.2s] mercies forever and I will tell
[141.0s] generations to come of the goodness of
[143.7s] the Lord.
[145.8s] So I don't see the slides and I don't
[148.4s] see corros. So I don't know what that
[150.4s] means.
[153.0s] Uh
[154.9s] I'm trying not to be anxious for
[156.4s] anything
[158.9s] [Laughter]
[162.5s] but uh
[165.0s] and I'm praying uh and trying to stay
[168.1s] calm but uh my message is so dependent
[171.9s] on these pictures that I will be a bit
[174.4s] discombobulated if I uh I don't see
[177.4s] them. So is it me? Um, is Koros here
[181.0s] today
[182.6s] now that he's my crutch?
[191.1s] Okay. So, I've done something that he
[192.9s] kept telling me to do. So, I hope that
[195.0s] will help.
[203.1s] Okay. Okay. Let me in the interest of
[205.4s] time, let me let me keep going. But the
[207.7s] first I can I can describe it and
[209.8s] hopefully you will use your God-given
[211.3s] imagination. Um let us pray together.
[214.7s] Thank you Jesus so much for your
[216.2s] goodness, for your mercy, for your love,
[218.1s] for your grace
[220.2s] for this week of emphasis when we have
[222.3s] learned more about women and we've seen
[224.9s] your hand. I pray Lord that as we
[228.3s] finalize you will encourage our hearts,
[230.6s] lift us up, draw us close to you, make
[233.0s] yourself clear that we will not fear of
[236.2s] anything but we will go forth because we
[240.1s] can call you father daddy you have
[243.0s] adopted us into your kingdom. Accept our
[245.5s] prayer, accept our service today is my
[247.8s] prayer in Jesus name. Amen. Yeah. So the
[251.4s] first slide I have actually is is um God
[255.9s] molding us as he is the porter like the
[260.0s] song that we sang for we are God's own
[262.6s] handiwork and even the children's sermon
[264.8s] was based on it Ephesians 2 uh verse 10
[267.3s] I hope that the whole of this week and
[269.2s] you can go and and and and look at the
[271.1s] the the on YouTube you will see that we
[274.2s] have emphasized and re-emphasized that
[276.2s] we are God's handiwork
[279.3s] you know create creat created in Christ
[281.8s] Jesus, born a new. We have been born
[285.1s] again, that we may do those good works
[288.5s] which God predestined. That is, he
[291.6s] planned beforehand. I'm reading from the
[293.4s] amplified version for us, taking paths
[296.2s] which he prepared ahead of time, that we
[298.7s] should walk in them, living the good
[301.7s] life which he pre-arranged and made
[304.8s] ready for us to live. He has made a good
[307.8s] life for us to live. He has made us to
[310.0s] do good works and and and we should we
[312.7s] should feel like a masterpiece. And
[314.9s] today that's what we are going to dwell
[316.4s] on. I just want to quickly run through
[319.5s] what we talked about during the week. We
[321.4s] talked about letting your light shine.
[323.9s] We are the salt. We are the light. And I
[326.4s] and I saw Dr. Wangai and I wanted to
[328.7s] testify. I wanted to give him his
[330.5s] flowers.
[332.2s] Many people don't know that actually I
[333.8s] became an Adventist out of his ministry.
[338.6s] I was a young girl in form three
[342.1s] and Dr. Wangai came all the way to Kenya
[345.0s] girls in Ambu. A lot of you may not even
[346.9s] know where Kenya girls is. Those days
[349.2s] the road was not as good. Somebody's
[350.9s] waving. The roads was they were not as
[352.7s] good as you see them today. It was a
[355.0s] long way away and Dr. Wangai and some
[358.4s] other uh friends of his in a group of
[361.1s] ministry were ministering in school and
[363.8s] that is how I became an Adventist. Let
[365.8s] your light shine. When you go out to
[368.2s] these schools, you don't know who is
[370.2s] coming forth. Let your light shine.
[374.6s] You are the salt of the earth. Do not be
[377.0s] intimidated. The Lord has made you an
[378.7s] Esther for such a time as this. Thank
[381.9s] you so much, Berea, for for making us
[384.4s] feel like Jesus has risen in your song.
[387.7s] Let your light shine. Thank you so much,
[390.2s] Kanyaka. I'm trying to deal with this
[392.1s] international part. But thank you
[395.8s] for being international, for deciding
[397.6s] that you are international.
[399.8s] We praise God for that and and and for
[402.7s] for for uh reminding us not to let our
[406.3s] hearts be troubled even when we see
[408.4s] locals as international.
[410.7s] So
[413.0s] you know and and thank you also for the
[414.7s] mass choir for the for the women
[417.4s] ministry choir bile si nishiko
[423.0s] kono let your light shine the one of the
[424.6s] ladies there was sitting uh next to me
[427.0s] and she told me that this week I used to
[429.2s] be one of them who was so afraid of
[431.2s] going in front to do something but now
[433.2s] I'm encouraged. This little light of
[436.4s] mine I'm going to let it shine. It is in
[440.3s] the shining of the little one that you
[442.8s] grow to this big one. And I wish I had
[445.5s] the slides but we will move on. God is
[448.5s] good. Then we talked about identity and
[451.6s] we said that we are saved by grace. This
[454.4s] Ephesians 2:10 actually the best part to
[457.4s] read it is from 8, you know 8 9 and 10.
[463.1s] For we are saved by grace, not of works,
[467.0s] lest any man should boast. Because God
[469.8s] has made us, we are his handiwork. He
[473.6s] has made us a new to do good works. So
[476.6s] we the stamp upon us is that we are
[479.7s] saved by grace. Here come the people who
[481.8s] know what to do.
[485.5s] While some of us may Isn't it this one?
[487.8s] It's this one. No.
[494.9s] Okay,
[497.7s] it's the one.
[502.2s] Say that again.
[504.3s] Don't worry. We are the network is with
[506.6s] us. So he said the network is poor. But
[509.7s] the good thing is the network is is with
[511.4s] me. Okay. So we are saved by grace. We
[515.2s] talked we talked about Rahab. Pastor
[517.6s] Pastor G was telling me yesterday that
[519.5s] when you are preaching, make sure you
[520.6s] have your sermon in three places. So
[523.3s] don't worry, I have the sermon.
[526.4s] Ah, and then we talked about being
[529.4s] intentional. Being intentional and today
[532.6s] I can actually see the women ministry
[534.5s] are intentional. They are so smartly
[536.8s] dressed. All I want to say that let it
[539.4s] not just be outward.
[542.1s] Let it also be inward. Let let us let us
[545.7s] let us see that beauty
[548.4s] coming out. You know, it's so beautiful.
[551.1s] I said to myself, my goodness, I need to
[552.9s] go and look for my my blue outfit, my
[556.2s] white shirt, my beret. So that when I'm
[559.3s] invited in these places, I look the
[561.2s] part. You look good. You do look good.
[564.1s] But find your purpose. Find your purpose
[567.2s] like Mary, the mother of Jesus. And then
[569.8s] we talked about intimacy.
[572.4s] Can your children call you blessed? Can
[575.0s] your children call you blessed? Are you
[576.7s] allowing your children to become what
[578.6s] God has prepared them to be? Or you want
[581.1s] them to become what you wanted to
[583.2s] become?
[585.2s] Let me not even say that what you want
[586.7s] them to become. What you wanted because
[588.6s] when you grew up, everybody had to be a
[591.0s] doctor like one guy. So I don't know who
[593.5s] was going to be the nurse, who was going
[594.9s] to be the receptionist, who was going to
[596.8s] clean the doctor's office.
[600.1s] So our children need to go the way God
[602.9s] wants them to go that they may call us
[604.9s] blessed and also that our husbands may
[607.9s] praise us. And I tell you yesterday as
[610.6s] we were leaving I heard Elder Lumumba
[612.8s] praising his wife Vain.
[616.1s] Vain, by the way, you're an amazing
[617.4s] woman. Because I was telling my sister
[619.6s] that, you know, uh she she said she
[622.7s] knows my other sister and I was telling
[624.2s] her that, "Oh, you know, Vain is the
[626.1s] leader of women ministry, new life." And
[627.8s] she said, "Oh my goodness, Vain is a
[629.8s] very classy woman." I said, "Oh, have
[633.4s] you visited Vin's house?" Because in
[636.2s] Proverbs, we said, "Your husband will
[638.8s] praise you if you're a good homemaker."
[642.2s] If we come to your house, we can tell
[644.2s] why your husband may not praise you.
[648.0s] We will not in USA.
[651.0s] But I want to tell you that yesterday,
[653.6s] Elder Lubmba was saying to us, Sister
[656.2s] Roslin, that you know, I was just
[658.2s] telling Rosaline that my wife reminds me
[661.3s] of my late mother.
[663.6s] Do you know that is the height of a
[664.8s] compliment from a man?
[669.2s] What do you remind your husband of
[684.4s] Then we talked about growing in faith
[687.2s] and we said um you know let's take uh
[691.8s] when we talked about Joabed and the
[693.4s] initiative she took to put her son in
[696.2s] the um in the river and we said just be
[700.2s] calm, celebrate God's goodness, ask for
[702.6s] God's help, let God be God and meditate
[705.4s] on good things. And I wanted to say by
[707.5s] the way uh on the intimacy part to thank
[710.0s] my husband who took some time to come
[711.6s] and worship with us. He's away in the
[713.8s] village so he's not able to attend with
[715.5s] us today. But my sister in talking about
[718.2s] intimacy and relationships, my sister
[720.2s] was with me through the week. It
[721.6s] encouraged my heart. Today she's with
[723.7s] her daughter Subira. she's serving uh uh
[726.8s] in music there and uh also with our
[730.2s] friend Mary. So, thank you so much for
[732.6s] coming to be with me at this time. I
[735.2s] appreciate it. And then finally we
[737.6s] talked about legacy and the the text
[740.5s] that we came out with is a beautiful
[742.6s] text in Proverbs 29:2
[745.3s] which we should all highlight that when
[747.1s] the godly are in authority
[750.1s] the people rejoice but when the wicked
[753.1s] are in power they groan.
[757.0s] Hey, hey, hey.
[761.7s] You should see old people when they are
[763.2s] suffering it and young people too. And
[767.8s] authority is in your house. Authority is
[771.2s] in your office. Authority is in your
[774.1s] church office. Authority is everywhere.
[777.3s] Are people groaning or people rejoicing
[781.3s] under your watch? And we talked about
[784.1s] Deborah.
[785.8s] Today
[787.5s] we are going to look at a portrait of a
[789.7s] masterpiece Abigail. And the the lady
[793.0s] who gave the children's sermon, she
[795.0s] talked about a the the the
[798.6s] masterpiece being like a picture and you
[802.2s] know there are few masterpieces in the
[804.4s] world. They are few. They are held in
[806.3s] museums you know. So there there is
[808.6s] there is there is uh some great
[810.7s] masterpieces by Michelangelo in Italy.
[813.5s] You know there is some great paintings
[816.2s] in in uh uh the Louv in Paris. These
[819.6s] they are they are rare. This is what and
[823.2s] this is what God is putting on us
[825.8s] stamping on us as a masterpiece. You are
[828.1s] rare. You are special. You are made a
[831.8s] new
[833.5s] even even in your brokenness.
[836.6s] God has made you a new. We talked about
[838.6s] Rahab and the scarlet the scarlet um rod
[843.0s] that she put out to accept what God had
[845.8s] given us. I am a masterpiece. It is
[849.8s] interesting how it is very difficult for
[851.8s] us to understand the grace of God that
[855.2s] makes us a masterpiece.
[858.3s] It is not of yourself. It is not of
[861.3s] anything that you have done. It is not
[863.4s] of anything that you will ever do. It is
[866.2s] an assurance from our God that you are a
[870.4s] masterpiece. I only wish you could see
[873.0s] the picture. Oh dear. Uhhuh. Are you
[875.9s] coming to try and so that they can see
[877.6s] the portrait?
[879.8s] Uhhuh. So you want to save uh this is uh
[886.0s] okay.
[888.2s] So bear with us uh because he needs to
[891.5s] save the the presentation so that we can
[894.2s] get
[895.7s] that will be of good because you can see
[897.2s] the pictures. The pictures are uh um
[901.8s] it's beautiful. I'm conscious of your
[903.8s] time. So just allow you will allow us to
[906.6s] how much time will you need? It's done.
[913.1s] We'll ask the musical team, why don't
[915.0s] you play have thine own way so that our
[917.8s] hearts don't worry so much about
[920.0s] technology.
[921.9s] Yeah, we're good.
[926.5s] I think I am
[934.5s] [Music]
[937.5s] just
[945.0s] I have it here, but I hope I will lose
[947.3s] it today. But I have it here. Don't
[949.0s] worry.
[954.5s] Okay.
[956.9s] Okay.
[959.4s] That is the masterpiece of our young
[961.1s] people. You know, we thank God for them.
[964.2s] They are techsavvy. They will sort us
[966.2s] out. But in the meantime, we are all
[969.2s] masterpieces in our own way. So don't
[971.9s] worry. We said during the week
[974.8s] that however much effort you make as a
[976.7s] bass, you can't sing supran.
[981.2s] So don't worry about somebody else's
[983.2s] masterpiece, isn't it? However much
[986.0s] effort you make, the violin cannot
[989.7s] become the
[993.4s] the trumpet, the clarinet,
[998.6s] the saxophone.
[1000.4s] My niece is looking at me like really?
[1004.0s] So everybody has a part that they that
[1007.7s] they play.
[1009.8s] So our key text is uh in uh 1st Samuel
[1014.6s] 25:33. Our masterpiece portrait is going
[1018.1s] to be Abigail.
[1021.0s] I hope I said that right. My daughter
[1022.6s] was like, "Mommy, is is it Abigail or is
[1024.9s] it Abigail?"
[1028.6s] Let's stick with that big guy. So, 1
[1032.4s] Samuel 25:33
[1035.0s] in the Amplified Bible, it says, "And
[1037.2s] blessed be your discretion and your
[1040.0s] discernment, and blessed be you who has
[1043.4s] kept me from bloodshed this day, and
[1047.5s] from avenging myself by my own hand."
[1051.7s] So, in 1 Samuel 25, 1 Samuel 25, just go
[1055.8s] and read it. It's only one chapter.
[1060.8s] It's very short. I I was thinking of
[1062.6s] reading it, but no, I want to wet your
[1064.3s] appetite to go and read it. It is there
[1067.1s] are three characters.
[1069.1s] Nabal,
[1071.8s] Abigail,
[1073.4s] and David.
[1075.7s] And the setting now just just just use
[1079.0s] your God-given imagination. The setting
[1081.4s] is in a wilderness.
[1084.5s] And I just want to give you
[1094.3s] Okay, I just want to give you David's um
[1097.6s] I mean Nabal's the profile of Nabal and
[1100.7s] the profile profile of of David. Okay,
[1108.1s] so I'm losing it as we go, but
[1111.4s] let me read it for you.
[1114.3s] So Nabal, the Bible says Nabal was very
[1117.6s] rich. The Bible doesn't say he was rich.
[1120.6s] It actually says he was very rich.
[1124.6s] Okay, you can go and do the math. But
[1127.6s] it's interesting the Bible says imagine
[1129.2s] if somebody said like now Vain was
[1131.1s] coming to introduce me this is the
[1132.6s] introduction or this is the introduction
[1134.6s] that somebody's send you your profile
[1137.0s] cuz they always say when you're speaking
[1138.6s] please send us your profile.
[1141.9s] Nebul was very rich. He was rough. He
[1146.2s] was insolent. He was evil. He was sirly
[1151.4s] and mean. He was a fool. He was
[1155.8s] arrogant. He was unapproachable.
[1159.0s] He was defiant. He was greedy.
[1163.9s] Do you know somebody like that?
[1168.4s] Are they sitting next to you?
[1172.8s] Don't look at them.
[1178.2s] David
[1181.0s] in the same context. David was the
[1184.1s] anointed king. At that time, he was
[1187.0s] already anointed king. He was a fugitive
[1190.3s] running away from soul. Vain and elder.
[1192.9s] Just relax. Don't worry. We will by the
[1195.0s] time they sort it out, maybe we'll show
[1196.4s] the picture at the Oh, look at that.
[1198.9s] There you go. Wonderful. Thank you for
[1202.6s] uh
[1205.0s] hustling for me.
[1207.8s] Thank you,
[1211.0s] David. David's profile,
[1215.6s] David. In the meantime, he was an
[1217.9s] anointed king already.
[1220.2s] He was a fugitive,
[1222.6s] but he's kind. He has an army of 600 but
[1227.0s] he's tenderhearted and he's humble.
[1230.9s] Okay. David was king at by this point
[1234.0s] vers chapter 25. It is in chapter 17 uh
[1238.2s] uh uh that he had actually already
[1241.1s] killed Goliath. So people are already
[1243.2s] talking about David. David was big.
[1245.7s] Okay. But David was hungry,
[1249.9s] angry, lonely and tired.
[1255.0s] So when you're in this whole situation,
[1257.4s] be very very very careful because
[1261.8s] a hungry man normally is an angry man.
[1265.2s] Okay?
[1266.9s] He was lonely because the Bible starts
[1269.7s] by saying
[1271.6s] that the the the the prophet had died.
[1276.8s] Okay? Prophet Samuel who anointed David
[1279.7s] had died. So, and if if you read if you
[1282.2s] know the story of David, uh uh Samuel
[1284.9s] was like his mentor. So, Samuel has
[1287.8s] died. He has been buried. He's in Saul
[1290.7s] is chasing him. He's in some wilderness.
[1293.3s] He's taking care of Nabel's property.
[1295.7s] And this is how things are going. So, he
[1299.4s] sends
[1301.0s] his men, 10 men. He sends only 10 men to
[1305.3s] go to Nabal's place and tell Nabal,
[1308.3s] "Please, we have been taking care of
[1310.6s] your things, but now it is harvest time.
[1313.4s] We hear you sharing goats. Please send
[1315.9s] us something so that we can share with
[1317.7s] you." Naniabal
[1321.7s] Nani, you know what he said? Who is
[1325.4s] David?
[1330.2s] Who is David? who David Nani
[1333.6s] we have heard of so many servants
[1335.6s] masquerading here
[1339.0s] this is surely you think that the whole
[1341.9s] of Israel did not know what had happened
[1344.2s] between David and Goliath
[1347.0s] and Nabal he's rude
[1349.9s] he's foolish he's all these things and
[1353.0s] that is how he responds
[1356.1s] in the meantime nothing is said of
[1358.0s] Abigail in that story until that time
[1361.3s] and then we come upon Abigail.
[1364.2s] Okay. So we move to the the the the
[1367.2s] portrait now of the masterpiece. What
[1369.9s] does the masterpiece look like? Abigail.
[1374.4s] So I'll give you the D's of the
[1375.8s] masterpiece. Abigail is discerning.
[1379.3s] Abigail is discreet. Abigail is decent.
[1383.8s] Abigail is a diffuser.
[1386.6s] And Abigail is deure.
[1391.2s] M
[1394.1s] now the young people I'm giving I'm
[1396.6s] giving something isn't it
[1399.8s] my niece will say yes you're giving
[1401.7s] vocabulary yes you also come to church
[1405.3s] to improve your vocabulary
[1407.9s] yes so Abigail is discerning what does
[1412.4s] it mean to be discerning
[1416.2s] oh there you go let's go to the next one
[1418.8s] does it mean to be discerning. Yeah.
[1422.9s] The Bible actually even says that she
[1425.5s] shows good judgment. Abigail shows good
[1429.0s] judgment. She is careful. She has keen
[1433.4s] insight and she is thoughtful and
[1437.0s] evaluates the subtleties, those things
[1439.7s] which are not said.
[1441.8s] And and good judgment is is common
[1445.4s] sense. Yet you can imagine how sometimes
[1447.4s] common sense is so uncommon.
[1451.5s] Uh David has been taking care those days
[1454.1s] there was no army as such. So David's
[1456.6s] army was taking care of the area where
[1460.5s] Nabal lived. And the servant actually
[1463.4s] goes and says to to to uh Abigail that e
[1469.2s] my mistress or Abigail, do you know that
[1473.0s] when we were with David and his men,
[1475.2s] they took care of us. We had nothing to
[1477.8s] worry about. But they have come to Nabal
[1480.6s] and asked him to give him something and
[1483.0s] he he was rude. He was insolent and said
[1486.4s] he doesn't want to hear them. Please,
[1487.8s] please, please do something because
[1489.6s] David is going to finish us.
[1493.1s] But not a big guy. Who are you? What
[1496.5s] kind of person are you when there is in
[1499.5s] times of trouble? Do you show excuse me,
[1503.6s] do you show good judgment?
[1506.6s] Are you able to sense that this person
[1510.3s] has been good to me? Let me reciprocate.
[1513.8s] Let me talk to relatives.
[1517.9s] So sometimes it's interesting how
[1519.8s] relatives can turn against their own
[1521.3s] relatives, especially the ones who have
[1523.5s] been good to them.
[1526.2s] I guess
[1529.8s] that is not Christian. That is that is
[1532.5s] foolishness. That is how the Bible
[1534.2s] describes Nabal. But look at Abigail.
[1537.4s] She has keen insight.
[1540.1s] Insight. It is not just information.
[1542.6s] She's able to know what to tell
[1546.7s] uh Nabal and what not to tell him. So
[1549.7s] she decides, eh, I better go and sort
[1552.8s] this thing out before things go bad. She
[1556.4s] is careful. She is careful.
[1561.6s] She's discerning. Even her her servant
[1565.4s] says to her, "Please consider
[1568.9s] otherwise we might be in trouble." and
[1571.2s] she is thoughtful. She evaluates the
[1573.4s] subtleties. She knows that this
[1575.5s] situation can escalate. Nobody has told
[1578.7s] her, by the way.
[1581.3s] She she's just been told that David is
[1583.9s] out there with many warriors. But she
[1586.4s] can be able to tell the subtleties to
[1588.2s] know that David has just killed Goliath.
[1592.4s] What about me and my house? I better
[1594.8s] quickly go and sort this thing out
[1596.7s] before it escalates. She is discerning.
[1601.9s] Then she is discreet. She is discreet.
[1605.6s] The next the next slide.
[1608.5s] What does it mean to be discreet? She is
[1611.2s] subtle. She is subtle. You know the
[1614.6s] Bible says she's married to the very
[1617.6s] rich man.
[1621.4s] When the servants told her she could
[1623.4s] have ordered them all to come and let us
[1627.3s] go and see. But it's very interesting
[1629.5s] what Abigail does. Abigail says she puts
[1632.8s] the things together. She loads them to
[1635.5s] the serpents. Then she says, "You guys
[1637.6s] go ahead. I am coming."
[1641.3s] She's coming alone in a dunkey. Some of
[1643.8s] us we are very rich and everybody must
[1649.0s] know.
[1650.9s] So when we arrive,
[1653.7s] no not Abigail, not this masterpiece.
[1657.8s] She is subtle. She's relying
[1661.4s] on herself and the the the the the the
[1664.9s] wisdom that God is going to give her to
[1667.2s] deal with with David. She is tactful and
[1671.3s] diplomatic.
[1673.0s] H you should go and read this chapter
[1674.7s] 25.
[1676.7s] Very tactful. When she talks to David,
[1678.6s] she says, "Hey King, surely are you
[1682.8s] going to mess up your whole legacy
[1685.0s] because of a foolish neighbor?
[1689.4s] She doesn't go there and say,
[1692.1s] "Hey,
[1694.2s] I know it's bad. I know it's this. I
[1697.0s] know." No, no, no, no, no, no, no. She's
[1699.2s] tactful and diplomatic. She says,
[1701.9s] "Surely you are already king.
[1705.2s] Don't mess up yourself because of a
[1708.0s] foolish Nabal." She encourages him and
[1712.8s] reminds him of his assignment. He says,
[1716.2s] "You know, my God has already given you
[1719.0s] such a great assignment. Don't mess it
[1722.2s] up." How tactful and diplomatic. She's
[1726.1s] careful in speech.
[1729.3s] Look at her. She goes and says,
[1732.6s] "I I I was not aware that this was
[1735.0s] happening."
[1736.8s] She doesn't go there and say, "Forget my
[1738.4s] stupid husband."
[1740.4s] Although she does say that, by the way,
[1741.8s] don't worry. He's a fool. But that's not
[1744.3s] what she leads with. She says, "I was
[1747.4s] not aware that this is what happened.
[1749.8s] Please, please, please forgive us. I am
[1752.1s] now here." Okay, she's careful in
[1755.0s] speech. And then she's she's aware of
[1757.7s] the social cues. She's aware that David
[1760.6s] is mourning.
[1762.9s] She's aware that David's ego has been
[1765.6s] injured.
[1767.2s] She's aware that that
[1771.6s] David has power that if it is not tamed,
[1775.1s] they can be destroyed.
[1777.3s] But above all, somebody who is discreet
[1780.0s] is respectful.
[1782.2s] I wish you could just show them um slide
[1785.4s] 10. If you could show slide 10 just for
[1788.6s] you to see the portrait, the picture
[1791.2s] that represents how uh Abigail
[1794.3s] approaches approaches uh the situation.
[1797.8s] If you find slide uh 10, that will be
[1800.3s] useful. Okay.
[1803.1s] Yes. Yes. Yes. Just look at that.
[1807.9s] In fact, in some place I'm going to the
[1809.4s] Bible is very interesting. The Bible
[1810.6s] says that she even curtsies. Curtsy. You
[1814.2s] know Katsy when you think Katsy you
[1816.9s] think what? Royal
[1819.8s] that is how diplomatic she is. She's
[1822.1s] married to a very rich man.
[1826.6s] It is not beneath her to show humility.
[1831.9s] That is that is just just picture the
[1834.2s] situ. David has arrived. By the way, it
[1837.0s] says David arrived with 400 men.
[1840.9s] 400 men. That is can what what can
[1843.0s] happen when you're upset? He is annoyed.
[1845.9s] He is like, "God, help me. If there's
[1849.4s] any man in that family that is going to
[1851.5s] survive.
[1854.7s] Can you imagine how annoyed somebody can
[1856.3s] get
[1858.1s] if you are not discerning?
[1861.1s] It can go by."
[1863.4s] He arrives. He had sent only 10 by the
[1866.5s] way. Only 10. By the way, if you read
[1868.2s] the Bible, it says when he sent the 10,
[1870.1s] he said, "Peace, peace be with you,
[1872.4s] Naba." When they brought the message
[1875.1s] back,
[1877.5s] he was like, "Who? Me? David, who killed
[1881.3s] Goliath with 600 men? You 200 remain
[1884.3s] here. Take care of the things." 420.
[1889.8s] This is what Abigail was facing.
[1895.1s] So this is why when we are saying that
[1897.1s] she is discerning, she's discreet, she's
[1899.8s] decent. Let's look at the the part where
[1902.1s] we talking about her decency. Let's look
[1904.1s] at the part where we're now talking
[1905.2s] about her decency. What is a decent
[1907.2s] person?
[1909.2s] She is kind. She is kind. And her
[1912.2s] kindness can be seen in the way she's
[1914.8s] dealing with the servants. Which servant
[1918.7s] can come and tell you that your home is
[1921.1s] about to be destroyed if you are not
[1923.0s] kind?
[1925.6s] If you are unkind, the servant will be
[1927.4s] like, "Finally, the Lord has done it for
[1931.0s] me."
[1934.9s] Isn't that so? That is the way some of
[1937.0s] us treat our servants and the day of
[1939.9s] danger they will say
[1943.8s] finally. But no, Abigail is decent. She
[1947.6s] is kind. The servant runs to her and
[1950.8s] says, "Please, please, please, please,
[1952.3s] please, I know you can do this." But
[1954.8s] apart from that, when she packs the
[1957.2s] food, she packs food not only for the
[1959.4s] king. Some of us are only just concerned
[1961.5s] about the powers that be.
[1964.2s] But she packs food even for the kings.
[1967.0s] Man, it reminds you of Rebecca, isn't
[1969.7s] it?
[1970.9s] She's like, I will not only give water
[1972.7s] to you, but I will also give to your
[1976.1s] your animals. She's kind. She's
[1979.4s] empathetic.
[1981.0s] She is like, I need to rush to diffuse
[1983.6s] this situation so that my family is not
[1986.5s] destroyed.
[1988.0s] But most importantly, a decent person is
[1991.0s] generous.
[1993.9s] I hope you're going to read this just at
[1996.1s] lunchtime.
[1997.9s] Will you?
[2001.3s] She is hasty. The Bible says she she
[2004.6s] takes haste. She's quick. She puts 200
[2007.8s] loaves. 200 loaves. I wonder when I
[2011.9s] don't know when she's baking this woman.
[2014.4s] Hey, can we readily find 200 loaves even
[2017.4s] in my house? In case of Vita, she has
[2021.6s] 200 loaves. Her husband is very rich.
[2024.3s] Two skins of wine, five sheep, five
[2027.8s] measures of grain, 100 clusters of
[2030.6s] raisins, 200 cakes of figs. Sheep. She's
[2035.1s] like, e,
[2037.7s] let me go and pacify him with
[2040.1s] generosity.
[2042.3s] When was the last time you were you even
[2044.2s] gave a bottle of water?
[2046.8s] We are not asking for 200 loaves. I've
[2049.0s] heard them saying that now it is one
[2051.4s] offering that covers everything.
[2053.0s] Hallelujah.
[2055.1s] I used to be in charge of stewardship
[2056.7s] and it was not easy. Every department
[2059.0s] wanted to come to the pull pit.
[2063.1s] Now we collect everything and we divide
[2065.8s] it. She was generous.
[2068.5s] She was civil. She was civil. She was
[2072.1s] civil.
[2073.8s] She was she she she she
[2077.0s] knew that the right thing to do was to
[2080.2s] reciprocate when somebody has helped
[2082.8s] you. Am I civil? When somebody has
[2086.9s] helped you, when somebody has raised
[2089.4s] you, you came from, you know, somebody
[2091.7s] has raised you with his wife and you
[2094.3s] have now become this grace great person.
[2097.0s] Are you civil?
[2099.5s] Are you able to reciprocate? Or when you
[2101.7s] are told, hey, so and so's child is
[2104.4s] having trouble. Who is so and so? Who is
[2107.0s] so and so? I've heard even some people
[2109.3s] say, what's what's the big deal? These
[2111.3s] days we are equal.
[2114.0s] Really,
[2116.2s] that is a bad attitude
[2119.1s] and is not the portrait of a
[2123.0s] masterpiece.
[2125.4s] Then she's a diffuser.
[2128.0s] She's a diffuser. No, there are so many
[2130.0s] ways of thinking of a diffuser. Even
[2131.8s] that, you know, it's just somebody who
[2136.2s] who cools things off, isn't it? She's a
[2138.9s] diffuser of good vibes. If you if you go
[2141.8s] to Google, she tell you a diffuser of
[2144.6s] good vibes. She's she's positive. Her
[2147.9s] humility, her kneeling, it just it just
[2151.3s] calmed a very escalated situation. She
[2154.4s] avoids escalation. When she arrives,
[2156.4s] she's beautiful. The Bible says she's
[2158.2s] beautiful. She arrives. She she she she
[2161.6s] cuts. She falls before him.
[2165.0s] Even the king is like go cho.
[2170.0s] You know there's a way you can arrive
[2171.2s] and people are like okay. The man has
[2174.6s] 400
[2177.8s] warriors with him. She's calm. She is
[2182.4s] emotionally controlled. A masterpiece.
[2185.6s] She doesn't panic. I love it. She
[2188.2s] doesn't panic when she's told that eh
[2190.8s] things are bad or even when she sees
[2192.8s] imagine if you go and find that the
[2194.7s] person you were thinking was going to
[2195.9s] help you have he has 400 men 400 some of
[2198.7s] us would be like wait
[2202.6s] where do I start
[2205.8s] she is calm she is calm and she avoids
[2210.2s] escalation
[2211.8s] she's able to resolve the conflict with
[2215.9s] diplomacy by appealing to the greatness
[2220.1s] of David. She is a diffuser.
[2224.1s] And finally, young people, she is deure.
[2227.7s] She is demure. If you read uh uh if you
[2231.2s] go to uh you search, the word deure was
[2234.6s] used a lot to describe young ladies.
[2238.7s] Okay. Now, some people are saying that
[2241.4s] you know when you say that we are
[2242.8s] modest,
[2244.3s] maybe you are putting us down. Uh-uh.
[2247.4s] But Abigail is demure. She is modest.
[2253.2s] She is modest despite the fact that she
[2256.6s] has so much wealth around her. She
[2260.2s] decides to to to ask the servants to go
[2263.4s] away ahead of ahead of her so that she
[2266.0s] doesn't come out arrogant. She doesn't
[2268.2s] come out rich. She doesn't come out as a
[2270.6s] showoff.
[2273.4s] She moves gently. She moves quietly.
[2277.4s] Our young people,
[2279.5s] everything that happens in your life, we
[2282.0s] know. Even when you have gone to a hotel
[2284.5s] which doesn't belong to anybody you ever
[2286.0s] heard of, you want to show us that your
[2287.5s] life is over there.
[2292.4s] Please be a masterpiece. Move quietly.
[2296.9s] Move silently. Be deure.
[2301.0s] Have some discretion. Let us find out
[2304.1s] what is going on in your in your life.
[2307.2s] She is humble.
[2309.4s] She is humble. I've already shown you
[2310.6s] her humility. She actually the Bible
[2312.6s] says in in in um amplified she says she
[2316.5s] she fell on her face and did an
[2319.8s] obeisance which is really curtsy. Wow.
[2324.1s] Wow. This is the humility that diffuses
[2328.1s] a hot temper. She is observant. She's
[2331.5s] observant. She's conscious of what is
[2333.9s] going on around her. She knows what is
[2335.8s] happening with David. And she knows that
[2338.2s] this his fuse is very small and it can
[2341.2s] blow up. And finally, she's sensitive to
[2346.6s] she's sensitive to others. She's
[2349.5s] sensitive to Nabal.
[2352.8s] She doesn't tell Nabal what is going on
[2354.6s] because she doesn't know what will
[2355.9s] happen. When she comes back, she finds
[2359.8s] Nabal in a party drinking so drunk. She
[2362.7s] decides, "Mm-
[2365.0s] let me not say anything." She waits
[2367.6s] until the following day when she tells
[2370.1s] Nabal what happened. Nabal just
[2372.8s] collapses. He gets a stroke.
[2376.2s] True story.
[2380.3s] 10 days later, he dies.
[2383.8s] Go and read the end for yourself.
[2387.0s] a portrait of a masterpiece. When we
[2390.2s] introduce you, what profile are we going
[2393.1s] to talk about? Are we going to say
[2394.9s] you're discerning, you're discreet,
[2397.5s] you're decent, you're a diffuser, you're
[2400.8s] demand.
[2402.4s] And how then can I become a masterpiece?
[2405.7s] How then can I become a masterpiece?
[2409.8s] And thanks to the the the the ladies at
[2412.1s] the general conference who wrote our
[2414.5s] material for this week.
[2417.1s] Abide abide a always seek God's
[2421.9s] presence. Believe in his promises
[2425.6s] intimately walk with him intimately.
[2433.9s] intimately.
[2435.6s] Read his word.
[2438.5s] Study it constantly. Remained plugged
[2440.7s] in. Depend on his strength. Just know
[2444.5s] that God is always working behind the
[2447.7s] scenes. Oh, we saw him working. We saw
[2451.3s] him working. He goes ahead of Abigail.
[2454.4s] He goes ahead of Joabed. He goes ahead
[2457.1s] of Mary. He goes ahead of Esther. Our
[2460.4s] God is always working behind the scenes.
[2464.4s] Depend on his strength and endure in
[2467.8s] faith in this world. We will have
[2471.0s] trouble. Not we might.
[2474.9s] We will.
[2476.8s] John 16:33. We will have it.
[2480.6s] What will make us a masterpiece is our
[2483.4s] ability to endure. So finally once again
[2488.7s] let's remind ourselves as we close
[2493.1s] for we are God's own handiwork.
[2497.9s] I am God's own handy work
[2502.2s] his workmanship
[2505.6s] recreated in Christ Jesus born and new
[2510.2s] that we may do those good works.
[2513.8s] We may do those good works. We may do
[2517.0s] those good works. Which good works? We
[2519.0s] may show discernment. We may be
[2521.9s] discreet. We may be decent. We may be
[2525.6s] diffusers. We may be demure. I mean
[2529.3s] Abigail that is where our our text came
[2532.0s] from. Abigail was able to say, "Make
[2534.4s] David say, "Wow,
[2537.1s] blessed be your discretion and
[2540.2s] discernment and blessed be you who has
[2544.0s] kept me from bloodshed."
[2546.6s] Can you imagine the ability to stop an
[2550.0s] angry man with 400 men backing him up?
[2555.0s] That is good works which God created in
[2558.6s] Abigail and she is now doing it. So may
[2562.4s] God help us to to remember that we
[2565.9s] should walk in these good works living
[2568.3s] the good life which he pre-arranged and
[2571.4s] made ready for us to live.
[2575.7s] And surely we cannot close the weak
[2578.9s] without asking. Who then
[2583.2s] wants to stand and say, "Lord,
[2588.0s] make me a new
[2591.7s] and help me to live like your
[2594.7s] masterpiece."
[2596.4s] Please stand as we pray together.
[2605.4s] Let us pray.
[2612.6s] Dear Jesus, thank you. Thank you for
[2615.4s] this beautiful stories that fill the
[2618.9s] Bible, that remind us again and again of
[2623.6s] your glory, of your goodness, of your
[2627.0s] greatness, of the good works that you
[2630.2s] predestined
