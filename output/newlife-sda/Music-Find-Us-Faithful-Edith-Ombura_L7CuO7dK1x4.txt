FULL TRANSCRIPT:
[Music] We're pilgrims on a journey on the narrow road. and those who have gone before us light the way. Cheering on the faithful, encouraging the weary, the lies are stiring testament to God's sustaining grace. surrounded by so great a cloud of witnesses. Let us run the race not only for the prize but as those of gone before us. Let us live to those behind us a stand of God's own faithfulness. Busted on through godly lives. Oh, may all who come behind us find us faithful. May the power of our devotion light the way. May the footprints that we live lead them to believe and the lives they live inspire them to obey. Oh, may all who come behind us find us faithful. [Music] After all our hopes and dreams have come and gone and our children see through all we've left behind. May the clues that they discover and the memories they uncover becomes the light that leads them to a road we each must find. Oh may all who come behind us find us faithful. May the power of our devotion light the way. May the footprints that we live lead them to believe and the lives of living inspire them to obey. Oh, may all who come behind us find us faithful. May the power of our devotion light the way. May the footprints that we live lead them to believe and the lives they live inspire them to obey. Oh, may all who come behind us find us faithful.
