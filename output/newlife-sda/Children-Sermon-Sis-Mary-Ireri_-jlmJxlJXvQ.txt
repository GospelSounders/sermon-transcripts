Father in the mighty name of Jesus Christ, we thank you so much for this wonderful time that you've given us that we are going to learn from you. Open our hearts to hear you speak to us for you as in Jesus name. Amen. One day long time ago there lived a people of God. People of God are people who do God's will. However, as time went by, they began forgetting what God wants them to do. And how do we know what God want us to do? It is written in the Holy Bible, especially in the ten commandments. And so these people began doing evil things. The commandment says do not steal. So what were they doing? They would steal. The commandment say do not uh obey your parents and what would they do? Disobey. Another commandment would say remember the Sabbath day to keep it holy. And what would they do? they would forget and God became not happy because they knew what they needed to do but they were not doing that. However, there were a few who were following God's command and so God decided to send one of them as the messenger. He sent one of them. No, every time, every now and the messenger, the messenger would go before the children who are now disobeying and tell them, "Hello, hello. Today God has sent me to tell you that you should obey by you stop stealing." And people would look at him to eat God. He would tell them the God of heaven and they continued. So another day the messenger of God would tell them you elder who and so and so you committed adultery. God does not want that. And the man would be like you. He would be very angry with that messenger. And they kept on doing so. And now the worst of it all, they decided to make their own gods. to make their own. There's somebody who decided I'm going to make my god. This is going to be my god. What is this? Yeah. So they made a horse. And so that person would go not worship the god of heaven. They would go every morning. They would wake up and worship the horse and tell the horse, "Oh, oh my god, protect me. Amen." Another one decided that no, I'm not going to be like the other one. I'm going to make a I'm going to make a So the person would wake up a work and they would kneel down before the rabbit and pray. Oh, thank you. You've had a good day. Help me tomorrow. All right. Another one. Another one. Don't touch my toys. Don't touch my toys. Another one decided, nuh-uh, I'm going to be very unique. I'm not going to have a horse, neither a rabbit. I'm going to have a Oh. And then they would also worship. And God was watching up above. So they began worshiping all those funny idols. Go back this way. This way. Enough. Enough. Wonderful. Come this way, children. Thank you. Don't touch my dollies. Don't touch them. Thank you. So they began worshiping that and so meanwhile okay meanwhile the messenger of the Lord kept warning them. God is telling you please do not worship these these ones. They have ears. Do you see they have ears? Show me your ears. Even these dollies they have ears. But can they hear? Can they hear? So the messenger will tell them please don't worship them there's a god but then they would tell them which god is that after all you will keep on believing in a god you don't see you can't see you are god you can't touch him as we want a god who we can see can you see which color is this god which color is this god correct they want a god they can touch you touch and they want a god who who is always there. Enough. Thank you so much for touching. Enough of the touch. Thank you. And so God saw this tab on people. And so what did I decide to do? He decided to tell his manervant that there's going to be a contest. A what? So now children. Hello. Now can you all of you go behind me? I show you what we want to do. Get behind me. Get behind me as quick as possible. As possible. As quick as possible. Get behind me. Get behind me. Get behind me. Get behind me. Get behind me. Get behind me. Teachers, help me. Get behind. I want to show you something on these seats. Kindly push back. Push back. Push back. So that you see what we are going to do. Okay. Push back. Push a little back. Push back. Thank you. Push a little back. Thank you. Push a little back. Thank you. Push a little back. Thank you. So God called for a contest. And what was the contest all about? Have you ever been to a contest? There are two teams. The one which will win and the one that will not win. So now the contest was to be in very early in the morning. So people who used to worship idols, idols had to come and carry their gods with them. They come and worship. And then there are these people who would worship God of heaven. They would also come. So now I want you to see I wish they you moved a little bit behind but anyway let's push the chair here. So we had one team one team of those people who worship who? One team of people who worship who? On one side and the other team of people who worship what? Who worship what? On the other side. And very early in the morning the contest began. What was the contest? The game was they were to pray and pray and pray. The God who brings fire from heaven is the true God. Is that true? So these people decided let us give these people first priority. So these ones began and they were asked are you ready? They said we are very ready with our gods. Okay start. They began. Oh our god. May God bring fire from heaven. Did the God hear? They prayed 1 hour, 2 hours. It was lunchtime. This team is still waiting and watching. It was evening. They are still praying to their gods. And then this team, the messenger of God started making fun, telling them, "You people, what has happened to your gods? They must have gone to sleep or maybe they are too busy. Please add more noise. So they kept on being louder. Our God make God please bring fire. Did the God answer? No. The God could not hear. And now it was already evening. The day was getting over. So what would happen? They decided now it's the time for the other team to have the context. So the messenger of God stood and when he stood he put his hands together and then he prayed and he told God, "God who dwells up above, you who people cannot see but you are there. Please prove to these people that you are the true God by bringing fire down in Jesus name. Amen. By the time he was saying amen, what happened? Fire came. Have you ever seen fire? And so the contest was over. Which team had won? Which team had won? God had heard. God had heard the prayer. Questions. I always ask questions. Question number one. What was the title of our message today? for Jesus every day. Question number two goes to a boy child. Yes, because that was a girl who answered. Question number two, our memory verse of the day came from the book of boy child. Boy child Isaiah wrong know me. Yes, they don't know me. Correct. Deuteronomy what? Deuteronomy what? Verse seven verse five. He got it. Five verse seven. Let's shine for all of them for trying. Shine shine shine for Jesus every day. The last question the the story I gave you is in the Bible. So who was the messenger in our story? Let's all of us shout. Wow. I can see you are good. students of their Bible. Let's shine for ourselves with God. Shine, shine, shine for Jesus every day. Wonderful. I want us to pray. We have learned that God does what? Touch. What do you used to listen? Touch your ears. Say God heals. Today I want us to pray. And as we pray myself as your teacher, teacher Mary Eri, where did my paper go? I want to be on the side of God who hears who together with me wants to be on this side. Wow. Let us pray. Thank you, Lord. You've taught us today that you hear and we have raised our hands. We want to be on your side of this God who can hear and answer prayer like you did for Elijah.

[390.0s] forget and God became not happy because
[393.3s] they knew what they needed to do but
[395.0s] they were not doing that. However, there
[398.4s] were a few who were following God's
[400.8s] command and so God decided to send one
[403.3s] of them as the messenger. He sent one of
[405.9s] them. No, every time, every now and the
[412.2s] messenger, the messenger would go before
[414.6s] the children who are now disobeying and
[417.0s] tell them, "Hello,
[420.7s] hello.
[422.8s] Today God has sent me to tell you that
[426.4s] you should obey by you stop stealing."
[429.8s] And people would look at
[431.9s] him to eat God. He would tell them the
[434.8s] God of heaven and they continued. So
[437.5s] another day the messenger of God would
[439.4s] tell them you elder who and so and so
[443.0s] you committed adultery. God does not
[445.4s] want
[446.4s] that. And the man would be like
[450.1s] you. He would be very angry with that
[453.2s] messenger. And they kept on doing so.
[456.2s] And now the worst of it all, they
[459.3s] decided to make their own gods. to make
[462.8s] their own.
[465.1s] There's somebody who decided I'm going
[467.1s] to make my god. This is going to be my
[470.6s] god. What is this?
[474.1s] Yeah. So they made a horse. And so that
[476.7s] person would go not worship the god of
[479.5s] heaven. They would go every morning.
[481.0s] They would wake up and worship the horse
[483.4s] and tell the horse, "Oh, oh my god,
[486.2s] protect me. Amen." Another one decided
[490.1s] that no, I'm not going to be like the
[492.9s] other one. I'm going to make a I'm going
[496.4s] to make

[523.1s] to have a horse, neither a rabbit. I'm
[525.4s] going to have
[527.1s] a
[528.8s] Oh. And then they would also worship.

[539.7s] Enough. Wonderful. Come this way,
[542.0s] children. Thank you. Don't touch my
[544.2s] dollies. Don't touch them. Thank you. So
[547.0s] they began worshiping that and
[550.0s] so
[552.3s] meanwhile okay meanwhile the messenger
[555.9s] of the Lord kept warning them. God is
[558.6s] telling you please do not worship these
[561.1s] these ones. They have ears. Do you see
[563.6s] they have ears? Show me your
[567.2s] ears. Even these dollies they have ears.
[570.9s] But can they hear? Can they hear? So the
[574.8s] messenger will tell them please don't
[576.5s] worship them there's a god but then they
[579.0s] would tell them which god is that after
[582.4s] all you will keep on believing in a god
[584.2s] you don't see you can't see you are god
[586.9s] you can't touch him as we want a god who
[590.2s] we can see can you see which color is
[593.6s] this
[594.4s] god which color is this god correct they
[598.6s] want a god they can touch you touch and
[602.7s] they want a god who who is always there.
[605.5s] Enough. Thank you so much for touching.
[607.6s] Enough of the touch. Thank you. And so
[610.7s] God saw this tab on people. And so what
[613.1s] did I decide to do? He decided to tell
[616.6s] his manervant that there's going to be a
[619.4s] contest. A what? So now children. Hello.
[624.2s] Now can you all of you go behind me? I

[651.0s] little back. Thank you. Push a little
[653.0s] back. Thank you. Push a little back.
[655.1s] Thank you. So God called for a contest.
[660.0s] And what was the contest all about? Have
[662.6s] you ever been to a contest?
[665.1s] There are two teams. The one which will
[668.5s] win and the one that will not win. So
[671.8s] now the contest was to be in very early
[674.4s] in the morning. So people who used to
[676.8s] worship
[678.4s] idols, idols had to come and carry their
[683.0s] gods with them. They come and worship.
[686.6s] And then there are these people who
[688.0s] would worship God of heaven. They would
[690.2s] also come. So now I want you to see I
[693.2s] wish they you moved a little bit behind
[695.2s] but anyway let's push the chair
[697.5s] here. So we had one team one team of
[702.4s] those people who worship who? One team
[705.4s] of people who worship who? On one
[709.0s] side and the other team of people who
[712.8s] worship what? Who worship what?
[717.1s] On the other side. And very early in the
[720.6s] morning the contest began. What was the
[723.3s] contest? The game was they were to pray
[727.4s] and pray and pray. The God who brings
[729.9s] fire from heaven is the true God. Is
[732.2s] that true? So these people decided let
[735.9s] us give these people first priority. So
[738.6s] these ones began and they were asked are
[740.8s] you ready? They said we are very ready
[743.0s] with our gods. Okay start. They began.
[747.3s] Oh our god. May God bring fire from
[750.8s] heaven. Did the God hear?
[755.1s] They prayed 1 hour, 2 hours. It was
[758.8s] lunchtime. This team is still waiting
[761.4s] and
[762.6s] watching. It was evening. They are still
[766.0s] praying to their gods. And then this
[768.8s] team, the messenger of God started
[770.8s] making fun, telling them, "You people,
[774.2s] what has happened to your gods? They
[776.7s] must have gone to sleep or maybe they
[779.7s] are too busy. Please add more noise. So
[783.4s] they kept on being louder. Our God
[787.8s] make God please bring fire. Did the God
[793.2s] answer? No. The God could not
[799.2s] hear. And now it was already evening.
[801.8s] The day was getting over. So what would
[803.6s] happen? They decided now it's the time
[806.0s] for the other team to have the context.
[809.2s] So the messenger of
[811.8s] God
[813.3s] stood and when he
[816.0s] stood he put his hands
[819.8s] together and then he prayed and he told
[824.4s] God, "God who dwells up above, you who
[828.0s] people cannot see but you are there.
[830.8s] Please prove to these people that you
[833.4s] are the true God by bringing fire down
[837.7s] in Jesus name.
[839.6s] Amen. By the time he was saying
[844.0s] amen, what happened? Fire came. Have you
[848.0s] ever seen fire?
[850.1s] And so the contest was over. Which team
[853.3s] had won?
[855.4s] Which team had won?
[858.2s] God had heard. God had heard the
[862.0s] prayer. Questions. I always ask
[865.2s] questions. Question number one. What was
