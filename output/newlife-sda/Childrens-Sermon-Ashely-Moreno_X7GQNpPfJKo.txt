[Music] Happy Sabbath. Happy. Um, my name is Ashley Moreno and I'm a proud member of this wonderful church, New Life. Before we start, let's have a word of prayer. Our kind and loving father, we thank you for this day. Thank you for the gift of life. Thank you for protecting us though from our homes to church. May you help us to hear your word and understand. For it is in Jesus name I pray. Our sermon title is Jesus our light in a dark world. Let me ask you something. Have you ever tried looking directly at the sun or a really bright light with your bare eyes? Have you ever tried looking at the directly at the sun or a really bright light with your bare eyes? Probably not. And even if you tried, you quickly turned away, right? This is because our eyes aren't made to handle such intense brightness. By looking directly at a bright light, you can harm your eyes permanently. There's even a name for it. Solar path. That's how the sun's light is powerful. Now come with me to the book of Exodus 33:20 where God tells Moses, "You cannot see my face and live." This reminds us that God's glory is far greater than anything we can handle. Even his light is too powerful for us. However, there are special moments in the Bible where people saw God face to face. In Genesis 32:30, Jacob says, "I saw God face to face and yet my life was spared." So why is it that now we can't see God like that? Did he plan it that way? No. In Genesis 3:8, before Adam and Eve sinned, they used to walk and talk with God freely. But once they sin, they hid from him. Sin is what separated us from God's presence. But thank God through his son Jesus Christ, we are reunited back to him. Let's go back to the example of the son. In John 8:12, Jesus says, "I am the light of the world. Whoever follows me will never walk in darkness, but will have the light of life." Jesus says that if you walk with him, you never walk in darkness. In Revelation, Revelation 1:16, Jesus is described as having a face that shines like the sun in all its brilliance. That's how powerful and glorious God is. church. Just like we need light to do our daily chores, is the same way we need light to live a life that pleases God. Even those watching us online are using light to connect with us. That's how light is very important. So I ask you, will you choose Jesus as your light and closest friend? If yes, please raise your right hand with me. And I invite Pastor Elvis to commit us all to God. Our loving father, hands are raised. We have bowed in our hearts, O Lord. We give you reverence because you are our creator and you are our redeemer. We thank you for blessing us with children and Lord we thank you for calling us your children. Now bless us this day oh Lord as we give you glory and honor. Father give us good health. Give us ability to mind of you. Bless us this day for this we pray in Jesus name. Amen. Thank you.

TIMESTAMPED TRANSCRIPT:
[0.0s] [Music]
[26.2s] Happy Sabbath. Happy.
[29.1s] Um, my name is Ashley Moreno and I'm a
[32.1s] proud member of this wonderful church,
[34.0s] New Life. Before we start, let's have a
[37.2s] word of prayer. Our kind and loving
[39.8s] father, we thank you for this day. Thank
[41.4s] you for the gift of life. Thank you for
[43.5s] protecting us though from our homes to
[46.0s] church. May you help us to hear your
[47.6s] word and understand. For it is in Jesus
[49.8s] name I pray.
[52.6s] Our sermon title is Jesus our light in a
[56.5s] dark world.
[58.7s] Let me ask you something. Have you ever
[61.4s] tried looking directly at the sun or a
[64.2s] really bright light with your bare eyes?
[69.8s] Have you ever tried looking at the
[71.8s] directly at the sun or a really bright
[74.7s] light with your bare eyes?
[77.7s] Probably not. And even if you tried, you
[81.0s] quickly turned away, right?
[85.0s] This is because our eyes aren't made to
[87.8s] handle such intense brightness. By
[90.7s] looking directly at a bright light, you
[93.3s] can harm your eyes permanently. There's
[96.2s] even a name for it. Solar path.
[101.0s] That's how the sun's light is powerful.
[104.4s] Now come with me to the book of Exodus
[107.1s] 33:20
[109.1s] where God tells Moses, "You cannot see
[111.9s] my face and live." This reminds us that
[115.6s] God's glory is far greater than anything
[118.3s] we can handle. Even his light is too
[121.3s] powerful for us. However, there are
[125.0s] special moments in the Bible where
[127.5s] people saw God face to face. In Genesis
[131.5s] 32:30,
[133.6s] Jacob says, "I saw God face to face and
[137.5s] yet my life was spared."
[140.8s] So why is it that now we can't see God
[143.2s] like that? Did he plan it that way?
[147.4s] No. In Genesis 3:8, before Adam and Eve
[152.4s] sinned, they used to walk and talk with
[155.3s] God freely. But once they sin, they hid
[159.0s] from him. Sin is what separated us from
[162.6s] God's presence. But thank God through
[165.7s] his son Jesus Christ, we are reunited
[168.6s] back to him. Let's go back to the
[171.6s] example of the son. In John 8:12, Jesus
[176.1s] says, "I am the light of the world.
[179.0s] Whoever follows me will never walk in
[181.1s] darkness, but will have the light of
[183.4s] life."
[186.2s] Jesus says that if you walk with him,
[189.9s] you never walk in darkness.
[193.4s] In Revelation,
[197.1s] Revelation 1:16, Jesus is described as
[200.4s] having a face that shines like the sun
[202.8s] in all its brilliance. That's how
[205.4s] powerful and glorious God is.
[208.5s] church. Just like we need light to do
[211.0s] our daily chores, is the same way we
[213.5s] need light
[215.4s] to live a life that pleases God. Even
[219.4s] those watching us online are using light
[221.9s] to connect with us. That's how light is
[225.0s] very important. So I ask you, will you
[229.1s] choose Jesus as your light and closest
[232.2s] friend? If yes, please raise your right
[235.8s] hand with me. And I invite Pastor Elvis
[239.5s] to commit us all to God.
[252.6s] Our loving father, hands are raised.
[256.5s] We have bowed in our hearts, O Lord. We
[259.8s] give you reverence
[261.7s] because you are our creator and you are
[264.7s] our redeemer.
[266.5s] We thank you for blessing us with
[269.0s] children and Lord
[272.1s] we thank you for calling us your
[273.9s] children. Now bless us this day oh Lord
[277.7s] as we give you glory and honor. Father
[280.4s] give us good health. Give us ability to
[283.9s] mind of you. Bless us this day for this
[287.9s] we pray in Jesus name. Amen. Thank you.
