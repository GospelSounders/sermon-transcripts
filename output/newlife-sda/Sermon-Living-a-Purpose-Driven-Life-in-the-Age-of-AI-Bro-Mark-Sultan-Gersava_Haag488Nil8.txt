FULL TRANSCRIPT:
[Music] Good morning church. Happy Sabbath. Happy day. Happy day. Happy. Wow. It's been a blessed day for all of us. You know what? Um my dear brothers and sisters, okay, from Kenya. So, and a warm welcome also to our visitors and our online viewers. So it is such a blessing uh to worship you today. So what a long journey from the Philippines. I traveled for almost 24 hours just to reach your beautiful country from the Philippines to Hong Kong to Etopia and at last here I am here in Nairobi. Thank you very much for the beautiful message of the song. That's so very beautiful. And I'm so honest I every time I uh I I hear the Kenyon song. It's so very beautiful. It's because I think in the world you are your your ch your you have been very privileged to have that kind of powerful voice. It's so beautiful to hear. That's the the baritone. Okay. And the base. Okay. That's what I really love with the Kenyans. And you know what brother and sisters? So why I'm in Nairobi? So I am here in Nairobi uh to attend the global good fund fellowship where I was selected as one of the 2025 global good fund fellows. An honor to given to the 10 change makers from across the world who are driving social impact and innovation. And you know what one of the most uh moving experience of this fellowship? a visit to the football mass community project in Valley View Academy. Anyone familiar with this organization? Football mass Kenya. Anyone here? No. So basically Football Moss community project in Valley View Academy uh serving children in the slum area of Civera. I think it's very near here. And this community, the football must use uses football and play as tools to build safe space for children who are victims of poverty, those with disabilities, and those who are victims of violence. Their work reminded me of our mission as Christians to stand for the billable to create hope where is despair and to embody the Christ love in practical ways. Me personally, I am a victim of um children at risk. I grow up in a community where there is civil war and I think in some part of Africa we are still experiencing it like I became part of the um displaced children in the Philippines that's almost years more than a decade of my life and within us let's take a pause for a word of prayer for this children. Shall we pray? Lord, here you are. There's a lot of children at risk in this world. In this in Kenya and the Philippines and wherever in this world, there are victims of violence. There are some victims of poverty, victims of civil war. But we know Lord that you that we have that Christ that we have that Lord who are with them and we are so very thankful that you are giving them hope in Jesus name we pray. Amen. Our Kthics is uh do we have a slide? It's possible. Okay. Okay. So our kithex this morning is basically found in the proverbs 19:21. If you have your Bible, uh, please open it with me in Proverbs 19 verse 21. And it says, I will be reading in the New International Versions that it says, "Many are the plans in the mind of a man, but it is the purpose of the Lord that will stand." Amen. The title of our gospel this morning is living a purpose-driven life in the age of AI. Let me begin with a question. What comes in your mind when we talk about AI? When you heard AI, it is artificial intelligence. So artificial intelligence has became the beacon for the last year are machines that program to think, learn and act like human. But what is really the meaning of AI in a Christian perspective? What do you think AI? What it is really the meaning of AI being an Adventist? So AI means adventist identity. That's AI. And we've been living we've been living with AI for several years ago, right? So before the artificial intelligence was created, we are already living it inside our church. Have you wondered that? That's how amazing that we have that kind of technology that just has been developed in 2025 or in 2024 recently. But we've been living this AI for how many years ago? Since 1844. So artificial intelligence AI mens identity and that's adventist identity. The title of our message this morning is living a purpose driven life in the age of AI anchored with adventist identity. So AI means adventist that Adventist identity that has a mission to make disciple. What is the mission? To make a disciple of Jesus Christ who live as his loving witnesses and proclaim to all people the everlasting gospel of the three angels messages in preparation for his soon return. AI that defines to be a 7th day Adventist rooted in a distinctive understanding of the scripture, the life of Jesus and purpose as it shapes how Adventist identity live. When you accept Jesus Christ as your personal savior, have you asked yourself in a mirror? Who am I as an AI? Who am I as an AI? What is my purpose as an Adventist? as my identity why I'm here. So let's take a look with the life of Jesus. Why Jesus came to earth? What was his purpose? So have you wondered why Jesus choose to be car to be a carpenter? He could have been a scholar, a priest, a physician, of course, a king, but he choose to work with his hands building, crafting, sweating under the sand. Why Jesus Christ choose to be a carpenter? Jesus Jesus wanted to show us that all works has its purpose. Whatever your profession, whatever skills that you have, not just what happened in church, but what happens in the workplace, in the field, in the shop and in our everyday lives. We have a conversation by pastor oil ago and we're talking all about ministry. We have a lot of um pastor uh we have revelation ministry, health ministry and a lot of the ministry. And you know what when I studied the Bible that the best ministry that we can have in this world that people surround us show Jesus in every second of our life. Jesus is not only an ordinary carpenter. He was also a minister, a leader and yes, even an entrepreneur. Jesus is an entrepreneur. He was a social entrepreneur, a mission-driven servant who addressed social injustices through love, inclusion, and transformation. So if you can see in the history of the Bible from the Old Testament to the New Testament, in the Old Testament there are a lot of slavery and the slavery happened in the carpentry or construction industry when the Israelite was captured by by the Egyptians. What they did with the Israelites to build those different buildings in Egypt. And Jesus is one of the reason why the slavery from the Old Testament to the New Testament lesson or in some places ended. He is an interpreter. It's because he is negotiating okay during his childhood. Okay. He is negotiating with his carpentry works in order to sell in the market. But beyond Jesus able behind being a carpenter Jesus healed the sick for feed the hungry taught the forgotten and gave people a sense of belongingness to something greater than themsself. So you know what Jesus this is one of the most beautiful discovery that I have in with Jesus being a social entrepreneur. Jesus as an entrepreneur he's has a message in an entrepreneurship you need a tagline like for example in bamboo high so we have saving the planet saving lives cuz we want to address plastic pollution but Jesus his key message is seek you first the kingdom of God and his righteousness and all other things shall be other sh all things shall be added unto you what is your gospel Jesus it's very clear with his gospel in seeking first the kingdom of God and his righteousness number two disciplehip come follow me Jesus said and I will make you fishers of men Jesus did not work alone he called ordinary people fishermen tax collectors to walk with him Come follow me. Jesus said and I will we and I will make you fishers of man. Innovation. What are your signs and wonders? As Jesus as the greatest innovator, he Jesus is the greatest entrepreneur ever because he was the most innovative ever. Jesus healed the sick. Jesus made the blind sea. Jesus walked on water. Just Jesus turned water to wine. Jesus rose to dead. Jesus rose up from the dead. And above all, Jesus the greatest innovation that Jesus made is the salvation. Jesus invented salvation. Mankind far passports to life after death. An innovation product that man desperately desired. And I think one of my favorite being an entrepreneur you need to have profit. And this is one thing Jesus in his life his profitability mission okay measured by the number of lives he saved his business is saving lives. So his bottom line is measured. We are all entrepreneur here. What is your baseline of profitability? How many people have you tell about the most beautiful story in the history? The story of Jesus. It's so nice that the profitability of Jesus is based on the number okay based on the number of the people that he can bring to his father. Jesus didn't chase didn't chase profit and money. His prophet his profit was insolved to save and purpose why he exist. Jesus has a clear purpose for coming into this world of course to save the humanity from eternal damnation and give eternal life. For God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son that whosoever believe in him shall not perish but have an everlasting life. Jesus has a clear purpose to coming in this world. So Jesus is very passionate of being a carpent of being a carpenter and an entrepreneur because he want to build your life. Jesus is passionate of being a carpenter entrepreneur. It's because he want to build your life. Today many fear about technology like I saw a lot of Facebook page when the artificial intelligence was introduced. There's a lot of post in the Facebook that this is already the mark of the beast. AI is already mark of the beast. But brothers and sisters, our AI or our Adventist identity, prophecy is sent the gospel. Okay, let's take a look for that. Prophecy is sent the gospel. Jesus is brethren, let's not spread fear or false hope. live like Christ in a world history inclining closer for the incoming of Jesus. How should we react? How we can bring our AI in this world? When we use the Bible prophecies which may inflict fear or our messages are too alarming, we lose the very heart of the gospel. Truth in its purest essence, no fear, no hatred, no false predictions, no fake conversations. How should we act? How we should react in the age of AI? How we can bring that AI our Adventist identity when we use Bible prophecies which may inflict fear of our misserts are too alarming. So we lost the very heart of the gospel. We need to bring the truth in its purest sense. No fear, no hatred. No false production, no fake conversation. So what's the twist? Refrain from posting or sharing posts which express religious biases. Respect others religious development and celebration. Prophecy is not gospel. Jesus is the gospel. Your Christ your Christlike life is the gospel. When you live Christ, you draw the world to him. Do not be destruction rather than be attraction. That's beautiful. That's how the how our gospel should be. So do not be a distraction rather than be an attraction. So just want to share to you my AI or Adventist identity in Jesus. So I came from a very poor family in the Philippines. So we're 11 siblings. So during our childhood, you know, we live in a 20 square meter hut. uh sometimes sleep in the in the classroom at the back at the back of the church and at the times we were lucky to have even one meal in a day. So we walk at least during our elementary or basic education we need to walk for 4 hours just to go to school. So one of the memories that I um so this is basically how we work and I think it's uh almost similar with some of the places here in Ken Kenya and one of the experience that I will never forget and became my inspiration of who am I now when I was in grade six during an examination day I left our house without breakfast during lunch I went back home expecting to have some food to eat but when I arrived at home my parents and my siblings was not there. I look in the container and at the and at the table of something to eat but saw nothing. I just found a glass of water. I drank and I cried a lot during the time. And I said to myself, starting today, I will never cry again. And this water soon we will place in rice cuz rice is life in the Philippines. Soon this water we will place it in a commercial powdered milk. because we never experience to drink those commercial merc. I will place this in our van and luckily I graduated from college as a self-supporting student and working students as a food technology. So I was 25 years old already when I uh finished my college that's so very late. So there's a lot of things like I was became part of the automated election of the Philippines. I volunteer a lot in the different com community. So since college I volunteered a lot in the community and peace building around the Philippines and the transition of my life happened here in this place that considered as one of the most dangerous place in the Philippines. So they invited me to conduct a leadership training and then supposedly that Saturday I'm going to met our missionary but sadly a week before our missionary was killed cuz that community is a Muslim community and our missionary was killed. It's because he brought Bible inside that community which is haram in the place. I'm so sad but beyond of all those thing that's really happened and I experienced when I visited this community I experienced the greatest miracle of my life. So when we entered the community the uh the rain is so heavy like uh the pouring of rain is very heavy and then when we arrived you know in in the venue where we are going to conduct the training the rain stopped. The same thing happened when we went back home and we were ambushed by the rebels in the in in the community but still thank you God that we are still alive. So that was the greatest miracle with the rain that um during the time it's not a rainy season in the Philippines but why God provide us rain in order to protect us. And then during the time I had this dream that in my dream someone is telling me Mark you need to do something you your family is already out of of poverty you able to finish all your siblings from their education and then someone telling me that you need to start a certain business cuz you are going to restore my creation. I want I will be going in my second coming if you are going to restore of how beautiful I created the earth and that's basically a transition. So during the time I have only around $250 US in my pocket I went back home to to the city to Metro Manila. Then I um after arriving in Mandela so I quit my full-time job. So I um with that certain amount of around $250 uh US dollars uh in my pocket. So it's really hard to become an entrepreneur. But you know what brethren? My journey of being an entrepreneur happened in this story. Let's watch this. Is there an audio? This is solving one of the world's Okay, basically we don't have an audio and that. Okay, that's it. This Filipino is solving one of the world's biggest problems using only a toothbrush. He's growing more trees. He's using less plastic and he's helping people in extreme poverty. But before I tell you exactly how he does it, I have to tell you about the problems he's trying to solve. You see, if your great great great great great great great grandfather had used a plastic toothbrush like this, as disgusting as it sounds, you might still be able to use that toothbrush today because it doesn't disappear appear. Well, luckily for us, back then, plastic toothbrushes didn't exist. But now we're leaving billions of them behind for future generations and they end up in places like this. And I've seen this problem myself in the Philippines. I traveled all the way from the north to the south, from the windmills of Locos to the pink beaches of Zimbanga. And sadly, I saw trash everywhere I [Applause] went. But it was on this journey that I met this guy. His name is Mark Sultan and when he was a kid, he lived in extreme poverty. I come from a family of farmers who used to survive with $60 a month. He lived through the problems that many Filipinos go through and he wanted to fix them. I noticed that a lot of the trash in my barangi was full of plastic toothbrushes and it gave me an idea. And that's when he created Bambooh [Applause] High, a social enterprise that makes toothbrushes from bamboo that decompose in just 3 months. And inside of every single one of these toothbrushes is a seed. So after 3 months of using it, you can plant it in the ground and grow a tree. The bristles and packaging can be used as a fertilizer together with a bamboo handle. Now we've grown thousand of trees throughout the Philippines and helped to solve the plastic toothbrush problem. And this toothbrush doesn't only help the environment, it also helps the people because they gave hundreds of Filipinos jobs. We are impacting a lot of farmers and all of them used to live in extreme poverty like me. For example, this woman, Analene, has gotten out of poverty and even built this house for her family all because of bamboo toothbrushes. Think about this. You can help to stop the plastic problem. You can reforest and you can help reduce extreme poverty or with something as simple as a toothbrush. And that's the journey. What's up? I've hidden this emoji. For me started or being a faith-driven entrepreneur. And you know what? It's really hard to become an entrepreneur. It's really hard to become a social entrepreneur. It's more harder to become a faith-driven entrepreneur. Cuz the business should be inclined in the principle of Jesus. That the business will not distract the environment. That the business is helping the poor. That the business is changing the world. You know what? six months after I start uh after I started the company the um we only have around $1,000 US sales and I need to pay for around $5,000 and I question God why you brought me why you put me in this situation but you know what God reminds me in this verse in Jeremiah 29:12-4 Then you will call upon me and come and pray to me and I will hear you. You will seek me and find me when you seek me with your all your heart. I will be found by you, declares the Lord. And I will restore your fortunes and gather you from all the nations and all the places where I have driven you, declares the Lord. And in 2019, I said to myself, this is my purpose in life. This is my Adventist identity. You know what before pandemic came in a big trial we experienced almost 10 days uh we not able to provide a salaries for our employees. One Saturday I I fasted and prayed the whole day. After the sunset I have this whole peace and pray to God that Lord starting today I will surrender my life to you. I will never question you anymore. Then I have a peaceful set. The next morning, Sunday, someone message uh I saw a message request request in my Facebook. When I check her Facebook, we don't have mutual friend. So, I need to be hesitant is because the scam is very rampant everywhere in the internet. I have some hesitations. But God reminds my reminds me and he tell me, "My child, you already surrender to me your life. Allow me to solve your problems." I replied to that woman cuz that woman um he messaged me that Mark, I have um a savings in my bank account and I want to invest in your company. So that's Sunday morning and then I met the woman. We don't have mutual friend. So when we met up, I shared to him uh to her our my experience that you know what last night I just pray to God okay that he will provide and here come you message me and then we have a conversation and then he started sharing you know what Mark I don't have a plan to invest my money in my because that's my savings but someone bothering me last night that I need to invest this money and you know what the money that we really that that we really need during the time is exact it's the same money that he want to invest in my company. Wow Lord thank you. I'm so very amazed with how grateful if we are just to fully surrender our life to Jesus. And you know what that woman we found out that we're just neighbor. She's just around 500 m away. But we never we never met before. That's the first time that we met. Without hesitation, without any contract, without any agreement, he signed a check and gave it to me. I go, Lord, how this woman will be trusted this your servant without any agreement, without any contract, with that big amount cuz that's basically around $5,000 and you know starting the time came and pandemic came in. So that day I never questioned our God. You know what brother and sisters as we surrender to all to all to him we have a true and lasting feast. We have overflowing joy and an incomparable hope and purpose will fill us and lead us forward in this journey of being an entrepreneur. We able to uplift uh 81 families uh out of poverty. So that's 81 families already that we uplift out of poverty. Like before their income is just below $60 US and now their income is more than $200 to $500. In this journey, God really blessed me with a lot of blessings. I can uh deeply say that I am a me that I am a millionaire without millions of monies but with millions of souls were rich and impacted. And as the world advanced in knowledge and technology I found my AI my adventist identity in Jesus. An an identity not just in what I believe but how we live with Christlike life. AI with a purpose to be disciple and create more disciples at the as so I never imagined in that journey that this young boy a farmer became a presidential appointee you know what I don't have any political background the the president who appointed me I never voted for him during election and there is a calling but I think there's some like a calling that God and you What what that innovation that made the president impress that plantable toothbrush that we developed okay pastor habet I only have one left okay with us so I never I never imagined to take me from that from being a farmer and now a presidential appointee and you know what the big vision we have a lot of conversation with which I shared to our uh elders that I have this vision that by 2032 or 204 I will become the President of the Republic of the Philippines. So as Christians, we desire to live our lives in a way that is blessing to the Lord. We want to do his will in all aspects of our lives in the daily choices we make that govern our actions and in the Lord and in in the lords of life decisions we have to make. Scripture does give us clear guidance regarding the moral choices we are to make as God's sons and daughter. So what can we do to make our life have purpose? What are within the will of gods in our lives? These biblical principles will guide us. God has created you with the aptitude for particular skills and abilities and with the inclination toward particular interest. You are God's hand or work. He created your inmost being and knit you together in your mother's womb. You are purply and wonderfully made. You have been given workrelated gifts that have been chosen specifically for you. God desires you for you for you to use your gifts he has given you. Working out of your design will bring you satisfaction will bless and enable you to serve others effectively and will bring glory to our designer. Number two, God assigned life to our pleasure and our growth. In our society, we are concerned with accomplishment, what we do, how we perform, what we produce, how busy we are, etc. We may judge the fruitfulness of our pastor's ministry, for example, by the size of his church, the number of books you written, tapes produced, the presence of a television ministry, etc. Yet Jesus said that all of this doesn't matter unless the person is intimidly connected to him. Remember that Christ calls us to seek the kingdom of God and his righteousness. Not to seek what we can do for the kingdom of God. Being rooted in Christ is a fundamental prerequisite to finding God's will for what we are doing in our life, in our career, in our business. You will not be ready or able to find the career path or the business that you want. He has designed you for unless you are seeking him first. God expect you to work because he knows there is a purpose and fulfillment and it's because that the way we are designed and number three surrender to him your life. It said I cry out to God most high to God to fulfill his purpose to me. This key understanding God's purpose to our life. Brethren, the two most important event in our life when the day you were born and the day you find your AI or the day you find your Adventist identity to Jesus. Nothing matters more than knowing God's Adventist identity for your life and nothing compensate for knowing them. Not success, wealth, fame or pleasure. Jesus choose to be a social entrepreneur, scer carpenter because Jesus is a builder. Today Jesus is building you, me and every Christian. We are in his hands a number construction at all times and his plan is to make us to be more like him. Knowing your AI, your AI or Adventist identity will bring you in heaven in the second coming of Jesus. Living a life with your ultimate AI gives you a chance to live beyond your own limitations. To love, sacrifice, and give to others. Finding a life of meaning, of purpose is the secret of dealing with the stress and anxiety and hopelessness that encou everyday lives. As I end this message this morning, let me share to you this song. [Music] Christ is my reward and all my devotion. [Music] No, there is nothing in this world that could ever satisfy. Every trial my soul will sing. No turning back. I've been set free. [Music] Christ is enough for me. Christ is enough for me. Everything I need is in you. Everything I need. Christ my all in all. The joy of my salvation on this hope will never fail. Heaven is her home. Through every storm, my soul will sing. Jesus is here. To God be the glory. Christ is enough for me. [Music] Christ is enough for me. Everything I need is in you. Everything I need. Christ is enough for me. Christ is enough for [Applause] me. Everything I need is in you. Everything I need. [Music] May I invite everyone the congregation to please stand and sing with me. I have desired to follow Jesus. No turning back. No turning back. Sing with me. I have desired to follow Jesus. No turning back. No turning back. The cross before me. The world behind me. No turning back. No turning back. The cross before me. The world behind me. No turning back. No turning [Music] back. Christ is enough for me. Christ is enough for me. Everything I need is in you. Everything I need. One more time. Christ is enough. Enough for me. Everything I need is in you. Everything I [Music] needed Jesus turning back have designed to follow Jesus. No turning back. No turning back before me. The world behind me. No turning back. No turning [Music] back. The cross before me. The world behind me. No turning back. No turning back. Jesus is our AI. He came into the earth to fulfill his purpose in life. His purpose to save the humanity. Jesus Christs into came into the earth to build our life. Jesus is being grateful and thankful because he found his purpose in life in these earths. He is the image of the invisible God. the firstborn of all creation. For by him all things were created in heaven and earth, visible and invisible, whether thrones or dominions or rulers or authorities. All things were created through him and for him. And he is before all things. And in him all things hold together, a purpose to serve the needy, purpose to heal the sick, a purpose to heal the world, and a purpose to save us from our sins. Jesus, a carpenter, spends his life on earth to fix the brokenness of humanity. In knowing your AI or Adventist identity, Jesus Christ is enough. Everything we need is in him. Happy Sabbath.

[24.1s] our visitors and our online viewers. So
[27.0s] it is such a blessing uh to worship you
[30.2s] today. So what a long journey from the
[32.4s] Philippines. I traveled for almost 24
[35.6s] hours just to reach your beautiful
[38.2s] country from the Philippines to Hong
[40.6s] Kong to Etopia and at last here I am
[44.4s] here in Nairobi. Thank you very much for
[47.5s] the beautiful message of the song.
[49.2s] That's so very
[50.7s] beautiful. And I'm so honest I every
[53.4s] time I uh I I hear the Kenyon song. It's
[59.8s] so very beautiful. It's because I think
[62.3s] in the world you are your your ch
[67.0s] your you have
[69.2s] been very privileged to have that kind
[73.1s] of powerful
[75.6s] voice. It's so beautiful to hear. That's
[79.0s] the the baritone. Okay. And the base.
[82.7s] Okay. That's what I really love with the
[85.7s] Kenyans. And you know what brother and
[88.4s] sisters? So why I'm in
[92.0s] Nairobi? So I am here in Nairobi
[95.5s] uh to attend the global good fund
[98.4s] fellowship where I was selected as one
[101.4s] of the 2025 global good fund
[104.4s] fellows. An honor to given to the 10
[107.8s] change
[108.7s] makers from across the world who are
[112.4s] driving social impact and
[118.4s] innovation. And you know
[121.3s] what one of the most uh moving
[126.0s] experience of this fellowship? a visit
[129.6s] to the football mass community project
[132.7s] in Valley View Academy. Anyone familiar
[136.4s] with this organization? Football mass
[139.2s] Kenya. Anyone
[141.6s] here? No. So basically Football Moss
[145.2s] community project in Valley View Academy
[148.6s] uh serving children in the slum area of
[152.4s] Civera. I think it's very near
[155.4s] here. And this community, the football
[158.2s] must use uses football and
[161.2s] play as tools to build safe
[164.8s] space for children who are victims of
[168.7s] poverty, those with
[170.6s] disabilities, and those who are victims
[173.1s] of
[174.0s] violence. Their work reminded me of our
[179.6s] mission as
[181.5s] Christians to stand for the billable to
[185.0s] create
[186.1s] hope
[187.6s] where is despair and to embody the
[192.0s] Christ love in practical
[195.0s] ways. Me personally, I am a victim of um
[199.6s] children at risk. I grow up in a
[202.8s] community where there is civil war and I
[206.2s] think in some part of Africa we are
[208.1s] still experiencing it like I became part
[211.2s] of the um
[213.5s] displaced children in the Philippines
[216.8s] that's almost years more than a decade
[220.9s] of my
[225.3s] life and within us let's take a pause
[228.8s] for a word of prayer for this children.
[231.3s] Shall we pray?
[233.6s] Lord, here you are. There's a lot of
[236.3s] children at risk in this world. In this
[241.3s] in Kenya and the Philippines and
[243.1s] wherever in this world, there are
[245.2s] victims of
[247.4s] violence. There are some victims of
[250.2s] poverty, victims of civil war. But we
[253.1s] know
[254.0s] Lord that you that we have that
[258.4s] Christ that we have that Lord who are
[262.0s] with them and we are so very thankful
[264.8s] that you are giving them hope in Jesus
[267.4s] name we pray.
[270.6s] Amen. Our
[273.9s] Kthics is uh do we have a slide? It's
[277.8s] possible. Okay. Okay. So our
[282.3s] kithex this
[285.2s] morning is basically found in the
[288.2s] proverbs
[291.9s] 19:21. If you have your Bible, uh,
[295.2s] please open it with me in Proverbs 19
[301.1s] verse 21. And it
[305.1s] says, I will be reading in the New
[308.2s] International
[310.2s] Versions that it
[313.8s] says, "Many are the plans in the mind of
[318.2s] a man, but it is the purpose of the Lord
[323.7s] that will stand." Amen.
[326.8s] The title of our gospel this
[330.6s] morning is living a purpose-driven life
[335.0s] in the age of
[339.6s] AI. Let me begin with a
[344.0s] question. What comes in your mind when
[347.5s] we talk about AI? When you heard AI, it
[351.0s] is artificial intelligence.
[355.1s] So artificial intelligence has became
[357.1s] the beacon for the last year are
[359.0s] machines that program to think, learn
[361.5s] and act like
[364.8s] human. But what is really the meaning of
[368.7s] AI in a Christian perspective? What do
[372.2s] you think
[374.8s] AI? What it is really the meaning of AI
[378.8s] being an
[382.3s] Adventist? So
[384.6s] AI
[387.3s] means adventist
[392.8s] identity. That's
[394.6s] AI. And we've been living we've been
[397.4s] living with AI for several years
[402.0s] ago,
[403.8s] right? So before the artificial
[406.4s] intelligence was created, we are already
[409.7s] living it inside our church.
[413.9s] Have you wondered that? That's how
[415.8s] amazing that we have that kind of
[419.9s] technology that just has been developed
[422.0s] in 2025 or in 2024 recently. But we've
[427.0s] been living this AI for how many years
[431.9s] ago? Since
[434.2s] 1844. So artificial intelligence AI
[438.9s] mens identity and that's adventist
[443.1s] identity. The title of our message this
[445.7s] morning is living a purpose driven life
[448.5s] in the age of AI anchored with adventist
[454.1s] identity.
[457.7s] So AI means adventist that Adventist
[460.6s] identity that has a mission to make
[464.4s] disciple. What is the mission?
[467.7s] To make a
[470.3s] disciple of Jesus Christ who live as his
[473.8s] loving witnesses and proclaim to all
[476.9s] people the everlasting gospel of the
[479.9s] three angels messages in preparation for
[483.4s] his soon return.
[486.8s] AI that
[489.5s] defines to be a 7th day
[492.3s] Adventist rooted in a distinctive
[495.6s] understanding of the
[498.4s] scripture, the life of
[501.3s] Jesus and
[504.3s] purpose as it
[506.4s] shapes how Adventist identity live.
[516.1s] When you accept Jesus Christ as your
[518.9s] personal
[519.8s] savior, have you asked yourself in a
[522.6s] mirror? Who am
[526.3s] I as an
[528.6s] AI? Who am I as an AI? What is my
[533.9s] purpose as an Adventist? as my identity
[538.2s] why I'm
[541.4s] here. So let's take a
[544.0s] look with the life of
[547.0s] Jesus. Why Jesus came to
[551.6s] earth? What was his
[554.1s] purpose? So have you
[558.0s] wondered why Jesus choose to be car to
[561.0s] be a carpenter?
[563.9s] He could have been a
[565.6s] scholar, a priest, a physician, of
[569.8s] course, a king, but he choose to work
[573.4s] with his hands building, crafting,
[577.2s] sweating under the sand. Why Jesus
[581.3s] Christ choose to be a carpenter?
[588.8s] Jesus Jesus wanted to show us that all
[593.8s] works has its purpose. Whatever your
[597.8s] profession, whatever skills that you
[604.5s] have, not just what happened in church,
[607.4s] but what happens in the workplace, in
[610.2s] the field, in the shop and in our
[612.8s] everyday lives. We have a conversation
[615.4s] by pastor oil
[616.8s] ago and we're talking all about
[619.2s] ministry. We have a lot of um pastor uh
[622.9s] we have revelation ministry, health
[625.0s] ministry and a lot of the ministry. And
[627.6s] you know what when I studied the
[630.5s] Bible that the best ministry that we can
[634.5s] have in this world that people surround
[638.5s] us show Jesus in every second of our
[647.2s] life. Jesus is not only an ordinary
[650.7s] carpenter. He was also a minister, a
[653.8s] leader and yes, even an
[658.2s] entrepreneur. Jesus is an entrepreneur.
[661.8s] He was a social entrepreneur, a
[665.4s] mission-driven servant who addressed
[667.2s] social injustices through love,
[669.5s] inclusion, and transformation. So if you
[672.2s] can see in the history of the Bible from
[674.6s] the Old Testament to the New Testament,
[676.9s] in the Old Testament there are a lot of
[680.1s] slavery and the slavery happened in the
[683.9s] carpentry or construction industry when
[687.3s] the Israelite was captured by by the
[690.2s] Egyptians. What they did with the
[691.7s] Israelites to build those different
[694.6s] buildings in Egypt. And Jesus is one of
[698.2s] the reason why the slavery from the Old
[700.9s] Testament to the New Testament lesson or
[704.6s] in some places ended. He is an
[707.8s] interpreter. It's because he is
[709.3s] negotiating okay during his childhood.
[711.6s] Okay. He is negotiating with his
[713.4s] carpentry works in order to sell in the
[716.5s] market. But beyond Jesus able behind
[721.5s] being a carpenter Jesus healed the sick
[723.5s] for feed the hungry taught the forgotten
[725.3s] and gave people a sense of belongingness
[727.9s] to something greater than
[731.3s] themsself. So you know what Jesus this
[733.5s] is one of the most beautiful discovery
[736.2s] that I have in with
[738.4s] Jesus being a
[741.3s] social entrepreneur.
[744.2s] Jesus as an
[746.0s] entrepreneur he's has a message in an
[750.0s] entrepreneurship you need a tagline like
[752.2s] for example in bamboo high so we have
[754.3s] saving the planet saving lives cuz we
[757.0s] want to address plastic pollution but
[760.0s] Jesus his key
[762.3s] message is seek you first the kingdom of
[766.1s] God and his righteousness and all other
[768.5s] things shall be other sh all things
[772.1s] shall be added unto you what is your
[775.3s] gospel Jesus it's very clear with his
[778.5s] gospel in seeking first the kingdom of
[781.0s] God and his
[783.2s] righteousness number two
[786.6s] disciplehip come follow me Jesus said
[790.5s] and I will make you fishers of men Jesus
[794.6s] did not work alone he called ordinary
[797.8s] people fishermen tax collectors to walk
[800.9s] with him Come follow me. Jesus said and
[805.2s] I will we and I will make you fishers of
[809.6s] man.
[812.0s] Innovation. What are your signs and
[816.8s] wonders? As Jesus as the greatest
[821.6s] innovator, he Jesus is the greatest
[824.9s] entrepreneur ever because he was the
[827.2s] most innovative ever. Jesus healed the
[829.9s] sick. Jesus made the blind sea. Jesus
[833.0s] walked on water. Just Jesus turned water
[835.7s] to wine. Jesus rose to dead. Jesus rose
[838.9s] up from the dead. And above all,
[842.3s] Jesus the greatest innovation that Jesus
[845.3s] made is the
[846.8s] salvation. Jesus invented salvation.
[849.8s] Mankind far passports to life after
[852.7s] death. An innovation product that man
[858.0s] desperately desired. And I think one of
[861.2s] my favorite being an entrepreneur you
[863.2s] need to have profit. And this is one
[865.9s] thing Jesus in his life his
[869.2s] profitability mission okay measured by
[872.9s] the number of lives he saved his
[876.3s] business is saving lives. So his bottom
[879.4s] line is
[882.3s] measured. We are all entrepreneur here.
[885.4s] What is your baseline of profitability?
[889.4s] How many
[891.4s] people have you tell about the most
[894.4s] beautiful story in the history? The
[896.8s] story of
[898.8s] Jesus. It's so nice that the
[901.6s] profitability of Jesus is
[905.2s] based on the number okay based on the
[908.8s] number of the
[910.4s] people that he can bring to his father.
[915.5s] Jesus didn't chase didn't chase profit
[918.8s] and money. His prophet his profit was
[922.1s] insolved to
[923.6s] save and
[925.8s] purpose why he
[929.2s] exist.
[931.4s] Jesus has a clear purpose for coming
[934.2s] into this world of course to save the
[936.0s] humanity from eternal damnation and give
[939.4s] eternal life. For God so loved the world
[941.7s] that he gave his only begotten son that
[943.7s] whosoever believe in him shall not
[945.8s] perish but have an everlasting
[948.9s] life. Jesus has a clear purpose to
[952.1s] coming in this
[953.8s] world. So Jesus is very passionate of
[957.8s] being a carpent of being a carpenter and
[961.0s] an entrepreneur because he want to build
[966.2s] your life.
[968.3s] Jesus is passionate of being a carpenter
[971.9s] entrepreneur. It's because he want to
[975.3s] build your
[979.9s] life.
[981.4s] Today many fear about technology like I
[986.1s] saw a lot of Facebook page when the
[988.4s] artificial intelligence was introduced.
[991.5s] There's a lot of post in the Facebook
[993.7s] that this is already the mark of the
[995.5s] beast. AI is already mark of the
[998.8s] beast. But brothers and sisters, our AI
[1003.1s] or our Adventist
[1004.8s] identity,
[1006.3s] prophecy is sent the gospel. Okay, let's
[1009.4s] take a look for that. Prophecy is sent
[1011.9s] the
[1014.6s] gospel. Jesus
[1018.3s] is brethren, let's not spread fear or
[1023.1s] false hope. live like
[1026.0s] Christ in a world history inclining
[1029.8s] closer for the incoming of
[1032.8s] Jesus. How should we
[1035.8s] react? How we can bring our AI in this
[1039.4s] world? When we use the Bible prophecies
[1042.2s] which may inflict fear or our messages
[1045.0s] are too alarming, we lose the very heart
[1047.9s] of the gospel. Truth in its purest
[1051.6s] essence, no fear, no hatred, no false
[1055.6s] predictions, no fake
[1058.0s] conversations. How should we act? How we
[1060.6s] should react in the age of AI? How we
[1063.1s] can bring that AI our Adventist identity
[1066.4s] when we use Bible prophecies which may
[1068.5s] inflict fear of our misserts are too
[1070.6s] alarming. So we lost the very heart of
[1073.4s] the gospel. We need to bring the truth
[1075.8s] in its purest sense. No fear, no hatred.
[1079.4s] No false production, no fake
[1081.1s] conversation. So what's the twist?
[1083.6s] Refrain from posting or sharing posts
[1085.6s] which express religious biases. Respect
[1089.1s] others religious development and
[1091.2s] celebration. Prophecy is not gospel.
[1094.0s] Jesus is the gospel. Your Christ your
[1097.6s] Christlike life is the gospel. When you
[1100.6s] live Christ, you draw the world to him.
[1104.2s] Do not be
[1105.3s] destruction rather than be attraction.
[1108.5s] That's beautiful. That's how the how our
[1110.8s] gospel should
[1115.7s] be. So do not be a distraction rather
[1119.8s] than be an attraction. So just want to
[1122.6s] share to you my AI or Adventist identity
[1125.4s] in Jesus. So I came from a very poor
[1128.3s] family in the Philippines. So we're 11
[1131.3s] siblings. So during our childhood, you
[1134.2s] know, we live in a 20 square meter hut.
[1137.2s] uh sometimes sleep in the in the
[1138.9s] classroom at the back at the back of the
[1140.5s] church and at the times we were lucky to
[1143.5s] have even one meal in a
[1146.9s] day. So we walk at least during our
[1150.2s] elementary or basic education we need to
[1152.2s] walk for 4 hours just to go to school.
[1156.0s] So one of the memories that I um so this
[1158.2s] is basically how we work and I think
[1159.6s] it's uh almost similar with some of the
[1163.0s] places here in Ken Kenya and one of the
[1165.5s] experience that I will never forget and
[1167.0s] became my inspiration of who am I now
[1170.4s] when I was in grade six during an
[1173.0s] examination day I left our house without
[1176.2s] breakfast during lunch I went back home
[1179.0s] expecting to have some food to eat but
[1182.0s] when I arrived at home my parents and my
[1184.3s] siblings was not there. I look in the
[1186.6s] container and at the and at the table of
[1188.9s] something to eat but saw nothing. I just
[1191.4s] found a glass of water. I drank and I
[1195.4s] cried a lot during the time. And I said
[1197.9s] to myself, starting today, I will never
[1201.4s] cry again. And this water soon we will
[1203.8s] place in rice cuz rice is life in the
[1207.8s] Philippines. Soon this water we will
[1209.9s] place it in a commercial powdered
[1212.4s] milk. because we never experience to
[1215.0s] drink those commercial merc. I will
[1217.5s] place this in our van and luckily I
[1221.0s] graduated from college as a
[1222.9s] self-supporting student and working
[1226.7s] students as a food technology. So I was
[1229.9s] 25 years old already when I uh finished
[1233.2s] my college that's so very late. So
[1235.6s] there's a lot of things like I was
[1237.1s] became part of the automated election of
[1238.9s] the Philippines. I volunteer a lot in
[1241.1s] the different com community. So since
[1244.0s] college I volunteered a lot in the
[1245.4s] community and peace building around the
[1247.0s] Philippines and the transition of my
[1249.3s] life happened here in this place that
[1252.2s] considered as one of the most dangerous
[1254.1s] place in the Philippines. So they
[1256.2s] invited me to conduct a leadership
[1257.8s] training and then supposedly that
[1259.8s] Saturday I'm going to met our missionary
[1262.7s] but sadly a week before our missionary
[1265.9s] was killed cuz that community is a
[1267.5s] Muslim community and our missionary was
[1269.8s] killed. It's because he brought Bible
[1272.5s] inside that community which is haram in
[1275.0s] the place. I'm so
[1277.1s] sad but beyond of all those thing that's
[1280.6s] really happened and I experienced when I
[1283.0s] visited this community I experienced the
[1284.9s] greatest miracle of my life. So when we
[1287.8s] entered the community the uh the rain is
[1290.9s] so heavy like uh the pouring of rain is
[1293.0s] very heavy and then when we arrived you
[1295.8s] know in in the venue where we are going
[1298.2s] to conduct the training the rain
[1299.8s] stopped. The same thing happened when we
[1302.2s] went back home and we were ambushed by
[1305.6s] the rebels in the in in the community
[1308.3s] but still thank you God that we are
[1310.8s] still alive. So that was the greatest
[1312.8s] miracle with the rain that um during the
[1316.0s] time it's not a rainy season in the
[1317.4s] Philippines but why God provide us rain
[1320.5s] in order to protect us. And then during
[1322.8s] the time I had this dream that in my
[1325.2s] dream someone is telling me Mark you
[1328.0s] need to do something you your family is
[1330.2s] already out of of poverty you able to
[1332.6s] finish all your siblings from their
[1335.5s] education and then someone telling me
[1337.7s] that you need to start a certain
[1341.4s] business cuz you are going to restore my
[1344.8s] creation. I want I will be going in my
[1347.7s] second coming if you are going to
[1349.7s] restore of how beautiful I created the
[1353.7s] earth and that's basically a transition.
[1356.1s] So during the time I have only around
[1358.2s] $250 US in my pocket I went back home to
[1361.6s] to the city to Metro Manila. Then I um
[1366.4s] after arriving in Mandela so I quit my
[1370.0s] full-time job. So I um with that certain
[1374.3s] amount of around $250
[1377.4s] uh US dollars uh in my pocket. So it's
[1381.3s] really hard to become an entrepreneur.
[1385.2s] But you know what
[1388.9s] brethren? My journey of being an
[1391.7s] entrepreneur happened in this story.
[1394.1s] Let's watch
[1395.6s] this. Is there an audio? This is solving
[1399.8s] one of the world's Okay, basically we
[1401.8s] don't have an audio and that. Okay,
[1404.5s] that's it. This Filipino is solving one
[1407.4s] of the world's biggest problems using
[1409.6s] only a toothbrush. He's growing more
[1412.6s] trees. He's using less plastic and he's
[1414.8s] helping people in extreme poverty. But
[1417.1s] before I tell you exactly how he does
[1419.3s] it, I have to tell you about the
[1420.8s] problems he's trying to solve.
[1426.7s] You see, if your great great great great
[1428.6s] great great great grandfather had used a
[1431.4s] plastic toothbrush like
[1433.4s] this, as disgusting as it sounds, you
[1436.2s] might still be able to use that
[1437.6s] toothbrush today because it doesn't
[1442.2s] disappear appear. Well, luckily for us,
[1445.5s] back then, plastic toothbrushes didn't
[1447.8s] exist.
[1449.4s] But now we're leaving billions of them
[1451.3s] behind for future generations and they
[1453.7s] end up in places like
[1458.3s] this. And I've seen this problem myself
[1461.2s] in the Philippines. I traveled all the
[1463.4s] way from the north to the south, from
[1465.4s] the windmills of Locos to the pink
[1467.5s] beaches of Zimbanga. And sadly, I saw
[1470.5s] trash everywhere I
[1472.0s] [Applause]
[1473.8s] went. But it was on this journey that I
[1476.9s] met this guy. His name is Mark Sultan
[1480.2s] and when he was a kid, he lived in
[1481.9s] extreme poverty. I come from a family of
[1484.4s] farmers who used to survive with $60 a
[1487.4s] month. He lived through the problems
[1489.4s] that many Filipinos go through and he
[1492.0s] wanted to fix them. I noticed that a lot
[1494.0s] of the trash in my barangi was full of
[1495.8s] plastic toothbrushes and it gave me an
[1498.5s] idea. And that's when he created Bambooh
[1501.3s] [Applause]
[1502.4s] High, a social enterprise that makes
[1505.1s] toothbrushes from bamboo that decompose
[1507.9s] in just 3 months. And inside of every
[1510.6s] single one of these toothbrushes is a
[1512.2s] seed. So after 3 months of using it, you
[1514.6s] can plant it in the ground and grow a
[1516.6s] tree. The bristles and packaging can be
[1519.0s] used as a fertilizer together with a
[1521.4s] bamboo handle.
[1525.0s] Now we've grown thousand of trees
[1527.4s] throughout the Philippines and helped to
[1529.7s] solve the plastic toothbrush problem.
[1532.2s] And this toothbrush doesn't only help
[1534.0s] the environment, it also helps the
[1536.0s] people because they gave hundreds of
[1537.9s] Filipinos jobs. We are impacting a lot
[1540.5s] of farmers and all of them used to live
[1543.0s] in extreme poverty like me. For example,
[1546.4s] this woman, Analene, has gotten out of
[1548.6s] poverty and even built this house for
[1550.5s] her family all because of bamboo
[1552.8s] toothbrushes. Think about this. You can
[1555.0s] help to stop the plastic problem. You
[1557.0s] can reforest and you can help reduce
[1559.2s] extreme poverty or with something as
[1561.8s] simple as a
[1563.4s] toothbrush. And that's the journey.
[1566.9s] What's up? I've hidden this emoji. For
[1568.8s] me started or being a faith-driven
[1572.5s] entrepreneur. And you know what? It's
[1574.7s] really hard to become an entrepreneur.
[1577.5s] It's really hard to become a social
[1580.1s] entrepreneur. It's more harder to become
[1582.9s] a faith-driven entrepreneur. Cuz the
[1585.3s] business should be inclined in the
[1587.0s] principle of Jesus. That the business
[1590.2s] will not distract the environment. That
[1592.6s] the business is helping the
[1595.6s] poor. That the business is changing the
[1599.1s] world. You know what? six months after I
[1601.8s] start uh after I started the company the
[1605.4s] um we only have around $1,000 US sales
[1609.8s] and I need to pay for around
[1613.6s] $5,000 and I question
[1616.2s] God why you brought me why you put me in
[1619.3s] this
[1620.3s] situation but you know what God reminds
[1623.1s] me in this
[1625.5s] verse in Jeremiah
[1629.1s] 29:12-4 Then you will call upon me and
[1631.9s] come and pray to me and I will hear you.
[1634.2s] You will seek me and find me when you
[1636.2s] seek me with your all your heart. I will
[1638.3s] be found by you, declares the Lord. And
[1641.1s] I will restore your fortunes and gather
[1643.4s] you from all the nations and all the
[1646.1s] places where I have driven you, declares
[1648.1s] the Lord. And in
[1651.6s] 2019, I said to myself, this is my
[1655.1s] purpose in life. This is my Adventist
[1658.0s] identity.
[1659.9s] You know what before pandemic came in a
[1662.2s] big trial we experienced almost 10 days
[1665.4s] uh we not able to provide a salaries for
[1667.8s] our
[1669.1s] employees. One Saturday I I fasted and
[1672.2s] prayed the whole day. After the sunset I
[1674.8s] have this whole peace and pray to God
[1676.4s] that Lord starting today I will
[1679.1s] surrender my life to you. I will never
[1681.7s] question you anymore. Then I have a
[1684.8s] peaceful set. The next morning, Sunday,
[1688.4s] someone message uh I saw a message
[1691.1s] request request in my
[1693.9s] Facebook. When I check her Facebook, we
[1696.4s] don't have mutual
[1697.7s] friend. So, I need to be hesitant is
[1700.6s] because the scam is very rampant
[1702.4s] everywhere in the
[1704.4s] internet. I have some
[1707.2s] hesitations. But God reminds my reminds
[1710.5s] me and he tell me, "My child, you
[1713.8s] already
[1715.2s] surrender to me your life. Allow me to
[1718.6s] solve your
[1720.9s] problems." I replied to that
[1724.0s] woman cuz that woman um he messaged me
[1727.7s] that Mark, I have um a savings in my
[1731.4s] bank account and I want to invest in
[1733.6s] your
[1736.8s] company. So that's Sunday morning and
[1739.4s] then I met the woman. We don't have
[1741.0s] mutual friend.
[1745.3s] So when we met up, I shared to him uh to
[1748.6s] her our my experience that you know what
[1751.0s] last night I just pray to God okay that
[1753.6s] he will provide and here come you
[1755.9s] message
[1757.0s] me and then we have a conversation and
[1761.0s] then he started sharing you know what
[1763.5s] Mark I don't have a plan to invest my
[1766.4s] money in my because that's my savings
[1768.7s] but someone bothering me last night that
[1771.5s] I need to invest this money and you know
[1774.0s] what the money that we really that that
[1778.0s] we really need during the time is exact
[1780.7s] it's the same money that he want to
[1783.3s] invest in my
[1786.9s] company. Wow
[1789.5s] Lord thank you. I'm so very amazed with
[1793.7s] how grateful if we are just to fully
[1796.4s] surrender our life to Jesus. And you
[1798.9s] know what that woman we found out that
[1802.1s] we're just neighbor. She's just around
[1805.0s] 500 m away. But we never we never met
[1809.3s] before. That's the first time that we
[1811.4s] met. Without hesitation, without any
[1814.6s] contract, without any agreement, he
[1816.6s] signed a check and gave it to
[1819.1s] me. I go, Lord, how this woman will be
[1823.1s] trusted this your
[1825.9s] servant without any agreement, without
[1828.6s] any contract, with that big amount cuz
[1831.5s] that's basically around
[1836.2s] $5,000 and you know starting the time
[1839.1s] came and pandemic came
[1843.5s] in. So that day I never questioned our
[1847.4s] God. You know what brother and sisters
[1850.5s] as we surrender to all to all to him we
[1854.6s] have a true and lasting feast. We have
[1857.5s] overflowing joy and an incomparable hope
[1860.4s] and purpose will fill us and lead us
[1863.2s] forward in this journey of being an
[1866.0s] entrepreneur. We able to uplift uh 81
[1869.4s] families uh out of poverty.
[1872.7s] So that's 81 families already that we
[1875.4s] uplift out of poverty. Like before their
[1877.8s] income is just below $60 US and now
[1880.5s] their income is more than $200 to
[1885.3s] $500. In this journey, God really
[1887.6s] blessed me with a lot of blessings. I
[1890.4s] can uh deeply say that I am a me that I
[1893.0s] am a millionaire without millions of
[1895.8s] monies but with millions of souls were
[1899.5s] rich and
[1901.2s] impacted. And as the world advanced in
[1903.8s] knowledge and technology I found my AI
[1907.8s] my adventist
[1910.1s] identity in Jesus. An an identity not
[1914.7s] just in what I believe but how we live
[1916.5s] with Christlike life. AI with a purpose
[1919.3s] to be disciple and create more disciples
[1922.4s] at the as so I never
[1927.0s] imagined in that journey that this young
[1930.4s] boy a farmer became a presidential
[1933.4s] appointee you know what I don't have any
[1935.2s] political
[1936.8s] background the the president who
[1939.6s] appointed me I never voted for him
[1941.2s] during election and there is a calling
[1943.8s] but I think there's some like a calling
[1946.5s] that God and you What what that
[1948.4s] innovation that made the president
[1950.3s] impress that plantable toothbrush that
[1952.6s] we developed okay pastor habet I only
[1955.3s] have one left okay with us so I never I
[1959.8s] never
[1961.0s] imagined to take me from that from being
[1963.8s] a farmer and now a presidential
[1965.3s] appointee and you know what the big
[1967.1s] vision we have a lot of conversation
[1969.4s] with which I shared to our uh elders
[1971.9s] that I have this vision that by 2032 or
[1975.4s] 204 I will become the President of the
[1977.9s] Republic of the
[1980.5s] Philippines. So as
[1982.7s] Christians, we desire to live our lives
[1985.8s] in a way that is blessing to the Lord.
[1989.1s] We want to do his will in all aspects of
[1991.4s] our lives in the daily choices we make
[1994.0s] that govern our actions and in the Lord
[1997.0s] and in in the lords of life decisions we
[2000.1s] have to make.
[2002.2s] Scripture does give us clear guidance
[2004.8s] regarding the moral choices we are to
[2006.8s] make as God's sons and
[2008.6s] daughter. So what can we do to make our
[2011.3s] life have purpose? What are within the
[2014.1s] will of gods in our
[2015.9s] lives? These biblical principles will
[2018.6s] guide us. God has created you with the
[2021.4s] aptitude for particular skills and
[2024.0s] abilities and with the inclination
[2026.2s] toward particular interest. You are
[2028.6s] God's hand or work. He created your
[2031.5s] inmost being and knit you together in
[2033.9s] your mother's womb. You are purply and
[2036.3s] wonderfully made. You have been given
[2038.3s] workrelated gifts that have been chosen
[2041.1s] specifically for you. God desires you
[2044.6s] for you for you to use your gifts he has
[2047.4s] given you. Working out of your design
[2050.9s] will bring you satisfaction will bless
[2053.4s] and enable you to serve others
[2055.2s] effectively and will bring glory to our
[2058.2s] designer. Number two, God assigned life
[2061.8s] to our pleasure and our growth. In our
[2065.9s] society, we are concerned with
[2068.4s] accomplishment, what we do, how we
[2070.6s] perform, what we produce, how busy we
[2073.4s] are,
[2075.1s] etc. We may judge the fruitfulness of
[2077.8s] our pastor's ministry, for example, by
[2080.4s] the size of his church, the number of
[2082.8s] books you written, tapes produced, the
[2085.8s] presence of a television ministry, etc.
[2088.5s] Yet Jesus said that all of this doesn't
[2090.7s] matter unless the person is intimidly
[2094.4s] connected to him. Remember that Christ
[2098.1s] calls us to seek the kingdom of God and
[2100.6s] his
[2101.7s] righteousness. Not to seek what we can
[2104.2s] do for the kingdom of God. Being rooted
[2107.3s] in Christ is a fundamental prerequisite
[2110.2s] to finding God's will for what we are
[2113.0s] doing in our life, in our career, in our
[2114.9s] business.
[2116.7s] You will not be ready or able to find
[2119.2s] the career path or the business that you
[2121.2s] want. He has designed you for unless you
[2124.2s] are seeking him
[2125.4s] first. God expect you to work because he
[2128.6s] knows there is a purpose and fulfillment
[2131.1s] and it's because that the way we are
[2133.0s] designed and number three surrender to
[2136.3s] him your life.
[2139.5s] It said I cry out to God most high to
[2143.5s] God to fulfill his purpose to me. This
[2147.3s] key understanding God's purpose to our
[2149.6s] life. Brethren, the two most important
[2153.5s] event in our
[2155.4s] life when the day you were born and the
[2160.1s] day you find your AI or the day you find
[2164.8s] your Adventist identity to Jesus.
[2168.2s] Nothing matters more than knowing God's
[2170.8s] Adventist identity for your life and
[2173.4s] nothing compensate for knowing them. Not
[2175.6s] success, wealth, fame or pleasure.
[2181.2s] Jesus choose to be a social
[2183.4s] entrepreneur, scer carpenter because
[2186.4s] Jesus is a builder. Today Jesus is
[2190.9s] building you, me and every Christian. We
[2195.0s] are in his hands a number construction
[2197.3s] at all times and his plan is to make us
[2199.8s] to be more like him. Knowing your AI,
[2203.4s] your AI or Adventist identity will bring
[2205.7s] you in heaven in the second coming of
[2208.2s] Jesus. Living a life with your ultimate
[2210.7s] AI gives you a chance to live beyond
[2213.5s] your own limitations. To love,
[2216.5s] sacrifice, and give to others. Finding a
[2220.2s] life of meaning, of purpose is the
[2222.5s] secret of dealing with the stress and
[2224.8s] anxiety and hopelessness that encou
[2229.0s] everyday lives.
[2231.2s] As I end this message this morning, let
[2235.6s] me share to you this song.
[2245.4s] [Music]
[2274.1s] Christ is my
[2277.7s] reward and all my devotion.
[2283.1s] [Music]

[2290.8s] world that could ever

[2303.6s] sing. No turning
[2307.4s] back. I've been set free.

[2352.1s] salvation on this hope will never fail.
[2359.0s] Heaven is her
[2363.6s] home. Through every
[2367.4s] storm, my soul will
[2370.6s] sing. Jesus is
[2373.8s] here. To God be the
[2379.6s] glory.
[2381.3s] Christ is enough for me.
[2386.6s] [Music]

[2394.8s] me. Everything I need is in
[2401.4s] you. Everything I
[2406.2s] need.

[2414.3s] Christ is enough for
[2419.3s] [Applause]
[2421.1s] me. Everything I need is in
[2428.0s] you. Everything I need.
[2435.6s] [Music]
[2441.7s] May I invite everyone the congregation
[2443.4s] to please stand and sing with
[2448.7s] me. I have
[2451.6s] desired to follow
[2455.1s] Jesus. No turning
[2458.2s] back. No turning back. Sing with me. I
[2463.0s] have
[2464.8s] desired to follow
[2468.2s] Jesus. No turning back. No turning

[2480.8s] behind me. No turning
[2484.6s] back. No turning
[2488.0s] back. The cross
[2490.6s] before me. The world behind me. No
[2496.6s] turning back. No turning
[2500.9s] [Music]
[2503.2s] back. Christ is enough for
[2509.6s] me.

[2517.9s] me. Everything I need is in you.
[2525.7s] Everything I
[2527.8s] need. One more time.
[2531.2s] Christ is
[2539.3s] enough. Enough for
[2544.8s] me. Everything I need is in you.
[2552.4s] Everything I
[2557.4s] [Music]
[2559.8s] needed
[2565.4s] Jesus turning
[2568.8s] back have
[2571.7s] designed to follow
[2575.0s] Jesus. No turning back. No
[2579.5s] turning
[2582.5s] back before me. The world
[2587.3s] behind me. No turning
[2591.6s] back. No turning
[2593.8s] [Music]
[2595.2s] back. The cross
[2597.6s] before me. The world
[2600.8s] behind me. No turning back. No
[2606.3s] turning
[2610.4s] back. Jesus is our AI. He came into the
[2615.8s] earth to fulfill his purpose in life.
[2618.9s] His purpose to save the humanity. Jesus
[2622.7s] Christs into came into the earth to
[2624.8s] build our life. Jesus is being grateful
[2627.3s] and thankful because he found his
[2628.9s] purpose in life in these earths. He is
[2631.9s] the image of the invisible God. the
[2634.5s] firstborn of all creation. For by him
[2637.5s] all things were created in heaven and
[2640.0s] earth, visible and invisible, whether
[2643.2s] thrones or dominions or rulers or
[2645.6s] authorities. All things were created
[2648.4s] through him and for him. And he is
[2651.1s] before all things. And in him all things
[2653.6s] hold together, a purpose to serve the
[2656.7s] needy, purpose to heal the sick, a
[2659.7s] purpose to heal the world, and a purpose
[2661.7s] to save us from our sins. Jesus, a
[2666.1s] carpenter, spends his life on earth to
[2669.0s] fix the brokenness of humanity. In
[2672.6s] knowing your AI or Adventist
[2676.3s] identity, Jesus Christ is enough.
[2680.3s] Everything we need is in him. Happy
[2683.7s] Sabbath.
