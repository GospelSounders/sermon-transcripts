I only mention what I want and my auntie will give it to me. Now let me tell you a story. The title is trust in God. Ella was a bright and hardworking young girl who loved animals more than anything. When when a teacher gave the class a big project to create a poster about an animal, Ella chose an elephant. She knew it would take a lot of time. So she asked her friendly and m to help. They all agreed and Ella felt happy and excited. She gathered all she needed, clean the table and even made cookies to share with her friends. But when the day came, her friends didn't show up. Lily went to play soccer and May didn't come. Ella sat alone at the table and finished poster feeling sad. Her grandmother noticed how quiet and sad Ella had become.

Anytime I need anything, I pray to God be about it first before I tell my parents because it's I know it's God who provides for my parents. My sister and my brother trust their parents and guardian more than God. That is not good because because God wants us to trust him for everything. Ruby, from the story, what do we learn? I learned it is better to trust God not human beings because human beings can fail us. Let let us pray to end the story. Dear father, thank you for this day. Thank you for the story. Help us to appreate the story in our lives. In Jesus name I pray. Amen.

[33.8s] my auntie will give it to me.
[37.0s] Now let me tell you a story. The title
[39.6s] is trust in God. Ella was a bright and
[42.2s] hardworking young girl who loved animals
[44.6s] more than anything. When when a teacher
[47.0s] gave the class a big project to create a
[49.8s] poster about an animal, Ella chose an
[53.7s] elephant. She knew it would take a lot
[56.2s] of time. So she asked her friendly and m
[59.0s] to help. They all agreed and Ella felt
[61.8s] happy and excited. She gathered all she
[64.7s] needed, clean the table and even made
[66.8s] cookies to share with her friends. But
[69.4s] when the day came, her friends didn't
[72.1s] show
[72.9s] up. Lily went to play soccer and May
[76.2s] didn't come. Ella sat alone at the table
[79.5s] and finished poster feeling sad. Her
[82.6s] grandmother noticed how quiet and sad
[85.5s] Ella had become. She sat with Ella and
[89.0s] reminded her of something
[90.8s] important. People can fail us even when
[93.8s] don't mean to, but God never
[96.6s] does. He is always faithful, present,
[99.4s] and trustworthy. That night, Ella took a
[103.8s] quiet moment to pray and ask God for
[105.8s] strength and peace. The next morning,
[109.0s] she woke up feeling hopeful. She worked
[111.5s] hard hard all day and managed to finish
[114.6s] the posture beautifully on her own. When
[117.5s] she brought it to school, her teacher
[119.5s] was impressed. But more importantly,
[122.6s] Ella felt something even better. Peace
[125.4s] in her heart. She had learned that where
[128.3s] people may disappoint her sometimes, God
[130.8s] never
[132.4s] would. He was the one she could always
[135.1s] count on for me. Therefore, I search in
[138.2s] God for everything I need. Anytime I
[140.7s] need anything, I pray to God be about it
[144.5s] first before I tell my parents because
[147.0s] it's I know it's God who provides for my
[150.3s] parents. My sister and my brother trust
[152.8s] their parents and guardian more than
[154.4s] God. That is not good because because
[157.9s] God wants us to trust him for
[160.0s] everything. Ruby, from the story, what
[162.8s] do we learn? I learned it is better to
[165.3s] trust God not human beings because human
[168.4s] beings can fail
[172.0s] us. Let let us pray to end the story.
[174.7s] Dear father, thank you for this day.
[176.8s] Thank you for the story. Help us to
[178.6s] appreate the story in our lives. In
[180.1s] Jesus name I pray. Amen.
