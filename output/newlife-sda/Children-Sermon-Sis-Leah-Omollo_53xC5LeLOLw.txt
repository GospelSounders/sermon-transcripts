FULL TRANSCRIPT:
[Music] Happy Sabbath. Happy day. Happy day. Happy Sabbath. Happy Sabbath, children. Happy Sabbath, parents. I'm here today to give their children's story. It comes from our key text Ephesians 2 10. The title of our story is Lily's craving. Our hearts crave for God. If we read the book of Ephesians 2 10, it says we are God's creation. He created us to belong to Christ Jesus. Now we can do good works. Long ago God prepared these works for us to do. We getting that one one sunny day, Lily's grandmama by the name Grandma Grace noticed that Lily was a bit sad. So she got worried and asked Lily, Lily, what is the problem? Lily said, "Grandma, I have everything, but I'm just feeling a bit sad." So what did Grandma say? Grandma told her, "Let me tell you a story from the Bible. Maybe if you listen to that story, you might feel better." So, Grandma started. A long time ago, there was a man named Paul. He wrote a letter to the people of Ephesus. In his letter, he said, "We are God's creation. He created us to belong to Christ Jesus. Now, we can do good works." Long ago, God prepared these works for us to do. He wrote this letter in Greek language. And in this language, the words he used for God's creation or God masterpiece meant that we are made very special. We are like a beautiful piece of love, a nice painting, a scripture with a pretty design. This means that each one of us is special and has a purpose given by God. Lily's eyes widened and what did Lily say? She asked grandma, "Does it mean that I also have a special place in God's heart?" And grandma told her, "Yes, you know, God loves everyone. And for you to have a special place in God's heart, you need to spend more time with God." Lily wondered, "How do I spend more time with God?" Grandma told her, "For you to spend more time with God, you just need to read his word so that you understand God better." Just the way you spend more time with your friends in school, more time with your friends in church, more time with your friends when you play is the same way you need to spend more time with God as you read his word. So Lily said, "From now hence forth, I'll be reading God's word." Then grandma told her to read the book of John 15:es 5. And the book says, "I am the vine, you are the branches. If you remain in me and I in you, you will bear much fruit." So Lily said, "Yes, if God is the vine, I am just a branch. I will continue remaining in God so that I can know more about him. Lily thought for a wide and then decided every morning I'll be reading a Bible story. The days went by and Lily noticed something amazing. The emptiness and the sadness she had in her heart just decided to disappear. Then one day, Lily ran to her grandma and said, "Grandma Grace, I think I understand now. The emptiness I had in my heart has started to disappear. I feel much happy. I feel more peaceful and full of joy." She also decided that she'll be loving people more. Then Grandma Lily hugged Lily and said, "That is right, my dear. When we know who we are in Christ and spend time with him and live to follow him, our hearts will be full and happy. Remember, you are God's creation and he loves you very much." And from that day on, Lily continued to grow her relationship with God. She always remembers that she was his special creation with a wonderful purpose. Children, today I just want to encourage you plus parents that we should always remember that we are God's special creation with a wonderful purpose. May God bless us all. Let's shine for teacher. Shine, shine, shine.

TIMESTAMPED TRANSCRIPT:
[0.0s] [Music]
[13.4s] Happy Sabbath. Happy day. Happy day.
[16.4s] Happy Sabbath. Happy Sabbath, children.
[20.2s] Happy Sabbath, parents.
[23.0s] I'm here today to give their children's
[25.0s] story. It comes from our key text
[27.9s] Ephesians 2 10. The title of our story
[32.1s] is Lily's craving. Our hearts crave for
[37.0s] God.
[39.0s] If we read the book of Ephesians 2 10,
[41.8s] it says we are God's creation. He
[45.3s] created us to belong to Christ Jesus.
[48.3s] Now we can do good works. Long ago God
[51.7s] prepared these works for us to do. We
[55.0s] getting that one one sunny day,
[59.7s] Lily's grandmama by the name Grandma
[63.8s] Grace noticed that Lily was a bit sad.
[68.1s] So she got worried and asked Lily, Lily,
[72.1s] what is the problem? Lily said,
[75.2s] "Grandma, I have everything, but I'm
[78.5s] just feeling a bit sad." So what did
[81.7s] Grandma say? Grandma told her, "Let me
[85.1s] tell you a story from the Bible. Maybe
[87.7s] if you listen to that story, you might
[90.4s] feel better."
[92.3s] So, Grandma started. A long time ago,
[96.2s] there was a man named Paul. He wrote a
[99.6s] letter to the people of Ephesus. In his
[102.8s] letter, he said, "We are God's creation.
[106.8s] He created us to belong to Christ Jesus.
[110.2s] Now, we can do good works." Long ago,
[113.4s] God prepared these works for us to do.
[116.5s] He wrote this letter in Greek language.
[119.8s] And in this language, the words he used
[122.8s] for God's creation or God masterpiece
[126.5s] meant that we are made very special.
[131.4s] We are like a beautiful piece of love, a
[135.2s] nice painting, a scripture with a pretty
[139.0s] design. This means that each one of us
[142.6s] is special and has a purpose given by
[145.3s] God. Lily's eyes widened and what did
[149.4s] Lily say? She asked grandma, "Does it
[153.1s] mean that I also have a special place in
[155.6s] God's heart?" And grandma told her,
[158.4s] "Yes, you know, God loves everyone.
[162.8s] And for you to have a special place in
[164.9s] God's heart, you need to spend more time
[168.1s] with God." Lily wondered, "How do I
[171.4s] spend more time with God?" Grandma told
[174.4s] her, "For you to spend more time with
[176.7s] God, you just need to read his word so
[180.0s] that you understand God better." Just
[182.6s] the way you spend more time with your
[185.0s] friends in school, more time with your
[187.5s] friends in church, more time with your
[189.8s] friends when you play is the same way
[192.2s] you need to spend more time with God as
[194.9s] you read his word. So Lily said, "From
[198.9s] now hence forth, I'll be reading God's
[201.3s] word." Then grandma told her to read the
[204.3s] book of John 15:es
[206.8s] 5. And the book says, "I am the vine,
[211.3s] you are the branches. If you remain in
[214.2s] me and I in you, you will bear much
[217.6s] fruit." So Lily said, "Yes, if God is
[220.8s] the vine, I am just a branch. I will
[223.6s] continue remaining in God so that I can
[226.3s] know more about him.
[228.9s] Lily thought for a wide and then decided
[231.9s] every morning I'll be reading a Bible
[234.3s] story. The days went by and Lily noticed
[238.4s] something amazing. The emptiness and the
[241.2s] sadness she had in her heart just
[243.8s] decided to disappear. Then one day, Lily
[247.5s] ran to her grandma and said, "Grandma
[250.4s] Grace, I think I understand now. The
[254.5s] emptiness I had in my heart has started
[257.5s] to disappear. I feel much happy. I feel
[261.4s] more peaceful and full of joy."
[265.5s] She also decided that she'll be loving
[269.1s] people more.
[271.2s] Then Grandma Lily hugged Lily and said,
[274.8s] "That is right, my dear. When we know
[277.6s] who we are in Christ and spend time with
[280.7s] him and live to follow him, our hearts
[283.8s] will be full and happy. Remember, you
[286.6s] are God's creation and he loves you very
[289.5s] much." And from that day on, Lily
[292.7s] continued to grow her relationship with
[294.8s] God. She always remembers that she was
[298.5s] his special creation with a wonderful
[301.4s] purpose. Children, today I just want to
[304.4s] encourage you plus parents that we
[306.8s] should always remember that we are God's
[309.7s] special creation with a wonderful
[312.3s] purpose. May God bless us all.
[320.1s] Let's shine for teacher. Shine, shine,
[323.8s] shine.
