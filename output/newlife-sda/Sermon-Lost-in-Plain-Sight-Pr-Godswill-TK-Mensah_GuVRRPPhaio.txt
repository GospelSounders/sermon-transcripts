FULL TRANSCRIPT:
[Music] It's a privilege to have you join us for day number three for our week-long project with title called. And we say you are not just called aside an individual being called. We are called and we are charged and we are commissioned. And it is on this basis we are here for this week-long public campus ministries week as I always do. It was Jesus himself who said if you continue in my words then you are my disciples indeed and you shall know the truth and the truth shall set you free. If the son set you free you will be free indeed. Can someone say an amen out there? I make to you four promises. Promise number one is the Bible is going to be the bedrock of our study. And the reason is the Bible means what it says and says just what it means. Promise number two is you are going to be enlightened irrespective of who you are. Promise number three, you are going to be challenged to make the most important decision of your life. And promise number four, our lives, your life and mine will never be the same. Our subject for this evening, lost in plain sight. Lost in plain sight. The subheading is why disciplehip is the only defense. Why disciplehip is the only defense. The way you are seated, um, I need to speak to you through here. um it's not excellent enough. So can I please ask the audience to be seated in a balanced way so that I don't need to focus here for the rest of the session. That's a commercial break. That's just a little commercial break um for the sake of the production so that we have people distributed evenly so that we will not uh focus on only one part of the entire auditorium. The time is 6:15 here. So I'm going to move with the speed of light. Our theme generally is called, charged and commissioned. And we explained that yesterday that when we say you are called, the Bible says you shall be witnesses to me. Every one of us is called. Then we talk about not just called, we said people are charged. We've been charged. You shall receive power. And then the third component of our theme is commissioned to the very ends of the earth. We have been discharged to do some work of soul winning. So day number one we looked at the forgotten battlefield. Why campus ministries hold the future of the church. Day number two we dealt with blueprints for a movement. Heaven's vision for campus min or missions. And today lost in plain sight. Why disciplehip is our only defense. I have two basic objectives for this evening. Objective number one is to expose the crisis of undiscipled Christianity on campus. That's the goal is to expose the crisis of undiscipled Christianity that is on campus. The second objective is to ignite a generational disciplehip movement rooted in multiplication. Ignite a generational disciplehip movement rooted in multiplication. I want to begin by saying there is a crisis we have talked about since we started this entire session. In fact, from 1965 to 2022, our church has baptized 43 million 652,857. technically almost 43.6 million church members from 1965 to 2022. Interestingly, the numbers remaining currently on the books after the audit is 25 million. The members who have left the church 18 million. Let me put it in context. We are saying are we willfully ignoring the alarming membership trends which reveals that 43 million people were baptized. Out of the 43 from 1965 till date 42% left 18.5 individuals have left the church. a staggering 42.5%. Somebody may say this is an outlier. In 2023 alone, we baptized 1.8 million church members globally. Nearly 1.3 million left. 1.8 8 million were baptized 2023 alone and the same year 1.8 million baptized 1.3 million left. Is this trend a new trend? No. It's an ancient SDA problem. And you see, I don't want to be the bearer of bad news, but how can a church exist without knowing the deficiency that is crippling her? It's not just only on the campus. Even in the local churches, every 100 baptism in 120 days almost 60 left. They leave, they check out. So what is the problem? And I am saying the difficulty is we have neglected disciplehip be it in the local churches be it on campus or be it in the city or the village churches. I will present some fact to put it in perspective. Fact number one I'm quoting from the general conference document 2014. The SCH has a global retention rate of around 50 to 60%. Meaning that for every 10 people who join the church, four to five eventually they leave. This is from the general conference. Fact number two, 50 to 70% of postsecary high school students in the global north disengage from the church after leaving Adventist schools. So it's not just a PCM thing. Even in Adventist schools like Beraton University, Bapok University in Nigeria, Valley University in Ghana or the one in Zambia. I forgotten the name. Come again. Lusaku. Yes. And the one in Zimbabwe the same. Fact number three. Nearly 50% of people baptized into the SDA church worldwide live within the first year of their baptism. 50%. This is from the general conference what we call retention and loss study. The church spent money to to to to ask that a research be done. And the conclusion is nearly 50% of people baptized into the SDA church worldwide, they live within the first one year of their baptism. Chances are that when we did hope for Africa and all the crusades we have done including this year all the members we baptize in the first 300 days 50% of them they will check out and the question is we keep doing more of the same why fact number four from even 1965 to 2015. Are you aware that we baptized 37 million and 15 million checked out? I gave you from 1965 to 2022. Even from 65 to 2015, we've lost 15 million church members. It's a fact. This is from the Office of the Archives and Statistics and Research of the World Church. Fact number five. Inactive membership across divisions. This is a 2022 data. Across multiple divisions, inactive membership rate reach up to 40%. In other words, half of all baptized members are not regularly involved in church activities worldwide. 40% of our church members, they are just what I call spectators. They are not active members. Fact number six, non-attendants in North America. In North America, we are told 60% of members do not attend church on weekly basis. And somebody will say it doesn't apply to us in West Africa or in East Africa or in Southern Africa. I have bad news for you. In 2023, out of the 22 million church members reported, only 9 million went to church on Sabbath. Of the 22.7 million membership in 2023, reported attendance at Sabbath service was 9 million 15845 less than less than 9.1 million. In other words, it means that only 40% of official members actively attended church in 2023. In excent according to the archives and statistics of the GC a staggering I'm quoting directly a staggering 60% of members did not attend church on Sabbath throughout this was reported in 2024 so throughout last year they are talking about 2023 an alarming trend indicating a crisis in commitment spiritual engagement ment within our church community. It is in this light. Look, I can go on. In 2019, we had baptism of about 1.3 million. The numbers that left 1.1 million 2019 alone. We baptized 1.3 million globally. And you know majority of the baptism they come from Africa and north southern Africa. Technically your division and SID are responsible for the largest baptism in the Africa bell. My division we are not yet there. And the data says out of those baptized in 2019 1.3 million 1.1 left the church. All those left were only 213,533 throughout the world. If the division here in East Africa baptizes majority of the members, chances are that those who left two, majority are from where? This division. Do you understand the the analysis? You see when we are dealing with university student one thing we need to do as a church and as a people is we must be honest with the data we keep doing more of the same it will interest you know in 2023 I just gave you the data 1 4 million people got baptized per the data 836,95 left only 628,000 stayed in the I can go on in 20 20 2019 and 2023. So if you check the percentage of those we baptize if we baptize about 83% of those baptized uh those who were baptized 83% left. Those who stayed only 16%. So we baptized 100 people. Eight eight of those people left. They checked out 8.3 or 83 of them left. Only 16 people remain. In 2023, we baptized 100 people. Every 100 people we baptized, 57.13% of them, they checked out. Only 42% left. In the same year, so think 10 years down the line. Look, I can go on. In 2022 and 2023, as you can see on your screen, if you check the data, you will notice there is a very insignificant growth margin in our church in terms of true numbers. If you do the analysis, those who left, those who stayed, ladies and gentlemen, you will get a heart attack. And the question you ask is must we be spending resources this way in case my data is right I'm told west my division wad we have about just barely 1 million church membership in SID barely 4 million church membership in ECD about 6 million church membership the question is how many of them are really attending church and are active Church members, we need to ask a question. And because it is the public campus ministries week, university student, you don't just pick things hook, link, and center. No, you analyze the data. Are we making progress? In case you do not know, after COVID 19 pandemic, 42% of adults age 18 to 29, they have changed their church attendance. In fact, 30% says they don't go to church very frequently. The numbers who used to go to church and those who don't go to church now in 2011 about 59% say we are not so active in church. In 2019 is it shot to 64%. We have a crisis. Look sometimes I want to get a heart attack. The question is so what do we do? This is the reason why in this evening's presentation I make the case because majority of you said you were not here when we started. I titled it lost in plain sight. Members are getting lost just in plain sight. And I subheading it why discipleship is the only defense. The solution is disciplehip. I wish I could have time to share with you further data. I don't have time on my hand. So, I'm going to zoom in. I I can present it for a local church, for a village church, for a city church, for a post-modern cosmopolitan city church, and also for campus. But for the sake of this evening, I will focus on just the campus. How can we do it on the campus? Ellen White has written extensively on how this can be done. In case I'm not able to finish, I may do the part two of this tomorrow. Let me say it for the campuses, the parent listening, the lecturers, the directors, the pastors listening. Please, I'm not a bearer of bad news, but somebody need to say it as it is. The beginning of how we lose students. The data says that out of every 10 SD who goes to school, university, public campus in four years circle, we lose about 50% to 60% of them. It's it's a statement of fact. How do we keep losing them? Why do we keep losing them? That's what we want to trace this evening. It's not more like a sermon. It's like a seminar. I'm quoting from selected messages book three, page 233 to page 234. Ellen White says and I quote, "Please pay attention. Out of the quote, we will glean the principles. There are those who after becoming established, rooted and grounded in the truth should enter this institutions of learning as student." Ellen White says not everybody must go to the public schools. However, those who must go, they are those who after becoming established, rooted and grounded in the truth should enter this institutions of learning as students. I want to begin by saying many parents don't care if their children are lost eternally. As far as they are architects, they are civil engineers, they they they go to school, they get a job, the parents are okay. If they go to hell, many Adventist parents don't care. What we care about is the status symbol of our children. He is going to MIT school, a top class school, reading a top class program. We don't care what the spirit of prophecy says concerning the salvation of our own children. Some of you are here, you are student. Hear me loud. Hear me clear. So what is the prerequisite for public campus members for someone to move from secondary school to go to university? What did the inspire writing say? We need to do as a condition precedent before they go. Condition number one, they must be established. Condition number two, they must be rooted. Condition number three, they must be grounded in the truth. Why is the GC saying 50% of students after four years they leave the church before they enter the university they were not established before they entered the universities they were not rooted before they entered the universities they were not grounded in the truth let me read it one more time selected messages book three page 233 to 234 there are Those who after becoming established rooted and grounded in the truth should enter this institutions of learning as student let me say it one more time hear me this the situation will get worse we will move from 50% of our own children who go to the University of Kata University of Nairobi University of Johannesburg University of Ghana University of Lagos, University of Cal Calaba, University of Casablanca, whichever it is, they will keep leaving the church. Why? When they are in the senior high school, when they are in the junior high school, they are not established, they are not rooted, they are not grounded in the truth. All we are interested in is they are mathematics, they are science, they are English, they are eternal issues are not our concern. So we will keep losing the children and one word to represent that is we don't disciple the students. Is there a need for them to even go to the schools? Why not in the book letters 26 Ellen White wrote this in 1891. She says, and I quote, "It will be perfectly safe for our youth to enter the colleges of our land if they were converted every day. But if they feel at liberty to be off guard one day, that very day, Satan is ready with his sners and they are overcome and led to walk in false path." And she says, "Forbidden path, paths that the Lord has not cast up." So what must qualify our daughters, our sons to go to the public schools or the public universities? Ellen White says they must be converted. The first three points we said was what will qualify them to go. They must be established. They must be rooted. They must be grounded in the truth. She added another dimension. They must be converted. It's not enough to be established. It's not enough to be rooted in the truth. It's not enough to be grounded in the truth. They must also become converted. In other words, when a child when a youth from New Life SDA is not yet converted and he or she is going to the university, chances are that they will not return. And hear me, if they don't return and they begin to doubt the truth, their salvation is at stake. They will be lost for all eternity. This is the reason why before they go to the university we can't be doing the usual father Abraham in the we can't be doing that what are the KPIs in the local churches to see where our children are what are the KPIs the key performance indicators that is given to the Sabbath school teachers that is given to the special class teachers Listen, what we experiencing today, the young people are no more interested in church. They are just leaving the church. It's not a one day or a 9-day wonder. It's been a process, a process of carelessness, a process of recklessness, a process of irresponsibility on the path of parents, pastors, elders, the church community, and the young people themselves. Why must we have our members at the public campus? Please don't get me wrong. I am not here saying send the children only to Baratin or or AUA. No, that is not it. Ellen White has written extensively because we certainly need to have them even if not because aside their spirituality because of our evangelistic ethos and outlook relevance and excellence they need to be on the public campus. What is my basis for this? I'm I'm quoting from inspired writing selected messages book three page 234. Why must they go? They can keep the living principles of the truth and observe the Sabbath and yet they will have opportunity to work for the master by dropping seeds of truth in minds and heart. This work must be done and it will be done by those who are led and thought of God. In this is another principle. Why must our student though there is a danger in the university, why must they go to the universities, the public campuses like your your how do you call it your your university of is it the media one how do you call it multimedia university or whichever university number one Ellen White says is an opportunity for our children our young people our youth to live the gospel Somebody should say an amen to that one. So if you can then they must not go. It's so dangerous. No, she says that is an avenue for them to leave the gospel. Point number two, why must our young people go to the centers of learning of the world? It's an occasion for them to observe the Sabbath. Are you aware majority of our student write Sabbath exam and sometime pastors, administrators, elders are not bold to tell the people it is breaking the fourth commandment to write an exam on the Sabbath. And then they keep writing exams on Sabbath for a long time. Then they become professionals. They start working on the Sabbath. And guess what? They have no regard for the Sabbath. One of the reason they need to go to the public campuses is an opportunity to live the gospel. Number two, it's an opportunity or an occasion for them to observe the Sabbath. And that leads me to point number three for the sake of time. It's a privilege to work with God on those campuses. They can keep the living principles of the truth, she says, and observe the Sabbath, yet they will have an opportunity to work for the master by dropping seats or dropping seats of truth in mind and in heart. Why must they go to this campuses? I like this one. Aside an opportunity to work for God is an occasion to influence minds and hearts. So this is a basis we started there is a crisis the source of the crisis is we've stopped discipling then I'm zooming in I'm not talking about local churches I'm talking about campus because this week is for public campus this is what Ellen wise is then the question is which personality so number one which the children go to or the young people go to the universities without being prepared number two they don't know why they are there. They are not aware. They need to be there to live the gospel. They need to be there to observe the Sabbath. They need to be there to be privileged to work with God. They be there so that they will influence minds and hearts. The question now is which personalities must execute the campus ministries mandate. Everybody cannot do campus ministries. Every pastor, every leader cannot do campus me with personalities. You see the difficulty is that we are lazy. We can't even take time to read the spirit of prophecy and glean principles that must guide what we do. Ellen White says and I quote, she says this work campus ministries must be done and it will be done by those who are one led and taught of God. So which characteristics? So for example in the fellowship when you want to select the president of the fellowship of those campus churches which students must be there which pastors must lead which aluminites must be part of it. Number one, people who are le and people who are taught of God. This is a key foundation. Aside knowing the Bible, aside being eloquent, aside being dressing to meet the trend and the time, you must be led by God and you must be taught by God. It goes for a moment, Holy Spirit, teach me, show me what must be done. We have a lot of people who are leading out on the campuses. Quite frankly, they are ignorant. What does it mean to be led and to be taught of God? Somewhere else, Ellen White says selected messages book two page 233 to 235. Those who have the spirit of God and have the truth route in their very being should be encouraged to enter colleges and live the truth as Daniel and Paul did. Take note. So which characteristics of people? those who have the spirit of God, who have the truth route. So you must have the Holy Spirit to be led by the Holy Spirit. You must have the truth route in you to be taught by God. So in ence, the personalities God can use for campus ministries, those who have the Holy Spirit. Number two, just not those who have the Holy Spirit, those who are consumed by the truth. So one is why are people leaving the church the young people why is they living in droves why our disciplehip is faulty why is it faulty before they go to school they are not grounded they are not established and the rest of it number two they don't know even why they are going number three the people we deploy to lead out in campus ministries they are not led by God they are not taught by God number two they have not the spirit of God. And number three, they are not consumed by the truth. And if you care to know, number four, they must be those who live the truth. Simple. Our church is in crisis. I repeat again, we don't just need a campus that holds programs. We must start movements. Don't just grow fellowships, plant fire. Don't just survive campus, transform the campus. Why are this university students those of you who are here you are so critical for God's work in the last days? Do you know why Ellen White made a statement your inability to be grounded in the church in the truth? Listen, Ellen White says, "Preachers, I'm quoting from the book testimonies for the church volume 5 page and page 136. In fact, it's repeated in the book life sketches of Ellen White. He said preachers or lay men advance in years cannot have one half the influence upon the young that the youth devoted to God can have upon their associate. You can do a work that those who minister in word and doctrine cannot do. You can reach a class whom the minister cannot affect or effect. And then why says the work the students can do on campus preachers cannot do it. Lay men with experience they can't do it. Why? He says even one half we cannot even do one of a half even 20% of what you can do as student on the campus pastors cannot do it elders cannot do it church leaders cannot do it administrators cannot do it and then why says speaking to students he says you can do a work that those who minister in word and doctrine cannot do you can reach a class whom the minister cannot affect. So tell me between a gifted preacher and a converted young person in University of Kenyata who can influence the campus much more. Tell me the pastor or the student? The students question. Let me say it one more time. It is misplaced priority for new life, Nairobi central, a lavendon and all the churches within the city of Nairobi to be so obsessed about community campaigns and evangelism without investing on campus. Let me quite quite bluntly is a misplaced priority. Another way to say it is that it's unseriousness. The next generation of presidents of Kenya, they in the university. The next engineers, top class private sector leaders, captains of industry, they are there. The next generation of financial mogul, people with a deep pocket, they are there. The next generation of brilliant mind who can defend the truth, they are there. And guess what? We are still doing this kind of local church business. Father Abraham have been are we? Yo, are we serious? Turn to somebody and tell the person we are sick. Why are you looking at me like that? Say it one more time. Say we are sick. It's not just in Kenya. Ghana is worse. Nigeria is worse worse worst. West Africa is worse. Promax manuscript 62 1903 Ellen White Right. A great work is to be done. I am moved by the spirit of God to say to those engaged in the Lord's work that the favorable time for our message to be carried to the cities has been passed by. Cities are where you have the universities and this work has not been done. I feel a heavy burden that we should now redeem the time. This why I title it lost in plain sight. just before us. Our children are going to hell. Young people are dying forever. And guess what? We are comfortable and nobody cares. Why? Disciplehip is the only defense. When I was the campus ministries director of my union, with the help of the campus ministries committee and some brilliant professionals, we carved a vision. Let me share with you which is a disciplehip module. You may want to give it a thought on Friday or Sabbath. I will give you a mission report of what some of your friends in various part of the world are doing. I wrote the vision for the campus. Yesterday we said it's not a ministry. It must be what? A movement. It says it's a Bible centered movement of student where all uphold live and share the gospel. Pause. This is the vision. It is not a place where clowns come in on the campus. One thing will keep the student. It must be Bible based. It must listen if if you say something you can't quoted from the Bible. Students should be able to say shut up. If you speak it contradicts the Bible, our young people should stand up and say in light of what the Bible says like the Berians, you are wrong elder, you are wrong. Respectfully, pastor, what you are saying contradicts the belief of the Bible. It must be a Bible centered movement. Everybody in the fellowship must swell. Bible students. Number two, they must uphold and live and share the gospel. So they believe the Bible, a movement of Bible believers. Number two, people who don't just believe the Bible, they they they they trust the Bible. And then number three, they leave the Bible. And number four, they share the gospel. That is the vision for campus. If you do this, they will not leave the church. There is too much music in the church in the campuses because we have not presented the Bible. Our children can't even tell. Are you aware that 60% of professionals do not know what Adventism is about? The cardinal beliefs of the remnant of Bible prophecy. Hear me, there is no other remnant. Check the book of Revelation chapter 3. After the Laudian church, a w a lukewarm church after that there was no other church. This is the church. So on the campus to keep the student, we must give them a vision. Why are they interested in Tik Tok and all this stupidity? We have not given them a vision. Why we claim there is a vision is a lukewarm vision, a tin vision. No, every student in Kenya, in Africa, on the university campus, nothing but the Bible and the Bible alone. and then they leave the Bible and then they share the Bible. Our mission was to prepare campuses for eternity. Period. We are not there to do entertainment. Campus ministries is not entertainment. It is a spiritual warfare. The student needs to know the destiny of their lecturers. The psychology lecturer, the economics lecturer, the whichever lecturer professor you are, the student understand whether you are agnostic, whether you are a Muslim, whether you are an a religious, you will go to hell except you submit to the leadership of Christ. So we are on campus not just to get a degree but to prepare them for the soon return of Jesus. Somebody say an amen to that one. Amen. The goal must be simple. Three dimensions. Number one, revive the students on campus. So those who are on fire yet they get to campus and the fire is dying. A disciplehip model must be how do we revive them? So the programs are targeted to stir the heart of students because I'll be showing you tomorrow and the days to come. Revival has always been a powerful force on campus. So revive, redeem and reclaim. When we say redeem is those who are lost, those who don't believe the everlasting gospel. Our goal is not just to revive our own members. We are also to redeem those who are no more interested or they don't believe the everlasting gospel and then reclaim. You are 7day Adventist. You're on campus and then you have a boyfriend and you are sleeping around. No, you are not a 7-day Adventist. You are you are lost. You have apostasized. You are a 7th day Adventist and you are writing exam on Saturday. No, you are not a 7-day Adventist. You're a 7th day Adventist and you eat pork. You are not a 7-day Adventist. They are leaving the church gradually. So, we must reclaim them. Three dimension. You revive, you redeem and you reclaim. How can the students leave if such a vision is been executed? What must be the philosophy? When I was campus ministry director, our philosophy was spiritual excellence that impact academic excellence and beyond. You can tell the stock I come from. Spiritual excellence and academic excellence. Two dimensions. You are sea. You must be godly. Number two, you must be brilliant. You can't be getting C's C's and the rest. What kind of foolishness is? Go and study. Stop the foolishness and go and study. You are SCA. do their writing exam then you are copying you are copying I was in one school I saw a beautiful lady well shaped nice girl exam time she pulled her ski and she started copying I raise my hand I said look at that foolish girl they should suck her from the exam hall what kind of nonsense is that which kind of Christian is it you are a Christian and you are caught in no if you are spiritual and you are not academically excellent you undermine the gospel are you getting the point those of you here do you understand what I'm You can't be as we keep the Sabbath asuroras and then you keep chemistry result. Are you mad? Who follow this god? The god of CNDs and the rest of it always always interested in in in in conference spirituality. We are in the spirit. We are the Daniel's man. And when the reason you are in school now has come, then you are flocking your causes. You are lazy. Your grace are so bad. And then you are justifying it. We are going to heaven. Shut up. Go and steady. Go and steady. So it must be spiritual excellence that impact. So if you are spiritual, the Bible says whatever your hand finds to do, do it with all your might. The Bible says there is a season for everything. A time to do. Listen, there must be a time to study. There must be a time. Listen, this is classy in our methodology. is simple. We educate minds. We equip hearts. We empower lives through radical, ruthless, relentless biblical commitment. We educate minds. We equip the heart. We empower lives through radical, ruthless, relentless biblical commitment. So if you are on campus, your mind must be sharp. Your heart must be clean. Your life must speak volumes. And the basis of all you do is not based on Hollywood, Nollywood, Kylewood, Zillawood, whatever wood. It must be based on the Bible. Two foundational philosophical underpinnings. The Bible and the spirit of prophecy. And the motto was and ought to be prepared and challenged to change the world. The students must see themselves by the time they graduate from school. They enter into the work market to be agents of change. And our tagline we borrow the Dr. P Dr. people influence this for us a lot is from a ministry to students to a movement of students. Why are young people leaving? They are leaving the church. I call it they are lost in plain sight. Our only defense is disciplehip. Look, they need to move from being attendees to apostles. And how can they do that? The classroom is not a detour. It's a designated field. The student must come to understand I am in class tomorrow. I'm going to share about the wild denses. The method they use, how you can take over the universities in Kenya and convert it into an evangelistic path, a spirit of prophecy and a biblical perspective. Students will be on fire and guess what? The young men will be godly. The young women will be godly. That is the future for the church. They are engaged in evangelism and they are not interested in pelvic activity. These days when it is raining our young girls and young boys if it is raining then they say the weather has brought itself. The weather has brought and some young people in elsewhere they are thinking of innovation. SDA young boys and girls they are thinking of how to use their pelvic exercise their pelvic indiscriminate sex on campus. Do you know the reason why there is no disciplehip? I wish I had time. Look, we are not just called to be present on campus. Oh, we were sent to transform it. And if we do not do it, these five enemies will kill the campus. Quite frankly, do you know my main content for today? I've not touched it yet. Enemies of campus movement. I'll just mention the number one is comfort. Write it down. C's I'm doing five C's. Comfort. The idol of balance over burden. Because there is no disciplehip. So everybody's comfortable. Sinners are comfortable. Wicked people are comfortable on campus. Everybody is comfortable. No. The idol of balance over burden. When ease replaces urgency, the altar grows cold and the result the young people begin to check out. The second enemy when disciplehip is not happening or the reason why it's not happening aside comfort. Everyone is too comfortable on campus. There is no fire, no burden, all of that. I dealt with a couple of them yesterday. There is compromise copying others instead of carrying our unique mandate. So you begin to see Adventist young people want to just be like all other denominations. We are a remnant of Bible prophecy. Our children don't even believe it. They don't understand Adventism is not one of the churches in the world. It is God's end time remnant to fulfill a unique agenda. When you hear the song, lift up the trumpet and loud let it ring. Jesus is coming again. Cher pilgrims be joyful and say hear me. The world is coming to an end. We have been given a mandate. We have been given a message. When there is compromise, we start to copy what others are doing blindly. So it's not just comfort, it's compromise. It's not just compromise. Then comparison begin to set in. Comparison deals with just quickly swallowing what others are doing. And then the compromise is we mingle Babylon with the sanctuary. Then canality will go when numbers matter more than transformation. So everybody is doing campus work with the merely only the optics. The transformation of the heart. The students are not broken. Lecturers are not be warned. You see our evangelistic report is just about our own children getting recycled and rebaptized and rebaptized and we are deceiving ourselves thinking something has been done. Look, it's activity. More of the same. One person who baptized four times, three times and we add it as if there is growth. There is no qualitative growth. This one is a scam. And then there is coward eyes fearing administration more than God. When there is no disciplehip, our sons and daughters will not stand like Daniel on campus. And why can't they stand there is coward eyes? Because before they even enter the school, they were not grounded. They were not established. And they were not rooted in the truth. Fearing administration more than God. I did a certain program recently three years ago. I took another M's program in a certain school. I won't mention the name. I deliberately chose to do the program daytime. When my admission came, they said I was admitted to do a day program. School started. They said it must be evening program. Monday to Friday. I said I can come to school from Monday to Friday to Thursday. Friday night I cannot. I am a seventh day Adventist. I keep the Sabbath. They said be there if you want a great you. I did not go. Exam time came. They said it will be on Friday. You will not ride. I wrote to the council of the school after seeking advice. A long matter short. When I met the leadership of the school, I said I'm a 7th day Adventist pastor. More so I'm a Christian. More so I'm a 7th day Adventist church member. I can't write exams on Saturday. They said no but this pastor wrote this your member wrote this person did this. I said that is them based on my belief respectfully. I cannot can I be given an exemption like they do for the Jews. Long matter shift. I did not write exams. When I was graduating, my thesis to the glory of God was the best the graduate school has ever seen. Ladies and gentlemen, why the cowardice? Why can't our children stand and say, "I can't eat pork. Why? It's not good for my health, too. I'm a Christian. More so, a 7-day Adventist. The Bible says I can't I should not defile the body." Why don't you take alcohol? I am a Christian. I can't defile the body. Why can't you have sex before marriage? No, I am. Ladies and gentlemen, there is cowardice. And do you know the reason our young people have not been discipled? I've not even touched on the disciplehip. You cannot conquer the campus if you will not confront these enemies. Hear me guys. Every generation must choose between being liked by men or being used by God. Every generation must choose it. I'll do the part tomorrow and I will show the difference between a Christian, a believer and a disciple. Let me wet your appetite and then we pray. Are you aware that throughout the Bible in the New Testament they use the word Christians only three times in the New Testament. Acts 11:26 Act 26:28 1 Peter 4:16 the disciples were first called Christian in Antioch. Acts 26:28 agria said almost thou persuaded me to be a Christian. 1 Peter 4:16, if anyone suffers as a Christian, let him not be ashamed. Only three times Christian is used in the Bible. Now, do you know that the word disciple mates meaning a learner, a follower, it appears almost 261 times in the New Testament alone. Are you also aware that the word believer or believers appears about two to 10 times depending on the translation you are using? My case is this we have too many Christians in quotes not disciples too many churchgoers. This is the reason why with our numbers in Kenya in Africa we are going to the GC again and the news will be the church is growing in Africa. True. What is it qualitative impact? 11 people shook the world and turned the world upside down and we are 6 million 4 million in just a geographical area. Africa alone almost 10 million almost 46% of the membership of the church. Nothing can be done. We are not shaking the world. Nobody is afraid of us. Do you know the underlining factor? We don't have disciples. We don't know how to disciple people. And the net effect, people are living in droves. Perhaps tomorrow I will situate it. Well, this is what I want us to do. Come tomorrow. Come with a friend. We are in crisis. God is looking for people he can depend on and dispatch them to hold the ro. The reason Jesus came to die is to save the lost. People come that they want to be saved and before our own eyes they are getting lost day by day. How do we solve it? Tomorrow I will go into the part two of this. But this evening I want us to sing two songs and then we pray a very critical prayer. I want us to sing the organist. You are going to help us with this songs and I want you to sing it like your life depends upon it. I wanted to sing the first song redeem. How I love to proclaim it. Redeem by the blood. When our students are singing this song, they should sing it with a meaning. It's not just from SDA, they should sing it with a personal connection with Jesus. They need to know what it is to be saved by God, redeemed from sin, save from the penalties of evil. They need to know. We will sing this song. And when we are done, we will also sing. [Music] It is almost time for the Lord to come. I want everybody in the auditorium and those of you joining online, I want you to sing it like your life depends upon it. Redeem and the musicians, I hope you're going to sing well. You must sing excellently. [Music] 337. Let's stand there. Let's sing. Redeemed, how I love to proclaim it. Redeemed, redeemed by the blood of the Lord. Redeemed through his infinite mercy. His child and forever. child and forever I am. Come on. Redeemed. Redeemed. Redeemed. Redeemed by the blood of the lamb. Redeemed [Applause] redeemed [Music] his child forever. I think of my blessed redeemer. redeemed and so happy in Jesus. All of which can tell. I know that the light of his presence with me of contin theory. I am redeemed. Every compass of the lamb redeemed redeemed. [Applause] redee [Music] his children forever. I am. I know there's a crown that is waiting in your bright manure for me. And soon be with the seeds be perfect at home with the Lord. I shall be redeemed. Redeemed. Redeemed. [Applause] Redeemer the blood of the lamb. Redeemed redeemed [Applause] redee [Music] forever. I am. We're going to sing him 212 212. It is almost time for the Lord to come. We are going to sing it as our closing hymn and as we sing it especially the young people the student Jesus is coming again. You are not just in school [Music] for the Lord to come. I hear the people see the stars of heaven. The stars are growing deep. It must be. It must be the breaking of the Come on, lift up your voice. Oh, it must be the breaking of the This is why we must disciple. This is why we must invest on the campus. The night is almost gone. The day is coming on. Oh, it must be Oh, it must be the breaking of the in the sun. In the sun, in the sun, in the moon, in earth, the sea and sky aloud proclaim proclaim to all the coming of the must. of the master. Come on. Oh, it must be Oh, it must be the breaking of the day. Oh, it must be the breaking of the day. It must be the breaking of the day. The night is almost gone. The night is almost. The day is coming on. It must be Oh, it must be the breaking. It must be church for new life church. [Applause] [Music] Lest the church cast away her pride with guarded loins and burning lamps to look for the breaking of the day to look for the Come on, lift up your voice. Say, "It must be." Oh, it must be the breaking of the day. Oh, it must be a breaking of the day. The night is almost gone. The night is almost gone. The day is coming on. We're singing the last stanza. The breaking of the go. Go to the streets. And in the broad highway, the broad highway. Let's call the main call. Let's call the halt and the blind to be ready to be ready for the breaking of the day. Just hold some one time. Oh, it must be the breaking of the It must be Oh, it must be the breaking of the day. The night is almost gone. The night is almost gone. The day is coming. Oh, it must be the breaking of the day. Father in heaven, we are just at the precipe of eternity. But right before our eyes, our young people are getting lost in millions, in thousands, and in hundreds. We don't care. We describe it. They've stopped church, but they are being lost. We pray today beginning with the students who are here, those watching online, church leaders, pastors, church elders, church board members. May we understand the unique place of this student in finishing God's work. With such an army of youth we are told rightly trained. How soon Lord we pray give a revived heart to the leadership of the church at new life. Bless the campus leaders. Bless the student present. May we begin to think the long term before they get to university, in their JHS, in their secondary schools. May we begin to make them firm, established, rooted in the word. May we make not just church members, may our children, our young people, may they become disciples. Bless those who have joined us from different countries across the globe. Bless those who are here. And tomorrow as we move to the fourth day, let there be a new revelation. Lord, until then, make us restless. Make us restless. Make us feel guilty for the thousands, the hundreds, the millions, yay, that are dying in multitudes. May God bless you. May God revive you. May God lay a burden on your heart. And out of this church, let there be a new mission field, the campus that will be exploited, deployed, and leverage to God's glory. May the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ and the love of God and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit abide with us now and forever more. Amen. God bless you. [Music] 

==================================================

TIMESTAMPED TRANSCRIPT:
[4.3s] [Music]
[6.7s] It's a privilege to have you join us for
[9.8s] day number three for our week-long
[13.9s] project with title called. And we say
[17.8s] you are not just called aside an
[20.6s] individual being called. We are called
[24.1s] and we are charged and we are
[26.6s] commissioned. And it is on this basis we
[30.6s] are here for this week-long public
[33.7s] campus ministries week as I always do.
[38.1s] It was Jesus himself who said if you
[41.8s] continue in my words then you are my
[45.2s] disciples indeed and you shall know the
[48.2s] truth and the truth shall set you free.
[52.0s] If the son set you free you will be free
[56.3s] indeed. Can someone say an amen out
[58.8s] there?
[60.6s] I make to you four promises. Promise
[63.1s] number one is the Bible is going to be
[64.5s] the bedrock of our study. And the reason
[67.0s] is the Bible means what it says and says
[71.5s] just what it means. Promise number two
[73.8s] is you are going to be enlightened
[75.5s] irrespective of who you are. Promise
[77.8s] number three, you are going to be
[78.9s] challenged to make the most important
[81.0s] decision of your life. And promise
[83.3s] number four, our lives, your life and
[86.3s] mine will never be the same. Our subject
[89.8s] for this evening, lost in plain sight.
[93.8s] Lost in plain sight. The subheading is
[97.8s] why disciplehip
[99.7s] is the only defense.
[102.5s] Why disciplehip is the only defense. The
[106.6s] way you are seated,
[108.6s] um, I need to speak to you through here.
[112.2s] um it's not excellent enough. So can I
[116.2s] please ask the audience to be seated in
[119.2s] a balanced way so that I don't need to
[121.7s] focus here for the rest of the session.
[124.3s] That's a commercial break.
[129.5s] That's just a little commercial break
[132.8s] um for the sake of the production
[136.1s] so that we have people distributed
[138.7s] evenly so that we will not uh focus on
[143.2s] only one part of the entire auditorium.
[151.6s] The time is 6:15 here. So I'm going to
[157.0s] move with the speed of light. Our theme
[160.0s] generally
[161.6s] is called, charged and commissioned. And
[166.8s] we explained that yesterday that when we
[170.2s] say you are called, the Bible says you
[172.7s] shall be witnesses to me. Every one of
[176.2s] us is called. Then we talk about not
[178.8s] just called, we said people are charged.
[182.3s] We've been charged. You shall receive
[185.2s] power. And then the third component of
[188.2s] our theme is commissioned to the very
[191.8s] ends of the earth. We have been
[193.7s] discharged to do some work of soul
[196.6s] winning. So day number one we looked at
[199.0s] the forgotten battlefield. Why campus
[202.2s] ministries hold the future of the
[205.0s] church. Day number two we dealt with
[207.5s] blueprints for a movement. Heaven's
[210.0s] vision for campus min or missions. And
[213.8s] today lost in plain sight. Why
[217.4s] disciplehip
[219.0s] is our only defense. I have two basic
[222.9s] objectives for this evening.
[225.9s] Objective number one is to expose the
[228.1s] crisis of undiscipled Christianity on
[232.0s] campus.
[234.5s] That's the goal is to expose
[238.7s] the crisis of undiscipled
[242.3s] Christianity that is on campus. The
[245.7s] second objective is to ignite a
[249.4s] generational disciplehip movement rooted
[253.0s] in multiplication.
[256.2s] Ignite a generational disciplehip
[259.1s] movement rooted in multiplication. I
[262.6s] want to begin by saying
[265.9s] there is a crisis we have talked about
[269.6s] since we started this entire session.
[274.1s] In fact, from 1965
[277.4s] to 2022,
[280.2s] our church has baptized 43 million
[285.6s] 652,857.
[290.2s] technically almost 43.6 million church
[294.8s] members from 1965
[298.5s] to 2022.
[301.9s] Interestingly,
[305.1s] the numbers remaining currently on the
[307.8s] books after the audit is 25 million.
[314.0s] The members who have left the church 18
[317.8s] million.
[319.5s] Let me put it in context.
[322.6s] We are saying are we willfully ignoring
[327.0s] the alarming membership trends which
[330.5s] reveals that 43 million people were
[333.4s] baptized. Out of the 43 from 1965 till
[338.4s] date 42%
[341.6s] left 18.5
[345.2s] individuals have left the church. a
[349.0s] staggering 42.5%.
[353.7s] Somebody may say this is an outlier.
[359.3s] In 2023
[361.8s] alone,
[363.5s] we baptized 1.8 million church members
[368.0s] globally.
[369.7s] Nearly 1.3 million left.
[377.2s] 1.8 8 million were baptized
[380.7s] 2023 alone and the same year 1.8 million
[387.0s] baptized 1.3 million left.
[392.6s] Is this trend a new trend? No. It's an
[396.9s] ancient SDA problem.
[400.7s] And you see, I don't want to be the
[404.0s] bearer of bad news, but how can a church
[407.7s] exist without knowing the deficiency
[411.9s] that is crippling her? It's not just
[415.4s] only on the campus. Even in the local
[418.6s] churches, every 100 baptism in 120 days
[423.5s] almost 60 left. They leave, they check
[427.0s] out.
[428.6s] So what is the problem? And I am saying
[431.8s] the difficulty is we have neglected
[434.9s] disciplehip
[436.6s] be it in the local churches be it on
[439.4s] campus or be it in the city or the
[442.0s] village churches. I will present some
[444.3s] fact to put it in perspective.
[447.5s] Fact number one I'm quoting from the
[450.1s] general conference document 2014. The
[453.2s] SCH has a global retention rate of
[456.2s] around 50 to 60%. Meaning that for every
[459.9s] 10 people who join the church, four to
[462.6s] five eventually they leave.
[465.6s] This is from the general conference.
[467.2s] Fact number two,
[470.0s] 50 to 70% of postsecary high school
[473.1s] students in the global north disengage
[476.0s] from the church after leaving Adventist
[478.4s] schools.
[481.6s] So it's not just a PCM thing. Even in
[485.2s] Adventist schools like Beraton
[488.1s] University, Bapok University in Nigeria,
[490.5s] Valley University in Ghana or the one in
[494.5s] Zambia. I forgotten the name. Come
[496.9s] again.
[498.5s] Lusaku.
[500.2s] Yes. And the one in Zimbabwe
[503.1s] the same.
[505.1s] Fact number three. Nearly 50% of people
[509.5s] baptized into the SDA church worldwide
[512.7s] live within the first year of their
[515.1s] baptism.
[516.7s] 50%.
[518.9s] This is from the general conference what
[521.2s] we call retention and loss study. The
[524.2s] church spent money to to to to ask that
[528.6s] a research be done. And the conclusion
[531.4s] is nearly 50%
[534.4s] of people baptized into the SDA church
[537.9s] worldwide, they live within the first
[540.5s] one year of their baptism. Chances are
[544.0s] that when we did hope for Africa and all
[547.2s] the crusades we have done including this
[549.2s] year all the members we baptize in the
[553.3s] first 300 days 50% of them they will
[557.5s] check out and the question is we keep
[560.0s] doing more of the same why
[565.4s] fact number four
[569.3s] from even 1965 to 2015. Are you aware
[575.8s] that we baptized 37 million and 15
[579.3s] million checked out? I gave you from
[581.5s] 1965 to 2022. Even from 65 to 2015,
[588.7s] we've lost 15 million church members.
[592.0s] It's a fact.
[594.1s] This is from the Office of the Archives
[596.2s] and Statistics and Research of the World
[598.7s] Church. Fact number five.
[602.9s] Inactive membership across divisions.
[605.9s] This is a 2022 data. Across multiple
[609.7s] divisions, inactive membership rate
[613.0s] reach up to 40%.
[616.2s] In other words, half of all baptized
[619.4s] members are not regularly involved in
[623.4s] church activities worldwide.
[626.9s] 40% of our church members, they are just
[631.5s] what I call spectators.
[634.1s] They are not active members.
[638.2s] Fact number six,
[641.2s] non-attendants in North America. In
[644.0s] North America, we are told 60% of
[646.2s] members do not attend church on weekly
[648.6s] basis. And somebody will say it doesn't
[651.5s] apply to us in West Africa or in East
[655.0s] Africa or in Southern Africa. I have bad
[657.7s] news for you. In 2023,
[661.4s] out of the 22 million church members
[665.4s] reported, only 9 million went to church
[669.4s] on Sabbath. Of the 22.7 million
[673.4s] membership in 2023,
[676.2s] reported attendance at Sabbath service
[678.9s] was 9 million
[681.6s] 15845
[683.5s] less than less than 9.1 million. In
[687.7s] other words, it means that only 40% of
[692.2s] official members actively attended
[695.4s] church in 2023.
[698.8s] In excent
[701.7s] according to the archives and statistics
[703.2s] of the GC a staggering I'm quoting
[706.3s] directly a staggering 60% of members did
[711.4s] not attend church on Sabbath throughout
[715.0s] this was reported in 2024 so throughout
[717.8s] last year they are talking about 2023
[721.7s] an alarming trend indicating a crisis in
[726.0s] commitment spiritual engagement ment
[729.1s] within our church community.
[733.2s] It is in this light. Look, I can go on.
[737.0s] In 2019,
[739.0s] we had baptism of about 1.3 million. The
[745.3s] numbers that left 1.1 million 2019
[749.6s] alone. We baptized 1.3 million globally.
[753.7s] And you know majority of the baptism
[756.4s] they come from Africa and north southern
[759.5s] Africa. Technically your division and
[763.8s] SID are responsible for the largest
[767.3s] baptism in the Africa bell. My division
[771.3s] we are not yet there. And the data says
[774.6s] out of those baptized in 2019 1.3
[779.4s] million 1.1 left the church. All those
[783.4s] left were only 213,533
[788.5s] throughout the world. If
[792.6s] the division here in East Africa
[795.7s] baptizes majority of the members,
[798.9s] chances are that those who left two,
[802.5s] majority are from where? This division.
[807.3s] Do you understand the the analysis? You
[810.0s] see when we are dealing with university
[812.2s] student one thing we need to do as a
[814.6s] church and as a people is we must be
[817.7s] honest with the data
[820.5s] we keep doing more of the same it will
[823.2s] interest you know in 2023 I just gave
[825.7s] you the data 1 4 million people got
[829.3s] baptized per the data 836,95
[835.0s] left only 628,000
[838.1s] stayed in the
[841.0s] I can go on in 20 20 2019 and 2023. So
[848.1s] if you check the percentage of those we
[850.8s] baptize if we baptize about 83% of those
[855.0s] baptized uh those who were baptized 83%
[858.9s] left. Those who stayed only 16%.
[862.6s] So we baptized 100 people. Eight eight
[866.6s] of those people left. They checked out
[868.9s] 8.3 or 83 of them left. Only 16 people
[872.6s] remain. In 2023, we baptized 100 people.
[876.4s] Every 100 people we baptized, 57.13%
[880.6s] of them, they checked out. Only 42%
[883.6s] left. In the same year,
[887.8s] so think 10 years down the line.
[891.4s] Look, I can go on.
[894.4s] In 2022 and 2023, as you can see on your
[899.6s] screen, if you check the data, you will
[904.2s] notice there is a very insignificant
[908.9s] growth margin in our church in terms of
[912.3s] true numbers. If you do the analysis,
[915.4s] those who left, those who stayed, ladies
[917.9s] and gentlemen, you will get a heart
[919.4s] attack.
[922.0s] And the question you ask is must we be
[925.1s] spending resources this way
[928.3s] in case my data is right I'm told west
[931.6s] my division wad we have about just
[934.2s] barely 1 million church membership in
[937.2s] SID barely 4 million church membership
[940.2s] in ECD about 6 million church membership
[943.7s] the question is how many of them are
[946.8s] really attending church and are active
[950.0s] Church members, we need to ask a
[952.6s] question. And because it is the public
[954.5s] campus ministries week, university
[956.7s] student, you don't just pick things
[958.6s] hook, link, and center. No, you analyze
[961.3s] the data. Are we making progress? In
[965.0s] case you do not know, after COVID 19
[968.6s] pandemic, 42% of adults age 18 to 29,
[973.9s] they have changed their church
[976.7s] attendance. In fact, 30% says they don't
[979.9s] go to church very frequently. The
[982.1s] numbers who used to go to church and
[983.5s] those who don't go to church now in 2011
[985.7s] about 59% say we are not so active in
[988.0s] church. In 2019 is it shot to 64%.
[993.8s] We have a crisis.
[996.6s] Look
[998.9s] sometimes I want to get a heart attack.
[1001.8s] The question is so what do we do? This
[1004.3s] is the reason why in this evening's
[1006.9s] presentation I make the case because
[1010.3s] majority of you said you were not here
[1012.2s] when we started. I titled it lost in
[1015.1s] plain sight. Members are getting lost
[1017.8s] just in plain sight. And I subheading it
[1021.0s] why discipleship
[1023.0s] is the only defense. The solution is
[1027.1s] disciplehip.
[1029.5s] I wish I could have time to share with
[1032.3s] you further data. I don't have time on
[1035.0s] my hand. So, I'm going to zoom in. I I
[1037.6s] can present it for a local church, for a
[1040.5s] village church, for a city church, for a
[1043.0s] post-modern cosmopolitan city church,
[1045.6s] and also for campus. But for the sake of
[1047.8s] this evening, I will focus on just the
[1050.8s] campus. How can we do it on the campus?
[1054.2s] Ellen White has written extensively on
[1056.9s] how this can be done. In case I'm not
[1060.1s] able to finish, I may do the part two of
[1062.0s] this tomorrow.
[1064.2s] Let me say it for the campuses, the
[1066.0s] parent listening, the lecturers, the
[1068.7s] directors, the pastors listening.
[1070.6s] Please, I'm not a bearer of bad news,
[1073.4s] but somebody need to say it as it is.
[1077.5s] The beginning of how we lose students.
[1080.3s] The data says that out of every 10 SD
[1082.6s] who goes to school, university, public
[1085.0s] campus in four years circle, we lose
[1087.2s] about 50% to 60% of them. It's it's a
[1090.2s] statement of fact.
[1092.9s] How do we keep losing them? Why do we
[1094.9s] keep losing them? That's what we want to
[1096.6s] trace this evening. It's not more like a
[1098.8s] sermon. It's like a seminar. I'm quoting
[1101.4s] from selected messages book three, page
[1104.2s] 233 to page 234. Ellen White says and I
[1108.1s] quote, "Please pay attention. Out of the
[1111.0s] quote, we will glean the principles.
[1114.0s] There are those who after becoming
[1116.9s] established,
[1118.5s] rooted and grounded in the truth should
[1122.2s] enter this institutions of learning as
[1125.5s] student."
[1127.0s] Ellen White says
[1129.8s] not everybody must go to the public
[1132.4s] schools.
[1135.3s] However, those who must go,
[1139.4s] they are those who after becoming
[1143.0s] established,
[1144.8s] rooted and grounded in the truth should
[1148.7s] enter this institutions of learning as
[1151.9s] students. I want to begin by saying many
[1155.0s] parents don't care if their children are
[1157.8s] lost eternally. As far as they are
[1160.4s] architects, they are civil engineers,
[1162.9s] they they they go to school, they get a
[1165.1s] job, the parents are okay. If they go to
[1168.0s] hell, many Adventist parents don't care.
[1172.6s] What we care about is the status symbol
[1176.2s] of our children. He is going to MIT
[1179.7s] school, a top class school, reading a
[1181.6s] top class program. We don't care what
[1183.9s] the spirit of prophecy says concerning
[1186.1s] the salvation of our own children. Some
[1188.8s] of you are here, you are student. Hear
[1190.5s] me loud. Hear me clear. So what is the
[1193.6s] prerequisite for public campus members
[1197.0s] for someone to move from secondary
[1199.3s] school to go to university? What did the
[1202.5s] inspire writing say? We need to do as a
[1205.7s] condition precedent before they go.
[1208.1s] Condition number one, they must be
[1211.4s] established.
[1213.0s] Condition number two, they must be
[1215.8s] rooted. Condition number three, they
[1218.6s] must be grounded in the truth.
[1222.2s] Why is the GC saying 50% of students
[1226.4s] after four years they leave the church
[1229.3s] before they enter the university they
[1232.2s] were not established before they entered
[1234.9s] the universities they were not rooted
[1237.8s] before they entered the universities
[1239.6s] they were not grounded in the truth
[1243.9s] let me read it one more time selected
[1246.6s] messages book three page 233 to 234
[1250.5s] there are Those who after becoming
[1253.0s] established rooted and grounded in the
[1255.8s] truth should enter this institutions of
[1258.4s] learning as student let me say it one
[1261.8s] more time hear me
[1266.3s] this the situation will get worse we
[1270.0s] will move from 50% of our own children
[1273.5s] who go to the University of Kata
[1276.1s] University of Nairobi University of
[1278.0s] Johannesburg University of Ghana
[1280.4s] University of Lagos, University of Cal
[1282.7s] Calaba, University of Casablanca,
[1285.2s] whichever it is, they will keep leaving
[1287.6s] the church. Why? When they are in the
[1290.3s] senior high school, when they are in the
[1292.4s] junior high school, they are not
[1295.0s] established, they are not rooted, they
[1298.4s] are not grounded in the truth. All we
[1301.0s] are interested in is they are
[1302.7s] mathematics, they are science, they are
[1305.0s] English, they are eternal issues are not
[1308.0s] our concern. So we will keep losing the
[1310.7s] children and one word to represent that
[1313.3s] is we don't disciple the students.
[1319.3s] Is there a need for them to even go to
[1322.7s] the schools? Why not in the book letters
[1326.7s] 26 Ellen White wrote this in 1891.
[1331.8s] She says, and I quote, "It will be
[1334.7s] perfectly safe for our youth to enter
[1338.2s] the colleges of our land if they were
[1341.5s] converted every day. But if they feel at
[1345.8s] liberty to be off guard one day, that
[1349.5s] very day, Satan is ready with his sners
[1354.0s] and they are overcome and led to walk in
[1357.4s] false path." And she says, "Forbidden
[1361.0s] path, paths that the Lord has not cast
[1364.8s] up."
[1366.6s] So what must qualify our daughters, our
[1372.1s] sons to go to the public schools or the
[1375.2s] public universities? Ellen White says
[1378.0s] they must be converted.
[1380.8s] The first three points we said was what
[1383.4s] will qualify them to go. They must be
[1385.7s] established. They must be rooted. They
[1388.2s] must be grounded in the truth. She added
[1390.8s] another dimension. They must be
[1393.9s] converted. It's not enough to be
[1396.6s] established. It's not enough to be
[1398.6s] rooted in the truth. It's not enough to
[1400.7s] be grounded in the truth. They must also
[1403.5s] become converted. In other words, when a
[1407.4s] child when a youth from New Life SDA is
[1412.6s] not yet converted and he or she is going
[1416.6s] to the university, chances are that they
[1420.2s] will not return. And hear me, if they
[1423.4s] don't return and they begin to doubt the
[1426.2s] truth, their salvation is at stake. They
[1429.8s] will be lost for all eternity.
[1435.4s] This is the reason why
[1437.7s] before they go to the university we
[1440.3s] can't be doing the usual father Abraham
[1443.4s] in the we can't be doing that
[1446.9s] what are the KPIs in the local churches
[1450.8s] to see where our children are what are
[1454.7s] the KPIs the key performance indicators
[1458.6s] that is given to the Sabbath school
[1460.4s] teachers that is given to the special
[1462.5s] class teachers Listen, what we
[1464.9s] experiencing today, the young people are
[1466.8s] no more interested in church. They are
[1468.2s] just leaving the church. It's not a one
[1470.1s] day or a 9-day wonder. It's been a
[1473.0s] process, a process of carelessness, a
[1476.2s] process of recklessness, a process of
[1478.7s] irresponsibility
[1480.6s] on the path of parents, pastors, elders,
[1484.0s] the church community, and the young
[1485.9s] people themselves.
[1493.3s] Why must we have our members at the
[1496.1s] public campus? Please don't get me
[1497.5s] wrong. I am not here saying send the
[1499.8s] children only to Baratin or or AUA. No,
[1503.1s] that is not it. Ellen White has written
[1505.5s] extensively because we certainly need to
[1508.5s] have them even if not because aside
[1511.3s] their spirituality because of our
[1513.6s] evangelistic ethos and outlook relevance
[1516.4s] and excellence they need to be on the
[1519.0s] public campus. What is my basis for
[1521.2s] this? I'm I'm quoting from inspired
[1523.5s] writing
[1525.7s] selected messages book three page 234.
[1530.7s] Why must they go? They can keep the
[1533.8s] living principles of the truth
[1537.0s] and observe the Sabbath and yet they
[1540.6s] will have opportunity to work for the
[1542.7s] master by dropping seeds of truth in
[1546.5s] minds and heart. This work must be done
[1550.9s] and it will be done by those who are led
[1555.0s] and thought of God. In this is another
[1558.6s] principle. Why must our student though
[1561.5s] there is a danger in the university, why
[1564.5s] must they go to the universities, the
[1566.7s] public campuses like your your how do
[1569.1s] you call it your your university of is
[1572.5s] it the media one how do you call it
[1576.2s] multimedia university or whichever
[1578.5s] university number one Ellen White says
[1580.9s] is an opportunity for our children our
[1585.0s] young people our youth to live the
[1588.2s] gospel Somebody should say an amen to
[1590.2s] that one. So if you can then they must
[1593.6s] not go. It's so dangerous. No, she says
[1596.0s] that is an avenue for them to leave the
[1598.5s] gospel. Point number two, why must our
[1600.9s] young people go to the centers of
[1602.8s] learning of the world? It's an occasion
[1606.2s] for them to observe the Sabbath. Are you
[1609.4s] aware majority of our student write
[1612.0s] Sabbath exam and sometime pastors,
[1615.2s] administrators, elders are not bold to
[1618.3s] tell the people it is breaking the
[1620.6s] fourth commandment to write an exam on
[1623.0s] the Sabbath.
[1625.2s] And then they keep writing exams on
[1627.5s] Sabbath for a long time. Then they
[1629.7s] become professionals. They start working
[1631.8s] on the Sabbath. And guess what? They
[1633.9s] have no regard for the Sabbath. One of
[1637.2s] the reason they need to go to the public
[1640.1s] campuses is an opportunity to live the
[1644.2s] gospel. Number two, it's an opportunity
[1649.1s] or an occasion for them to observe the
[1652.3s] Sabbath. And that leads me to point
[1654.5s] number three for the sake of time. It's
[1656.6s] a privilege to work with God on those
[1660.1s] campuses.
[1661.9s] They can keep the living principles of
[1664.0s] the truth, she says, and observe the
[1666.7s] Sabbath, yet they will have an
[1668.6s] opportunity to work for the master by
[1670.9s] dropping seats or dropping seats of
[1674.0s] truth in mind and in heart. Why must
[1677.3s] they go to this campuses? I like this
[1680.2s] one. Aside an opportunity to work for
[1683.1s] God is an occasion to influence minds
[1688.1s] and hearts.
[1690.0s] So this is a basis we started there is a
[1692.9s] crisis the source of the crisis is we've
[1695.4s] stopped discipling
[1697.6s] then I'm zooming in I'm not talking
[1699.5s] about local churches I'm talking about
[1701.0s] campus because this week is for public
[1703.3s] campus this is what Ellen wise is then
[1706.5s] the question is which personality so
[1709.1s] number one which the children go to or
[1711.8s] the young people go to the universities
[1714.4s] without being prepared
[1717.0s] number two they don't know why they are
[1720.0s] there.
[1721.6s] They are not aware. They need to be
[1723.8s] there to live the gospel. They need to
[1726.0s] be there to observe the Sabbath. They
[1728.1s] need to be there to be privileged to
[1729.5s] work with God. They be there so that
[1731.4s] they will influence minds and hearts.
[1736.5s] The question now is which personalities
[1739.6s] must execute the campus ministries
[1742.1s] mandate. Everybody cannot do campus
[1745.0s] ministries. Every pastor, every leader
[1748.5s] cannot do campus me with personalities.
[1751.0s] You see the difficulty is that we are
[1753.6s] lazy.
[1755.5s] We can't even take time to read the
[1757.4s] spirit of prophecy and glean principles
[1759.9s] that must guide what we do. Ellen White
[1762.6s] says and I quote, she says this work
[1765.8s] campus ministries must be done and it
[1769.4s] will be done by those who are one led
[1774.0s] and taught of God. So which
[1777.4s] characteristics? So for example in the
[1779.4s] fellowship when you want to select the
[1781.4s] president of the fellowship of those
[1783.7s] campus churches which students must be
[1785.8s] there which pastors must lead which
[1788.3s] aluminites must be part of it. Number
[1790.3s] one, people who are le and people who
[1793.0s] are taught of God. This is a key
[1795.9s] foundation. Aside knowing the Bible,
[1798.8s] aside being eloquent, aside being
[1800.8s] dressing to meet the trend and the time,
[1803.5s] you must be led by God and you must be
[1806.8s] taught by God. It goes for a moment,
[1809.2s] Holy Spirit, teach me, show me what must
[1813.3s] be done. We have a lot of people who are
[1816.2s] leading out on the campuses. Quite
[1818.6s] frankly, they are ignorant.
[1824.7s] What does it mean to be led
[1829.0s] and to be taught of God? Somewhere else,
[1831.6s] Ellen White says selected messages book
[1834.5s] two page 233 to 235.
[1838.2s] Those who have the spirit of God and
[1841.3s] have the truth route in their very being
[1845.1s] should be encouraged to enter colleges
[1849.0s] and live the truth as Daniel and Paul
[1852.8s] did. Take note.
[1855.6s] So which characteristics of people?
[1857.8s] those who have the spirit of God,
[1861.1s] who have the truth route. So you must
[1864.1s] have the Holy Spirit to be led by the
[1866.2s] Holy Spirit. You must have the truth
[1868.3s] route in you to be taught by God. So in
[1871.5s] ence, the personalities God can use for
[1874.6s] campus ministries, those who have the
[1877.2s] Holy Spirit. Number two, just not those
[1880.7s] who have the Holy Spirit, those who are
[1883.0s] consumed by the truth.
[1886.6s] So one is why are people leaving the
[1890.1s] church the young people why is they
[1892.6s] living in droves why
[1895.8s] our disciplehip is faulty why is it
[1898.4s] faulty before they go to school they are
[1900.6s] not grounded they are not established
[1902.2s] and the rest of it number two they don't
[1904.5s] know even why they are going number
[1906.2s] three the people we deploy to lead out
[1909.3s] in campus ministries they are not led by
[1911.5s] God they are not taught by God number
[1914.0s] two they have not the spirit of God. And
[1917.0s] number three, they are not consumed
[1920.4s] by the truth. And if you care to know,
[1922.8s] number four, they must be those who live
[1926.4s] the truth.
[1929.8s] Simple.
[1932.6s] Our church is in crisis.
[1945.7s] I repeat again, we don't just need a
[1948.6s] campus that holds programs.
[1952.4s] We must start movements.
[1955.4s] Don't just grow fellowships,
[1958.0s] plant fire. Don't just survive campus,
[1962.2s] transform the campus.
[1965.5s] Why are this university students those
[1968.6s] of you who are here you are so critical
[1970.5s] for God's work in the last days? Do you
[1972.7s] know why Ellen White made a statement
[1975.4s] your inability to be grounded in the
[1977.9s] church in the truth? Listen, Ellen White
[1980.8s] says, "Preachers,
[1982.7s] I'm quoting from the book testimonies
[1984.2s] for the church volume 5 page and page
[1988.6s] 136.
[1991.6s] In fact, it's repeated in the book life
[1993.7s] sketches of Ellen White. He said
[1995.8s] preachers or lay men advance in years
[2000.1s] cannot have one half the influence upon
[2004.1s] the young that the youth devoted to God
[2007.9s] can have upon their associate. You can
[2010.6s] do a work that those who minister in
[2012.7s] word and doctrine cannot do. You can
[2015.4s] reach a class whom the minister cannot
[2018.2s] affect or effect. And then why says the
[2021.3s] work the students can do on campus
[2023.5s] preachers cannot do it. Lay men with
[2026.3s] experience they can't do it. Why? He
[2029.5s] says even one half we cannot even do one
[2033.3s] of a half even 20% of what you can do as
[2037.5s] student on the campus pastors cannot do
[2040.6s] it elders cannot do it church leaders
[2043.0s] cannot do it administrators cannot do it
[2045.4s] and then why says speaking to students
[2047.4s] he says you can do a work that those who
[2050.8s] minister in word and doctrine cannot do
[2055.4s] you can reach a class whom the minister
[2059.0s] cannot affect. So tell me between a
[2062.0s] gifted preacher and a converted young
[2064.6s] person in University of Kenyata who can
[2067.1s] influence the campus much more. Tell me
[2069.5s] the pastor or the student? The students
[2073.8s] question.
[2075.5s] Let me say it one more time. It is
[2078.1s] misplaced priority
[2080.6s] for new life, Nairobi central, a
[2083.8s] lavendon and all the churches within the
[2086.6s] city of Nairobi to be so obsessed about
[2090.1s] community campaigns and evangelism
[2092.7s] without investing on campus. Let me
[2094.9s] quite quite bluntly is a misplaced
[2097.0s] priority. Another way to say it is that
[2099.0s] it's unseriousness.
[2105.8s] The next generation of presidents of
[2108.3s] Kenya, they in the university. The next
[2111.6s] engineers, top class private sector
[2115.0s] leaders, captains of industry, they are
[2117.5s] there. The next generation of financial
[2120.4s] mogul, people with a deep pocket, they
[2123.0s] are there. The next generation of
[2125.2s] brilliant mind who can defend the truth,
[2127.8s] they are there. And guess what? We are
[2130.6s] still doing this kind of local church
[2132.6s] business. Father Abraham have been are
[2135.0s] we?
[2140.5s] Yo, are we serious?
[2148.5s] Turn to somebody and tell the person we
[2149.8s] are sick.
[2152.1s] Why are you looking at me like that? Say
[2153.4s] it one more time. Say we are sick.
[2157.5s] It's not just in Kenya. Ghana is worse.
[2161.8s] Nigeria is worse worse worst.
[2165.8s] West Africa is worse. Promax
[2175.1s] manuscript 62 1903 Ellen White Right. A
[2179.0s] great work is to be done. I am moved by
[2182.3s] the spirit of God to say to those
[2185.2s] engaged in the Lord's work that the
[2188.0s] favorable time for our message to be
[2191.6s] carried to the cities has been passed
[2193.6s] by. Cities are where you have the
[2195.1s] universities and this work has not been
[2197.6s] done. I feel a heavy burden that we
[2201.4s] should now redeem the time. This why I
[2205.6s] title it lost in plain sight. just
[2209.0s] before us. Our children are going to
[2211.0s] hell. Young people are dying forever.
[2214.5s] And guess what? We are comfortable and
[2217.4s] nobody cares.
[2220.0s] Why? Disciplehip is the only defense.
[2224.1s] When I was the campus ministries
[2225.5s] director
[2227.0s] of my union,
[2230.0s] with the help of the campus ministries
[2231.8s] committee and some brilliant
[2233.2s] professionals,
[2235.0s] we carved a vision. Let me share with
[2237.3s] you which is a disciplehip module. You
[2240.2s] may want to give it a thought on Friday
[2242.5s] or Sabbath. I will give you a mission
[2244.4s] report of what some of your friends in
[2247.2s] various part of the world are doing. I
[2251.4s] wrote the vision for the campus.
[2254.2s] Yesterday we said it's not a ministry.
[2255.7s] It must be what? A movement. It says
[2258.3s] it's a Bible centered movement of
[2261.1s] student where all uphold live and share
[2265.2s] the gospel. Pause. This is the vision.
[2268.8s] It is not a place where clowns come in
[2272.0s] on the campus. One thing will keep the
[2274.4s] student. It must be Bible based.
[2279.1s] It must listen if if you say something
[2282.2s] you can't quoted from the Bible.
[2283.5s] Students should be able to say shut up.
[2287.2s] If you speak it contradicts the Bible,
[2289.4s] our young people should stand up and say
[2291.4s] in light of what the Bible says like the
[2293.9s] Berians, you are wrong elder, you are
[2296.9s] wrong. Respectfully, pastor, what you
[2299.3s] are saying contradicts the belief of the
[2302.0s] Bible. It must be a Bible centered
[2305.0s] movement. Everybody in the fellowship
[2307.4s] must swell. Bible students. Number two,
[2311.2s] they must uphold and live and share the
[2315.3s] gospel. So they believe the Bible, a
[2317.6s] movement of Bible believers. Number two,
[2320.0s] people who don't just believe the Bible,
[2321.9s] they they they they trust the Bible. And
[2326.3s] then number three, they leave the Bible.
[2328.7s] And number four, they share the gospel.
[2331.0s] That is the vision for campus. If you do
[2333.3s] this, they will not leave the church.
[2337.1s] There is too much music in the church in
[2340.0s] the campuses because we have not
[2341.8s] presented the Bible. Our children can't
[2344.3s] even tell. Are you aware that 60% of
[2346.8s] professionals do not know what Adventism
[2349.6s] is about? The cardinal beliefs of the
[2353.2s] remnant of Bible prophecy. Hear me,
[2355.7s] there is no other remnant. Check the
[2357.8s] book of Revelation chapter 3. After the
[2359.8s] Laudian church, a w a lukewarm church
[2363.3s] after that there was no other church.
[2366.9s] This is the church.
[2369.4s] So on the campus to keep the student, we
[2372.6s] must give them a vision. Why are they
[2375.4s] interested in Tik Tok and all this
[2377.8s] stupidity? We have not given them a
[2380.1s] vision. Why we claim there is a vision
[2383.4s] is a lukewarm vision, a tin vision. No,
[2387.7s] every student in Kenya, in Africa, on
[2390.9s] the university campus, nothing but the
[2393.3s] Bible and the Bible alone.
[2396.2s] and then they leave the Bible and then
[2399.2s] they share the Bible. Our mission was to
[2403.7s] prepare campuses for eternity. Period.
[2407.0s] We are not there to do entertainment.
[2409.1s] Campus ministries is not entertainment.
[2413.0s] It is a spiritual warfare. The student
[2416.2s] needs to know the destiny of their
[2418.1s] lecturers. The psychology lecturer, the
[2420.2s] economics lecturer, the whichever
[2422.6s] lecturer professor you are, the student
[2424.6s] understand whether you are agnostic,
[2426.7s] whether you are a Muslim, whether you
[2428.6s] are an a religious, you will go to hell
[2432.6s] except you submit to the leadership of
[2435.3s] Christ. So we are on campus not just to
[2437.8s] get a degree but to prepare them for the
[2440.4s] soon return of Jesus. Somebody say an
[2442.0s] amen to that one. Amen. The goal must be
[2444.9s] simple. Three dimensions.
[2447.7s] Number one, revive the students on
[2450.9s] campus. So those who are on fire yet
[2454.1s] they get to campus and the fire is
[2456.0s] dying.
[2457.8s] A disciplehip model must be how do we
[2460.7s] revive them? So the programs are
[2463.0s] targeted to stir the heart of students
[2465.8s] because I'll be showing you tomorrow and
[2467.4s] the days to come. Revival has always
[2470.0s] been a powerful force on campus. So
[2473.4s] revive,
[2475.0s] redeem and reclaim. When we say redeem
[2477.8s] is those who are lost, those who don't
[2480.4s] believe the everlasting gospel. Our goal
[2482.9s] is not just to revive our own members.
[2484.7s] We are also to redeem those who are no
[2488.0s] more interested or they don't believe
[2490.1s] the everlasting gospel and then reclaim.
[2493.1s] You are 7day Adventist. You're on campus
[2495.1s] and then you have a boyfriend and you
[2497.0s] are sleeping around. No, you are not a
[2498.9s] 7-day Adventist. You are you are lost.
[2500.6s] You have apostasized. You are a 7th day
[2502.7s] Adventist and you are writing exam on
[2504.6s] Saturday. No, you are not a 7-day
[2506.2s] Adventist. You're a 7th day Adventist
[2507.8s] and you eat pork. You are not a 7-day
[2509.5s] Adventist. They are leaving the church
[2511.8s] gradually. So, we must reclaim them.
[2514.8s] Three dimension. You revive, you redeem
[2518.6s] and you reclaim.
[2524.2s] How can the students leave if such a
[2527.2s] vision is been executed?
[2532.3s] What must be the philosophy? When I was
[2534.6s] campus ministry director, our philosophy
[2536.5s] was spiritual excellence that impact
[2539.9s] academic excellence and beyond.
[2543.1s] You can tell the stock I come from.
[2546.4s] Spiritual excellence and academic
[2548.7s] excellence. Two dimensions.
[2551.4s] You are sea. You must be godly. Number
[2554.2s] two, you must be brilliant. You can't be
[2555.8s] getting C's C's and the rest. What kind
[2558.4s] of foolishness is? Go and study. Stop
[2560.4s] the foolishness and go and study. You
[2561.8s] are SCA. do their writing exam then you
[2563.8s] are copying you are copying I was in one
[2566.7s] school I saw a beautiful lady well
[2568.8s] shaped nice girl exam time she pulled
[2571.3s] her ski and she started copying I raise
[2572.8s] my hand I said look at that foolish girl
[2574.4s] they should suck her from the exam hall
[2575.8s] what kind of nonsense is that which kind
[2577.4s] of Christian is it you are a Christian
[2578.8s] and you are caught in no
[2581.9s] if you are spiritual and you are not
[2584.6s] academically excellent you undermine the
[2587.5s] gospel are you getting the point those
[2590.3s] of you here do you understand what I'm
[2592.4s] You can't be as we keep the Sabbath
[2595.3s] asuroras and then you keep chemistry
[2597.5s] result.
[2600.1s] Are you mad? Who follow this god? The
[2603.0s] god of CNDs and the rest of it always
[2606.2s] always interested in in in in conference
[2609.7s] spirituality. We are in the spirit. We
[2611.7s] are the Daniel's man. And when the
[2613.4s] reason you are in school now has come,
[2615.0s] then you are flocking your causes. You
[2616.5s] are lazy. Your grace are so bad. And
[2618.6s] then you are justifying it. We are going
[2620.2s] to heaven. Shut up. Go and steady. Go
[2622.8s] and steady. So it must be spiritual
[2625.4s] excellence that impact. So if you are
[2628.0s] spiritual, the Bible says whatever your
[2630.6s] hand finds to do, do it with all your
[2634.2s] might. The Bible says there is a season
[2636.7s] for everything. A time to do. Listen,
[2639.8s] there must be a time to study. There
[2641.8s] must be a time. Listen, this is classy
[2648.2s] in our methodology.
[2651.2s] is simple.
[2653.8s] We educate minds.
[2656.6s] We equip hearts. We empower lives
[2660.8s] through radical, ruthless, relentless
[2664.7s] biblical commitment. We educate minds.
[2669.2s] We equip the heart. We empower lives
[2673.5s] through radical, ruthless, relentless
[2678.1s] biblical commitment. So if you are on
[2681.7s] campus,
[2683.5s] your mind must be sharp.
[2686.2s] Your heart must be clean. Your life must
[2689.7s] speak volumes. And the basis of all you
[2693.0s] do is not based on Hollywood, Nollywood,
[2696.8s] Kylewood, Zillawood, whatever wood. It
[2699.6s] must be based on the Bible. Two
[2701.9s] foundational philosophical
[2703.4s] underpinnings. The Bible and the spirit
[2705.7s] of prophecy.
[2707.7s] And the motto
[2709.7s] was and ought to be prepared and
[2713.3s] challenged to change the world. The
[2715.8s] students must see themselves by the time
[2717.9s] they graduate from school. They enter
[2720.2s] into the work market to be agents of
[2723.5s] change. And our tagline we borrow the
[2726.3s] Dr. P Dr. people influence this for us a
[2729.3s] lot is from a ministry to students to a
[2733.7s] movement of students.
[2737.2s] Why are young people leaving? They are
[2739.3s] leaving the church. I call it they are
[2741.8s] lost in plain sight. Our only defense is
[2746.3s] disciplehip.
[2750.0s] Look,
[2752.2s] they need to move from being attendees
[2754.6s] to apostles.
[2757.0s] And how can they do that?
[2760.1s] The classroom is not a detour. It's a
[2763.0s] designated field. The student must come
[2765.4s] to understand I am in class tomorrow.
[2767.2s] I'm going to share about the wild
[2768.8s] denses. The method they use, how you can
[2771.7s] take over the universities in Kenya and
[2774.1s] convert it into an evangelistic path, a
[2776.6s] spirit of prophecy and a biblical
[2778.0s] perspective. Students will be on fire
[2780.2s] and guess what? The young men will be
[2782.2s] godly. The young women will be godly.
[2784.2s] That is the future for the church.
[2787.1s] They are engaged in evangelism and they
[2789.4s] are not interested in pelvic activity.
[2791.5s] These days when it is raining our young
[2793.3s] girls and young boys if it is raining
[2794.9s] then they say the weather has brought
[2796.6s] itself. The weather has brought and some
[2799.1s] young people in elsewhere they are
[2801.2s] thinking of innovation. SDA young boys
[2803.2s] and girls they are thinking of how to
[2805.2s] use their pelvic exercise their pelvic
[2811.1s] indiscriminate sex on campus.
[2814.4s] Do you know the reason why there is no
[2816.6s] disciplehip?
[2819.2s] I wish I had time.
[2825.0s] Look,
[2827.3s] we are not just called to be present on
[2829.0s] campus. Oh, we were sent to transform
[2831.8s] it.
[2835.1s] And if we do not do it, these five
[2837.3s] enemies will kill the campus. Quite
[2840.2s] frankly, do you know my main content for
[2842.9s] today? I've not touched it yet.
[2847.8s] Enemies of campus movement.
[2851.0s] I'll just mention the number one is
[2852.4s] comfort. Write it down. C's I'm doing
[2854.8s] five C's. Comfort.
[2857.3s] The idol of balance over burden. Because
[2861.5s] there is no disciplehip. So everybody's
[2864.0s] comfortable. Sinners are comfortable.
[2866.6s] Wicked people are comfortable on campus.
[2869.4s] Everybody is comfortable. No.
[2872.9s] The idol of balance over burden. When
[2875.8s] ease replaces urgency, the altar grows
[2879.8s] cold and the result the young people
[2882.6s] begin to check out.
[2887.1s] The second enemy when disciplehip is not
[2889.9s] happening or the reason why it's not
[2891.4s] happening aside comfort. Everyone is too
[2893.4s] comfortable on campus. There is no fire,
[2895.6s] no burden, all of that. I dealt with a
[2897.8s] couple of them yesterday. There is
[2899.4s] compromise copying others instead of
[2902.8s] carrying our unique mandate. So you
[2905.0s] begin to see Adventist young people want
[2907.3s] to just be like all other denominations.
[2910.1s] We are a remnant of Bible prophecy. Our
[2913.5s] children don't even believe it. They
[2915.4s] don't understand Adventism is not one of
[2918.1s] the churches in the world. It is God's
[2920.3s] end time remnant to fulfill a unique
[2922.9s] agenda. When you hear the song, lift up
[2925.7s] the trumpet and loud let it ring. Jesus
[2928.5s] is coming again. Cher pilgrims be joyful
[2931.6s] and say hear me. The world is coming to
[2934.9s] an end. We have been given a mandate. We
[2937.7s] have been given a message. When there is
[2940.2s] compromise, we start to copy what others
[2943.6s] are doing blindly.
[2947.3s] So it's not just comfort, it's
[2949.8s] compromise. It's not just compromise.
[2953.1s] Then comparison begin to set in.
[2957.6s] Comparison deals with
[2961.8s] just quickly
[2964.8s] swallowing what others are doing. And
[2967.2s] then the compromise is we mingle Babylon
[2970.6s] with the sanctuary. Then canality will
[2973.2s] go when numbers matter more than
[2976.6s] transformation. So everybody is doing
[2978.8s] campus work with the merely only the
[2981.3s] optics. The transformation of the heart.
[2984.3s] The students are not broken. Lecturers
[2986.6s] are not be warned. You see our
[2988.3s] evangelistic report is just about our
[2990.4s] own children getting recycled and
[2992.0s] rebaptized and rebaptized and we are
[2993.8s] deceiving ourselves thinking something
[2995.5s] has been done. Look, it's activity. More
[2998.2s] of the same. One person who baptized
[3000.3s] four times, three times and we add it as
[3002.4s] if there is growth. There is no
[3004.1s] qualitative growth. This one is a scam.
[3009.8s] And then there is coward eyes fearing
[3012.9s] administration more than God. When there
[3015.3s] is no disciplehip, our sons and
[3017.8s] daughters will not stand like Daniel on
[3020.5s] campus. And why can't they stand there
[3023.4s] is coward eyes? Because before they even
[3025.8s] enter the school, they were not
[3027.4s] grounded. They were not established. And
[3029.4s] they were not rooted in the truth.
[3033.9s] Fearing administration
[3036.5s] more than God. I did a certain program
[3039.4s] recently
[3040.9s] three years ago. I took another M's
[3042.9s] program in a certain school. I won't
[3044.6s] mention the name. I deliberately chose
[3048.3s] to do the program daytime.
[3052.0s] When my admission came, they said I was
[3053.5s] admitted to do a day program.
[3056.3s] School started. They said it must be
[3058.1s] evening program.
[3060.0s] Monday to Friday. I said I can come to
[3062.4s] school from Monday to Friday to
[3064.0s] Thursday. Friday night I cannot. I am a
[3066.9s] seventh day Adventist. I keep the
[3068.6s] Sabbath. They said be there if you want
[3071.0s] a great you. I did not go. Exam time
[3074.2s] came. They said it will be on Friday.
[3076.3s] You will not ride. I wrote to the
[3078.4s] council of the school after seeking
[3081.4s] advice. A long matter short. When I met
[3085.0s] the leadership of the school, I said I'm
[3087.2s] a 7th day Adventist pastor. More so I'm
[3090.0s] a Christian. More so I'm a 7th day
[3092.4s] Adventist church member. I can't write
[3094.6s] exams on Saturday. They said no but this
[3098.8s] pastor wrote this your member wrote this
[3101.1s] person did this. I said that is them
[3103.8s] based on my belief respectfully. I
[3107.0s] cannot can I be given an exemption like
[3109.6s] they do for the Jews.
[3112.6s] Long matter shift. I did not write
[3114.7s] exams. When I was graduating, my thesis
[3118.9s] to the glory of God was the best the
[3121.8s] graduate school has ever seen.
[3124.7s] Ladies and gentlemen, why the cowardice?
[3128.1s] Why can't our children stand and say, "I
[3132.2s] can't eat pork. Why? It's not good for
[3134.7s] my health, too. I'm a Christian. More
[3137.4s] so, a 7-day Adventist. The Bible says I
[3140.6s] can't I should not defile the body." Why
[3143.8s] don't you take alcohol? I am a
[3145.7s] Christian. I can't defile the body. Why
[3148.8s] can't you have sex before marriage? No,
[3151.2s] I am. Ladies and gentlemen, there is
[3153.8s] cowardice. And do you know the reason
[3155.7s] our young people have not been
[3157.7s] discipled?
[3159.5s] I've not even touched on the
[3160.7s] disciplehip.
[3162.5s] You cannot conquer the campus if you
[3165.7s] will not confront these enemies.
[3169.8s] Hear me guys. Every generation must
[3173.0s] choose between being liked by men or
[3176.2s] being used by God.
[3180.1s] Every generation must choose it.
[3184.8s] I'll do the part tomorrow and I will
[3187.9s] show the difference between a Christian,
[3191.6s] a believer and a disciple. Let me wet
[3194.6s] your appetite and then we pray.
[3197.8s] Are you aware that throughout the Bible
[3202.0s] in the New Testament they use the word
[3204.6s] Christians only three times in the New
[3207.6s] Testament. Acts 11:26 Act 26:28 1 Peter
[3213.0s] 4:16 the disciples were first called
[3215.7s] Christian in Antioch. Acts 26:28 agria
[3220.1s] said almost thou persuaded me to be a
[3223.3s] Christian. 1 Peter 4:16, if anyone
[3226.6s] suffers as a Christian, let him not be
[3229.0s] ashamed. Only three times Christian is
[3232.2s] used in the Bible. Now, do you know that
[3236.5s] the word disciple
[3239.0s] mates
[3240.5s] meaning a learner, a follower, it
[3243.4s] appears almost 261 times in the New
[3247.3s] Testament alone.
[3249.5s] Are you also aware that the word
[3252.2s] believer or believers appears about two
[3255.0s] to 10 times depending on the translation
[3257.6s] you are using? My case is this we have
[3261.0s] too many Christians in quotes not
[3265.0s] disciples
[3267.5s] too many churchgoers.
[3269.8s] This is the reason why with our numbers
[3272.3s] in Kenya in Africa we are going to the
[3275.0s] GC again and the news will be the church
[3277.9s] is growing in Africa. True. What is it
[3281.2s] qualitative impact? 11 people shook the
[3284.6s] world and turned the world upside down
[3288.1s] and we are 6 million 4 million in just a
[3291.3s] geographical area. Africa alone almost
[3293.7s] 10 million
[3295.7s] almost 46% of the membership of the
[3298.6s] church. Nothing can be done. We are not
[3301.2s] shaking the world. Nobody is afraid of
[3303.6s] us. Do you know the underlining factor?
[3305.8s] We don't have disciples. We don't know
[3307.9s] how to disciple people. And the net
[3311.0s] effect, people are living in droves.
[3314.6s] Perhaps tomorrow
[3316.6s] I will situate it. Well, this is what I
[3318.6s] want us to do.
[3320.9s] Come tomorrow.
[3323.0s] Come with a friend. We are in crisis.
[3327.4s] God is looking for people he can depend
[3329.8s] on and dispatch them to hold the ro. The
[3333.4s] reason Jesus came to die is to save the
[3335.9s] lost. People come that they want to be
[3338.1s] saved and before our own eyes they are
[3341.2s] getting lost day by day.
[3345.2s] How do we solve it? Tomorrow I will go
[3348.2s] into the part two of this. But this
[3349.9s] evening I want us to sing two songs and
[3353.0s] then we pray a very critical prayer. I
[3357.4s] want us to sing the organist. You are
[3359.3s] going to help us with this songs and I
[3362.4s] want you to sing it like your life
[3365.1s] depends upon it. I wanted to sing the
[3369.3s] first song redeem. How I love to
[3373.3s] proclaim it. Redeem by the blood. When
[3377.0s] our students are singing this song, they
[3379.7s] should sing it with a meaning. It's not
[3381.8s] just from SDA, they should sing it with
[3384.6s] a personal connection with Jesus. They
[3387.7s] need to know what it is to be saved by
[3389.6s] God, redeemed from sin, save from the
[3392.6s] penalties of evil. They need to know. We
[3395.8s] will sing this song. And when we are
[3397.4s] done, we will also sing.
[3400.9s] [Music]
[3402.9s] It is almost time for the Lord to come.
[3407.5s] I want everybody in the auditorium and
[3409.7s] those of you joining online, I want you
[3411.9s] to sing it like your life depends upon
[3415.2s] it. Redeem
[3418.6s] and the musicians, I hope you're going
[3420.1s] to sing well. You must sing excellently.
[3424.0s] [Music]
[3428.2s] 337.
[3429.9s] Let's stand there.
[3433.3s] Let's
[3441.8s] sing.
[3443.9s] Redeemed, how I love to proclaim
[3448.1s] it. Redeemed, redeemed by the blood of
[3451.8s] the Lord. Redeemed through his infinite
[3455.4s] mercy.
[3458.5s] His child and forever. child and forever
[3462.3s] I am. Come on. Redeemed. Redeemed.
[3467.9s] Redeemed.
[3470.6s] Redeemed by the blood of the lamb.
[3475.1s] Redeemed
[3476.2s] [Applause]
[3479.1s] redeemed
[3480.2s] [Music]

[3803.9s] Father in heaven,
[3806.7s] we are just at the precipe of eternity.
[3810.6s] But right before our eyes,
[3814.3s] our young people are getting lost
[3817.7s] in millions,
[3819.5s] in thousands, and in hundreds.
[3824.1s] We don't care.
[3826.9s] We describe it. They've stopped church,
[3830.5s] but they are being lost.
[3833.4s] We pray today
[3835.8s] beginning with the students who are
[3838.0s] here, those watching online, church
[3841.9s] leaders, pastors, church elders, church
[3846.0s] board members. May we understand the
[3849.8s] unique place of this student in
[3853.6s] finishing God's work.
[3856.1s] With such an army of youth we are told
[3860.6s] rightly trained. How soon Lord we pray
[3866.2s] give a revived heart to the leadership
[3870.2s] of the church at new life.
[3872.9s] Bless the campus leaders. Bless the
[3875.4s] student present. May we begin to think
[3878.5s] the long term before they get to
[3881.4s] university, in their JHS, in their
[3884.1s] secondary schools. May we begin to make
[3886.6s] them firm, established, rooted in the
[3889.8s] word. May we make not just church
[3892.9s] members, may our children, our young
[3895.4s] people, may they become disciples.
[3899.0s] Bless those who have joined us from
[3901.9s] different countries across the globe.
[3904.6s] Bless those who are here. And tomorrow
[3907.9s] as we move to the fourth day, let there
[3910.7s] be a new revelation. Lord, until then,
[3914.5s] make us restless.
[3917.1s] Make us restless.
[3920.0s] Make us feel guilty for the thousands,
[3923.8s] the hundreds, the millions, yay, that
[3927.4s] are dying in multitudes.
[3931.0s] May God bless you.
[3933.6s] May God revive you. May God lay a burden
[3938.3s] on your heart. And out of this church,
[3942.1s] let there be a new mission field, the
[3944.7s] campus that will be exploited, deployed,
[3948.4s] and leverage to God's glory. May the
[3951.4s] grace of our Lord Jesus Christ and the
[3954.0s] love of God and the fellowship of the
[3956.2s] Holy Spirit abide with us now and
[3959.1s] forever more. Amen. God bless you.
