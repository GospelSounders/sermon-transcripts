FULL TRANSCRIPT:
Thank you very much. You may be seated. Thank you very much and God's precious blessings. Allow me to say this that uh we're going to have again another very short program and we still want to beg your indulgence. This is what has been uh we've been waiting for. But before I call Eldo to come up front, allow me to make mention of this that tomorrow we have a music extravaganza here that is starting at 9:00. We have invited several choirs that are going to be here. Please those of you who can find time uh join with us and then I also want to make an announcement that probably may have uh been made in your WhatsApp group and wasn't mentioned here by the elder announcing that the VBS parents are requested to meet on the right side of this church. Immediately we are done with this program. So then come at the time come at the hour allow me at this moment to welcome my elder Elder please. I would I would like to invite all those who are participating in this program to come up front so that we minimize on time for walking. They know themselves. Okay. Happy Sabbath. Happy Sabbath. I want us to take a moment to to mark a historic milestone, the veiling unveiling of the model for the Crystal Fountain Cathedral and the official launch of our development fund which has already been started by the men. But I want to start with a familiar quote from Sister Ellen White from the book Christian Experience and Teachings of Ellen White page 204. And it reads, "In reviewing our past history, having traveled over every step of advance to our present standing, I can say, "Praise God." As I see what God has wrought, I'm filled with astonishment and with confidence in Christ as as a leader. We have nothing to fear for the future except as we shall forget the way the Lord has led us and his teaching in our past history. I take a moment to reflect on our growth and movement as new life 7th Adventist church. We have grown from city hall to Kenya poly technique to railways club and ultimately to the fifth gong avenue. For the pioneers who are privileged to be part of these developments, you readily appreciate that our settling on this land was nothing short of a divine miracle. The God of that miracle is still on his throne. Amen. Amen. The God of that miracle is still on his throne and is bidding us to move forward in faith. While under our current building structure, we have undoubtedly achieved many gospel and evangelistic milestones. We have set up several thriving churches and Sabbath schools. We have built other notable ministries in our multiple chapency lines. Aside from attending to our spiritual and physical needs of our members, church members like Nemiah Nehemiah, we must now like Nemiah we must now just a minute. We must now fairly look at the work in the face. Look at ourselves in the face like the builders on the wall. In his time, we must take fresh courage. Brethren, it is time for us to reckon with the prophet Hagai's challenge in the book of Hag 1:4. Is it time for you to dwell in your nice houses while the house of the Lord lies in ruins? By and by, many vision bearers are fading off the scene. Some have relocated to other churches. Some have gone on retirement and relocated to their home churches. And sadly, yet inevitably some have slept waiting for the second coming of Jesus Christ. We have tried for a little much longer than we should under the current structure. We have stayed here for too long. The fast changing Nairobi skyline as evidenced by our surrounding in the neighborhood is perhaps our ultimate uh wakeup call. While the finer details of the project are being worked out, we must begin doing something and today is the day. If it is not today, then when? If it is not you, then who? African demographics show that our population is youth heavy with a median age of 19 years. Trends also plainly show that it is rapidly urbanizing. These are rapidly urbanizing continent. The cities will remain key population centers. Nairobi remains a global regional hub for many organization including our church. It is a center of traffic teaming with modern church facility and various nationalities and classes and we need to come up with a befitting sanctuary for the lord as the father servant of the lord said in the sermon equally nairobi is being a hub of knowledge and learning we must be ready to attract the lord's side to the lord's side many young people trooping in the institutions of learning looking for jobs, knowledge and skills. We must work to bequit our young people at charge befitting the lofty aspirations to extend the Lord's work uh the Lord's work globally in keeping the gospel commission. My final call, brothers and sisters, let each one as an individual church members and as families reflect on the work that lies ahead. Let us know we are but stewards of the Lord's goods who must be found faithful when we return to take accounts. Let us embrace the vision and the challenge. Let us rally our families. Let us rally our friends to its realization. It can be done in the Lord's strength in a canon and by his unfailing providence in the prayerful words of a national anthem let me say let one and all arise with hearts both strong and true. May the Lord bless you. Church members, the exhortation was very clear. Let them build me a sanctuary. Let them build me a sanctuary. He would have done it himself, but he has called upon us to do it in his behalf. Let me see all those that are saying we want to be a part of those that will be in the sanctuary to be up on their feet to be up on their feet. Then after this prayer, I'd like every one of us to be seated as this team leads us through until the unveiling of this. Let's pray. Our father and our God in heaven, we thank you this afternoon for your goodness that has kept us all through. We thank you for every privilege that we enjoy time and again. And we thank you for this holy Sabbath day that you give us all that we can worship you. We thank you for how you've fed us with your word since morning to this time. It's a special day for all of us as new life church that you've called us aside that we can reflect on uh building a sanctuary for you in which you will be worshiped and through it that you will lift us up till to eternity. Thank you for all that we've done through your guidance and thank you for the plans that are ahead of us of making this a realization. How we pray that you speak to us in a language that we will be able to understand that we may know the meaning of all this that we are planning to do and that we can be serious about it and that we can invite you in this so that you can help us go through until we have it realized and that we can have a crystal fountain church that in it everyone within town will see you and uh being drawn closer to you that we can worship you, dear Lord. I pray that you provide resources that are needed for this to be realized and that even as we are struggling to do all these things that dear Lord, you'll protect us from everything else that will require our resources that we may commit all this to the honor and the glory of your name. how we pray that you open doors that uh all this can be realized and that at the end of the day when we enter into this sanctuary we call upon your name and thank you for all that you've enabled us to achieve. How I pray that you will res preserve our lives all of us here and even our loved ones until we see this sanctuary there and that we can worship you from in that we can say indeed you've walked with us and you've done your wonders through our resources above it all. Oh Lord, we pray that uh through this all of us will be prepared for eternity that is soon to come and when you come all of us will be in heaven. Bless us even as you even as you forgive us of all our shortcomings and that you can hear and answer our prayers. In Jesus name we pray. Amen. Our scripture reading comes from the book of Hagi chapter 1 verse 4 to8 and I will read it in your hearing. The word of God says, "Is it time for you yourselves to dwell in your panled houses and this temple to lie in ruins? Now therefore, thus says the Lord of hosts, consider You have not, you have sown much, bring in little. You eat, but do not have enough. You drink, but you are not filled with drink. You clothe yourselves, but you are not warm. And he who earns wages earns wages to put into a bag with holes. Thus says the Lord of Hosts, "Consider your ways. Go up to the mountains and bring wood and build the temple that I may take pleasure in it and be glorified. Say the I will take you through the background and vision casting. Beloved, today we stand on sacred ground, not just physically but spiritually. Many years ago, this congregation took a bold step of faith and acquired land right here in the heart of the city. With great hope and vision, a temporary structure was put up with the expectation that a permanent sanctuary solid and worthy of our God would follow shortly. But now over 35 years have passed. Generations have come and gone in this temporary structure. Children have been born under its iron sheets. They have grown up. They were baptized, got married and some are now parents and soon grandparents still worshiping in the same place meant to be just for a season. Our elders who carry the original dream are aging. Some are retiring and some have relocated. Some have gone to rest. In and in the midst of all the question remains, what happened to the dream? What happened to the vision? What happened to the commitment to build our the crystals fountain cader in this city. This fist landally placed at the city center holds incredible potential not only for our comfort but for mission, for outreach, for soul winning. Imagine a glorious sanctuary standing here. One that calls people from every corner of the city that runs programs for children, youth, couples, the hurting, the hopeless. A place where the gospel flows like a fountain and Christ is glorified. Imagine this place becoming a disciplehip center of influence where teaching in God's way is done. A center supportive of the ministry we can serve God in every situation. Friends, we can no longer delay. The season for building has come. We must arise. Not just with talk but with our hands, with our hearts, with our sacrifices. The Crystal Fountain Cathedral, the Crystal Fountain Sanctuary, the Crystal Fountain Center of influence, depending on how you want to call it, will not just be a building. It will be our legacy. It will be a lighthouse in the city. When it is done, we look back and say, "Thus far we have come. Christ is our ebenezo. May we not pass this battle to the next generation as an unfinished assignment in business. But may we rise now and say together, let us rise and build. And now the unveiling of the 3D model which signifies the thoughts that have been put now that we can be able to see in a very simple way our thank you. We decided that it be a 3D model so that you can come have a look, make your comments and then we will do a final model that will form the part of what will become of the three of the of the 2 acre plot development for on the fifthong Avenue. So the unveiling proceeds and there we are. Ladies and gentlemen, this is the crystal fountain sanctuary or center or cathedral. We want to thank God and today we open it in the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit. Let's all say a big amen. Amen. Amen. Elder. Beloved, today we mark a sacred milestone. As we unveil the model of the Crystal Fountain Cathedral, we do not just reveal a structure, but we reveal a vision, a vision of worship, a vision of impact, and a vision of a dwelling place for God in the heart of the city. The Lord said to Hagi, "Go up the mountains and bring down timber and build my house so that I may take pleasure in it and be honored." Saints, behold the model of development vision of the fifth Gong Avenue and particularly the crystal fountain cathedral here. A house for his glory. You are not even saying amen. Thank you. Happy Sabbath. Happy day. Happy. This architectural masterpiece proposed will be uh occupying these two plots that we occupy right now. May I concentrate on the church, the the sanctuary. It will have a sitting auditorium, the big sitting auditori will take between 3,000 and 5,000 people. And we have three other small auditorium that will sit between 150 and 400 people. Three. The reason why we thought of proposing three smaller auditori is because at times we have had to have children church service in our open uh tent and there will come a time when the youths will want to have their own church service unique to themselves and we may be having visiting visitors who are doing a retreat and can have their quiet auditorium where they can do their own service. This structure will have three basements that will take 700 cars packed at one time so that the ground floor is open to green areas and these buildings. There will be so many other activities that will take place. A library and a museum. a museum that will have the history of our church right from when the our father started our SDA church, the library both physical and virtual and very many other activities like the pastor's offices and very many rooms that will be used as class classes for our lesson discussions and classes for our children. I want to now welcome my colleague technical uh expert also Elder Osar to make comments. Brothers and sisters uh I know many questions are coming in your minds and uh as Elariki is explaining very clearly and emphasizing on the sanctuary, people are asking questions that why maybe the other tall building on the side. And um the reality of the matter is we are in a very prime piece of land in the city where we need to build something that worth the area that we are in. The question comes where do we get the money to build this structure that has been presented here the sanctuary would cost something in the region of 500 to 600 million shillings. Now we ask ourselves how do we finance it? There are three options that we can do as a church. We can give by way of fundraising or giving As a church we can go into debt financing. As a church we can go into equity. Now which option can work better for us? I know if we decided as a church we had 500 families each family giving us 1 million we will start building tomorrow. That is an option on the table. There is also an option that we go into Blay Stan get 500 million shillings that's what I call debt and then come and build but as those as we all know when you get into debt there is an obligation of monthly payments that will be very difficult. Then that comes the other option of equity where we partner. But does that not release us from the obligation of giving? Because the more giving of fundraising you have, the more or the less equity that you will require. If as a church we raised 1 billion and we want to build the true structures, it means we le we need less of equity to be able to achieve the same goal. And that is why as development committee we are presenting this as an option that we mix both giving and equity. And why equity? For somebody to give us capital, there must be something of interest. If we want to build apartments and office blocks, somebody who is investing his money must get return for his money. He will not get return for his money on the church. So we need to partner with both. And one of the things that I want I also want to highlight to the church, it is important who our neighbors are. Today we know who our neighbors at the back are. We know this side. We know this side. There's an empty plot behind there. We don't know who will come and what he will build there. Now if we partner with somebody to build on this half of the plot to give us finance, we can control what will be done on this side and we may we will have peace as we build on the other side. So these are options and we want to hasten to say that this is an option that the development is presenting. The church will give us feedback. We are open to your options. But the options that we are presenting to you today is that we need to have a mix of giving and equity to be able to achieve our goal in the shortest time possible. May God bless you. Thank you. Happy Sabbath. Um, a moment has come. The men that you had nominated to take this vision and perhaps I want to ask them to stand where they are uh the committee for the development wherever you are. Maybe for those you can move a bit forward. Amidas there are men of great profession. We have uhhuh we have three here. We have Wes Linet and everybody uh we have um Elder Ben you can raise up your hand. Um thank you so much. That is the surveyor that we have um quite proven in his field. I want to say that we have engineer Osar. We have Wesley who is an architect within the team. We also have procurement and we have uh others like professor Kibu who is in the area of social considerations. Why am I bringing them within the moment that we want to fix and finalize with the designs of what needs to be done here? Please make your comments. We are going to leave a book here with a pen. If you come you can script or ask any question and all questions that you have. You can meet these men in their spaces. Ask them. We have started the consultation with the church and we have held about three meetings and we want to have more workshops to listen to everyone. Friends before you I do not want you to be intimidated. In Isaiah he says God can even give us the resources of the Gentiles to feed us. Amen. He is possible. We must now move forward from mobilization to organizing. And therefore I want to say that the days ahead of us are as follows. Perhaps in the next one or two months we should be able to conclude on the options that we want to have with the option that you have here. And after that reflecting on that consensus we will be able to then move forward to fixing how we and which way we can be able to demarcate on the financing bit. I want to thank the men who have taken a step forward and I want to have to invite Chris. Chris if you can come. There's justice Gone for the men. Is he around? Justice Please come. These men in the just the last one month have managed to get pledges of 7.1 million shillings. What do you say? A pledge is a prayer and a prayer is on the side of revelation. We must now work to achieve that. I know first elder thank you so much. He had aimed that by today he was going to get 10 million shillings. He has just got 70%. But you still get an A. He's a professor in medicine. So he gets an A. Don't you think so? Now if all of us who are seated here commit, give and for the men you now know, Chris and Gon in my mother tongue means It means a miracle. Please come. It means a miracle. So do not be intimidated at all. This is doable. We can do it. And in fact, it is God doing it. Amen. For the men. And let me dare say all the male, these two gentlemen have started the journey. Meet with them. Do not fear raising because it's a prayer and pastors already prayed and said in Mark 11:24 he says whatever you do ask and if you ask what will happen before it happens you believe and after you believe what happens I want to welcome all of you to participate in building the so cherished vision that we have had of the crystal fountain cathedral and the scent of inference in this city. May God bless you. Uh, Brother J, do you want to make any emphasis before I All right, perfect. Thank you very much. All right, we want to do a prayer of dedication. But before I do that, let me ask a simple question. How many strongly believe that this is doable for the Lord? Amen. You know in the scriptures brothers and sisters there were some Pharisees who went to the Lord and told him that this centurion deserves good stuff because he has built the Lord a synagogue. How many built a synagogue for the Lord at that time? One. And if one centurion who is a gentile was able to build the Lord a sanctuary, that was a mockery to the Pharisees, how about ourselves? Before I left Spicer Memorial College, there was one doctor who came with his family from the United States. And they built a sanctuary in Spicer Memorial College by themselves. a sanctuary that is of a capacity of 2,500 people, a balcony of about 800 and the rest down. And he did it singlehandedly with his family. I want to believe even as the team here is telling us that this is doable. I believe today, I believe strongly today, all right, that Elder Abala, if you made it that you want to do it, we will leave this whole thing by for yourself and you will do it. Somebody say amen to that. Amen. I want to believe prof even if we were to say we have left it for you. You can do the sanctuary, we do the rest and you can do it. But because we have to do it together, I pray that we may all now begin this journey. Let us say a big amen to the men that have started this journey. Amen. through the initiative of our first elder they wanted today to have 10 million as the first basket but they have said they have brought 7 is that 7.1 million 7.1 million as pledges and others have already given I know there's something cooking with the women I have the youth leader here with me elder Jerry where are you Jerry I've already calling you elder and I know that from the children department. Joffrey, things are going to get started. Allow me now to request all church members here present to kindly be up on your feet because I want to take you through a litany as a prayer. And as I do that, I want to request all the serving elders to kindly come up front here. All of you please come. All of you. So um just as you've been told we have a book that will be left here at any of your free time. Please pass by and write your comments but we're going to have a very big book that is going to be brought here. Again we want all your sentiments. You know this is not a journey that is going to be done by one person. This is not the journey for this development team alone or Dr. Moger or ourselves. This is this entire church and because of that we want to hear your comments. We want to hear your sentiments before the real thing begins. Now you're not seeing something in here but Dr. Moger whispered to me that the next that you'll be seeing will be having lights inside. Is that so? And the lights will be showing you the exact thing that will be in each of these floors. Allow me also to say this before we pray and I'm going to take you through this litany of prayer. Allow me to let you know that as our former senior pastor was leaving, Pastor Jacob Akali, he handed over to me the title deeds of this church and I they are in my custody. You you all didn't hear what I said. The title deed for this church was handed over to me and they are in my custody on behalf of God and for this church. Allow me to also let you know that I have invited special friends who are also part of us. I know that right now my good friend Elder Stemer is following us online. How many of you know Elder Stea? Uh how many of you know Elder Stimmer? Thank you. And I hope you are praying for him. Are we? Yes. I reached out to him and is following online. Elder Ratego is not here with us because of uh a challenge he had of sickness. I did speak to him. And we have also Elder Sylvester. Where are you? Please come stand here. These are one of the trustees. I want you to stand right here. I've also invited my friend and my uncle, Professor Maranga. Where are you? Please come. Please come. Come, come. Kindly come. Great. Ambassador Sam, how many of you know her? Very good. Ambassador Ser will be joining us in the month of November. We will be having a serious fundraising. Thank you very much for coming, man. Thank you very much. We will be having a serious fundraising. I know our pastor said a fundraising is for anything and any member. We want to just say this. We are putting God's resources together to build him a sanctuary. Can somebody say amen to that? Amen. This is a prayer of dedication and allow me to ask us to lift our hands. Kindly lift up your hands. All I would like you to say is let it be according to your word. Amen. Can you say that? Let it be according to your word. Amen. Shall we pray? Whilst your hands are up, loving Jesus, as you build this church, grow our faith, oh Lord, everyone. Loving Jesus, as you provide for the resources needed, increase our love to serve and hasten your kingdom congregation. Let it be according to your word. Amen. Loving Jesus, as you strengthen the foundations to hold these structures, strengthen our unity to one another. Congregation, loving Jesus, as you expand our walls, expand our ministry too to places far and abroad. congregation. Loving Jesus, as you have promised, let the gates of hell never prevail on this work, congregation. And so, heavenly father, with these hands lifted up unto you, we surrender that your will may take charge and prevenence. We commit the beginnings as we commit ourselves to you. fulfill your promise that the good work you have begun, you shall be in it until its completion in Christ Jesus. On this memory day of 5th July, the year of the Lord 2025, this work remains launched in the name of the father, the son, and the holy spirit. And we pray, heavenly father, you who has said that you will be with us until the completion of every work, now begin with us until the end of it. when we shall come back again and like Solomon stood before the temple, enable us all to stand before it. And like they dedicated it unto you in a few either months time or year's time, may we also stand to offer a sacrifice of thanksgiving. Thank you for we know you've heard and answered our prayer. God's people, may the Lord bless you and keep you. May the Lord lift up his countenance upon each one of us and be gracious to us. Amen. May he cause his face to shine upon each one of us and grant us peace. Peace now and forever. In his name we pray. Amen. God bless each one of you. Please be seated. Thank you very

TIMESTAMPED TRANSCRIPT:
[0.6s] Thank you very much. You may be seated.
[2.1s] Thank you very much and God's precious
[3.4s] blessings. Allow me to say this that uh
[6.4s] we're going to have again another very
[8.0s] short program and we still want to beg
[10.3s] your indulgence. This is what has been
[12.2s] uh we've been waiting for. But before I
[14.6s] call Eldo to come up front, allow me to
[17.9s] make mention of this that tomorrow we
[19.8s] have a music extravaganza here that is
[21.9s] starting at 9:00. We have invited
[24.2s] several choirs that are going to be
[25.7s] here. Please those of you who can find
[28.2s] time uh join with us and then I also
[31.7s] want to make an announcement that
[33.1s] probably may have uh been made in your
[34.7s] WhatsApp group and wasn't mentioned here
[37.0s] by the elder announcing that the VBS
[39.4s] parents are requested to meet on the
[41.0s] right side of this church. Immediately
[42.9s] we are done with this program. So then
[46.0s] come at the time come at the hour allow
[49.2s] me at this moment to welcome my elder
[51.7s] Elder please.
[65.8s] I would I would like to invite all those
[67.7s] who are participating in this program to
[69.5s] come up front so that we minimize on
[74.4s] time for walking.
[76.4s] They know themselves.
[103.4s] Okay. Happy Sabbath.
[105.8s] Happy Sabbath.
[116.1s] I want us to take a moment to
[120.6s] to mark a historic milestone,
[124.2s] the veiling unveiling of the model for
[126.4s] the Crystal Fountain Cathedral and the
[129.6s] official launch of our development fund
[132.7s] which has already been started by the
[134.6s] men.
[136.5s] But I want to start with a familiar
[137.9s] quote from Sister Ellen White
[141.9s] from the book Christian Experience and
[143.9s] Teachings of Ellen White page 204.
[147.5s] And it reads,
[153.2s] "In reviewing our past history,
[156.4s] having traveled over every step of
[159.8s] advance to our present standing, I can
[163.4s] say, "Praise God."
[166.9s] As I see what God has wrought, I'm
[169.9s] filled with astonishment
[172.2s] and with confidence in Christ
[175.2s] as as a leader.
[177.5s] We have nothing to fear for the future
[180.9s] except as we shall forget the way the
[184.2s] Lord has led us and his teaching in our
[187.0s] past history.
[190.3s] I take a moment
[193.8s] to reflect on our growth and movement as
[196.5s] new life 7th Adventist church. We have
[199.8s] grown from city hall to Kenya poly
[202.6s] technique to railways club and
[206.0s] ultimately to the fifth gong avenue. For
[209.1s] the pioneers who are privileged to be
[211.4s] part of these developments, you readily
[214.1s] appreciate that our settling on this
[216.6s] land was nothing short of a divine
[219.7s] miracle.
[221.8s] The God of that miracle is still on his
[224.8s] throne. Amen. Amen. The God of that
[227.7s] miracle is still on his throne and is
[230.2s] bidding us to move forward in faith.
[235.0s] While under our current building
[236.5s] structure, we have undoubtedly achieved
[239.1s] many gospel and evangelistic milestones.
[243.5s] We have set up several thriving churches
[246.6s] and Sabbath schools. We have built other
[249.2s] notable ministries in our multiple
[250.9s] chapency lines. Aside from attending to
[254.2s] our spiritual and physical needs of our
[256.3s] members,
[258.1s] church members like Nemiah Nehemiah,
[261.9s] we must now
[266.1s] like Nemiah
[269.9s] we must now
[272.5s] just a minute. We must now fairly look
[276.1s] at the work in the face. Look at
[280.0s] ourselves in the face like the builders
[282.9s] on the wall. In his time, we must take
[285.0s] fresh courage. Brethren, it is time for
[288.7s] us to reckon with the prophet Hagai's
[291.4s] challenge in the book of Hag 1:4.
[295.2s] Is it time for you to dwell in your nice
[298.3s] houses while the house of the Lord lies
[301.7s] in ruins?
[304.9s] By and by, many vision bearers are
[307.3s] fading off the scene.
[309.3s] Some have relocated to other churches.
[312.2s] Some have gone on retirement and
[314.5s] relocated to their home churches. And
[317.2s] sadly, yet inevitably some have slept
[321.1s] waiting for the second coming of Jesus
[323.0s] Christ. We have tried for a little much
[326.4s] longer than we should under the current
[328.7s] structure. We have stayed here for too
[330.6s] long.
[331.8s] The fast changing Nairobi skyline as
[334.3s] evidenced by our surrounding in the
[336.6s] neighborhood is perhaps our ultimate
[340.1s] uh wakeup call.
[346.2s] While the finer details of the project
[347.8s] are being worked out,
[350.6s] we must begin doing something
[353.4s] and today is the day. If it is not
[356.6s] today, then when?
[359.1s] If it is not you, then who?
[363.2s] African demographics show that our
[365.4s] population is youth heavy with a median
[368.1s] age of 19 years. Trends also plainly
[371.4s] show that it is rapidly urbanizing.
[374.1s] These are rapidly urbanizing continent.
[376.4s] The cities will remain key population
[378.7s] centers. Nairobi remains a global
[381.4s] regional hub for many organization
[383.2s] including our church. It is a center of
[386.1s] traffic teaming with modern church
[388.7s] facility
[390.4s] and various nationalities and classes
[393.8s] and we need to come up with a befitting
[398.6s] sanctuary for the lord as the father
[400.9s] servant of the lord said in the sermon
[403.7s] equally nairobi is being a hub of
[405.5s] knowledge and learning we must be ready
[408.3s] to attract the lord's side to the lord's
[411.2s] side many young people trooping in the
[413.4s] institutions of learning
[415.0s] looking for jobs, knowledge and skills.
[417.6s] We must work to bequit our young people
[420.6s] at charge befitting the lofty
[422.6s] aspirations to extend the Lord's work uh
[425.8s] the Lord's work globally in keeping the
[427.8s] gospel commission. My final call,
[431.1s] brothers and sisters, let each one as an
[434.8s] individual church members and as
[436.6s] families reflect on the work that lies
[439.7s] ahead.
[441.0s] Let us know we are but stewards of the
[444.2s] Lord's goods who must be found faithful
[448.2s] when we return to take accounts. Let us
[451.9s] embrace the vision and the challenge.
[454.8s] Let us rally our families. Let us rally
[458.2s] our friends to its realization.
[461.7s] It can be done in the Lord's strength in
[464.3s] a canon and by his unfailing providence
[470.6s] in the prayerful words of a national
[472.2s] anthem let me say let one and all arise
[479.8s] with hearts both strong and true.
[483.4s] May the Lord bless you.
[489.9s] Church members,
[493.5s] the exhortation was very clear. Let them
[497.9s] build me a sanctuary.
[501.3s] Let them build me a sanctuary. He would
[505.8s] have done it himself, but he has called
[508.2s] upon us to do it in his behalf. Let me
[511.5s] see all those that are saying we want to
[513.7s] be a part of those that will be in the
[515.0s] sanctuary to be up on their feet
[517.8s] to be up on their feet.
[523.2s] Then after this prayer, I'd like every
[525.1s] one of us to be seated as this team
[527.7s] leads us through until the unveiling of
[530.6s] this.
[535.0s] Let's pray. Our father and our God in
[539.0s] heaven, we thank you this afternoon for
[541.3s] your goodness that has kept us all
[544.2s] through.
[545.9s] We thank you for every privilege that we
[548.2s] enjoy time and again. And we thank you
[550.4s] for this holy Sabbath day that you give
[553.2s] us all that we can worship you. We thank
[556.4s] you for how you've fed us with your word
[558.9s] since morning to this time.
[561.4s] It's a special day for all of us as new
[564.1s] life church that you've called us aside
[567.0s] that we can reflect on uh building a
[569.9s] sanctuary for you in which you will be
[573.0s] worshiped and through it that you will
[576.1s] lift us up till to eternity.
[580.1s] Thank you for all that we've done
[582.1s] through your guidance and thank you for
[584.7s] the plans that are ahead of us of making
[587.7s] this a realization.
[590.2s] How we pray that you speak to us in a
[592.2s] language that we will be able to
[593.6s] understand
[595.1s] that we may know the meaning of all this
[597.2s] that we are planning to do and that we
[600.0s] can be serious about it and that we can
[602.3s] invite you in this so that you can help
[605.1s] us go through until we have it realized
[608.3s] and that we can have a crystal fountain
[610.7s] church that in it everyone within town
[613.9s] will see you and uh being drawn closer
[617.4s] to you that we can worship you, dear
[620.6s] Lord. I pray that you provide resources
[622.6s] that are needed for this to be realized
[625.6s] and that even as we are struggling to do
[627.6s] all these things that dear Lord, you'll
[630.4s] protect us from everything else that
[632.5s] will require our resources that we may
[635.4s] commit all this to the honor and the
[638.0s] glory of your name.
[640.1s] how we pray that you open doors that uh
[642.6s] all this can be realized and that at the
[645.6s] end of the day when we enter into this
[648.0s] sanctuary we call upon your name and
[651.4s] thank you for all that you've enabled us
[653.3s] to achieve. How I pray that you will res
[656.8s] preserve our lives all of us here and
[659.0s] even our loved ones until we see this
[661.8s] sanctuary there and that we can worship
[664.3s] you from in that we can say indeed
[667.1s] you've walked with us and you've done
[669.4s] your wonders through our resources above
[673.3s] it all. Oh Lord, we pray that uh through
[676.1s] this all of us will be prepared for
[679.6s] eternity that is soon to come and when
[682.1s] you come all of us will be in heaven.
[684.7s] Bless us even as you even as you forgive
[687.2s] us of all our shortcomings and that you
[690.3s] can hear and answer our prayers. In
[692.7s] Jesus name we pray. Amen.
[702.3s] Our
[708.8s] scripture reading comes from the book of
[710.7s] Hagi chapter 1 verse 4 to8 and I will
[714.2s] read it in your hearing. The word of God
[716.6s] says, "Is it time for you yourselves to
[720.2s] dwell in your panled houses and this
[723.5s] temple to lie in ruins? Now therefore,
[727.4s] thus says the Lord of hosts, consider
[732.1s] You have not, you have sown much, bring
[734.7s] in little. You eat, but do not have
[738.1s] enough. You drink, but you are not
[741.5s] filled with drink. You clothe
[743.6s] yourselves, but you are not warm. And he
[747.0s] who earns wages earns wages to put into
[751.0s] a bag with holes. Thus says the Lord of
[754.6s] Hosts, "Consider your ways. Go up to the
[757.7s] mountains and bring wood and build the
[761.1s] temple that I may take pleasure in it
[764.9s] and be glorified. Say the
[772.1s] I will take you through the background
[774.5s] and vision casting.
[776.9s] Beloved, today we stand on sacred
[779.6s] ground, not just physically but
[782.6s] spiritually.
[784.1s] Many years ago, this congregation took a
[787.1s] bold step of faith and acquired land
[790.1s] right here in the heart of the city.
[793.0s] With great hope and vision, a temporary
[796.2s] structure was put up with the
[798.1s] expectation that a permanent sanctuary
[801.2s] solid and worthy of our God would follow
[804.6s] shortly. But now over 35 years have
[809.6s] passed.
[818.8s] Generations have come and gone in this
[822.8s] temporary
[824.6s] structure. Children have been born under
[827.7s] its iron sheets. They have grown up.
[831.7s] They were baptized,
[834.0s] got married and some are now parents and
[837.8s] soon grandparents
[840.1s] still worshiping in the same place meant
[844.1s] to be just for a season.
[851.0s] Our
[856.1s] elders who carry the original dream are
[860.2s] aging. Some are retiring and some have
[864.1s] relocated.
[865.7s] Some have gone to rest. In and in the
[870.3s] midst of all the question remains, what
[875.4s] happened to the dream? What happened to
[878.9s] the vision? What happened to the
[881.8s] commitment to build our the crystals
[887.8s] fountain cader
[890.6s] in this city.
[897.2s] This fist landally
[900.1s] placed at the city center holds
[902.2s] incredible potential not only for our
[905.4s] comfort but for mission, for outreach,
[908.4s] for soul winning. Imagine a glorious
[911.4s] sanctuary standing here. One that calls
[914.2s] people from every corner of the city
[917.2s] that runs programs for children, youth,
[920.8s] couples, the hurting, the hopeless. A
[924.0s] place where the gospel flows like a
[925.8s] fountain and Christ is glorified.
[929.1s] Imagine this place becoming a
[930.5s] disciplehip center of influence where
[932.9s] teaching in God's way is done.
[936.1s] A center supportive of the ministry we
[938.4s] can serve God in every situation.
[947.8s] Friends,
[949.4s] we can no longer delay.
[952.8s] The season for building has come. We
[956.8s] must arise.
[958.9s] Not just with talk but with our hands,
[962.7s] with our hearts, with our sacrifices.
[966.7s] The Crystal Fountain Cathedral, the
[970.6s] Crystal Fountain Sanctuary, the Crystal
[973.8s] Fountain Center of influence,
[976.8s] depending on how you want to call it,
[979.0s] will not just be a building.
[981.6s] It will be our legacy. It will be a
[985.5s] lighthouse in the city. When it is done,
[989.5s] we look back and say, "Thus far we have
[992.8s] come. Christ is our ebenezo.
[996.5s] May we not pass this battle to the next
[998.9s] generation
[1000.4s] as an unfinished assignment in business.
[1004.2s] But may we rise now and say together,
[1007.1s] let us rise and build.
[1016.5s] And now the unveiling
[1019.3s] of the 3D model which signifies
[1024.6s] the thoughts
[1027.0s] that have been put now that we can be
[1030.1s] able to see in a very simple way
[1035.8s] our
[1039.4s] thank you. We decided that it be a 3D
[1042.8s] model so that you can come have a look,
[1046.4s] make your comments and then we will do a
[1049.6s] final model that will form the part of
[1053.4s] what will become of the three of the of
[1056.1s] the 2 acre plot development for on the
[1059.0s] fifthong Avenue.
[1063.6s] So the unveiling proceeds
[1073.6s] and there we are.
[1081.2s] Ladies and gentlemen,
[1083.7s] this is the crystal fountain sanctuary
[1088.2s] or center or cathedral.
[1091.4s] We want to thank God and today we open
[1094.1s] it in the name of the Father, the Son,
[1097.8s] and the Holy Spirit.
[1101.9s] Let's all say a big amen. Amen. Amen.
[1106.2s] Elder.
[1113.0s] Beloved,
[1115.8s] today we mark a sacred milestone.
[1119.7s] As we unveil the model of the Crystal
[1122.0s] Fountain Cathedral,
[1124.6s] we do not just reveal a structure,
[1128.2s] but we reveal a vision,
[1131.3s] a vision of worship,
[1134.2s] a vision of impact,
[1137.4s] and a vision of a dwelling place for God
[1140.5s] in the heart of the city.
[1143.4s] The Lord said to Hagi,
[1146.8s] "Go up the mountains and bring down
[1150.2s] timber and build my house so that I may
[1153.7s] take pleasure in it and be honored."
[1158.1s] Saints,
[1160.6s] behold the model of development vision
[1163.1s] of the fifth Gong Avenue and
[1166.2s] particularly the crystal fountain
[1168.6s] cathedral here. A house
[1172.3s] for his glory.
[1178.2s] You are not even saying amen.
[1182.2s] Thank you.
[1188.0s] Happy Sabbath.
[1190.1s] Happy day. Happy. This architectural
[1193.5s] masterpiece proposed
[1196.5s] will be uh occupying these two plots
[1201.5s] that we occupy right now. May I
[1204.6s] concentrate on the church, the the
[1207.7s] sanctuary.
[1210.0s] It will have a sitting auditorium,
[1214.3s] the big sitting auditori will take
[1217.6s] between 3,000 and 5,000 people.
[1221.4s] And we have three other small auditorium
[1224.9s] that will sit between
[1227.8s] 150 and 400 people. Three. The reason
[1231.4s] why we thought of proposing three
[1234.3s] smaller auditori is because at times we
[1238.5s] have had to have children church service
[1242.5s] in our open uh tent and there will come
[1247.3s] a time when the youths will want to have
[1249.8s] their own church service unique to
[1252.7s] themselves and we may be having visiting
[1256.2s] visitors who are doing a retreat and can
[1260.2s] have their quiet auditorium where they
[1262.6s] can do their own service. This structure
[1266.5s] will have three basements that will take
[1269.8s] 700 cars packed at one time so that the
[1274.7s] ground floor is open to green areas and
[1278.8s] these buildings. There will be so many
[1281.2s] other activities that will take place. A
[1283.8s] library and a museum. a museum that will
[1286.3s] have the history of our church right
[1288.3s] from when the our father started our SDA
[1291.1s] church, the library both physical and
[1294.6s] virtual and very many other activities
[1298.1s] like the pastor's offices and very many
[1301.7s] rooms that will be used as class classes
[1305.3s] for our lesson discussions and classes
[1308.4s] for our children. I want to now welcome
[1312.1s] my colleague technical uh expert also
[1315.8s] Elder Osar to make comments.
[1321.0s] Brothers and sisters uh I know many
[1324.4s] questions are coming in your minds and
[1326.7s] uh as Elariki is explaining very clearly
[1332.7s] and emphasizing on the sanctuary,
[1336.7s] people are asking questions that why
[1339.8s] maybe the other tall building on the
[1341.7s] side.
[1345.1s] And um the reality of the matter is
[1348.8s] we are in a very prime piece of land
[1352.9s] in the city
[1355.1s] where we need to build something that
[1357.3s] worth the area that we are in.
[1360.6s] The question comes
[1363.8s] where do we get the money to build this
[1368.3s] structure that has been presented here
[1372.1s] the sanctuary would cost something in
[1374.4s] the region of 500 to 600 million
[1376.6s] shillings.
[1378.7s] Now we ask ourselves how do we finance
[1380.7s] it? There are three options that we can
[1383.6s] do as a church. We can give by way of
[1388.1s] fundraising or giving
[1391.0s] As a church we can go into debt
[1393.8s] financing.
[1395.7s] As a church we can go into equity.
[1400.0s] Now which option can work better for us?
[1405.0s] I know if we decided as a church we had
[1408.5s] 500 families each family giving us 1
[1412.1s] million
[1414.2s] we will start building tomorrow. That is
[1416.2s] an option on the table.
[1419.3s] There is also an option that we go into
[1422.9s] Blay Stan get 500 million shillings
[1425.7s] that's what I call debt
[1428.2s] and then come and build but as those as
[1431.0s] we all know when you get into debt there
[1434.5s] is an obligation of monthly payments
[1438.1s] that will be very difficult. Then that
[1441.5s] comes the other option of equity
[1444.6s] where we partner.
[1447.2s] But does that not release us from the
[1451.3s] obligation of giving? Because the more
[1454.3s] giving of fundraising you have, the more
[1457.8s] or the less equity that you will
[1460.8s] require. If as a church we raised 1
[1464.7s] billion and we want to build the true
[1467.0s] structures, it means we le we need less
[1470.8s] of equity to be able to achieve the same
[1473.2s] goal. And that is why as development
[1475.5s] committee we are presenting this as an
[1478.4s] option that we mix both giving and
[1483.0s] equity.
[1484.8s] And why equity? For somebody to give us
[1488.2s] capital,
[1489.8s] there must be something of interest. If
[1492.2s] we want to build apartments and office
[1494.0s] blocks,
[1495.6s] somebody who is investing his money must
[1498.4s] get return for his money. He will not
[1501.0s] get return for his money on the church.
[1504.2s] So we need to partner with both. And one
[1507.7s] of the things that I want I also want to
[1509.6s] highlight to the church, it is important
[1512.5s] who our neighbors are.
[1515.5s] Today we know who our neighbors at the
[1517.7s] back are. We know this side. We know
[1521.1s] this side. There's an empty plot behind
[1523.9s] there. We don't know who will come and
[1526.8s] what he will build there. Now if we
[1529.7s] partner with somebody to build on this
[1532.6s] half of the plot to give us finance, we
[1535.4s] can control what will be done on this
[1537.9s] side
[1539.7s] and we may we will have peace as we
[1541.8s] build on the other side. So these are
[1544.1s] options and we want to hasten to say
[1547.0s] that this is an option that the
[1550.2s] development is presenting. The church
[1553.0s] will give us feedback. We are open to
[1556.0s] your options. But the options that we
[1558.3s] are presenting to you today is that we
[1560.6s] need to have a mix of giving and equity
[1564.4s] to be able to achieve our goal in the
[1566.9s] shortest time possible. May God bless
[1569.2s] you.
[1572.2s] Thank you. Happy Sabbath.
[1575.4s] Um,
[1577.8s] a moment has come.
[1580.6s] The men that you had
[1583.7s] nominated to take this vision and
[1586.6s] perhaps I want to ask them to stand
[1588.2s] where they are uh the committee for the
[1592.2s] development wherever you are. Maybe for
[1594.6s] those you can move a bit forward. Amidas
[1599.0s] there are men of great profession. We
[1600.9s] have
[1605.4s] uhhuh we have three here. We have Wes
[1607.5s] Linet and everybody uh we have um Elder
[1611.4s] Ben you can raise up your hand. Um thank
[1615.5s] you so much. That is the surveyor that
[1617.4s] we have um quite proven in his field. I
[1621.4s] want to say that we have engineer Osar.
[1624.7s] We have Wesley who is an architect
[1627.3s] within the team. We also have
[1628.8s] procurement and we have uh others like
[1632.4s] professor Kibu who is in the area of
[1634.9s] social considerations. Why am I bringing
[1637.7s] them within the moment that we want to
[1640.6s] fix and finalize with the designs of
[1643.4s] what needs to be done here? Please make
[1645.8s] your comments.
[1647.8s] We are going to leave a book here with a
[1650.4s] pen. If you come you can script or ask
[1653.3s] any question and all questions that you
[1655.7s] have.
[1657.3s] You can meet these men in their spaces.
[1660.1s] Ask them. We have started the
[1662.5s] consultation with the church and we have
[1664.3s] held about three meetings and we want to
[1667.0s] have more workshops to listen to
[1668.6s] everyone.
[1671.0s] Friends before you I do not want you to
[1674.2s] be intimidated. In Isaiah he says God
[1678.9s] can even give us the resources of the
[1681.5s] Gentiles to feed us. Amen. He is
[1685.5s] possible. We must now move forward from
[1689.0s] mobilization to organizing.
[1692.2s] And therefore I want to say that the
[1693.8s] days ahead of us are as follows. Perhaps
[1698.7s] in the next one or two months we should
[1701.6s] be able to conclude on the options that
[1704.2s] we want to have with the option that you
[1706.5s] have here. And after that reflecting on
[1709.0s] that consensus we will be able to then
[1712.0s] move forward to fixing how we and which
[1716.8s] way we can be able to demarcate on the
[1719.6s] financing bit. I want to thank the men
[1724.1s] who have taken a step forward and I want
[1728.6s] to have to invite Chris. Chris if you
[1730.6s] can come. There's justice Gone for the
[1734.2s] men. Is he around? Justice
[1738.6s] Please come.
[1740.6s] These men in the just the last one month
[1743.8s] have managed to get pledges
[1746.6s] of 7.1 million shillings. What do you
[1749.6s] say?
[1751.6s] A pledge is a prayer
[1754.5s] and a prayer is on the side of
[1756.2s] revelation. We must now work to achieve
[1760.8s] that. I know first elder thank you so
[1762.9s] much. He had aimed that by today he was
[1766.1s] going to get 10 million shillings. He
[1768.3s] has just got 70%. But you still get an
[1771.8s] A.
[1773.4s] He's a professor in medicine. So he gets
[1775.8s] an A. Don't you think so? Now if all of
[1778.6s] us who are seated here commit,
[1782.9s] give and for the men you now know, Chris
[1788.3s] and Gon in my mother tongue means
[1794.5s] It means a miracle. Please come. It
[1797.8s] means a miracle. So do not be
[1801.1s] intimidated at all.
[1803.8s] This is doable. We can do it. And in
[1807.4s] fact, it is God doing it. Amen. For the
[1811.3s] men. And let me dare say all the male,
[1816.0s] these two gentlemen have started the
[1818.7s] journey. Meet with them. Do not fear
[1821.8s] raising
[1823.9s] because it's a prayer and pastors
[1826.2s] already prayed and said in Mark 11:24
[1830.8s] he says whatever you do ask and if you
[1833.9s] ask what will happen before it happens
[1836.7s] you believe and after you believe what
[1838.9s] happens I want to welcome all of you to
[1842.1s] participate in building the so cherished
[1846.2s] vision that we have had of the crystal
[1847.9s] fountain cathedral and the scent of
[1849.9s] inference
[1850.9s] in this city. May God bless you.
[1858.8s] Uh, Brother J, do you want to make any
[1860.7s] emphasis before I
[1863.7s] All right, perfect. Thank you very much.
[1866.2s] All right, we want to do a prayer of
[1869.5s] dedication.
[1871.0s] But before I do that, let me ask a
[1873.6s] simple question. How many strongly
[1876.4s] believe that this is doable for the
[1878.6s] Lord?
[1880.2s] Amen. You know in the scriptures
[1882.2s] brothers and sisters there were some
[1884.6s] Pharisees who went to the Lord and told
[1887.2s] him that this centurion
[1890.2s] deserves good stuff because he has built
[1894.2s] the Lord a synagogue. How many built a
[1897.6s] synagogue for the Lord at that time?
[1899.7s] One. And if one centurion who is a
[1902.8s] gentile was able to build the Lord a
[1905.4s] sanctuary, that was a mockery to the
[1907.6s] Pharisees, how about ourselves? Before I
[1911.0s] left Spicer Memorial College, there was
[1913.3s] one doctor who came with his family from
[1915.0s] the United States. And they built a
[1917.9s] sanctuary in Spicer Memorial College by
[1920.9s] themselves. a sanctuary that is of a
[1925.1s] capacity of 2,500
[1927.3s] people, a balcony of about 800 and the
[1929.8s] rest down. And he did it singlehandedly
[1933.0s] with his family. I want to believe even
[1935.0s] as the team here is telling us that this
[1937.0s] is doable. I believe today, I believe
[1939.8s] strongly today, all right, that Elder
[1942.6s] Abala, if you made it that you want to
[1945.0s] do it, we will leave this whole thing by
[1947.5s] for yourself and you will do it.
[1949.7s] Somebody say amen to that. Amen. I want
[1952.0s] to believe prof
[1956.9s] even if we were to say we have left it
[1958.6s] for you. You can do the sanctuary, we do
[1961.0s] the rest and you can do it. But because
[1965.1s] we have to do it together, I pray that
[1968.1s] we may all now begin this journey. Let
[1971.0s] us say a big amen to the men that have
[1973.0s] started this journey. Amen.
[1975.9s] through the initiative of our first
[1978.0s] elder they wanted today to have 10
[1980.8s] million as the first basket but they
[1984.7s] have said they have brought 7 is that
[1987.9s] 7.1 million 7.1 million as pledges and
[1991.6s] others have already given I know there's
[1994.0s] something cooking with the women I have
[1996.5s] the youth leader here with me elder
[1998.0s] Jerry where are you Jerry I've already
[1999.4s] calling you elder
[2002.7s] and I know that from the children
[2005.2s] department. Joffrey, things are going to
[2007.3s] get started. Allow me now to request all
[2010.4s] church members here present to kindly be
[2013.6s] up on your feet because I want to take
[2016.2s] you through a litany as a prayer. And as
[2019.0s] I do that, I want to request all the
[2023.0s] serving elders to kindly come up front
[2026.3s] here. All of you please come. All of
[2028.5s] you.
[2037.8s] So um just as you've been told we have a
[2042.4s] book that will be left here at any of
[2044.8s] your free time. Please pass by and write
[2048.5s] your comments but we're going to have a
[2049.8s] very big book that is going to be
[2051.2s] brought here. Again we want all your
[2053.2s] sentiments. You know this is not a
[2054.6s] journey that is going to be done by one
[2056.4s] person. This is not the journey for this
[2058.7s] development team alone or Dr. Moger or
[2061.0s] ourselves. This is this entire church
[2065.3s] and because of that we want to hear your
[2067.1s] comments. We want to hear your
[2068.7s] sentiments before the real thing begins.
[2071.4s] Now you're not seeing something in here
[2073.5s] but Dr. Moger whispered to me that the
[2076.3s] next that you'll be seeing will be
[2078.6s] having lights inside. Is that so? And
[2081.4s] the lights will be showing you the exact
[2083.2s] thing that will be in each of these
[2084.6s] floors. Allow me also to say this before
[2087.4s] we pray and I'm going to take you
[2088.4s] through this litany of prayer. Allow me
[2091.0s] to let you know that as our
[2095.4s] former senior pastor was leaving, Pastor
[2097.5s] Jacob Akali, he handed over to me the
[2102.6s] title deeds of this church
[2106.0s] and I they are in my custody.
[2109.3s] You you all didn't hear what I said. The
[2112.2s] title deed for this church was handed
[2114.0s] over to me and they are in my custody on
[2117.3s] behalf of God and for this church. Allow
[2120.6s] me to also let you know that I have
[2123.0s] invited special friends who are also
[2125.7s] part of us. I know that right now my
[2128.5s] good friend Elder Stemer is following us
[2131.4s] online. How many of you know Elder Stea?
[2139.8s] Uh how many of you know Elder Stimmer?
[2142.8s] Thank you. And I hope you are praying
[2144.2s] for him. Are we? Yes. I reached out to
[2147.0s] him and is following online. Elder
[2148.7s] Ratego is not here with us because of uh
[2151.9s] a challenge he had of sickness. I did
[2154.0s] speak to him. And we have also Elder
[2157.5s] Sylvester. Where are you? Please come
[2160.2s] stand here. These are one of the
[2161.8s] trustees. I want you to stand right
[2163.4s] here. I've also invited my friend and my
[2166.8s] uncle, Professor Maranga. Where are you?
[2168.6s] Please come.
[2170.6s] Please come. Come, come. Kindly come.
[2174.2s] Great. Ambassador Sam, how many of you
[2177.5s] know her?
[2180.1s] Very good. Ambassador Ser will be
[2182.2s] joining us in the month of November. We
[2185.8s] will be having a serious fundraising.
[2189.4s] Thank you very much for coming, man.
[2190.7s] Thank you very much. We will be having a
[2192.8s] serious fundraising.
[2195.2s] I know our pastor said a fundraising is
[2198.6s] for anything and any member.
[2201.5s] We want to just say this. We are putting
[2204.6s] God's resources together to build him a
[2208.5s] sanctuary. Can somebody say amen to
[2211.0s] that? Amen.
[2216.9s] This is a prayer of dedication and allow
[2221.5s] me to ask us to lift our hands. Kindly
[2226.2s] lift up your hands. All I would like you
[2228.2s] to say is let it be according to your
[2231.2s] word. Amen. Can you say that? Let it be
[2234.5s] according to your word. Amen. Shall we
[2237.2s] pray?
[2238.7s] Whilst your hands are up,
[2241.3s] loving Jesus,
[2243.4s] as you build this church, grow our
[2247.0s] faith, oh Lord, everyone.

[2256.5s] resources needed, increase our love to
[2259.0s] serve and hasten your kingdom

[2263.4s] your word. Amen. Loving Jesus, as you
[2267.4s] strengthen the foundations to hold these
[2269.4s] structures, strengthen our unity to one
[2272.3s] another. Congregation,
[2277.3s] loving Jesus, as you expand our walls,
[2280.9s] expand our ministry too to places far
[2284.3s] and abroad. congregation.
[2289.8s] Loving Jesus, as you have promised, let
[2293.8s] the gates of hell never prevail on this
[2296.6s] work, congregation.
[2301.4s] And so, heavenly father, with these
[2302.9s] hands lifted up unto you, we surrender
[2305.9s] that your will may take charge and
[2307.8s] prevenence. We commit the beginnings as
[2311.0s] we commit ourselves to you. fulfill your
[2313.8s] promise that the good work you have
[2315.8s] begun, you shall be in it until its
[2319.0s] completion in Christ Jesus. On this
[2322.6s] memory day of 5th July, the year of the
[2325.3s] Lord 2025,
[2327.6s] this work remains launched in the name
[2330.1s] of the father, the son, and the holy
[2331.6s] spirit. And we pray, heavenly father,

[2337.7s] us until the completion of every work,

[2345.0s] Solomon stood before the temple, enable
[2348.2s] us all to stand before it. And like they
[2350.6s] dedicated it unto you in a few either
[2353.6s] months time or year's time, may we also
[2356.2s] stand to offer a sacrifice of
[2357.9s] thanksgiving. Thank you for we know
[2359.9s] you've heard and answered our prayer.
