FULL TRANSCRIPT:
[Music] Let's bow our heads and let's pray. Father in heaven, in the next few minutes, we want to introduce our work for this week. We pray for your presence. We pray for your leading. Let this brief moment set the tone for a week long journey on how we can put an onslaught on the campus. In Jesus's name, we have prayed. Amen. as I always do. It was Jesus himself who said, "If you continue in my words, then you are my disciples indeed and you shall know the truth and the truth shall set you free. If the son set you free, you will be free indeed." Can you say an amen out there? I make to you four promises and throughout the week I will do so. Promise number one is the Bible is going to be the bedrock of our study. The reason is the Bible means what it says and says what it means. Promise number two, you shall be enlightened irrespective of who you are. Promise number three, you shall be challenged to make the most important decision of your life. And promise number four, your life and my our lives will never be the same. for this evening. The brief introduction I caption it the forgotten battlefield and I subheaded it why campus ministries hold the future of the church. Take time the forgotten battlefield. Why campus ministries hold the future of the church. This evening what I intend to do is I want to make you miserable then you will go home so that we can decode tomorrow. So my goal this afternoon or late afternoon is to give you a headache. You go home with a headache. We end the Sabbath with a headache and then you start asking question then tomorrow we'll begin to debrief. In the words of Charles Malik, Charles Malik is the former uh president of the United Nations General Assembly, I quote, "The university is the clearcut falcrum with which to move the world more potently than any other means. Change the university and you will change the world. Take time. The university is the clearcut falcrum, is the pivot with which to move the world. More importantly than any other means, change the university and you will change the world. Period. In this statement, this diplomat is saying any organization, any institution, any group who is interested in changing the world where they need to focus is not just the cities. It's not just the community. The compass is the key thing. Now, there is a crisis in our church. And the crisis will give you a headache. Majority of 7th Day Adventist young people, they leave the church either before university or immediately after university. Data number one, we call it attrition rate. 68% of Adventist youth they stop active church involvement during or after the university. This is a data by the Andrew University. A whole work was done published by the review and herald. In excent 68% of the current members at New Life Church, chances are that immediately or sooner after leaving university, they will leave the church or they may even leave before they go to the university. It will interest you to know that there is what we call disengagement rate. Nearly 70% of young people 18 to 35 years old, they disengage from the Adventist church. So the ages 18 to 35, the church is losing about 70% of 18 years to 35 years. And guess what? With this happening within our fields across the world, we gather every Sabbath and it is the same music, is the same story, is the same Sabbath school, more of the same. And the church is behaving as if nothing is going wrong. Ladies and gentlemen, allow me to state that 40 to 50% according to Roger L. Dudley, he wrote a book titled Why Our Teenagers Leave the Church. He's a 7th day Adventist altar scholar 40 to 50% of Adventist youth they leave the church in their 20s. So if you see every 10 Adventist young person between the ages of 19 to 29, chances are that five or four of them very soon before they get into 30 years, they will stop the church. You you need to read that book. Why our teenagers leave the church? It's a 10 years studies personal stories and the rest of them and parents are still eating ugali they are still eating chapati and it is business as usual. The choir is still singing the same song, the same sabbath school, the same divine service, the same ayat change direction, the same thing. Are you aware that only 37% of public high school SDA graduate remain in the church 13 years later? only 37%. In essence, we are losing about 63 of this critical church members. If I were to have time, I would have broken us into groups and you will analyze that graph on the table on your screen. The Adventist youth disengagement trend. This afternoon after divine service I started pulling it together to see just to give a summary. Hear me. We are in danger as a church. Let me say it one more time. We are in danger as a church. And it is in this lie I titled the first session the forgotten battlefield. Why tempest ministries hold the future of the church. Let me remind you again. Charles Malik, former president of the United Nations, the university is the clearcut falcrum with which to move the world. More importantly than any other means, change the university and you will change the world. As if this statement is not enough, we have a department, a directorate at the GC, the general conference called uh archives and stuff. Our director for archives as a church is David JB Trim. He's a historian. He's an archavist. He's an educ educationist or an educator. He says, and I quote, "62.5% of those who left the SDA church, they started uh they stated that they were young adult when they ceased being church members." He added, "The data is clear. The remnant is an endangered species. The data is clear. The remnant of Bible prophecy is an endangered species. In except in the few years to come, we are already having more former SDAs than current SDAs. Let me say it one more time. for the director and the director of archives at the general conference to say the church is an endangered species. He is saying in effect the church is at the verge of being extinct. If we are endangered where why are we endangered and it's as if look he says 50 to 70% of disengagement people who have lost interest they don't care they don't think even about SDA and this kind of thing they have disen 50 to 70% of the disengagement rate of post high senior high secondary individuals North in the global north and people say that oh it is the global north when we have been analyzing the data they say no it's the global north the global north is the industrialized world north America Europe the Caribbean and and and and all those fields including sometimes southern America so they said it doesn't apply to Africa the data you are quoting doesn't apply to Africa we are not in trouble as you are suggesting. He further says the 7th day Adventist church is losing its young people. This is true virtually everywhere. I am quoting the director of the general conference archives. The 7th Day Adventist Church is losing its young people. This is true virtually everywhere. Though it is particularly true in the global north of economically advanced secular countries with postmodern or post religious cultures but it's a fact everywhere our children are living our faith. In the year 20 2007, Jean Pollson was in Cameroon with a youth engagement with young people in Cameroon and he says and I paraphrase him in the next 15 years. I doubt if there will be a church identity. 2007 the GC president was care the rate at which they are looking into the crystal ball what the data is saying in 2007 2008 he says in 15 years time he doubted if there will ever be a church reason the young people are leaving our church so new life you Can you can do all the crusades you think all the major churches in the city on the continent you can do all the crusade you think. This is the reason why if you really mean business as a church this week we better be here because it is going to be revealing and we are going to it's not your usual revival. It is a seminar. It's intriguing. It will be life transforming. We're going to pull the Bible data, the writings of Ellen Y. And we are going to develop a framework. How do we arrest the spiritual declivity among the young people? Mothers are cried, pastor, pray for my daughter, pray for my son, pray for this. And the church is doing the same thing she has done from 1990s till date. And yet we want to get a different result. It's a joke. Hear me loud. While this is happening, the GC leader says some leaders are doing things differently. I'll say this quickly in person. There are places in many divisions where church leaders prefer simply not to record the losses, he admits. But closing our eyes to that is no substitute for closing the back door. So instead of reporting those who are leaving when we do crusade what we do or evangelistic campaign we in on the books huge membership but in reality fake data. The director of the general conference archives says literally we are lying. Could it be I'm asking a question. Quote me very well. Could it be our mission reports are not premised on fact? Who are we deceiving? Revelation 3 says, "And to the angel of the church of the loudation, write these things, says, Amen. the faithful and true witness." I wish I had time. Look, I'm talking about the forgotten battlefield. Why Campus Ministries holds the future of the church. The center for creativity ministry 2018 report on Adventist young adult retention. This is the verdict. It's a a sponsored research. Any it's not just university student. Those who are professionals any educated person is leaving our church. I read young professionals with higher education levels are more likely to leave or disengage from the church citing issues of relevance and connection to real world concern. The educated class are no more attracted to a church with the most educated message of all time. It's paradoxical intelligent message yet intelligent people are living and guess what we will eat the same ugali and chapati and it's the same business the same camp meeting and nobody is asking the question how do we solve the problem Do you know that 35% of young Adventist professionals, the bankers, the engineers, the doctors, the lecturers and the rest of them, the CEOs, they 35% of them site social political issues as a reason for distancing from the church feeling the church's stand is outdated or disconnected from societal concern and the church is saying what do you also know that nearly 60% of young professionals they report that they find the SDA church teachings and activities irrelevant to their daily lives and their careers. This is a document by the North American Division Millennial Engagement Report 2017. 60% of professionals reported in a field that look the messages, the teachings, they are irrelevant to their daily lives and their careers. Look, this one nearly gave me heart attack. Among young Adventist professionals, 48% express difficulties reconciling traditional church doctrines with modern professional life, leading some of them to disengage. So the mark of the beast, the sanctuary service, the investigative judgment and all its teachings, the young professionals, the intelligential, the professional, this is not just the student, even the working class who are the brilliant one. They said we can't connect them. We can't connect them. We are in crisis. I want to stop here. What's the time? My garden watch is deceiving me. Come again. 4:30. I'm scared for my daughter. She'll be 13 years in September. I'm scared for the teenagers. Will there be a church they will identify with? This is the reason this week we want to think and brainstorm about the campus. I I've not even started this presentation. I've only done 5% of even this very presentation. So what I want us to do is there are multiplicity of factors. Look, I can tell you one minute. Let me make this case and let's pray. Look, while we are we are not sure of all what we are talking about. Do you know how the charismatic Pentecostal churches grew historically? The charismatic Pentecostal churches grew from four key dimensions. Let me give them to you quickly. Number one, the if you see what we call the charismatic Pentecostal wave, they use campus ministries, four things, church leaders to reach and influential lay leaders, the professionals who are now leaving our churches. And then they use energetic and educated students. And then the third group they used was the or the fourth criteria was the popularization of the grassroots level of the science and wonders movement. This is how the charismatic churches grew. Now watch the charismatic churches for the past 30 years check the history in Africa and for the past 40 years they have seen some unprecedented growth that I have the data. Look, they are focused now. Some of them have abandoned their main churches and they are on the campus. The pastors are on the campus. Let me give you some quotes from some of the leading charismatic pastors from West Africa and the rest. Some of the key statement they make. One says, "Our goal is to bring Jesus to the universities and the universities will take Jesus to the workplace and then the streets and the villages." Our obsessed passion, the name of the church is lighthouse is campus ministries and healing crusades. We will fund the campus ministry and it will plow back to move us to the next level. This is a policy direction by a church that has decided that there will be an onslaught on campus. One charismatic pastor says the future of our ministry is the impact and investment we make today on the tertiary campuses. Some denominations as if he's talking about my church are rural centered. We will use the upper class to impact rural ministries. Another says, "The Lord has laid on my heart to have a strategic spiritual takeover by taking hostage of the institutions of higher learning. Give me 100 committed and spiritual university students and the future of our ministry will be like wildfire. Let the heavens twist in our favor for the souls of student." So you take the 10 richest pastors in the whole world. Five are from West Africa. And do you know what they did? Campus ministries. Campus ministries. And as if look as if that was not enough. As if that was not enough. Look if you take Islam I can tell you Islam non-religious groups they are investing on the universities look they normalize their beliefs in curriculum and culture be it Islam LGBTQ everybody knows if you want to survive focus on university be it politician be it a religious be it everybody is looking for students. So what they do is Islamic humanists, LGBTQ and the eastern spiritualists are now in spending millions on the campuses to share their beliefs to lecturers, philosophers, educationists. And guess what we are doing? We are still singing coming again without contextualizing it to the universities. Look, I can take you they fund student influence strategically. Muslims organization, global foundation, secular groups, they sponsor fellowship events. They give scholarship as a way. I'm not talking about even rel Christian groups. So these are non-Christian groups, Eastern mystical religions, Buddhism, atheism and its bewitching influence. This is what they are doing. They reframe what we call identity and belonging. LGBTQ communities create powerful tribes and safe spaces that offer belonging before belief. Don't you don't believe in LGBTQ. It's okay. Just belong. They are being thoughtful and we are still studying Sabah school the normal way. You go to our universities. I have been the campus ministry director for my union before I in deliberately resign. Hear me. It is wild out there and sometimes you wonder is my church aware what is happening. Look some of this Muslim group, Buddhist group and the rest they empower student leaders very early. the cults, the activist groups, the mentor and mobilize students in their first semester, they they run after them. We believe they will go and come back. It's a lie. Whilst we are still doing normal public campaign, they are using documentaries and they are using storytelling to shape world views. They are investing in movies and the rest of it guys we have been priced out of the market. So this week your church is a strategic church the whole SDA church worldwide Africa holds the key. It's not Europe. It's not North America. It's not South America. It is Africa. When we are talking about campus ministries, North America with the greatest of respect, it is Africa. Europe doesn't know what it is. And this is the reason. How come we are growing? Every 10 Adventists you see in the world, four are from Africa. Yet somebody will come and tell us how to win the world. You can't win Europe. You can't win. Now we will sit down as zombies. We are stupid. We don't know anything. You will come and teach us. Go and evangelize Europe. We hold the future. And we need to begin to tell our daughters and our sons 15 years, 16 years. We need to sit down. So this week we want to reclaim our members. We want to redeem our children and we want to restore Adventism in its height. Somebody should say an amen to that one. So I want to charge you. It is not a usual revival thing. We are in crisis. So if you permit I will have called it a crisis meeting. We want to solve a problem. So we would depend heavily on data. We would depend heavily on the Bible. We will pray and we are going to ask the Lord what do we do if new life doesn't get it right with campus ministries. Kenya is gone. I've done my checks. You are the citadel of campus ministries. A lot of university students have been speaking to me. They see you as their citadel. And during the week, I'm going to show you how that will be to your economic advantage as a church, your membership retention as a church. So, I welcome you to a week-long program where we will pray, where we will think. And I just want to ask a question. How many persons want to be at the center stage of this week-long program? Let me see your hand. We don't need a lot of numbers. Hands down. You see I we I prefer 10 people who want to think along. How many persons feel God's will? Maybe there is something we need to do. Even your own children this week will help you. How your children will not shipwreck? They will not leave the church. How the young people in your household, they will not leave the church. And I want to ask a question. How many persons here are interested to know what God wants us to do in this last days in this regard? Let me see your hand. I want you to be upstanding. Let's bow our heads please. Tomorrow, what time do you say we are starting? We are starting. All right. They will come and give the announcement. I just want to plead with you today I've shared 15% of my content. So the presentation number one I've given 15%. It means 70 85% has not been given. So tomorrow let's come a little early so that we can leverage the time to God's glory. Is that clear? Somebody say an amen. Amen. Let us pray. Father in heaven, we are in crisis and someone needs to scream it at rooftop. In your wisdom, you have chosen this church new life to bring an awakening. We are losing the most important group of our church, the intelligential university student and young adult. Whereas the Bible says in the last days you will use young people to finish your work. We instead are losing the young people. We want to have a crisis meeting in a form of a week-long revival. We want to find solutions through your word and the writings of Ellen White and data. We pray stir in the heart of our young people. Stir in the heart of our church elders. Stir in the heart of our professionals. We plead you want to use new life as the catalyst to shape campus ministries in East Africa and beyond. So we pray let this church know the weight of their responsibility. If they do not do it, you will pass them by. You will give the mandate to another church. But we pray by the close of this week, beginning tomorrow, every night, as we pray and as we wrestle in prayer and also in studies, may we find answers. May they become sentinels for the halting the spiritual declivity. Bless the women, bless the students, bless the men, bless the young people. Until we meet again tomorrow, may grace abound for we have asked in Jesus's name. Let somebody say an amen. 

==================================================

TIMESTAMPED TRANSCRIPT:
[0.2s] [Music]
[45.7s] Let's bow our heads and let's pray.
[47.1s] Father in heaven,
[49.1s] in the next few minutes, we want to
[51.0s] introduce our work for this week. We
[54.6s] pray for your presence. We pray for your
[57.3s] leading. Let this brief moment set the
[61.4s] tone for a week long journey on how we
[66.6s] can put an onslaught on the campus. In
[70.3s] Jesus's name, we have prayed. Amen. as I
[74.7s] always do. It was Jesus himself who
[77.7s] said, "If you continue in my words, then
[81.8s] you are my disciples indeed and you
[85.0s] shall know the truth and the truth shall
[88.0s] set you free. If the son set you free,
[92.0s] you will be free indeed." Can you say an
[94.8s] amen out there?
[97.1s] I make to you four promises and
[98.9s] throughout the week I will do so.
[100.5s] Promise number one is the Bible is going
[102.2s] to be the bedrock of our study. The
[104.6s] reason is the Bible means what it says
[108.2s] and says what it means. Promise number
[110.7s] two, you shall be enlightened
[112.6s] irrespective of who you are. Promise
[115.0s] number three, you shall be challenged to
[117.4s] make the most important decision of your
[119.9s] life. And promise number four, your life
[123.1s] and my our lives will never be the same.
[127.0s] for this
[129.0s] evening. The brief introduction I
[131.6s] caption it the forgotten battlefield and
[136.0s] I subheaded it why campus ministries
[140.1s] hold the future of the church. Take time
[145.8s] the forgotten battlefield.
[149.5s] Why campus ministries hold the future of
[154.9s] the church. This evening what I intend
[157.8s] to do is I want to make you miserable
[161.1s] then you will go home so that we can
[163.3s] decode tomorrow. So my goal this
[166.8s] afternoon or late afternoon is to give
[169.6s] you a headache. You go home with a
[172.1s] headache. We end the Sabbath with a
[175.2s] headache and then you start asking
[178.2s] question then tomorrow we'll begin to
[181.1s] debrief.
[183.4s] In the words of Charles Malik, Charles
[186.2s] Malik is the former uh president of the
[189.4s] United Nations General Assembly, I
[191.8s] quote, "The university is the clearcut
[196.0s] falcrum with which to move the world
[199.8s] more potently than any other means.
[204.2s] Change the university and you will
[207.0s] change the world. Take time. The
[210.4s] university is the clearcut falcrum, is
[214.9s] the pivot with which to move the world.
[218.9s] More importantly than any other means,
[222.7s] change the university and you will
[225.5s] change the world. Period. In this
[228.5s] statement, this diplomat is saying any
[232.6s] organization,
[234.3s] any institution,
[236.3s] any group who is interested in changing
[239.9s] the world where they need to focus is
[243.8s] not just the cities. It's not just the
[247.8s] community. The compass is the key thing.
[252.7s] Now,
[254.6s] there is a crisis in our church.
[257.8s] And the crisis will give you a headache.
[261.9s] Majority of 7th Day Adventist young
[264.6s] people, they leave the church either
[267.5s] before university or immediately after
[271.4s] university.
[273.9s] Data number one,
[276.2s] we call it attrition rate. 68% of
[281.1s] Adventist youth they stop active church
[285.1s] involvement during or after the
[289.3s] university.
[291.2s] This is a data by the Andrew University.
[294.4s] A whole work was done published by the
[297.6s] review and herald.
[300.0s] In excent
[301.9s] 68%
[304.2s] of the current members at New Life
[307.7s] Church, chances are that immediately or
[311.6s] sooner after leaving university, they
[314.7s] will leave the church or they may even
[318.1s] leave before they go to the university.
[324.1s] It will interest you to know that there
[326.3s] is what we call disengagement rate.
[330.0s] Nearly 70%
[333.0s] of young people 18 to 35 years old, they
[338.3s] disengage from the Adventist church.
[342.5s] So the ages 18 to 35, the church is
[346.7s] losing about 70%
[350.6s] of 18 years to 35 years. And guess what?
[355.4s] With this happening within our fields
[358.4s] across the world, we gather every
[360.8s] Sabbath and it is the same music, is the
[364.5s] same story, is the same Sabbath school,
[367.9s] more of the same.
[370.6s] And the church is behaving as if nothing
[375.2s] is going wrong.
[380.1s] Ladies and gentlemen, allow me to state
[383.4s] that 40 to 50% according to Roger L.
[386.9s] Dudley, he wrote a book titled Why Our
[390.4s] Teenagers Leave the Church. He's a 7th
[393.0s] day Adventist altar scholar 40 to 50% of
[397.5s] Adventist youth they leave the church in
[400.1s] their 20s.
[403.0s] So if you see every 10 Adventist young
[407.0s] person between the ages of 19 to 29,
[411.9s] chances are that five or four of them
[415.7s] very soon before they get into 30 years,
[419.2s] they will stop the church.
[425.4s] You you need to read that book. Why our
[429.1s] teenagers leave the church? It's a 10
[432.8s] years studies personal stories and the
[435.9s] rest of them and parents are still
[438.7s] eating ugali they are still eating
[441.7s] chapati and it is business as usual. The
[445.8s] choir is still singing the same song,
[448.4s] the same sabbath school, the same divine
[450.9s] service, the same ayat
[454.2s] change direction, the same thing.
[462.3s] Are you aware that only 37%
[467.0s] of public high school SDA graduate
[471.0s] remain in the church 13 years later?
[474.6s] only 37%.
[478.8s] In essence, we are losing about 63
[484.6s] of this critical church members. If I
[488.1s] were to have time, I would have broken
[490.6s] us into groups and you will analyze that
[494.0s] graph on the table on your screen. The
[497.1s] Adventist youth disengagement trend.
[499.4s] This afternoon after divine service I
[501.0s] started pulling it together to see just
[502.9s] to give a summary. Hear me. We are in
[507.3s] danger as a church.
[510.4s] Let me say it one more time. We are in
[515.3s] danger as a church. And it is in this
[519.0s] lie I titled the first session the
[522.7s] forgotten battlefield.
[525.5s] Why tempest ministries hold the future
[529.8s] of the church.
[532.3s] Let me remind you again. Charles Malik,
[535.6s] former president of the United Nations,
[538.0s] the university
[539.9s] is the clearcut falcrum
[542.8s] with which to move the world. More
[545.8s] importantly than any other means, change
[549.0s] the university and you will change the
[552.0s] world. As if this statement is not
[554.6s] enough, we have a department, a
[557.4s] directorate at the GC, the general
[559.8s] conference called uh archives and stuff.
[563.0s] Our director for archives as a church is
[565.9s] David JB Trim. He's a historian. He's an
[569.6s] archavist. He's an educ educationist or
[572.5s] an educator. He says, and I quote,
[575.3s] "62.5%
[577.9s] of those who left the SDA church, they
[580.8s] started uh they stated that they were
[583.8s] young adult when they ceased being
[587.3s] church members." He added, "The data is
[591.6s] clear. The remnant is an endangered
[596.5s] species.
[598.4s] The data is clear. The remnant of Bible
[604.2s] prophecy is an endangered species. In
[608.9s] except in the few years to come, we are
[612.6s] already having more former SDAs than
[617.0s] current SDAs.
[619.8s] Let me say it one more time. for the
[622.8s] director and the director of archives at
[626.3s] the general conference to say
[629.1s] the church is an endangered species. He
[632.9s] is saying in effect the church is at the
[635.8s] verge of being extinct.
[645.1s] If we are endangered
[649.0s] where why are we endangered and it's as
[652.8s] if look he says
[656.6s] 50 to 70% of disengagement people who
[660.0s] have lost interest they don't care they
[662.2s] don't think even about SDA and this kind
[664.3s] of thing they have disen 50 to 70% of
[668.0s] the disengagement rate of post high
[672.3s] senior high secondary individuals North
[674.9s] in the global north and people say that
[677.1s] oh it is the global north when we have
[679.1s] been analyzing the data they say no it's
[681.7s] the global north the global north is the
[684.1s] industrialized world north America
[687.4s] Europe the Caribbean and and and and all
[690.9s] those fields including sometimes
[694.2s] southern America
[697.3s] so they said it doesn't apply to Africa
[700.5s] the data you are quoting doesn't apply
[703.0s] to Africa we are not in trouble as you
[705.5s] are suggesting. He further says the 7th
[708.2s] day Adventist church is losing its young
[711.2s] people. This is true virtually
[715.7s] everywhere.
[717.9s] I am quoting the director of the general
[720.1s] conference archives. The 7th Day
[722.4s] Adventist Church is losing its young
[725.2s] people. This is true virtually
[727.3s] everywhere. Though it is particularly
[729.7s] true in the global north of economically
[732.2s] advanced secular countries with
[734.5s] postmodern or post religious cultures
[737.4s] but it's a fact everywhere our children
[742.0s] are living our faith.
[747.0s] In the year 20 2007,
[750.5s] Jean Pollson was in Cameroon with a
[752.9s] youth engagement with young people in
[755.8s] Cameroon and he says and I paraphrase
[758.7s] him in the next 15 years. I doubt if
[762.3s] there will be a church identity.
[766.2s] 2007 the GC president was care the rate
[770.3s] at which they are looking into the
[771.9s] crystal ball what the data is saying in
[775.3s] 2007 2008 he says in 15 years time he
[780.5s] doubted if there will ever be a church
[785.4s] reason the young people are leaving our
[789.7s] church
[793.4s] so new life you Can you can do all the
[797.4s] crusades you think
[800.1s] all the major churches in the city on
[803.3s] the continent you can do all the crusade
[805.9s] you think. This is the reason why if you
[809.4s] really mean business as a church this
[811.9s] week we better be here because it is
[815.8s] going to be revealing and we are going
[818.0s] to it's not your usual revival. It is a
[821.5s] seminar. It's intriguing. It will be
[824.4s] life transforming. We're going to pull
[826.4s] the Bible data, the writings of Ellen Y.
[829.8s] And we are going to develop a framework.
[832.5s] How do we arrest the spiritual declivity
[836.6s] among the young people? Mothers are
[839.1s] cried, pastor, pray for my daughter,
[841.4s] pray for my son, pray for this. And the
[843.7s] church is doing the same thing she has
[847.2s] done from 1990s
[851.0s] till date. And yet we want to get a
[854.3s] different result. It's a joke.
[862.2s] Hear me loud.
[865.1s] While this is happening,
[867.6s] the GC leader says some leaders are
[870.5s] doing things differently. I'll say this
[872.8s] quickly in person. There are places in
[875.0s] many divisions where church leaders
[877.0s] prefer simply not to record the losses,
[879.5s] he admits. But closing our eyes to that
[882.5s] is no substitute for closing the back
[885.2s] door. So instead of reporting those who
[888.1s] are leaving when we do crusade what we
[890.5s] do or evangelistic campaign we in on the
[893.3s] books huge membership but in reality
[898.2s] fake data.
[900.3s] The director of the general conference
[903.0s] archives says literally we are lying.
[909.1s] Could it be I'm asking a question. Quote
[911.3s] me very well. Could it be our mission
[914.2s] reports are not premised on fact?
[921.0s] Who are we deceiving?
[928.5s] Revelation 3 says, "And to the angel of
[931.3s] the church of the loudation, write these
[933.8s] things, says, Amen. the faithful and
[937.4s] true witness." I wish I had time.
[941.8s] Look, I'm talking about the forgotten
[944.4s] battlefield. Why Campus Ministries holds
[948.2s] the future of the church.
[952.5s] The center for creativity ministry 2018
[956.2s] report on Adventist young adult
[958.2s] retention. This is the verdict. It's a a
[961.9s] sponsored research.
[965.5s] Any it's not just university student.
[967.9s] Those who are professionals any educated
[970.0s] person is leaving our church. I read
[974.1s] young professionals with higher
[975.5s] education levels are more likely to
[978.1s] leave or disengage from the church
[981.1s] citing issues of relevance and
[983.4s] connection to real world concern. The
[986.6s] educated class are no more attracted to
[990.8s] a church with the most educated message
[994.2s] of all time. It's paradoxical
[999.3s] intelligent message yet intelligent
[1002.2s] people are living and guess what we will
[1005.3s] eat the same ugali and chapati and it's
[1008.7s] the same business the same camp meeting
[1011.8s] and nobody is asking the question how do
[1014.6s] we solve the problem
[1024.9s] Do you know that 35% of young Adventist
[1028.2s] professionals, the bankers, the
[1030.4s] engineers, the doctors, the lecturers
[1032.3s] and the rest of them, the CEOs, they 35%
[1035.7s] of them site social political issues as
[1039.1s] a reason for distancing from the church
[1042.2s] feeling the church's stand is outdated
[1045.1s] or disconnected from societal concern
[1048.3s] and the church is saying what
[1053.4s] do you also know that nearly 60% of
[1056.7s] young professionals they report that
[1058.8s] they find the SDA church teachings and
[1061.8s] activities irrelevant to their daily
[1064.6s] lives and their careers. This is a
[1067.0s] document by the North American Division
[1069.7s] Millennial Engagement Report 2017.
[1073.2s] 60% of professionals reported in a field
[1078.2s] that look the messages, the teachings,
[1081.7s] they are irrelevant to their daily lives
[1085.5s] and their careers.
[1091.0s] Look, this one nearly gave me heart
[1093.1s] attack.
[1094.8s] Among young Adventist professionals, 48%
[1099.3s] express difficulties reconciling
[1102.5s] traditional church doctrines with modern
[1105.4s] professional life, leading some of them
[1107.5s] to disengage. So the mark of the beast,
[1110.6s] the sanctuary service, the investigative
[1112.7s] judgment and all its teachings, the
[1115.6s] young professionals, the intelligential,
[1118.5s] the professional, this is not just the
[1120.4s] student, even the working class who are
[1123.0s] the brilliant one. They said we can't
[1125.2s] connect them. We can't connect them. We
[1128.3s] are in crisis.
[1141.0s] I want to stop here.
[1147.0s] What's the time?
[1149.2s] My garden watch is deceiving me. Come
[1151.6s] again. 4:30.
[1161.8s] I'm scared for my daughter.
[1164.3s] She'll be 13 years in September.
[1169.1s] I'm scared for the teenagers.
[1173.3s] Will there be a church
[1175.8s] they will identify with?
[1178.5s] This is the reason this week
[1181.4s] we want to think and brainstorm
[1185.2s] about the campus. I I've not even
[1187.8s] started this presentation. I've only
[1190.0s] done 5% of even this very presentation.
[1194.3s] So what I want us to do is
[1197.6s] there are multiplicity of factors.
[1201.3s] Look, I can tell you
[1204.9s] one minute.
[1206.7s] Let me make this case and let's pray.
[1210.6s] Look,
[1212.4s] while we are
[1215.4s] we are not sure
[1217.8s] of all what we are talking about. Do you
[1220.8s] know how the charismatic Pentecostal
[1223.1s] churches grew historically? The
[1225.8s] charismatic Pentecostal churches grew
[1228.0s] from four key dimensions. Let me give
[1230.5s] them to you quickly. Number one, the if
[1234.1s] you see what we call the charismatic
[1236.6s] Pentecostal wave, they use campus
[1239.8s] ministries,
[1241.4s] four things, church leaders to reach and
[1244.6s] influential lay leaders, the
[1246.3s] professionals who are now leaving our
[1247.7s] churches. And then they use energetic
[1250.2s] and educated students. And then the
[1252.6s] third group they used was the or the
[1255.1s] fourth criteria was the popularization
[1258.0s] of the grassroots level of the science
[1260.4s] and wonders movement. This is how the
[1263.0s] charismatic churches grew. Now watch
[1266.9s] the charismatic churches for the past 30
[1269.2s] years check the history in Africa and
[1271.8s] for the past 40 years they have seen
[1273.9s] some unprecedented growth that I have
[1277.5s] the data. Look, they are focused now.
[1281.2s] Some of them have abandoned their main
[1283.4s] churches and they are on the campus.
[1286.6s] The pastors are on the campus. Let me
[1288.6s] give you some quotes from some of the
[1290.2s] leading charismatic pastors from West
[1292.3s] Africa and the rest. Some of the key
[1293.8s] statement they make. One says, "Our goal
[1296.5s] is to bring Jesus to the universities
[1299.8s] and the universities will take Jesus to
[1302.5s] the workplace and then the streets and
[1305.1s] the villages." Our obsessed passion, the
[1308.2s] name of the church is lighthouse is
[1310.7s] campus ministries and healing crusades.
[1313.6s] We will fund the campus ministry and it
[1317.0s] will plow back to move us to the next
[1319.8s] level. This is a policy direction by a
[1324.1s] church that has decided that there will
[1326.6s] be an onslaught on campus. One
[1329.4s] charismatic pastor says the future of
[1331.8s] our ministry is the impact and
[1334.8s] investment we make today on the tertiary
[1337.8s] campuses. Some denominations as if he's
[1340.6s] talking about my church are rural
[1342.9s] centered. We will use the upper class to
[1346.8s] impact rural ministries.
[1350.8s] Another says, "The Lord has laid on my
[1354.5s] heart to have a strategic spiritual
[1357.7s] takeover by taking hostage of the
[1360.3s] institutions of higher learning. Give me
[1363.4s] 100 committed and spiritual university
[1366.1s] students and the future of our ministry
[1369.1s] will be like wildfire.
[1371.4s] Let the heavens twist in our favor for
[1374.3s] the souls of student."
[1378.2s] So you take the 10 richest pastors in
[1381.4s] the whole world. Five are from West
[1383.8s] Africa.
[1385.4s] And do you know what they did? Campus
[1388.2s] ministries.
[1391.7s] Campus ministries. And as if look as if
[1395.1s] that was not enough. As if that was not
[1398.2s] enough. Look if you take Islam I can
[1402.0s] tell you
[1405.3s] Islam non-religious groups they are
[1408.6s] investing on the universities look they
[1412.5s] normalize their beliefs in curriculum
[1415.0s] and culture be it Islam LGBTQ
[1419.0s] everybody knows if you want to survive
[1421.6s] focus on university be it politician be
[1424.6s] it a religious be it everybody is
[1428.0s] looking for students.
[1431.6s] So what they do is Islamic humanists,
[1435.0s] LGBTQ and the eastern spiritualists are
[1438.2s] now in spending millions on the campuses
[1443.4s] to share their beliefs to lecturers,
[1446.6s] philosophers, educationists.
[1449.4s] And guess what we are doing? We are
[1451.5s] still singing coming again without
[1454.3s] contextualizing it to the universities.
[1458.3s] Look, I can take you they fund student
[1461.4s] influence strategically. Muslims
[1463.8s] organization, global foundation, secular
[1467.0s] groups, they sponsor fellowship events.
[1470.5s] They give scholarship as a way. I'm not
[1473.4s] talking about even rel Christian groups.
[1475.5s] So these are non-Christian groups,
[1478.8s] Eastern mystical religions, Buddhism,
[1482.5s] atheism and its bewitching influence.
[1485.3s] This is what they are doing. They
[1486.9s] reframe what we call identity and
[1489.7s] belonging. LGBTQ communities create
[1493.0s] powerful tribes
[1495.8s] and safe spaces that offer belonging
[1499.6s] before belief. Don't you don't believe
[1501.8s] in LGBTQ. It's okay. Just belong.
[1505.5s] They are being thoughtful and we are
[1508.0s] still studying Sabah school the normal
[1510.3s] way.
[1513.0s] You go to our universities. I have been
[1515.9s] the campus ministry director for my
[1517.6s] union before I in deliberately resign.
[1522.0s] Hear me. It is wild out there and
[1526.6s] sometimes you wonder is my church aware
[1530.9s] what is happening.
[1533.3s] Look some of this Muslim group, Buddhist
[1535.8s] group and the rest they empower student
[1537.9s] leaders very early.
[1540.9s] the cults, the activist groups, the
[1544.4s] mentor and mobilize students in their
[1547.4s] first semester, they they run after
[1549.8s] them.
[1552.4s] We believe they will go and come back.
[1554.6s] It's a lie.
[1558.7s] Whilst we are still doing normal public
[1560.6s] campaign, they are using documentaries
[1563.6s] and they are using storytelling to shape
[1566.6s] world views. They are investing in
[1569.4s] movies and the rest of it guys we have
[1574.0s] been priced out of the market.
[1577.5s] So this week
[1581.2s] your church is a strategic church
[1586.5s] the whole SDA church worldwide Africa
[1590.4s] holds the key. It's not Europe.
[1595.0s] It's not North America. It's not South
[1597.8s] America. It is Africa. When we are
[1600.9s] talking about campus ministries,
[1603.2s] North America with the greatest of
[1605.0s] respect,
[1608.2s] it is Africa.
[1612.9s] Europe doesn't know what it is. And this
[1617.0s] is the reason. How come we are growing?
[1620.6s] Every 10 Adventists you see in the
[1622.5s] world, four are from Africa.
[1626.5s] Yet somebody will come and tell us how
[1628.6s] to win the world. You can't win Europe.
[1633.0s] You can't win.
[1636.2s] Now we will sit down as zombies. We are
[1638.9s] stupid. We don't know anything. You will
[1641.0s] come and teach us. Go and evangelize
[1643.4s] Europe.
[1646.2s] We hold the future. And we need to begin
[1649.0s] to tell our daughters and our sons 15
[1651.4s] years, 16 years. We need to sit down. So
[1654.2s] this week we want to reclaim our
[1657.0s] members. We want to redeem our children
[1660.3s] and we want to restore Adventism in its
[1664.4s] height. Somebody should say an amen to
[1666.2s] that one. So I want to charge you.
[1670.3s] It is not a usual revival thing. We are
[1674.1s] in crisis. So if you permit I will have
[1677.0s] called it a crisis
[1680.5s] meeting.
[1682.6s] We want to solve a problem. So we would
[1685.6s] depend heavily on data. We would depend
[1688.6s] heavily on the Bible. We will pray and
[1691.4s] we are going to ask the Lord what do we
[1693.4s] do if new life doesn't get it right with
[1696.8s] campus ministries. Kenya is gone.
[1700.6s] I've done my checks. You are the citadel
[1704.8s] of campus ministries.
[1707.5s] A lot of university students have been
[1709.4s] speaking to me. They see you as their
[1711.8s] citadel. And during the week, I'm going
[1713.8s] to show you how that will be to your
[1716.6s] economic advantage as a church, your
[1719.4s] membership retention as a church. So, I
[1722.4s] welcome you to a week-long program where
[1725.6s] we will pray, where we will think. And I
[1728.4s] just want to ask a question. How many
[1730.4s] persons want to be at the center stage
[1733.2s] of this week-long program? Let me see
[1735.0s] your hand. We don't need a lot of
[1737.7s] numbers. Hands down. You see I we I
[1740.7s] prefer 10 people who want to think
[1743.8s] along. How many persons feel
[1747.8s] God's will? Maybe there is something we
[1750.9s] need to do. Even your own children this
[1753.7s] week will help you. How your children
[1756.1s] will not shipwreck? They will not leave
[1758.2s] the church. How the young people in your
[1760.2s] household, they will not leave the
[1761.8s] church. And I want to ask a question.
[1763.6s] How many persons here are interested to
[1766.4s] know what God wants us to do in this
[1768.7s] last days in this regard? Let me see
[1770.4s] your hand.
[1772.9s] I want you to be upstanding.
[1780.3s] Let's bow our heads
[1782.6s] please. Tomorrow, what time do you say
[1784.0s] we are starting?
[1788.0s] We are starting. All right. They will
[1790.0s] come and give the announcement. I just
[1791.6s] want to plead with you today I've shared
[1793.8s] 15% of my content. So the presentation
[1797.8s] number one I've given 15%. It means 70
[1802.4s] 85% has not been given. So tomorrow
[1805.5s] let's come a little early so that we can
[1808.0s] leverage the time to God's glory. Is
[1811.2s] that clear? Somebody say an amen. Amen.
[1813.4s] Let us pray. Father in heaven,
[1816.3s] we are in crisis
[1820.2s] and someone needs to scream it at
[1822.6s] rooftop.
[1825.0s] In your wisdom, you have chosen this
[1828.3s] church new life
[1832.1s] to bring an awakening.
[1836.3s] We are losing the most important group
[1839.7s] of our church,
[1841.9s] the intelligential university student
[1844.9s] and young adult.
[1847.0s] Whereas the Bible says in the last days
[1849.4s] you will use young people to finish your
[1851.1s] work. We instead are losing the young
[1853.7s] people.
[1856.2s] We want to have a crisis meeting in a
[1858.7s] form of a week-long revival.
[1861.9s] We want to find solutions through your
[1863.8s] word and the writings of Ellen White and
[1867.2s] data. We pray stir in the heart of our
[1872.2s] young people. Stir in the heart of our
[1875.6s] church elders. Stir in the heart of our
[1879.0s] professionals.
[1880.9s] We plead you want to use new life as the
[1885.1s] catalyst
[1887.0s] to shape campus ministries in East
[1889.7s] Africa and beyond. So we pray let this
[1893.5s] church know the weight of their
[1895.2s] responsibility.
[1897.4s] If they do not do it, you will pass them
[1900.2s] by. You will give the mandate to another
[1903.0s] church. But we pray by the close of this
[1906.8s] week, beginning tomorrow, every night,
[1910.9s] as we pray and as we wrestle in prayer
[1914.3s] and also in studies, may we find
[1917.2s] answers. May they become sentinels for
[1921.7s] the halting the spiritual declivity.
[1925.2s] Bless the women, bless the students,
[1928.2s] bless the men, bless the young people.
[1931.0s] Until we meet again tomorrow, may grace
[1933.4s] abound for we have asked in Jesus's
[1936.7s] name. Let somebody say an amen.
