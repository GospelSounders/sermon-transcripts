FULL TRANSCRIPT:
[Music] All things work for a good though sometimes we don't see how they could. Struggles that break our hearts into sometimes blind us to the truth. Our father knows what's best for us. His ways are not our own. So when your pathway grows steam and you just can't see him, remember you're never alone. [Music] God is too wise to be mistaken. [Music] And God is too good to be unkind. So when you don't trace his hand, trust his heart. [Music] He sees the master plan [Music] and he holds the future in his hand. But don't leave us those who have no hope. All our hope is found in him. We see the present clearly. And he is the first and the last. And like a topless tree is leaving you and me to someday be like the heat. God is too wise to be mistaken and God is too good to be unkind. So when you can understand where you don't see his plan and where you can't trace his hand, trust his hand. [Music] He alone is faithful and true. And he alone knows what's best for you. [Music] God is too wise to be mistaken. [Music] And God is too good to be unkind. [Applause] So when you don't understand, when you don't see his plan, when you can't trace his hand, trust his heart. [Music] Where you don't understand, where you don't see his hand, and where you can't trace his hand, trust his heart. [Music] Amen. Amen. [Music]
