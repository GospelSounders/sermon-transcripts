is first things first in our topic today we refer the Bible that is the book of agay agay it is a book that is found between Zachariah and Stephania just get there first things first get with me the book of agay in this book of AGI it is only two chapters there's only chapter one and chapter 2 and the message that runs across the book of AGI it is first things first here we get to learn what the children of Israel what the Jews were doing immediately when they left the land of captivity we understand that in the year we understand that in the year which year is this in the year 586 PC the Jews were taken into captivity a foreign Hidan King came and destroyed the temple the place of worship and many people were killed and the Jews were taken captive in Babylon but then because God is involved in the life and Affairs of humanity in the year 538 BC a king was raised by the name Cyrus and Sirus ordered the return of the lants the return of the Jews back home in Jerusalem in Judah and therefore when Hagi the servant of God when hag by the prophet is delivering the message to the Jews these were Lem minants who came back from Babylon from the land of captivity they came back so that they can worship their King and leimar yes when they came back the Bible says when they got home when they were in Judah when they were in their Homeland they forgot that God brought them back so that they can engage in first things first and the first thing they were supposed to do is recorded in um H agay chapter 1 ver8 and this was an imperative to build for him a sanctuary to build for him the temple but then when they came out of the land of captivity when they came back home the Bible says they came with one singular assignment they came so that they can put God first they came with one mission to build the temple for God in Jerusalem that was destroyed but look at your Bible look at your Bible look at your Bible First number two agay yes God commanded them through the prophet AGI to build the temple for their God to build the temple for the god of Hostess but then when they got home when they got home they said it is not a time they said it is not a time when they got home they were now more comfortable they were now happy to get into their Homeland therefore they said it is not yet time to build the temple for God they say it is not at time yes we can build the temple sometimes in the future yes it's not the time I have more other things of priority in my life therefore it's not not a time God says put me first and build me a sanctuary God says come back to me keep my co my Covenant with me they say it is not a Time God's people because it was not a Time Bible records they were engaged in other priorities of their life what was their priority they planted and planted and planted and harvested priority for them because it was not a time they build houses they build mansions they build many houses some for hire some for rent they purchased a car after another from Japan because it was noted the assignment of God build the temple for me but then the people of God the Jews say it's is not a time let me pay school fees first because it's not a time they were saying it's not a time it's not a Time time let me enrich myself let me gather and look for more dollars and Kenya Shillings because it is not a Time the temp of the Lord can be done at a later date it's not the time first things first first things first you earn a satary today it is end mon you have received your paycheck instead of paying God's command return a faithful thought and an offering to me into the stor you say it's noted time this can wait for another time it's not the time when priorities when our priorities are upside down what happens God's people when we begin with these things when we begin with the things of the world when they preoccupy us when the things of this world take precedence in our lives what happens God's people what happens God's people what happens when you deny to make God first and your lifestyle what happens what happens go with me go with me to the Bible when we live with misplaced priorities when the city of Jerusalem that was destroyed was now you could see buildings coming upon another one you could see Estates coming up but then they forgot to do a sanctuary for the Lord God's people God's people God's people this was 20 years down the line that had left the land of captivity 20 years ago but here are the Jews here are the people of God who have decided to exist and live aive without God why because my pastor the presence of the temple represented the presence of God in their midst God says do for me a tabernacle so that I may dwell in your midest but look at these people they have come from the land of captivity they have no place of worship but they have said that can wait let us do other things these are people for 20 years God had no place in their hearts imagine a life of godlessness a life without God a life without the fear of God what alive this was the situation in Jerusalem can you tell your neighbor to wake up tell your neighbor to wake up tell your neighbor to wake up because God first My Lifestyle God is telling us the aspect of stewardship is an aspect of the great controversy Elder are you with me the the issue of stewardship it is an issue of the great controversy that's why in the last days the devil will convince those with means those who God has blessed they're supposed to give to support the work of mission the devil will convince them to keep their resources so that God's work can suffer that's why we're saying what happens what happens when people have priorities that are upside down what happens when we forget God and put these things first what happens when we forget God and seek these things first at the expense of your eternity let us go back to the book of Hai let's go back to the Book of haay Bible says that is verse five verse 5 and six the Bible says you replant but you not Harvest you receive more but you you put in a bag that is full of holes in other words the vure of not putting God first in all your engagements is that automatically you will encounter an ecological and economical crisis because God is not fast and it's not your lifestyle can somebody say Amen somebody say Amen to the Lord am yes when you have priorities that are upside down when God is last in your life when those are the things that make us anxious are of priority in your life let me tell you the Bible tells us yes your experience ecological and economical crisis therefore you'll be chasing the wind you'll be chasing the wind these things no one will tell you you don't hear it from this Minister amen amen you cannot bu all these things let me remind us that they planted but they have vested a little they build houses but when the house is almost complete the house comes crumbling down yes they engaged in Commerce they opened many warehouses they were doing online business besides their regular employment but then whatever they were earning they were putting in bugs full of holds what happens what happens for 20 years they lived without God for 20 years they lived without the sanctuary for 20 years they lived without a place of worship what a disaster what a disaster let me finish let me finish how do you want me to finish let me finish let us go the book of aay The Book of aay chapter 1 first line number seven let whoever was been tempted to go to Slumber to wake up now the book of Hai chapter 1 first line number seven it says the word of the Lord because it says that thus says the Lord of hosts if you have been sleeping if you have been engaged in other things now can you wake up because I'm finishing I'm finishing the Lord of hosts says just listen to what the Lord important is called going to say just listen just listen to what the Lord who owns the universe and Earth what is going to say just listen are you listening if you listening can you show me are you listening God's people are you listening are you listening thank you so much God bless you the Lord of hosts the creator of the universe your creator the one who has given you life the one who has blessed you with a hand the one who has blessed you with the children the one who has blessed you with a family the one who has blessed you with resources and now you're enjoying he saying this get it get it it consider your ways consider your ways consider your lifestyle consider your priorities consider what you do as a child of God consider when you take careful thought of what you are doing right now what you are doing right now in the presence of God God is telling you consider your ways consider your ways how do you consider your ways consider your priorities and realign them according to the purposes of God consider consider your ways consider how much you have stolen from God consider your ways consider your ways and see how much have you withheld from God consider your ways and repay that because defrauding God is the greatest crime for human beings and it's deeply widespread consider your ways consider your ways why because canels on stewardship page 86 paragraph 1 and two it says when we withhold resources that are due to God we are cast we miss out in the blessings of God we miss out receiving the blessings of God when we take from God that which belongs to him therefore consider your ways and repay now and today consider your ways consider your ways because the Bible again says know that that book cancel on stewardship it says that robbery when you rob God your perceptions your ability to understand spiritual matters is eroded taken away that same book says when you rob God what belongs to him he says it makes your heart hard like a stone therefore consider your ways the Bible says as much as you can remember if there's anything you have taken from God repay it so that you can go back to the way and Highway of God's blessings reorder your priorities reorder your priorities in the book prets and kings in the book prophets and Kings it says because the people of Judah the Jews in the time of AGI because their priorities were upside down because they did not put God first as their lifestyle bad book prophets and Kings it says God took away the blessings from them go and read go and read because the one who speaking is the Lord our creator the AL Mighty God who says consider your ways knowing the tenture of behold withholding the resources that belong to God your blessings will be removed your blessings will be removed I have not Sav the spirit of insiration it is not me saying the Bible says what happens Malachi 3:8 what happens to whoever who robs God of tis and offerings can you tell me what happens down there down there what happens what happens what happens what happens yes God declares a curse on all those who have robbed him of tithes and offerings this is what the lord of hosts is saying therefore what can we do consider your ways repent and put God first consider your ways and repent and let God be first and let that be your lifestyle and you may stay blessed for eternity today today as I wind up this discussion in your presence today The God Who has given you energy The God Who has given you resources The God Who has given you blessings The God Who has blessed you has things to say consider your ways return unto him and let him have first priority in your life and make it your lifestyle and when it is your lifestyle it means that you have AC accepted the lordship of Jesus Christ upon your life so when we're talking about put God first it simply means accepting the lordship of Jesus Christ in your life and making it your lifestyle

[771.6s] today is first things
[777.9s] first in in our
[780.8s] Series in our series God first My
[785.5s] Lifestyle our topic is first things
[794.2s] first in our topic
[797.4s] today we
[801.4s] refer the
[803.2s] Bible that is the book of
[807.4s] agay agay
[810.3s] it is a book that is found between
[813.6s] Zachariah and
[815.8s] Stephania just get
[818.2s] there first things
[823.8s] first get with
[826.2s] me the book of
[829.0s] agay in this book of
[832.2s] AGI it is only two
[836.7s] chapters there's only chapter one
[840.0s] and chapter
[841.5s] 2 and the
[844.1s] message that runs
[847.4s] across the book of
[850.4s] AGI it
[853.3s] is first things
[858.2s] first
[860.0s] here we get to
[862.3s] learn what the children of
[866.6s] Israel what the Jews
[869.8s] were doing
[872.0s] immediately when they left the land of
[877.4s] captivity we
[880.0s] understand that in the
[882.6s] year we understand that in the year
[886.4s] which year is this in the year 586
[893.0s] PC the Jews were taken into captivity
[900.5s] a foreign Hidan
[902.7s] King came and
[906.4s] destroyed the temple the place of
[910.3s] worship and many people were killed and
[914.7s] the Jews were taken captive in
[920.4s] Babylon but then because God is involved
[925.7s] in the life and Affairs of humanity
[929.6s] in the year 538
[932.6s] BC a king was raised by the name
[936.8s] Cyrus and Sirus ordered the return of
[941.4s] the
[942.4s] lants the return of the Jews back home
[947.6s] in Jerusalem in
[950.5s] Judah and
[952.5s] therefore
[954.5s] when Hagi the servant of God when hag by
[960.3s] the prophet is
[963.6s] delivering the message to the
[967.1s] Jews these were Lem
[970.2s] minants who came back from Babylon from
[975.1s] the land of
[977.0s] captivity they came back so that they
[980.7s] can worship their King and
[984.6s] leimar yes when they came back the Bible
[989.7s] says when they got
[992.2s] home when they were in
[995.3s] Judah when they were in their
[998.8s] Homeland they
[1001.1s] forgot that God brought them back so
[1005.9s] that they can engage in first things
[1009.8s] first and the first thing they were
[1012.6s] supposed to do is recorded in um H agay
[1018.4s] chapter 1
[1020.9s] ver8 and this was an
[1024.3s] imperative to build for him a
[1028.6s] sanctuary to build for him the temple
[1033.0s] but then when they came out of the land
[1038.7s] of
[1039.9s] captivity when they came back home the
[1043.8s] Bible says they came with one singular
[1048.4s] assignment
[1050.1s] they came so that they can put God first
[1054.9s] they came with one mission to build the
[1059.3s] temple for God in Jerusalem that was
[1062.9s] destroyed but look at your Bible look at
[1067.0s] your
[1068.3s] Bible look at your Bible First number
[1071.8s] two
[1074.0s] agay yes God commanded them
[1079.4s] through the prophet AGI to build the
[1084.0s] temple for their God to build the temple
[1088.6s] for the god of Hostess but then when
[1092.0s] they got home when they got home they
[1095.6s] said it is not a
[1098.0s] time they said it is not a time when
[1102.4s] they got home they were now more
[1105.5s] comfortable they were now happy to get
[1109.1s] into their Homeland therefore they said
[1112.2s] it is not yet time to build the temple
[1116.0s] for
[1117.9s] God they say it is not at
[1122.1s] time yes we can build the temple
[1126.4s] sometimes in the
[1128.0s] future yes it's not the time I have more
[1133.3s] other things of priority in my life
[1137.5s] therefore it's not not a
[1141.2s] time God says put me first and build me
[1147.7s] a sanctuary God says come back to me
[1152.8s] keep my co my Covenant with me they say
[1157.0s] it is not a
[1159.4s] Time God's
[1161.8s] people because it was not a Time Bible
[1166.3s] records they were engaged in other
[1169.5s] priorities of their life what was their
[1173.3s] priority they planted and planted and
[1177.5s] planted and
[1179.4s] harvested priority for
[1182.1s] them because it was not a
[1185.6s] time they build
[1188.3s] houses they build
[1190.8s] mansions they build many houses some for
[1195.7s] hire some for rent they purchased a car
[1200.9s] after another from Japan because it was
[1206.7s] noted the assignment of
[1209.2s] God build the temple for me but then the
[1214.0s] people of God the Jews say it's is not a
[1218.0s] time let me pay school fees first
[1221.4s] because it's not a time they were saying
[1226.0s] it's not a time it's not a Time time let
[1230.2s] me enrich
[1232.6s] myself let me
[1235.8s] gather and look for more dollars and
[1239.2s] Kenya Shillings because it is not a Time
[1243.0s] the temp of the Lord can be done at a
[1245.6s] later date it's not the
[1248.2s] time first things
[1251.9s] first first things
[1254.2s] first you earn a satary today
[1258.8s] it is end mon you have received your
[1263.2s] paycheck instead of paying God's command
[1268.3s] return a faithful thought and an
[1270.8s] offering to me into the stor you say
[1273.9s] it's noted time this can wait for
[1277.0s] another time it's not the
[1280.2s] time when
[1283.5s] priorities when our priorities are
[1286.6s] upside down what happens God's
[1290.0s] people when we begin with these things
[1294.8s] when we begin with the things of the
[1297.6s] world when they preoccupy
[1301.0s] us when the things of this world take
[1305.7s] precedence in our lives what happens
[1308.9s] God's people what happens God's people
[1311.9s] what happens when you deny to make God
[1316.7s] first and your lifestyle what
[1319.5s] happens what
[1321.4s] happens go with
[1324.6s] me go with me to the
[1327.5s] Bible when we live with misplaced
[1333.3s] priorities when the city of Jerusalem
[1337.0s] that was
[1338.2s] destroyed was now you could see
[1342.5s] buildings coming upon another one you
[1346.4s] could see Estates coming up but then
[1350.9s] they forgot to do a sanctuary for the
[1355.1s] Lord God's
[1357.1s] people God's people God's people this
[1362.1s] was 20 years down the
[1364.0s] line that had left the land of captivity
[1367.3s] 20 years ago but here are the
[1371.0s] Jews here are the people of God who have
[1376.5s] decided to exist and live aive without
[1382.2s] God why because my pastor the presence
[1386.7s] of the
[1388.0s] temple represented the presence of God
[1392.0s] in their
[1393.0s] midst God says do for me a
[1396.8s] tabernacle so that I may dwell in your
[1400.2s] midest but look at these people they
[1402.9s] have come from the land of captivity
[1405.4s] they have no place of worship but they
[1407.6s] have said that can wait let us do other
[1412.3s] things these are people for 20
[1417.8s] years God had no place in their
[1424.4s] hearts
[1426.3s] imagine a life of
[1430.4s] godlessness a life without God a life
[1435.7s] without the fear of God
[1439.3s] what
[1441.0s] alive this was the situation in
[1446.6s] Jerusalem can you tell your neighbor to
[1448.9s] wake
[1449.9s] up tell your neighbor to wake
[1453.4s] up tell your neighbor to wake
[1456.5s] up
[1458.7s] because God first My
[1462.8s] Lifestyle God is telling
[1465.4s] us the aspect of stewardship is an
[1470.4s] aspect of the great
[1472.4s] controversy
[1474.0s] Elder are you with
[1477.0s] me the the issue of
[1481.0s] stewardship it is an issue of the great
[1485.2s] controversy that's why in the last
[1489.7s] days the devil will
[1493.7s] convince those with
[1496.3s] means those who God has blessed they're
[1500.0s] supposed to give to support the work of
[1503.0s] mission the devil will convince them to
[1506.5s] keep their resources so that God's work
[1510.1s] can
[1511.6s] suffer that's
[1513.6s] why we're
[1515.6s] saying what
[1518.2s] happens what
[1520.1s] happens when people have
[1524.7s] priorities that are upside down
[1528.6s] what happens when we forget God and put
[1534.3s] these things
[1537.2s] first what happens when we forget God
[1541.6s] and seek these things first at the
[1545.5s] expense of your
[1547.9s] eternity let us go back to the book of
[1551.5s] Hai let's go back to the Book of haay
[1555.0s] Bible
[1556.0s] says that is verse five
[1562.4s] verse 5 and six the Bible
[1565.6s] says you
[1568.3s] replant but you not
[1571.8s] Harvest you receive
[1574.8s] more but you you put in a
[1579.3s] bag that is full of
[1584.5s] holes in other
[1586.9s] words the
[1589.0s] vure of not putting God first in all
[1593.6s] your
[1594.5s] engagements is that
[1597.9s] automatically you will encounter an
[1602.3s] ecological and economical crisis because
[1607.0s] God is not fast and it's not your
[1609.4s] lifestyle can somebody say
[1611.7s] Amen somebody say Amen to the Lord am
[1616.0s] yes when you have
[1618.9s] priorities that are upside

[1671.6s] little they build
[1674.5s] houses but when the house is almost
[1677.4s] complete
[1679.1s] the house comes crumbling
[1683.5s] down
[1685.2s] yes they engaged in
[1688.4s] Commerce they opened many
[1693.4s] warehouses they were doing online
[1697.7s] business besides their regular
[1701.5s] employment but then whatever they were
[1704.4s] earning they were putting in bugs full
[1707.9s] of
[1710.3s] holds what
[1712.8s] happens what
[1715.3s] happens for 20 years they lived without

[1979.0s] crime for human beings and it's deeply
[1983.3s] widespread consider your
[1986.2s] ways consider your ways why
[1990.8s] because canels on
[1993.2s] stewardship page
[1995.1s] 86 paragraph 1 and two it says when we
[2001.2s] withhold resources that are due to God
[2006.4s] we are cast
[2009.4s] we miss out in the blessings of God we
[2014.9s] miss
[2016.0s] out receiving the blessings of God when

[2067.0s] God
[2068.5s] what belongs to him he says it makes
[2072.2s] your heart hard like a
[2075.7s] stone therefore consider your
[2080.3s] ways the Bible says as much as you can
[2085.1s] remember if there's anything you have
[2088.5s] taken from God repay it so that you can
[2092.6s] go back to the way and Highway of God's

[2107.4s] book prets and
[2110.2s] kings in the book prophets and
[2117.0s] Kings it
[2121.4s] says because the people of
[2125.7s] Judah the Jews in the time of
[2130.9s] AGI because their priorities were upside
[2135.4s] down
[2136.9s] because they did not put God first as
[2141.0s] their lifestyle bad
[2143.7s] book prophets and Kings it
[2147.8s] says God took away the blessings from
[2153.8s] them go and read
[2158.3s] go and read because the one who speaking
[2163.5s] is the Lord our creator the AL Mighty
[2167.8s] God who says consider your ways knowing
[2172.6s] the tenture of behold withholding the
[2175.8s] resources that belong to God your
[2178.4s] blessings will be
[2180.3s] removed your blessings will be
[2182.9s] removed I have not Sav the spirit of
[2186.3s] insiration it is not me
[2190.0s] saying the Bible
[2192.1s] says what
[2194.1s] happens Malachi
[2196.4s] 3:8 what happens to
[2200.0s] whoever who robs God of tis and
[2203.3s] offerings can you tell me what happens
[2206.0s] down there down there what happens what
[2209.3s] happens what happens what happens yes
[2215.5s] God declares a
[2219.0s] curse on all those who have robbed him
[2225.6s] of tithes and
[2229.2s] offerings
[2231.1s] this is what the lord of hosts is saying
[2236.0s] therefore what can we do consider your
[2239.6s] ways
[2241.2s] repent and put God
[2244.5s] first consider your ways
[2248.1s] and repent and let God be first and let
