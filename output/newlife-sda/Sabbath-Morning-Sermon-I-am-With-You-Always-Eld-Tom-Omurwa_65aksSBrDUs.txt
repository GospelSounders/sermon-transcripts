FULL TRANSCRIPT:
[Music] Good morning and happy Sabbath. It's still morning. We just got a few more minutes to go. I would want to take this opportunity to welcome each and every one of us once again to this session we are having as we share and learn from the word of the Lord. As always, I take it indeed a great privilege when I'm accorded an opportunity to be able to stand before the children of God to share the word. As much as it's an opportunity and a privilege for me, I know that it's also at the same time challenging. And that's why I really seek your prayers as I share the word on 11th of March uh 2023 during the strategic planning Sabbath two years ago. A sermon was presented here entitled, "Are you worthy of the calling?" Are you worthy of the calling? I want to imagine that you can remember that there was such a sermon. During that sermon, we did learn a few things, a few traits necessary for us to be committed in participating in the implementation of our of the great commission. At that time we also noted that uh the church is the coordination center of all evangelistic activities. And we also learned at that time that this coordination efforts are guided by the church's strategic plan which is really the blueprint for us in our evangelistic work in our church and also out of this church as we serve. And as you are aware, today is another strategic planning and implementation Sabbath. And later today, later this morning, we will be launching that uh strategic plan. I really want to pray that uh we will all be present as we present this blueprint to the Lord. We pray over it so that we are in one accord so that the Holy Spirit can guide us as we do the implementation in the next uh five years. Now, as a followup to that sermon that happened two years ago, I am going to share from very familiar verses, the verses that were read to us, the great commission, Matthew 28 from verse 18 to 20. And of course, other verses will also come in. And before I go into that, let us pray. Our dear and loving master, our God, once again, Lord, I come before you uh this morning. Father, knowing that I'm not worthy even to stand before your children to make this presentation, but Lord, we have to do it because you have chosen me to do it. I pray that father may you hold my hand even as I go through this sermon. And father I pray that may also guide my lips that what comes out of my mouth will be that which will only glorify your name our dear father. I once again seek that lord you prepare your children who are listening to this sermon. those ones who are physically present in this church and those ones who are watching factually out there that Lord they will pick something that they will learn that they will apply in their lives is our prayer in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ. Amen. So Matthew 28 from verse 18 to 20 I just want to quickly go through that. It reads that all authority in heaven and on earth has been given to me. Therefore, go and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, and teaching them to obey everything, teaching them to obey everything I have commanded you. And surely I am with you always to the very end of age. The title of the sermon this morning uh now this afternoon is that I am with you always. I am with you always and you can add to the very end of age. Friends, the great commission is very familiar to us. And in addition to the reference that is in Matthew 28, we have got all the also other references in the other uh uh books in scripture including Mark. In Mark 16 verse1 15 it says that and this is Jesus who said to them Mark 16:15 it says go into all the world and preach the gospel to all creation that is the version that is in Mark there's also in Luke and if you go to Luke chapter 24 from verse 46 to 49 this is a long reading but I'll just go to 47 seven, you can fill the other uh pieces. It says, "And repentance for the forgiveness of sins will be preached in the name in his name to all nations beginning at Jerusalem." That is the Luke account. And then we have got the Acts account. Acts 1:8. This one I think was the basis of a sermon that we received on um on 1st of January this year. And it says, "But you will receive power when the Holy Spirit comes on you, and you will be my witnesses in Jerusalem and in all Judea and Samaria and to the ends of the earth." There's also another one in John, but I'll come to that later. But so all these pieces, all these references of the great commission when when you look at them together, there are certain common threads that you find in each of those. Some are long, some are short, but then there are common threads. And I just want to quickly run through those um pieces, those threads. The first one, they were all spoken. They were all spoken after Christ had risen. Okay? And you understand when Christ rose it was very charged. Okay. People were confused. Others would not believe that actually he had risen. So it is in that atmosphere highly charged uh post-resurrection appearances of Christ that this commission were was made. So so so that's the first one I would say the first thread. The second one in each of those instances okay as I I I read Jesus specifies the responsibilities that the apostles were to undertake and it's it's clear it says make disciples by baptizing and teaching proclaiming the gospel and being witnesses. Those are mentioned in all those three that I mentioned including um the one in Acts. Now friends, you you you know that um in the early church this was picked up very rapidly and people really took it seriously and they took it as a center center stage of the evangelistic work and they did a lot in terms of witnessing, proclaiming and also demonstrations of power. Um and also of course uh uh the outcome was baptism uh which which which was good and of course those ones who were baptized they were guided and they were nurtured to maturity. So um they they became mature disciples after baptism that was during the early church and of course things have continued to flow since that time uh of course variously. The third thread or point I want to mention from those verses that I read each of them it pointed to a kind of global you know international audience. Um it talks about all nations all all nations. Uh of course none should be excluded. You see this in Matthew and Luke. is all and it also talks about all creation and of course the ends of the earth meaning every everywhere that is really the scope. So those three are common in each of those. So friends just to come back that this great commission was issued as a directive. It was issued as a directive to follow. It was issued as a command to obey. It was issued as a decree to execute. In other words, the great commission is just more than a personal or political statement. It's not a personal or political statement. It is in the Bible. It has not changed ever since. It will not change. It will remain and you cannot change it. But being a command that needs to be executed, then he's calling upon us to get involved. We have to get involved. Unless we want to disobey, which is still okay. You can disobey. I know that political statements change. People tell us things today, tomorrow they change. Some say they're going to build a certain road. uh which is okay. We get excited. Another government comes in place. It changes. It says yeah many things about that particular road and so on. So we remain in the same situation. Political statements change. This is not a political statement. It will never be. It comes from the resurrected Christ. The head of all principalities and the possessor of all things is the one who has given that call. And friends, this I think should give it enough weight for us to take it seriously that if it comes from Jesus Christ, the possessor of all things, then who are you? What do you possess? Whatever you have is because Christ has given you. you know what do you possess other than just obeying and therefore we actually owe a debt to Christ because he's the possessor of all things and he has given us okay and uh here we are at times forgetting this is a weighty matter and friends we cannot call him Lord that is Jesus and then take his word for granted The great commission is calling upon us to act and we need to act and to emphasize its comprehensiveness. How comprehensive is this great commission? It's smarked by the term all. And I want just quickly run through that. It says that all authority, you know, it's Christ saying all authority. Christ assures the disciples that I've got I've been given all authority auth all all means everything everything and I can just imagine that the entire godhead is behind it you know all authority in heaven and on earth has been given to me now if all the authority has been given to Christ I think Christ has the right to give orders he has got the right to tell us what to Since in any case he holds this earth by his hands. So he has the authority to make orders. He has got the authority to make decisions and also he has the authority to enforce obedience. At times we can be disobedient. But you know God can actually force us. He can make us to be obedient and he has got ways of doing that. Let us not test him on that particular one. And this authority friends was not acquired. It was not given rather to to Christ. It was not stolen or snatched. This an authority that came from the Godhead. And if you want to read more about this, you can go to Philippians chapter 2 9-11. I won't go through through that, but for you just to have understand that this was not, you know, given or snatched or stolen, but it's an authority that came from above and therefore that this authority is actually primar authority that comes from MA. It says a lot really in terms of how we should take it and the intent that God has by so making this commission. He really wants the work done. He really wants the work done. And therefore we need to reage upon this authority that Christ has you know to have the work done. And with this authority we are sure that everything that we do in the name of Christ as long as within the framework of the great commission friends it will work. We shouldn't fear and therefore will not be let down. The second all is about all nations. All nations. When Jesus said go make disciples of all nations he established the unlimited scope. It is unlimited scope of the great commission. But friends, we must pay particular attention to the call not just to go and proclaim because it's easy to go and proclaim, but we need to also make disciples of all nations. Bring people of different groups together, you know. And it should not be just among a few people because we can be tempted to say okay fine we are going to focus on a certain enclave within our area and forget that there are many other areas where such is needed. So we have to be careful and also be careful that we don't just be selective in terms of addressing the all the nations peace. And again just for a reminder that uh the great commission's fulfillment is not measured by how far you go from new life. It's not I know some think that when we go to Turkana for example and then that's now great work. Yes, we are going to toana which also they deserve to have that but remember that there's a lot that also needs to happen around here. There is so much around us. So your success is not about we went to Turukana, we went to Waja, we went to whatever. No, it's not but the quality of the fellowship okay that you um deliver. The third all is that all the commands and uh and Jesus is very clear. says that teach them all his commands. Um, in other words, don't be selective. The commands are there. We know the commands. But don't be selective which command you are able to deliver. Deliver all the the commands and the commands that I have commanded you. The fourth and final all uh is all the way. And he says that and and Christ actually wraps it this way. Uh and he says that I will be with you. Um I am with you always up to the end of time. That is all the way. Um he has promised of course his followers that he will be present. But this implies that there's going to be continuity. We don't know when the end is going to come. Okay? Because as our life is short, okay? We don't know when it will come. But then there's going to be continuity. When our time comes and we go, there are others who will pick it up and continue and so on. So Christ will be there all the way. So this is where I want to take a bit of time to address the issue of I am with you always. I am with you always even to the end of time. This phrase is very comforting. When you hear it, when you read it, you say, "Yeah, Christ will be with me." It's very comforting, isn't it? And really, we should take it as such. In other words, no matter what happens to us, no matter what sales, we will always, you know, will not fear. We we really be successful because Christ is with us all the way. And with this statement of course comes that the certainty of uh this you know the prestige because Christ is there everything we do is good anyway Christ cannot lead us to bad places and also the power behind you know his presence remember all authority has been given to me as much as it's this statement is really reassuring Um but more importantly is that it it works within a plan. You know Christ cannot or God cannot be in a place without a plan. What would he be doing there? You know there has to be a plan for him to be present. God is not an idler. Okay. right now is extremely busy as he takes care of the 8 billion people in this world to make sure that they breathing oxygen they are fed you know they are surviving that alone is massive is never idle and therefore he operates within a plan or some purpose and therefore is ever present our presence is the greatest opportunity that we have it's available to us And I just don't know how many of us really exploit this that Christ is present all the time. How many exploit that? At times we forget but Christ is the resource that we have all the time available anytime you need when you don't have money Christ is there you know Christ is there so this is the resource but how many of us are really taking advantage of that and exploiting this resource how many so what does this mean in terms of implementing the great commission uh that Christ will be always with us. And I want to take a few minutes as I close just to pinpoint seven points that um will carry home. The first one and very obvious when Christ say that I will be with you all the time. In other words, he's present. I mean don't doubt he is present. When he says I'll be with you all the time, he means he will be present. In other words, Christ will be present when you are preparing your strategic plan. Christ will be present when you are implementing it. He will be present as you are winning souls. He will be present as you, you know, as you are baptizing them. He will be present as you nurture them, you know, to maturity. Christ is ever present. In other words, don't doubt. He's ever present. So the second point his presence reassures us that we are well resourced and remember I said is the primary source but we are also well resourced. Did you know that? I know quite often we we fail to initiate evangelistic campaigns uh or activities because we claim to lack resources. Mostly we we say we don't have money. Money is not and will never be the greatest resource. It will never. And if you think it will, it will never. It's there. I know some of us are struggling to get that money, but it will never okay. Uh be the greatest resource. But it's also good to have money. But that should not be the first thing we front. Like we cannot go for evangelistic campaigns just because there's no money. No, that is wrong. We cannot plan because we don't have money. No, that is wrong. Actually, I don't know how much money the disciples had when they doing evangelistic work, you know, during the early church. How much money they have? How much money did Paul have? We How much was he making from the tents that he was making? You know, that took him to the places that he went how much did he have? I doubt if he had money, maybe it wasn't much. Okay? And therefore, money should not be the first thing. But let me tell you, the biggest resource other than Christ that we have is you and me. Did you know that? Did you know that you are the biggest resource? Your mere presence is enough but you find you are here and you are struggling with the money and yet you are a bigger resource than than money. So the biggest resource is you and me and of course you need the Holy Spirit to guide us. But more importantly is that we need the Holy Spirit friends to empower us to implement the work commissioned unto us. Often we struggle in our evangelistic work because we never invite the Holy Spirit that he may give us the power that we need. We lack a lot of power at times. We need to allow the Holy Spirit that he may guide us, he may dwell in us, he may empower us and through the Holy Spirit all will be well. Again, I'm saying this in the context of implementing the great commission. And here we have a strategic plan which is coming which will be launched in a short while. You are the biggest resource other than Christ. You are the biggest resource. Forget about money. Money will come but it starts with you. The third point about his presence. His presence and his ever available presence reminds us that this work is delegated. You know we can easily forget and think that the great commission uh is delegated. you know is given to us as a privilege you know yes it is a privilege but but it is a call that come and partner with me to do this work it is God who's calling us to in you know partner with him to do this work and for us indeed it's a privilege yes it is a privilege and we should take it as such and that's why we need to hold on to it but it is delegated work if God delegated work to us you know it could have done this great commission by the way but he has asked us to do it if he could then how about you and me delegating the work also at times uh I know delegating can be difficult [Music] um we struggle with it I want to believe that uh for those ones who have worked in places and uh you yeah you must have exp experienced this how people struggle to delegate at times I worked in government for seven years after after university for 7 years but those seven years I was able to observe certain things that was in government and then I the rest of the 30 or so years I worked after that I was with the non-government organizations but I will tell you one thing people struggle with delegating attack someone doesn't want to go on leave he has got 21 I don't know 30 days and files and when he's forced to go and what is this that you are hiding delegation is night when you go and leave delegate to the other people they will continue the work that's the continuity we are talking out people struggle. I'm sure you have experienced those ones who are working how people struggle with this. There are things they want to hide when they don't want to go and leave because they feel that when they go and leave somebody's going to come in an acting capacity and probably that person will do a better job and they will be confirmed in that position. you know such it is but anyway let's go to the Bible and let's learn something about delegation here Exodus 18 Exodus 18 from from um verse 13- 27 I won't read this but this is a a very common story that can help us learn how to delegate now this is the story about Moses's father-in-law Jethro uh and I'll just par paraphrase is he planned to visit uh his son-in-law Moses in the wilderness wherever Moses was at that time and in the process of course he also planned to take along Moses his wife and the two children for the visit the father-in-law did inform Moses that he was coming in and informed him in advance which is a good Jetro, I must say, was a good father-in-law. Indeed, a good father-in-law because you know at times you need to inform your children when you are coming. Father-in-laws who are here and mother-in-laws, you need to inform your children when you are coming from the village or wherever to visit them. At times you throw people off. But Jethro, he informed the sonin-law in advance he was coming and therefore Moses must have prepared. Let's learn something from there also. Father-in-laws, let us be informing people. Anyway, when Jethro came on the second day, he did observe how the how Moses was uh serving the people as he was doing the judging, you know, very overzealous. He was the teacher, he was the problem solver, he was everything you know and in the process you know he kept people waiting. is overworked as he judges, as he teaches, as he solves problems. He is also overworked. At the same time, the people who want to be served is a long queue. And the father in observed and told him, you know, Moses, what you are doing is not right. And of course, he advised him on what he needed to do. And I want to believe that when Moses was advised, you can get that story and read more about it. Moses's performance must improve. Therefore, delegation is important. Okay? Even as we go into implementing the strategic plan that is coming, please let's think about delegation. Let's not carry everything on our own. We become ineffective. You know, when we are just handling wholly everything selfishly at times, no, it doesn't help and more so not in God's work. Delegation is important and indeed like I said this work is delegated to us and because Christ has delegated it to us let us also learn to delegate. Number four of seven. His presence is a reminder of the time scope of our engagement. His presence reminds us about the time that we have to engage. He says, "I will always be with you until the end of time." It conotes one thing uh that this commission has an end. It's going to end at some point. Okay? But our participation, we don't know. But it will end when we die. Okay? Or we become too old or whatever or when we are unable to to do it. However much we get convicted friends convicted in doing this work uh one thing I'll tell you for sure it's going to come to an end somehow we don't have much time we don't some of us are now 65 years and over but just a few years ago I thought I was a young person you know uh those mountains that is planning for us to climb Uh yeah those mountains that we will be climbing in May that's nothing we never been scared but now you think about it twice okay it's not you have to prepare and prepare well but that is it time is not on our side friends it's not on our side and therefore let us not procrastinate let us not procrastinate thinking that yes I'll do it tomorrow because I have time tomorrow may never even come for you. It may never come for me. Okay. Tomorrow you realize that the energy that you used to have is no more. You realize that there are things you used to do but now you cannot do them. That is the change that happens and it happens so fast. And therefore let us not procrastinate. I know pro procrastination is a one of the sin of omissions. You can you want to read that is in James 4:17 where it says therefore to him who knows to do good and does not do it to him it is sin procrastination is sin and therefore just for us to know that we don't have much time and um and therefore let's just cut all of the time that we have right now the time we launch the strategic plan let us get up something from it and let move for the next 5 years if we'll be alive. We don't know you know five five years you think is it's a long time it can be a short time and at times probably you cannot even hit it all right so let us just do the best I can I like this comment that I read somewhere and it's about pro procrastination um it really interested me I'll just read it says when we procrastinate we put off something important in exchange for doing something else even if that thing is nothing at all. That really interested me. Just think about it technically then what this statement is saying that if you choose to do nothing you are still choosing to do something that if you choose to do nothing you are still choosing to do something but I don't want us to go that way okay otherwise then we are we are going to be in that category of busy bodies in church you know those busy bodies they are all over but you don't see anything that they are doing they criticizing things left, right and center. when somebody starts an initiative today somebody's trying lead guided by the Holy Spirit but they are punching it punching it you know those busy bodies our classrooms here we really when uh in 2023 I know a lot of effort energy thank you to thank you members for the children classrooms but you know the criticism that came from there you know instead of appreciating and saying oh we have done this within our abilities that busy bodies they just wanted to tear people apart, you know, kill people. Okay. And really we have tried but anyway they are there and they are being used. Number five of seven as I close. Number five of seven it says you should know should you should his presence therefore means that you should not fear or worry. Um friends I know at times when you feel that Jesus Christ is with us and and particularly when we are not doing things right we start fearing and saying oh now Christ is seeing me Christ is seeing me but his presence should not evoke that fear we should not fear. I know we are seen as at times we do the wrong things. Okay. But we should not fear and more so in the context of implementing the you know the strategic plan or the work of God um that we have before we should not feel guilty and um rather his presence should help us. It should spare us as his disciples to proclaim the good news of uh the presence of his kingdom in us. I know that fear is a common obstacle. At times we fear that we not be able to implement because we are not okay maybe because the work is difficult. Okay. Or I am not worthy to do it. Uh you know all those fears I am inadequate and so on. You know those fears that uh that come um and at times these fears can lead us into inaction. um of course hindering us from the work of God and particularly the work of spread the work of spreading the gospel and of course making of disciples. Um but we can overcome this and uh friends with the Holy Spirit working in us and directing us we will be able to overcome. We just need to rely on the Holy Spirit. Then quickly number six of seven what his presence means to us. Number six of seven that we should be obedient and faithful. You remember I said that Christ without authority can actually enforce discipline. He can actually enforce obedience. If you are disobedient, yes, you can. Maybe not for too long. God, Jesus can just turn things around and then and he will deal with you. Okay? Of course, in a good way. All right? So that you can come back to to track. We need to be obedient because we are in his uh presence. Obedience to the great commission. It means that we just need to follow God's instruction. The instructions have been given to us. We need just to make disciples of all nations. And um this basically just requires a willingness on our part to step outside our comfort zones. I know new life at times we stick too much into our comfort zones. You know we don't want to go out. I I struggle you know I've been head elder for 4 years. I hope that I will not again continue because now because of my age. Uh please don't consider that. But let me tell you one thing. Do you know that even elders getting elders to do some work like been struggling to send an elder to the new Sabbath school the one in Kaji do you know getting an elder just to go and serve it's so difficult people are busy I don't know what they are doing you know this is what we are talking about that you know let us do the work. If you are willing or you agreed to be an L in this church, then just be open to work. If you agree to become a deacon or a deconness in this church, then be ready to work. When your leaders tell you there's some work to do here, go. But at times we struggle. This comfort zone that we are talking about friends in this church will not help us. We need to get out of that. And my prayer is really is that as we get into the new strategic plan that we will all be committed when people are called upon to work let us be able to do so. And faithfulness also the second part of it it involves persevering in the task of making disciples even when faced with challenges or even setbacks you know. Yeah. Let's just persevere. At times it can be difficult. At times we don't have money. At times it's this way or that way. Let us persevere and that is faithfulness. We have to remain steadfast in one's commitment in sharing the gospel. Without that commitment then of course our faith would be dead before knowing it. Friends, the seventh and final observation from the statement that I am with you always till the end of time is about reminding us of the blessings that follow. Did you know that you can be blessed? Did you know that once you do God's work and complete it that actually there are blessings that come with it? Did you know that? You know, I want to remind you and I want us to read first John, no, John uh 17 verse1-5. John 17 1-5. And for this one, I'm just going to read. Okay. Um it it reads Jesus spoke these words, lifted up his eyes to heaven and said, "Father, the hour has come. Glorify your son that your son also may glorify you. As you have given him authority over all flesh, that he should give eternal life to as many as you have given him." And this is eternal life that they may know you. the only true God and Jesus Christ whom you have sent. I like verse four which says that father and this is Jesus saying I have glorified you on the earth. I have finished the work which you gave me to do. And now, oh father, glorify me together with yourself with the glory which I had with you before the world was you know here you know here Jesus God is asking God the father to glorify him but he's giving a reason he's saying because I have completed that which you send me to do. You don't ask to be glorified. You don't ask to be blessed, you know, for you and me when you have actually done nothing or you were given a task and then you did it halfway and then you disappeared. You abandoned it and then you expect blessings. They wouldn't come. Jesus completed that which the father sent him to do and he was right to ask his father to glorify him and therefore friends it's important that whatever we start we finish let's not do things halfway I know in our church we have pieces here and there that are incomplete many many pieces here and there that are incomplete. I just want to pray that as we get into the new dispensation of the new strategic plan that indeed whatever we start we see it through that way and then we'll glorify God and we'll also be blessed without it and then we'll just be stuck in mad friends. Okay. And I know even in your personal life there are certain things you started that you are not eh they have been hanging h seek the holy spirit to guide you okay and you will see uh everything completed and once they completed then of course we will glorify lord therefore we can also be blessed by completing the work and as I conclude um let us remember one thing that Jesus Christ our Lord is always with us. He's always with us as we implement the work. He's never far. He's the nearest resource that we have. And um he will support us as long as we seek him all the time. And uh like we mentioned today, we are commissioning the strategic plan uh which is going to happen I think in a few minutes from now and I want to pray that uh each and every one of us will remain seated because it will take like 10 minutes or so uh as we roll this out and uh this is a strategic plan that we are going to implement for the next 5 years. It's important. Please members find a place in this strategic plan. Find something that you can do so that you can partner with God and serve. But more importantly, let us ask the Holy Spirit to guide us on what we can do. Let's wait upon the Holy Spirit and he will inform and empower us. With that, I would want to invite

TIMESTAMPED TRANSCRIPT:
[0.0s] [Music]
[24.5s] Good morning and happy
[27.4s] Sabbath. It's still morning. We just got
[29.8s] a few more minutes to
[32.4s] go. I would want
[35.9s] to take this opportunity
[39.1s] to welcome each and every one of us once
[42.0s] again
[42.8s] to this session we are having as we
[46.2s] share and learn from the word of the
[48.6s] Lord.
[50.9s] As always, I take it indeed a great
[54.6s] privilege when I'm accorded an
[57.4s] opportunity to be able to stand before
[60.6s] the children of God to share the word.
[66.2s] As much as it's an opportunity and a
[68.0s] privilege for me, I know that it's also
[70.8s] at the same time challenging. And that's
[73.6s] why I really seek your
[76.0s] prayers as I
[79.3s] share the
[83.9s] word on 11th of March uh
[90.8s] 2023 during the strategic planning
[94.1s] Sabbath two years
[96.6s] ago. A sermon was presented here
[102.4s] entitled, "Are you worthy of the
[105.5s] calling?" Are you worthy of the calling?
[108.6s] I want to imagine that you can remember
[112.8s] that there was such a
[115.5s] sermon. During that sermon, we did
[119.2s] learn a few things, a few
[123.9s] traits necessary for us to be
[127.7s] committed in participating in the
[130.2s] implementation of our of the great
[135.6s] commission. At that time we also noted
[139.0s] that
[140.8s] uh the
[143.6s] church is the coordination center of all
[148.9s] evangelistic
[151.6s] activities. And we also learned at that
[154.2s] time
[155.2s] that this coordination
[158.5s] efforts are guided by the church's
[162.6s] strategic
[164.5s] plan which is really the blueprint for
[168.6s] us in our evangelistic work in our
[172.2s] church and also out of this church as we
[177.0s] serve. And as you are aware, today is
[180.7s] another strategic planning and
[183.1s] implementation
[186.8s] Sabbath. And later today, later this
[190.0s] morning, we will be launching that uh
[194.4s] strategic plan. I really want to pray
[197.8s] that uh we will all be present as we
[201.7s] present this blueprint to the Lord.
[205.1s] We pray over it so that we are in one
[207.4s] accord so that the Holy Spirit can guide
[210.2s] us as we do the implementation in the
[212.6s] next uh five
[214.4s] years. Now, as a followup to that sermon
[217.3s] that happened two years
[221.9s] ago, I am going to
[224.3s] share
[225.8s] from very familiar verses, the verses
[229.4s] that were read to us, the great
[231.6s] commission, Matthew 28 from verse 18 to
[235.1s] 20. And of course, other verses will
[237.5s] also come in.
[242.6s] And before I go into that, let us
[247.1s] pray. Our dear and loving master, our
[249.8s] God, once again, Lord, I come before you
[254.4s] uh this
[257.2s] morning. Father, knowing that I'm not
[260.2s] worthy even to stand before your
[261.8s] children to make this
[264.1s] presentation, but Lord, we have to do it
[266.2s] because you have chosen me to do it. I
[269.4s] pray that father may you hold my
[273.3s] hand even as I go through this sermon.
[277.0s] And father I pray
[279.2s] that may also guide my lips that what
[282.3s] comes out of my mouth will be that which
[285.4s] will only glorify your name our dear
[287.8s] father. I once again seek that lord you
[291.0s] prepare your children who are listening
[292.6s] to this sermon. those ones who are
[296.0s] physically present in this church and
[299.0s] those ones who are watching factually
[301.0s] out there that Lord they will pick
[303.7s] something that they will learn that they
[306.0s] will apply in their lives is our prayer
[308.9s] in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ.
[312.8s] Amen. So Matthew 28 from
[316.8s] verse 18 to 20 I just want to quickly go
[319.9s] through that. It reads that all
[322.7s] authority in heaven and on earth has
[325.3s] been given to me. Therefore, go and make
[328.6s] disciples of all
[330.1s] nations, baptizing them in the name of
[333.8s] the Father and of the Son and of the
[336.2s] Holy Spirit, and teaching them to
[339.3s] obey
[341.0s] everything, teaching them to obey
[344.0s] everything I have commanded
[347.4s] you. And surely I am with you always to
[353.8s] the very end of
[356.5s] age. The title of the sermon this
[360.6s] morning uh now this afternoon is that I
[365.9s] am with you always. I am with you always
[370.7s] and you can add to the very end of age.
[376.3s] Friends, the great commission is very
[378.8s] familiar to us. And in addition to the
[382.2s] reference that is in Matthew 28, we have
[385.1s] got all the also other references in the
[387.4s] other uh uh books in scripture including
[391.0s] Mark. In Mark 16 verse1 15 it says that
[398.0s] and this is Jesus who said to them Mark
[400.8s] 16:15 it says go into all the world and
[405.3s] preach the gospel to all creation that
[409.0s] is the version that is in Mark there's
[412.1s] also in Luke and if you go to Luke
[414.9s] chapter
[415.9s] 24 from verse 46 to 49 this is a long
[419.1s] reading but I'll just go to 47 seven,
[421.8s] you can fill the other uh pieces. It
[424.2s] says, "And repentance for the
[426.2s] forgiveness of sins will be preached in
[430.2s] the name in his name to all nations
[433.8s] beginning at
[435.2s] Jerusalem." That is the Luke account.
[438.3s] And then we have got the Acts account.
[440.3s] Acts 1:8. This one I think was the basis
[443.2s] of a sermon that we received on um on
[446.2s] 1st of January this year. And it says,
[449.5s] "But you will receive
[452.1s] power when the Holy Spirit comes on you,
[456.5s] and you will be my witnesses in
[459.5s] Jerusalem and in all Judea and Samaria
[463.5s] and to the ends of the
[468.4s] earth." There's also another one in
[470.6s] John, but I'll come to that later. But
[472.8s] so all these pieces, all these
[474.6s] references of the great commission when
[477.4s] when you look at them together, there
[480.6s] are certain common threads that you find
[482.6s] in each of those. Some are long, some
[484.8s] are short, but then there are common
[486.6s] threads. And I just want to quickly run
[488.6s] through those um pieces, those threads.
[491.2s] The first
[492.1s] one, they were all spoken. They were all
[495.4s] spoken after Christ had risen. Okay? And
[499.0s] you understand when Christ rose it was
[501.3s] very charged. Okay. People were
[503.6s] confused. Others would not believe that
[505.9s] actually he had risen. So it is in that
[508.8s] atmosphere highly charged uh
[512.0s] post-resurrection appearances of Christ
[514.6s] that this commission were was made. So
[518.7s] so so that's the first one I would say
[520.7s] the first thread. The second one in each
[523.9s] of those instances okay as I I I read
[527.9s] Jesus specifies the
[530.0s] responsibilities that the apostles were
[532.6s] to undertake and it's it's clear it says
[535.6s] make
[537.1s] disciples by baptizing and teaching
[541.6s] proclaiming the gospel and being
[545.0s] witnesses. Those are mentioned in all
[548.5s] those three that I mentioned including
[551.3s] um the one in Acts. Now friends, you you
[555.0s] you know that um in the early church
[558.8s] this was picked up very rapidly and
[562.2s] people really took it seriously and they
[565.4s] took it as a center center stage of the
[568.3s] evangelistic work and they did a lot in
[571.4s] terms of witnessing, proclaiming and
[574.6s] also demonstrations of power.
[577.4s] Um and also of course uh uh the outcome
[581.5s] was baptism uh which which which was
[584.2s] good and of course those ones who were
[586.0s] baptized they were guided and they were
[588.3s] nurtured to
[590.2s] maturity. So um they they became mature
[594.6s] disciples after
[596.4s] baptism that was during the early church
[598.6s] and of course things have continued to
[601.0s] flow since that time uh of course
[604.1s] variously. The third thread or point I
[607.2s] want to mention from those verses that I
[609.6s] read each of them it pointed to a kind
[614.1s] of
[615.0s] global you know international
[619.0s] audience. Um it talks about all nations
[623.5s] all all nations. Uh of course none
[627.8s] should be excluded. You see this in
[629.7s] Matthew and Luke. is all and it also
[632.4s] talks about all creation and of course
[636.2s] the ends of the earth meaning every
[639.3s] everywhere that is really the
[641.6s] scope. So those three are common in each
[645.8s] of
[647.7s] those. So friends just to come back that
[650.6s] this great commission was
[654.1s] issued as a
[656.3s] directive. It was issued as a
[659.2s] directive to
[662.8s] follow. It was issued as a command to
[669.6s] obey. It was issued as a decree to
[673.8s] execute.
[677.8s] In other
[678.9s] words, the great
[681.9s] commission is just
[684.1s] more than a personal or political
[688.8s] statement. It's not a personal or
[692.2s] political statement. It is in the
[694.7s] Bible. It has not changed ever since. It
[697.4s] will not change. It will remain and you
[700.3s] cannot change it.
[702.8s] But being a
[705.2s] command that needs to be executed, then
[707.6s] he's calling upon us to get involved. We
[709.8s] have to get involved. Unless we want to
[712.1s] disobey, which is still okay. You can
[718.2s] disobey. I know
[720.4s] that political statements
[723.2s] change. People tell us things today,
[726.6s] tomorrow they change. Some say they're
[729.6s] going to build a certain road.
[732.3s] uh which is okay. We get excited.
[734.5s] Another government comes in place. It
[736.6s] changes. It says yeah many things about
[739.9s] that particular road and so on. So we
[741.8s] remain in the same
[743.9s] situation. Political statements change.
[747.8s] This is not a political statement. It
[750.9s] will never
[753.8s] be. It comes from the resurrected
[758.2s] Christ.
[761.4s] The head of all
[764.2s] principalities and the possessor of all
[766.4s] things is the one who has given that
[772.7s] call. And friends, this I think should
[775.8s] give it enough weight for us to take it
[780.0s] seriously that if it comes from Jesus
[782.4s] Christ, the possessor of all things,
[783.7s] then who are you? What do you possess?
[786.4s] Whatever you have is because Christ has
[788.1s] given you. you know what do you possess
[791.5s] other than just
[795.3s] obeying and therefore we actually owe a
[798.2s] debt to Christ because he's the
[800.2s] possessor of all things and he has given
[802.5s] us okay and uh here we are at times
[805.8s] forgetting this is a weighty
[811.2s] matter and friends we
[813.6s] cannot call him Lord that is Jesus and
[817.6s] then take his word for granted
[820.3s] The great commission is calling upon us
[822.3s] to act and we need to
[825.4s] act and to emphasize its
[827.9s] comprehensiveness. How comprehensive is
[830.2s] this great
[832.4s] commission? It's smarked by the term
[835.2s] all. And I want just quickly run through
[837.7s] that. It says that all
[840.8s] authority, you know, it's Christ saying
[843.0s] all authority.
[845.1s] Christ assures the
[846.9s] disciples that I've got I've been given
[849.4s] all authority auth all all means
[852.2s] everything everything and I can just
[855.4s] imagine that the entire godhead is
[857.7s] behind it you know all authority in
[861.1s] heaven and on earth has been given to me
[864.2s] now if all the authority has been given
[866.7s] to Christ I think Christ has the right
[871.1s] to give orders he has got the right to
[873.5s] tell us what to
[875.7s] Since in any case he holds this earth by
[879.8s] his
[882.8s] hands. So he has the authority to make
[885.3s] orders. He has got the authority to make
[887.4s] decisions and also he has the authority
[890.8s] to enforce
[893.5s] obedience. At times we can be
[895.3s] disobedient. But you know God can
[897.0s] actually force us. He can make us to be
[899.3s] obedient and he has got ways of doing
[901.4s] that.
[905.3s] Let us
[906.8s] not test him on that particular
[911.7s] one. And this authority friends was not
[918.5s] acquired. It was not given rather to to
[921.2s] Christ. It was not stolen or snatched.
[924.6s] This an authority that came from the
[927.4s] Godhead.
[929.0s] And if you want to read more about this,
[930.4s] you can go to Philippians chapter 2
[933.3s] 9-11. I won't go through through that,
[935.5s] but for you just to have understand that
[937.4s] this was not, you know, given or
[939.7s] snatched or stolen, but it's an
[941.3s] authority that came from
[947.9s] above and therefore that this authority
[950.8s] is actually
[954.2s] primar authority that comes from MA. It
[956.6s] says a lot really in terms of how we
[959.0s] should take it and the intent that God
[962.0s] has by so making this
[965.2s] commission. He really wants the work
[967.8s] done. He really wants the work done. And
[970.3s] therefore we need to reage upon this
[972.5s] authority that Christ has you know to
[975.8s] have the work
[980.2s] done. And with this authority we are
[983.0s] sure that everything that we do in the
[985.7s] name of Christ as long as within the
[988.8s] framework of the great commission
[990.5s] friends it will work. We shouldn't
[995.9s] fear and therefore will not be let down.
[999.2s] The second all is about all nations. All
[1002.6s] nations. When Jesus said go make
[1005.7s] disciples of all nations he established
[1008.2s] the unlimited scope. It is unlimited
[1010.8s] scope of the great
[1014.9s] commission. But friends, we must pay
[1017.0s] particular attention to the call not
[1018.8s] just to go and proclaim because it's
[1022.0s] easy to go and proclaim, but we need to
[1026.2s] also make disciples of all
[1029.5s] nations. Bring people of different
[1031.7s] groups
[1032.7s] together, you
[1035.3s] know. And it should not be just among a
[1038.4s] few
[1039.9s] people because we can be tempted to say
[1042.7s] okay fine we are going to focus on a
[1044.5s] certain enclave
[1046.7s] within our
[1048.7s] area and forget that there are many
[1051.2s] other areas where such is needed. So we
[1055.2s] have to be careful and also be careful
[1057.8s] that we don't just be selective in terms
[1060.4s] of addressing the all the nations
[1065.0s] peace. And again just for a reminder
[1067.4s] that uh the great commission's
[1069.5s] fulfillment is
[1071.0s] not measured by how far you go from new
[1074.1s] life. It's not I know some think that
[1077.4s] when we go to Turkana for example and
[1080.3s] then that's now great work.
[1083.0s] Yes, we are going to toana which also
[1084.8s] they deserve to have that but remember
[1086.9s] that there's a lot that also needs to
[1088.4s] happen around here. There is so much
[1090.9s] around us. So your success is not about
[1093.3s] we went to Turukana, we went to Waja, we
[1096.0s] went to whatever. No, it's not but the
[1098.6s] quality of the fellowship okay that you
[1102.8s] um deliver. The third all is that all
[1106.2s] the
[1106.9s] commands and
[1109.9s] uh and Jesus is very clear. says that
[1113.3s] teach them all his commands.
[1117.5s] Um, in other words, don't be selective.
[1120.2s] The commands are there. We know the
[1121.8s] commands. But don't be selective which
[1123.7s] command you are able to deliver. Deliver
[1126.2s] all the the
[1130.0s] commands and the commands that I have
[1132.9s] commanded you. The fourth and final all
[1136.7s] uh is all the way. And he says
[1140.8s] that and and Christ actually wraps it
[1143.4s] this way. Uh and he says that I will be
[1146.6s] with you. Um I am with you always up to
[1150.8s] the end of time. That is all the way.
[1155.2s] Um he has promised of course his
[1157.6s] followers that he will be present. But
[1159.9s] this implies that there's going to be
[1161.7s] continuity. We don't know when the end
[1164.3s] is going to come. Okay? Because as our
[1167.5s] life is short, okay? We don't know when
[1169.8s] it will come. But then there's going to
[1171.8s] be continuity. When our time comes and
[1173.9s] we go, there are others who will pick it
[1175.6s] up and continue and so on. So Christ
[1177.7s] will be there all the
[1181.9s] way. So this is where I want to take a
[1185.0s] bit of
[1186.0s] time to address the issue of I am with
[1190.6s] you always.
[1192.6s] I am with you
[1194.7s] always even to the end of time. This
[1198.1s] phrase is very comforting. When you hear
[1200.6s] it, when you read it, you say, "Yeah,
[1202.1s] Christ will be with me." It's very
[1203.3s] comforting, isn't it? And really, we
[1205.5s] should take it as such. In other words,
[1207.9s] no matter what happens to
[1210.0s] us, no matter what sales, we will
[1213.6s] always, you know, will not fear. We we
[1216.6s] really be successful because Christ is
[1218.8s] with us all the way.
[1222.5s] And with this statement of course comes
[1224.2s] that the certainty of uh this you know
[1227.5s] the prestige because Christ is there
[1229.4s] everything we do is good anyway Christ
[1231.6s] cannot lead us to bad places and also
[1234.2s] the power behind you know his presence
[1237.4s] remember all authority has been given to
[1243.3s] me as much as it's this statement is
[1247.5s] really reassuring
[1250.6s] Um but more importantly is that it it
[1254.2s] works
[1255.2s] within a plan. You know Christ cannot or
[1259.5s] God cannot be in a place without a plan.
[1261.4s] What would he be doing there? You know
[1263.3s] there has to be a plan for him to be
[1271.6s] present. God is not an idler. Okay.
[1275.4s] right now is extremely busy as he takes
[1277.3s] care of the 8 billion people in this
[1279.5s] world to make sure that they breathing
[1281.5s] oxygen they are fed you know they are
[1285.0s] surviving that alone is massive is never
[1288.8s] idle and therefore he operates within a
[1294.0s] plan or some purpose and therefore is
[1298.1s] ever present our presence is the
[1301.1s] greatest opportunity that we have it's
[1303.4s] available to us And I just don't know
[1305.9s] how many of us really exploit this that
[1308.7s] Christ is present all the time. How many
[1311.0s] exploit that? At times we forget but
[1314.2s] Christ is the resource that we have all
[1316.7s] the time available anytime you need when
[1319.7s] you don't have money Christ is there you
[1322.6s] know Christ is there so this is the
[1324.8s] resource but how many of us are really
[1328.0s] taking advantage of that and exploiting
[1331.0s] this resource how
[1336.5s] many so what does this mean in terms of
[1340.4s] implementing the great commission
[1343.7s] uh that Christ will be always with us.
[1347.2s] And I want to take a few minutes as I
[1348.6s] close just to pinpoint seven points that
[1352.1s] um will carry home. The first one and
[1354.6s] very obvious when Christ say that I will
[1356.7s] be with you all the time. In other
[1357.8s] words, he's
[1358.8s] present. I mean don't doubt he is
[1362.2s] present. When he says I'll be with you
[1364.4s] all the time, he means he will be
[1367.0s] present. In other words, Christ will be
[1369.8s] present when you are preparing your
[1372.1s] strategic plan. Christ will be present
[1374.6s] when you are implementing it. He will be
[1377.0s] present as you are winning souls. He
[1379.4s] will be present as you, you know, as you
[1381.4s] are baptizing them. He will be present
[1385.0s] as you nurture them, you know, to
[1387.4s] maturity. Christ is ever present. In
[1390.9s] other words, don't doubt. He's ever
[1394.2s] present.
[1396.2s] So the second point his
[1400.0s] presence reassures us that we are well
[1403.8s] resourced and remember I said is the
[1405.8s] primary source but we are also well
[1407.6s] resourced. Did you know
[1410.4s] that? I know quite often we we fail to
[1413.5s] initiate evangelistic campaigns uh or
[1416.4s] activities because we claim to lack
[1418.4s] resources. Mostly we we say we don't
[1420.6s] have money.
[1422.5s] Money is
[1423.6s] not and will never be the greatest
[1426.3s] resource. It will
[1428.5s] never. And if you think it will, it will
[1431.1s] never. It's there. I know some of us are
[1433.7s] struggling to get that money, but it
[1435.2s] will never okay. Uh be the greatest
[1438.0s] resource. But it's also good to have
[1443.1s] money. But that should not be the first
[1445.5s] thing we front. Like we cannot go for
[1447.7s] evangelistic campaigns just because
[1449.3s] there's no money. No, that is wrong. We
[1453.4s] cannot plan because we don't have money.
[1456.0s] No, that is
[1460.4s] wrong. Actually, I don't know how much
[1463.0s] money the disciples had when they doing
[1465.7s] evangelistic work, you know, during the
[1468.3s] early church. How much money they have?
[1470.7s] How much money did Paul have?
[1473.6s] We How much was he making from the tents
[1475.8s] that he was making? You know, that took
[1478.3s] him to the places that he
[1482.1s] went how much did he have? I doubt if he
[1486.3s] had money, maybe it wasn't much. Okay?
[1488.8s] And therefore, money should not be the
[1490.9s] first thing. But let me tell you, the
[1493.3s] biggest resource other than Christ that
[1495.8s] we have is you and me. Did you know
[1498.4s] that? Did you know that you are the
[1500.5s] biggest resource? Your mere presence is
[1505.4s] enough but you find you are here and you
[1508.0s] are struggling with the money and yet
[1509.3s] you are a bigger resource than than
[1511.9s] money. So the biggest resource is you
[1516.2s] and me and of course you need the Holy
[1520.4s] Spirit to guide
[1524.8s] us. But more importantly is that we need
[1527.2s] the Holy Spirit friends to empower us to
[1530.1s] implement the work commissioned unto us.
[1533.0s] Often we struggle in our evangelistic
[1535.4s] work because we never invite the Holy
[1539.1s] Spirit that he may give us the power
[1541.2s] that we need. We lack a lot of power at
[1543.8s] times.
[1546.0s] We need to allow the Holy Spirit that he
[1549.7s] may guide us, he may dwell in us, he may
[1553.5s] empower us and through the Holy Spirit
[1555.8s] all will be well. Again, I'm saying this
[1558.5s] in the context of implementing the great
[1560.5s] commission. And here we have a strategic
[1564.5s] plan which is coming which will be
[1566.8s] launched in a short while. You are the
[1570.6s] biggest resource other than Christ. You
[1573.1s] are the biggest resource. Forget about
[1575.1s] money. Money will come but it starts
[1577.4s] with
[1579.8s] you. The third
[1582.1s] point about his
[1584.5s] presence. His presence and his ever
[1588.6s] available presence reminds us that this
[1592.5s] work is
[1593.9s] delegated. You know we can easily forget
[1597.2s] and think that the great commission
[1600.1s] uh is delegated. you know is given to us
[1602.9s] as a privilege you know yes it is a
[1605.7s] privilege but but it is a call that come
[1608.6s] and partner with me to do this work it
[1611.0s] is God who's calling us to in you know
[1614.5s] partner with him to do this work and for
[1616.4s] us indeed it's a privilege yes it is a
[1619.0s] privilege and we should take it as such
[1620.8s] and that's why we need to hold on to it
[1623.9s] but it is delegated
[1628.0s] work if God delegated work to us you
[1631.2s] know it could have done this great
[1632.3s] commission by the way but he has asked
[1633.8s] us to do it if he could then how about
[1636.5s] you and me delegating the work also at
[1641.1s] times uh I
[1643.7s] know delegating can be difficult
[1648.0s] [Music]
[1650.8s] um we struggle with
[1653.3s] it I want to believe that uh for those
[1656.6s] ones who have worked in places and uh
[1661.4s] you yeah you must have exp experienced
[1664.3s] this how people struggle to delegate at
[1666.4s] times I worked in government for seven
[1668.4s] years after after university for 7 years
[1671.3s] but those seven years I was able to
[1674.2s] observe certain things that was in
[1676.2s] government and then I the rest of the 30
[1679.8s] or so years I worked after that I was
[1681.4s] with the non-government organizations
[1683.2s] but I will tell you one thing people
[1685.5s] struggle with delegating
[1690.4s] attack someone doesn't want to go on
[1696.3s] leave he has got 21 I don't know 30
[1700.1s] days and files and when he's forced to
[1704.8s] go
[1708.4s] and what is this that you are
[1711.4s] hiding delegation is night when you go
[1713.8s] and leave delegate to the other people
[1715.2s] they will continue the work that's the
[1716.6s] continuity we are talking
[1718.8s] out people struggle. I'm sure you have
[1721.6s] experienced those ones who are working
[1723.9s] how people struggle with this. There are
[1726.2s] things they want to hide when they don't
[1729.4s] want to go and leave because they feel
[1731.1s] that when they go and leave somebody's
[1732.7s] going to come in an acting capacity and
[1735.4s] probably that person will do a better
[1737.2s] job and they will be confirmed in that
[1739.1s] position.
[1740.8s] you
[1742.0s] know such it is but anyway let's go to
[1745.0s] the Bible and let's learn something
[1747.1s] about delegation here Exodus 18 Exodus
[1750.6s] 18 from from um verse 13- 27 I won't
[1755.4s] read this but this is a a very common
[1758.1s] story that can help us learn how to
[1760.9s] delegate now this is the story about
[1764.8s] Moses's father-in-law Jethro uh and I'll
[1768.7s] just par paraphrase is he planned to
[1772.3s] visit uh his son-in-law Moses in the
[1775.8s] wilderness wherever Moses was at that
[1777.7s] time and in the process of course he
[1781.2s] also planned to take along Moses his
[1784.0s] wife and the two children for the
[1786.6s] visit the father-in-law did inform Moses
[1790.6s] that he was
[1792.1s] coming in and informed him in
[1795.3s] advance which is a good
[1799.8s] Jetro, I must say, was a good
[1803.6s] father-in-law. Indeed, a good
[1805.3s] father-in-law
[1806.4s] because you know at times you need to
[1810.0s] inform your children when you are
[1812.1s] coming. Father-in-laws who are here and
[1814.2s] mother-in-laws, you need to inform your
[1816.2s] children when you are coming from the
[1817.6s] village or wherever to visit them. At
[1819.9s] times you throw people off.
[1822.5s] But Jethro, he informed the sonin-law in
[1825.9s] advance he was coming and therefore
[1827.5s] Moses must have prepared. Let's learn
[1830.5s] something from there also.
[1832.0s] Father-in-laws, let us be informing
[1834.6s] people. Anyway, when Jethro came on the
[1838.0s] second day, he did observe how the how
[1841.0s] Moses was uh serving the people as he
[1844.7s] was doing the judging, you know, very
[1847.5s] overzealous. He was the teacher, he was
[1850.4s] the problem solver, he was everything
[1852.7s] you know and in the process you know he
[1855.1s] kept people waiting. is overworked as he
[1859.8s] judges, as he teaches, as he solves
[1862.4s] problems. He is also overworked. At the
[1865.6s] same time, the people who want to be
[1867.0s] served is a long
[1868.4s] queue. And the father in observed and
[1871.3s] told him, you know,
[1872.8s] Moses, what you are doing is not right.
[1875.5s] And of course, he advised him on what he
[1878.3s] needed to
[1881.3s] do. And I want to believe that when
[1883.8s] Moses was advised, you can get that
[1885.6s] story and read more about it. Moses's
[1887.9s] performance must improve. Therefore,
[1889.8s] delegation is important. Okay? Even as
[1892.6s] we go into implementing the strategic
[1894.8s] plan that is coming, please let's think
[1896.4s] about delegation. Let's not carry
[1898.6s] everything on our own. We become
[1900.8s] ineffective. You know, when we are just
[1903.3s] handling wholly everything selfishly at
[1906.6s] times, no, it doesn't help and more so
[1910.8s] not in God's work.
[1914.4s] Delegation is important and indeed like
[1917.3s] I said this work is delegated to us and
[1921.2s] because Christ has delegated it to us
[1923.4s] let us also learn to delegate. Number
[1927.2s] four of
[1929.2s] seven. His presence is a reminder of the
[1932.4s] time scope of our engagement. His
[1935.1s] presence reminds us about the time that
[1938.2s] we have to engage. He says, "I will
[1941.5s] always be with you until the end of
[1943.2s] time." It conotes one thing uh that this
[1947.0s] commission has an end. It's going to end
[1949.4s] at some point. Okay? But our
[1951.9s] participation, we don't know. But it
[1953.5s] will end when we die. Okay? Or we become
[1955.8s] too old or whatever or when we are
[1957.8s] unable to to do it.
[1962.5s] However much we get convicted friends
[1964.6s] convicted in doing this work uh one
[1967.9s] thing I'll tell you for
[1970.3s] sure it's going to come to an end
[1973.3s] somehow we don't have much
[1976.4s] time we
[1978.8s] don't some of us are now 65 years and
[1982.9s] over but just a few years ago I thought
[1985.8s] I was a young person you know uh those
[1989.1s] mountains that is planning for us to
[1991.1s] climb
[1993.8s] Uh yeah those mountains that we will be
[1996.2s] climbing in May that's nothing we never
[1998.7s] been scared but now you think about it
[2001.9s] twice okay it's not you have to prepare
[2005.5s] and prepare well but that is it time is
[2008.4s] not on our side friends it's not on our
[2010.4s] side and therefore let us not
[2014.4s] procrastinate let us not procrastinate
[2016.6s] thinking that yes I'll do it tomorrow
[2018.2s] because I have time tomorrow may never
[2020.5s] even come for you. It may never come for
[2023.0s] me. Okay. Tomorrow you realize that the
[2025.1s] energy that you used to have is no more.
[2028.5s] You realize that there are things you
[2029.9s] used to do but now you cannot do them.
[2032.6s] That is the change that happens and it
[2035.1s] happens so fast. And therefore let us
[2037.4s] not procrastinate. I know pro
[2039.9s] procrastination is a one of the sin of
[2042.6s] omissions. You can you want to read that
[2044.5s] is in James 4:17 where it says therefore
[2048.1s] to him who knows to do good and does not
[2050.9s] do it to him it is sin procrastination
[2055.6s] is sin and therefore just for us to know
[2059.2s] that we don't have much time and
[2062.1s] um and therefore let's just cut all of
[2064.7s] the time that we have right now the time
[2067.0s] we launch the strategic plan let us get
[2070.2s] up something from it and let
[2073.0s] move for the next 5 years if we'll be
[2075.3s] alive. We don't know you know five five
[2078.4s] years you think is it's a long time it
[2081.0s] can be a short time and at times
[2082.7s] probably you cannot even hit it all
[2084.6s] right so let us just do the best I can I
[2087.0s] like this comment that I read somewhere
[2089.1s] and it's about pro procrastination
[2092.3s] um it really interested me I'll just
[2094.6s] read it says when we
[2098.4s] procrastinate we put off something
[2100.7s] important in exchange for doing
[2103.5s] something else even if that thing is
[2107.4s] nothing at all. That really interested
[2110.9s] me. Just think about it technically then
[2113.8s] what this statement is saying that if
[2116.3s] you choose to do
[2119.7s] nothing you are still choosing to do
[2122.6s] something that if you choose to do
[2124.7s] nothing you are still choosing to do
[2126.6s] something but I don't want us to go that
[2128.4s] way okay otherwise then we are we are
[2131.4s] going to be in that category of busy
[2133.6s] bodies in church you know those busy
[2136.4s] bodies they are all over but you don't
[2138.6s] see anything that they are doing they
[2140.2s] criticizing things left, right and
[2142.1s] center. when somebody starts an
[2143.5s] initiative today somebody's trying lead
[2145.9s] guided by the Holy Spirit but they are
[2147.7s] punching it punching it you know those
[2151.4s] busy bodies our classrooms here we
[2153.4s] really when uh in 2023 I know a lot of
[2156.8s] effort energy thank you to thank you
[2159.0s] members for the children classrooms but
[2161.4s] you know the criticism that came from
[2164.2s] there you know instead of appreciating
[2166.6s] and saying oh we have done this within
[2168.5s] our abilities that busy bodies they just
[2171.7s] wanted to tear people apart, you know,
[2174.1s] kill people. Okay. And really we have
[2176.8s] tried but anyway they are there and they
[2178.7s] are being used. Number five of
[2181.8s] seven as I close. Number five of seven
[2185.8s] it
[2187.6s] says you should know should you should
[2190.5s] his presence therefore means that you
[2192.2s] should not fear or worry. Um friends I
[2196.1s] know at times when you feel that Jesus
[2197.6s] Christ is with us and and particularly
[2199.4s] when we are not doing things right we
[2201.1s] start fearing and saying oh now Christ
[2203.6s] is seeing me Christ is seeing me but his
[2205.6s] presence should not evoke that fear we
[2208.1s] should not fear. I know we are seen as
[2210.5s] at times we do the wrong things. Okay.
[2213.1s] But we should not fear and more so in
[2216.9s] the context of implementing the you know
[2219.5s] the strategic plan or the work of God um
[2222.6s] that we have before we should not feel
[2224.8s] guilty and um rather his presence should
[2228.6s] help us. It should spare us as his
[2231.8s] disciples to proclaim the good news of
[2234.9s] uh the presence of his kingdom in us. I
[2238.3s] know that fear is a common obstacle. At
[2241.8s] times we fear that we not be able to
[2244.2s] implement because we are not okay maybe
[2248.2s] because the work is difficult. Okay. Or
[2251.3s] I am not worthy to do it. Uh you know
[2255.0s] all those fears I am inadequate and so
[2257.8s] on. You know those fears that uh that
[2260.6s] come um and at times these fears can
[2263.5s] lead us into inaction.
[2265.7s] um of course hindering us from the work
[2268.2s] of God and particularly the work of
[2269.9s] spread the work of spreading the gospel
[2272.2s] and of course making of disciples. Um
[2275.4s] but we can overcome this and uh
[2278.4s] friends with the Holy
[2281.6s] Spirit working in us and directing us we
[2285.9s] will be able to overcome. We just need
[2289.8s] to rely on the Holy Spirit. Then quickly
[2292.7s] number six of seven what his presence
[2296.1s] means to us. Number six of
[2299.6s] seven that we should be obedient and
[2302.9s] faithful. You
[2305.0s] remember I said that Christ without
[2308.1s] authority can actually enforce
[2310.3s] discipline. He can actually enforce
[2312.5s] obedience. If you are disobedient, yes,
[2315.0s] you can. Maybe not for too long. God,
[2318.9s] Jesus can just turn things around and
[2322.2s] then and he will deal with you. Okay? Of
[2324.6s] course, in a good way. All right? So
[2326.6s] that you can come back to to track. We
[2330.3s] need to be obedient because we are in
[2334.2s] his uh presence. Obedience to the great
[2337.8s] commission. It means that we just need
[2339.6s] to follow God's instruction. The
[2341.1s] instructions have been given to us. We
[2343.9s] need just to make disciples of all
[2345.8s] nations. And um this basically just
[2348.8s] requires a willingness on our part to
[2351.4s] step outside our comfort zones. I know
[2354.0s] new life at times we stick too much into
[2356.8s] our comfort zones. You know we don't
[2358.2s] want to go out. I I struggle you know
[2362.1s] I've been head elder for 4 years. I hope
[2366.0s] that I will not again continue because
[2368.1s] now because of my age. Uh please don't
[2371.0s] consider that. But let me tell you one
[2373.0s] thing. Do you know that even elders
[2376.9s] getting elders to do some
[2379.2s] work like been struggling to send an
[2382.4s] elder to the new Sabbath school the one
[2386.2s] in Kaji do you know getting an elder
[2389.4s] just to go and serve it's so difficult
[2392.0s] people are busy I don't know what they
[2393.5s] are doing you
[2395.6s] know this is what we are talking
[2399.3s] about that you know let us do the work.
[2404.3s] If you are willing or you agreed to be
[2408.0s] an L in this church, then just be open
[2410.0s] to work. If you agree to become a deacon
[2413.4s] or a deconness in this church, then be
[2416.2s] ready to work. When your leaders tell
[2418.1s] you there's some work to do here, go.
[2421.2s] But at times we struggle. This comfort
[2423.0s] zone that we are talking about friends
[2425.4s] in this
[2427.2s] church will not help us. We need to get
[2430.1s] out of that. And my prayer is really is
[2432.7s] that as we get into the new strategic
[2435.3s] plan that we will all be committed when
[2437.4s] people are called upon to work let us be
[2440.2s] able to do so. And faithfulness also the
[2443.3s] second part of it it involves
[2445.6s] persevering in the task of making
[2448.5s] disciples even when faced with
[2450.3s] challenges or even setbacks you know.
[2454.1s] Yeah. Let's just persevere. At times it
[2456.9s] can be difficult. At times we don't have
[2459.4s] money. At times it's this way or that
[2461.8s] way. Let us persevere and that is
[2467.2s] faithfulness. We have to remain
[2469.5s] steadfast in one's commitment in sharing
[2473.4s] the gospel. Without that commitment then
[2476.1s] of course our faith would be dead before
[2479.1s] knowing it.
[2481.7s] Friends, the seventh and
[2484.7s] final
[2486.8s] observation
[2488.4s] from the statement that I am with you
[2491.8s] always till the end of time is
[2496.3s] about reminding us of the blessings that
[2502.4s] follow. Did you know that you can be
[2506.2s] blessed? Did you know that once you do
[2509.3s] God's work and complete it that actually
[2512.0s] there are blessings that come with it?
[2514.3s] Did you know that? You know, I want to
[2518.1s] remind you and I want us
[2522.0s] to read first John, no, John uh 17
[2527.9s] verse1-5. John 17 1-5. And for this one,
[2532.5s] I'm just going to read. Okay. Um it it
[2537.3s] reads Jesus spoke these words, lifted up
[2541.0s] his eyes to heaven and said, "Father,
[2543.4s] the hour has come. Glorify your son that
[2546.3s] your son also may glorify you. As you
[2550.2s] have given him authority over all flesh,
[2553.4s] that he should give eternal life to as
[2556.5s] many as you have given him." And this is
[2560.8s] eternal life that they may know you. the
[2564.6s] only true God and Jesus Christ whom you
[2569.0s] have
[2570.0s] sent. I like verse four which says that
[2574.5s] father and this is Jesus saying I have
[2577.2s] glorified you on the earth. I have
[2580.6s] finished the work which you gave me to
[2584.4s] do. And now, oh father, glorify me
[2586.8s] together with yourself with the glory
[2590.3s] which I had with you before the world
[2595.0s] was you know here you know here Jesus
[2599.5s] God is asking God the father to glorify
[2603.4s] him but he's giving a reason he's saying
[2605.9s] because I have completed that which you
[2608.2s] send me to do. You don't ask to be
[2611.5s] glorified. You don't ask to be blessed,
[2613.8s] you know, for you and me when you have
[2615.7s] actually done
[2616.8s] nothing or you were given a task and
[2619.8s] then you did it halfway and then you
[2622.2s] disappeared. You abandoned it and then
[2624.9s] you expect blessings. They wouldn't
[2626.8s] come.
[2629.0s] Jesus completed that which the father
[2632.3s] sent him to
[2633.8s] do
[2635.3s] and he was right to ask his father to
[2641.7s] glorify him and therefore friends it's
[2645.2s] important that whatever we start we
[2648.2s] finish let's not do things halfway I
[2651.7s] know in our church we have pieces here
[2654.1s] and there that are incomplete many many
[2657.4s] pieces here and there that are
[2658.9s] incomplete. I just want to pray that as
[2661.0s] we get into the new dispensation of the
[2663.2s] new strategic plan that indeed whatever
[2666.2s] we start we see it
[2668.5s] through that way and then we'll glorify
[2671.5s] God and we'll also be blessed without it
[2674.8s] and then we'll just be stuck in mad
[2676.5s] friends. Okay. And I know even in your
[2679.7s] personal life there are certain things
[2681.4s] you started that you are
[2683.5s] not eh they have been hanging h seek the
[2687.5s] holy spirit to guide you okay and you
[2690.2s] will see uh everything completed and
[2693.7s] once they completed then of course we
[2695.2s] will glorify
[2696.4s] lord therefore we can also be blessed by
[2700.1s] completing the work and as I conclude
[2704.5s] um let us remember one thing that Jesus
[2707.7s] Christ our Lord is always with
[2710.8s] us. He's always with us as we implement
[2713.4s] the work. He's never far. He's the
[2716.1s] nearest resource that we have. And um he
[2720.2s] will support us as long as we seek him
[2724.0s] all the time. And uh like we mentioned
[2727.7s] today, we are commissioning the

[2749.9s] a strategic plan that we are going to
[2751.4s] implement for the next 5 years. It's
[2754.0s] important. Please members find a place

[2778.7s] inform and empower us. With that, I
[2783.4s] would want to invite
