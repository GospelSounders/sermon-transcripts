FULL TRANSCRIPT:
[Music] All things work for a good though sometimes we don't see how they could. Struggles that break our hearts into sometimes blind us to the truth. Our father knows what's best for us. His ways are not our own. So when the pathway grows dim and you just can't see him, remember you're never alone. God is too wise to be mistaken. And God is too good to be unkind. So when you don't understand, when you don't see his plan, when you can't trace his hand, trust his heart. [Music] He sees the master plan and he holds the future in his hand. So don't leave us those who have no hope. All our hope is found in him. We see the present clearly. But his first and the last. And like a testing you and me to someday be just like him. [Music] God is too wise to be mistaken. when God is too good to be unkind. So when you don't understand, when you don't see his plan, when you can't trace his hand, trust his heart. He alone is faithful and true. And he alone knows what's best for you. [Music] God is too wise to be mistaken and God is too good to be unkind. So when you don't understand, when you don't see his fled, when you can't trace his hand, trust his heart. [Music] When you don't understand, when you don't see his plan, and when you can't trace his hand, trust his heart. [Music] [Music]
