FULL TRANSCRIPT:
[Music] I'm getting [Music] Happy Sabbath, church. Happy day. Happy day. Happy Sabbath. My name is Malawa and today we have something very exciting for the children's sermon. It is a skit entitled the bold request. Welcome Alexander the Great. A man known for conquering nations and winning countless battles. A fierce and matched warrior. But what many didn't know was that he had a soft spot, a heart full of compassion. Once in a year he would open his palace gate to the people of his kingdom. Anyone could ask for help, food, clothing, healing, justice. And Alexander would listen. Come forth. Come forth. If you have a need, make it known. The king is listening. My king, I have no food for my children who have gone two days without eating. Let her house be filled with grain and fruit. Feed them for the rest of the month. Your Majesty, my wife is in the hospital. We cannot afford a treatment. Her bills shall be paid in full. Let the best physicians attend to her. My king, my son has been wrongly in prison. Please review his case. Justice will be done. His case will be reopened immediately. My king, my family has been putting on tone clothes for a long time. Please provide us with garments. Each of your family members will be given six new pairs of clothes. Alien take their measurements. Your Majesty, your compassion knows no end. Yes, young man. What is your request? Tell the king I want a palace. A palace? Surely you are joking. Ask for food or clothes or money, something realistic. No, I want a well vanished palace. A place I can live freely and play with my friends. This is shocking. The king helps the needy, not the greedy. Just tell the king. That's what I want. What is the matter, Elon? He he he's asking for a palace, your majesty. Your request is granted. But why my king? Everyone today asked for food, clothes, or money. Things that even ordinary people could give. But this young man, he asked for something that only I, the king, could provide. He believed that I was that powerful, that generous, and that makes me proud. The young man received his paralace, a grand beautiful home filled with joy, laughter, and comfort. He dared to quest the king with a bold request, and the king honored his boldness. How often do we bring our small worries to God, but hide the big ones? How often do we forget that our king, Jesus Christ, can handle everything? He doesn't just provide food and clothing. He heals. He restores. He saves. He is powerful. And that's rock solid. Is there anything too hard for the Lord? So today, bring your biggest fears, your deepest trails, your wildest dreams, and trust him because only he can handle the impossible. My God is rock. That's rocking. Amen. Are you

[68.8s] Welcome Alexander the Great. A man known
[72.6s] for conquering nations and winning
[74.6s] countless battles. A fierce and matched
[77.0s] warrior. But what many didn't know was
[79.0s] that he had a soft spot, a heart full of
[81.8s] compassion. Once in a year he would open
[84.5s] his palace gate to the people of his
[86.2s] kingdom. Anyone could ask for help,
[88.9s] food, clothing, healing, justice. And
[92.0s] Alexander would
[94.4s] listen. Come forth. Come forth. If you
[98.5s] have a need, make it known. The king is

[213.4s] you are joking. Ask for food or clothes
[217.2s] or money, something realistic.
[222.1s] No, I want a well vanished palace. A
[226.0s] place I can live freely and play with my
[228.2s] friends. This is
[230.8s] shocking. The king helps the needy, not

[306.6s] king honored his
[308.2s] boldness. How often do we bring our
[311.4s] small worries to God, but hide the big

[318.7s] everything?
[320.7s] He doesn't just provide food and
[322.7s] clothing. He heals. He restores. He
