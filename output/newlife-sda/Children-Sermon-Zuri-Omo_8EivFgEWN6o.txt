FULL TRANSCRIPT:
Happy day. My name is Zuri Omo. I'm going to be doing the children's story. Before we start, let us pray. Dear God, thank you for this day. Thank you for protecting us and guiding us. As I said, as I said this children's story, please may you protect me and guide me in Jesus name I pray. Amen. The title of our story is pancakes. Six-year-old Dan decided one Saturday morning to fix his parents' pancakes. He found a bowl and spoon, pulled out a chair to the counter, opened the cupboard, and pulled out the heavy flour canister, spilling it on the floor. He scooped some of the flour into the bowl with his hands, mixed in most of a cup of milk and added some sugar, leaving a flurry trail on the floor, which by now had a few tracks left by his kitten. Dan was covered with flour and getting frustrated. He wanted to this to be something very good for mom and dad, but it was getting very bad. He did not know what to do next, whether to put it all in the oven or on the stove, and he did not know how the stove worked. Suddenly, he saw his kitten leaking from the bowl of mix and reached to push her away, knocking the egg carton on the floor. Frantically, he tried to clean up the this mental mess, but spilled on the eggs, getting his pajamas white and sticky. Just then, he saw Dad standing at the door. Big crocodile tears welled up in Dan's eyes. All he wanted to do was something good, but he had made a terrible mess. He was sure a scolding was coming, maybe even a spanking. His father just watched him. Then walking through the mess, he picked up his grandson, hugged him, and loved him, getting his own pajamas white and sticky in the process. That's how God deals with us. We try to do something good in life, but it turns into a mess. Our marriage gets all sticky. We insult a friend. We can't stand our job or our health goes sour. Sometimes we just stand in there in tears because we can't think of anything else to do. That's when God picks us up and loves us and forgives us even though some of our mess gets all over him. be but be but just because we might mess up. We can't stop trying for God or for others.

TIMESTAMPED TRANSCRIPT:
[0.2s] Happy day.
[2.6s] My name is Zuri Omo. I'm going to be
[4.7s] doing the children's story. Before we
[7.0s] start, let us pray. Dear God, thank you
[9.8s] for this day. Thank you for protecting
[11.4s] us and guiding us. As I said, as I said
[14.2s] this children's story, please may you
[16.6s] protect me and guide me in Jesus name I
[18.6s] pray. Amen. The title of our story is
[23.2s] pancakes. Six-year-old Dan decided one
[25.9s] Saturday morning to fix his parents'
[27.8s] pancakes. He found a bowl and spoon,
[31.5s] pulled out a chair to the counter,
[33.5s] opened the cupboard, and pulled out the
[35.6s] heavy flour canister, spilling it on the
[38.0s] floor. He scooped some of the flour into
[41.1s] the bowl with his hands, mixed in most
[45.2s] of a cup of milk and added some sugar,
[49.8s] leaving a flurry trail on the floor,
[51.8s] which by now had a few tracks left by
[55.3s] his kitten. Dan was covered with flour
[58.5s] and getting frustrated. He wanted to
[61.8s] this to be something very good for mom
[63.9s] and dad, but it was getting very bad. He
[67.4s] did not know what to do next, whether to
[70.2s] put it all in the oven or on the stove,
[74.0s] and he did not know how the stove
[77.8s] worked. Suddenly, he saw his kitten
[80.6s] leaking from the bowl of
[83.4s] mix and reached to push her away,
[87.3s] knocking the egg carton on the floor.
[90.8s] Frantically, he tried to clean up the
[94.3s] this mental mess, but spilled on the
[98.4s] eggs, getting his pajamas white and
[100.8s] sticky. Just then, he saw Dad standing
[103.8s] at the door. Big crocodile tears welled
[106.6s] up in Dan's eyes.
[108.7s] All he wanted to do was something good,
[110.9s] but he had made a terrible mess. He was
[114.0s] sure a scolding was coming, maybe even a
[117.0s] spanking. His father just watched him.
[119.9s] Then walking through the mess, he picked
[122.2s] up his grandson, hugged him, and loved
[124.5s] him, getting his own pajamas white and
[127.1s] sticky in the process. That's how God
[129.5s] deals with us. We try to do something
[132.9s] good in life, but it turns into a mess.
[136.9s] Our marriage gets all sticky. We insult
[139.9s] a friend. We can't stand our job or our
[143.7s] health goes sour. Sometimes we just
[147.1s] stand in there in tears because we can't
[150.0s] think of anything else to do. That's
[152.8s] when God picks us up and loves us and
[156.1s] forgives us even though some of our mess
[159.9s] gets all over him. be but be but just
[163.9s] because we might mess up. We can't stop
[167.3s] trying for God or for others. Sooner or
[170.3s] later, we'll get it right. And then
[173.0s] they'll be glad we tried.
[177.1s] Amen. I I now have a song to sing
[180.1s] entitled Yet Not I, but through Christ
[182.2s] in me.
[188.7s] [Music]
[201.3s] What gift of grace is Jesus my
[207.1s] redeemer? There is no
[209.7s] more for heaven now to give.
[215.0s] is my joy, my righteousness and
[220.5s] freom, my steadfast love, my deep and
[225.4s] boundless
[227.3s] peace. To this I hope my hope is only
[234.5s] Jesus. For my life is holy bound to his.
[242.3s] Oh, how strange and divine. I can see.
[247.4s] All is blind, yet I through Christ in
[255.0s] [Music]

[256.6s] [Music]
[264.4s] me. The night is dark, but I am not
[269.7s] forsaken.
[272.2s] For by my side the favor he will
[278.0s] fail. I labor all in weakness and
[284.8s] rejoicing for lead my need. His power is
[290.1s] his
[291.6s] place. To this I hope my shepherd will
[296.8s] defend me.
[300.3s] and
[302.4s] glorious to
[305.6s] thee. When the runes are come, I can
[310.7s] feel I will yet
[314.3s] not through Christ in me.
[320.2s] [Music]
[329.6s] No faith I dread. I know I am
[335.4s] forgi. The future sure the price it has
[340.5s] been
[341.9s] paid. for
[344.4s] Jesus and suffered for my
[348.5s] pardon. And he was raised to over the
[355.2s] grave. To this I hope my sin has been
[362.0s] defeated. Jesus now and ever live.
[369.6s] Though the chains are released, I can
[373.7s] see I am free at the land through Christ
[380.0s] in
[382.6s] [Music]
[391.2s] me. needed every breath. I long to
[395.9s] follow
[397.8s] Jesus for he I say that he will bring me
[404.4s] home. And day by day I know he will
[409.6s] renew
[411.1s] me until I stand with joy before the
[416.4s] Lord.
[418.6s] To this I hope my hope is only
[424.6s] Jesus. All the
[427.1s] glory ever to
[431.2s] me and the race complete till my lips
[437.0s] shall repeat yet.
[445.0s] To this I have my heart in
[451.0s] Jesus. All the
[453.3s] glory ever to
[457.4s] me. When the grace is complete till my
[462.4s] lips shall repeat and
[466.0s] not through Christ.
[471.2s] to this I
[473.9s] hope and it shall repeat. Yet not I, but
[480.0s] through Christ in
[483.6s] me. Yet not I, but through Christ in
[490.2s] me. Yet not I, but through Christ in me.
