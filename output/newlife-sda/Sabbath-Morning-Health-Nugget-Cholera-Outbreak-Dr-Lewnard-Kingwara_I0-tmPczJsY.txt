FULL TRANSCRIPT:
Happy Sabbath. Uh good morning. I think we can settle and then we start our health nugget sessions. Okay. So, uh in this week uh health uh health discussion, we would want to discuss a topical issue which is which is with us. It's about the current color outbreak that we have in the country. I'll start by introducing my name. I'm Dr. Leonard Kinwara. I work for an institution called the Kenya National Public Health Institute. Uh it's a semi- autonomous institution uh within the ministry of health established under the presidential legal order. Uh it's the institution that's in charge of the health security in the country. Uh but I want us to uh to discuss on cholera and uh the first thing is to understand what is what is cholera. It's good to know that it's a severe dal disease. It's caused by an organism called vibro and uh the symptoms that you should watch whether you have it your brother your sister uh is a watery diarrhea the stomach pains uh or you or vomiting. So if you have those specific symptoms, if your neighbor, your brother, your sister has any of those symptoms, if not treated quickly, it can lead to dehydration and even death. So that means that you should immediately go to the nearest facility so that you can be diagnosed to verify whether you have cholera or not. And how is this colera spread? uh it spread when one eats uh food or water which is contaminated by the organism that causes cholera and uh some of the places in the country that currently have kolera. Uh we have Nairobi County, we have Kisumu County and we have Migori County. So those cases have have experienced uh a heightened number of kolera cases in Nairobi. It is spread through Kasarani, Embacasi, East and Central, Roy Samu, Kibra, Dagoreti and Makadara. And we know the members of our church, some of them are drawn from these specific areas. And that's why we need to heighten up uh checking to ensure that that um um we get treated in a timely manner. So far in the country we've had 97 cases as of 7th April and a total of six deaths. In Nairobi we've had 13 cases and one death in Nairobi. So it's something that we should give a much needed attention. And what's the government doing about it? The government has heightened up um uh surveillance. It has established multis sectoral response that involves a number of institutions to ensure that it's capable of responding to this. It has established six welle equipped and isolation facilities where you can be isolated to ensure that it doesn't spread quickly and also treated. Uh it's also conducting a public sensization uh using all platforms including uh church uh media and other institutions. Uh and it's also conducting uh additional research so that we can be able to understand why we've had resurgent number of kera cases that has persisted all across from 2015 up to date we we've had intermediate number of kolera situations in the country. But how can you as an individual prevent colera? One, by ensuring personal hygiene. Washing hands is one of the key things. Uh uh we can also ensure that we treat um uh um we treat the water that we are using and the water that we are using um we can treat by boiling. We can also treat by um putting in um spa and water guard. Uh ensuring that the water that we are using even for washing utensils is also clean because that's also one of the areas where we do forget. Uh we you have a clean water but the water that you are using to wash utensil that you are using in the house are um not clean enough. Uh there's also a hotline uh a free number uh that you'll be provided um uh that you can be able to call and be able to be assisted. And what can the church do about it by continually sensitizing uh the church members on the cola situation? Uh remind the church members on how to respond in case they have kolera. uh calling in our healthcare workers, calling the hotline the uh getting treated uh provide hand washing facilities within the church compound to ensure that uh church itself doesn't become the center for dissemination of kolera. uh maintain the cleanliness within the church facility uh in the church washroom and also sharing the information widely with um in the social media platform and in all church gathering otherwise it was that brief. I know uh 7th Day Adventist has been at the forefront of of maintaining um a healthy lifestyle uh and a healthy hygiene but as they say remind them it is time when this pandemic we have it and we just want a heightened response a heightened awareness among oursel so that we can be able to respond much more effectively to kera so I'll stop there and uh hand it over to the deacon on on uh as you have been informed there's a kolera outbreak that affects Nairobi among other counties. So we're encouraging church members to uh adopt the practices that we've been uh told and uh try contain the outbreak. Ensure the water you are using is clean and uh above all uh if you have the symptoms again ensure that you visit a health facility as soon as possible so that you are managed. Thank you and have a blessed Sabbath. Let's believe and pray. Gracious and everlasting father we thank you for the gift of life and the gift of the Sabbath. Thank you for allowing us uh to see this Sabbath day and thank you Lord even for the sensitization about Kolera. How we pray father that our various places of residence you may keep us safe even together with our families and our neighbors. We commit the rest of the Sabbath program unto you that may you lead us and may you guide us with the wisdom of your holy spirit. For in the mighty name of Jesus Christ we pray believing and trusting. Amen. [Music]

TIMESTAMPED TRANSCRIPT:
[5.9s] Happy
[7.6s] Sabbath. Uh good
[12.2s] morning. I think we can settle and then
[14.7s] we start
[16.0s] our health nugget sessions.
[32.8s] Okay. So, uh in this week uh health uh
[37.4s] health discussion, we would want to
[39.0s] discuss a topical issue which is which
[41.9s] is with us. It's about the current color
[45.0s] outbreak that we have in the country.
[47.2s] I'll start by introducing my name. I'm
[48.9s] Dr. Leonard Kinwara. I work for an
[51.4s] institution called the Kenya National
[52.9s] Public Health Institute. Uh it's a semi-
[57.1s] autonomous institution uh within the
[59.4s] ministry of health established under the
[62.3s] presidential legal order. Uh it's the
[65.3s] institution that's in charge of the
[66.6s] health security in the country. Uh but I
[70.6s] want us to
[72.6s] uh to discuss on cholera and uh the
[76.1s] first thing is to understand what is
[78.6s] what is cholera.
[80.6s] It's good to know that it's a severe dal
[84.0s] disease. It's caused by an organism
[87.0s] called
[88.8s] vibro and uh the symptoms that you
[92.0s] should watch whether you have it your
[94.6s] brother your sister
[96.7s] uh is a watery diarrhea the stomach
[99.8s] pains
[101.6s] uh or you or vomiting. So if you have
[105.8s] those specific symptoms, if your
[108.1s] neighbor, your brother, your sister has
[110.0s] any of those symptoms, if not treated
[112.6s] quickly, it can lead to dehydration and
[114.5s] even death. So that means that you
[117.1s] should immediately go to the nearest
[120.4s] facility so that you can be diagnosed to
[123.6s] verify whether you have cholera or not.
[127.1s] And how is this colera spread? uh it
[130.2s] spread when one eats uh food or water
[134.6s] which is contaminated by the organism
[137.2s] that causes
[138.8s] cholera and
[141.3s] uh some of the places in the country
[144.8s] that currently have kolera. Uh we have
[148.9s] Nairobi County, we have Kisumu County
[152.1s] and we have Migori County. So those
[154.7s] cases have have experienced uh a
[157.0s] heightened number of kolera cases in
[159.4s] Nairobi. It is spread through Kasarani,
[162.4s] Embacasi, East and Central, Roy Samu,
[165.5s] Kibra, Dagoreti and Makadara. And we
[168.5s] know the members of our church, some of
[170.5s] them are drawn from these specific
[172.6s] areas. And that's why we need to
[175.4s] heighten up uh checking to ensure that
[180.4s] that um um we get treated in a timely
[185.0s] manner. So far in the country we've had
[187.7s] 97 cases as of 7th April and a total of
[191.5s] six deaths. In Nairobi we've had 13
[194.2s] cases and one death in Nairobi. So it's
[197.4s] something that we should give a much
[200.0s] needed
[201.2s] attention. And what's the government
[203.2s] doing about it? The government has
[205.5s] heightened up um uh surveillance. It has
[208.9s] established multis sectoral response
[210.9s] that involves a number of institutions
[213.0s] to ensure that it's capable of
[216.5s] responding to this. It has established
[219.0s] six welle equipped and isolation
[221.6s] facilities where you can be isolated to
[224.4s] ensure that it doesn't spread quickly
[227.0s] and also treated. Uh it's also
[230.1s] conducting a public sensization uh using
[232.9s] all platforms including uh church uh
[236.4s] media and other institutions. Uh and
[239.8s] it's also conducting uh additional
[241.9s] research so that we can be able to
[243.8s] understand why we've had resurgent
[245.6s] number of kera cases that has persisted
[248.2s] all across from 2015 up to date we we've
[252.2s] had intermediate number of kolera
[254.2s] situations in the country. But how can
[257.0s] you as an individual prevent
[259.0s] colera? One, by ensuring personal
[262.2s] hygiene. Washing hands is one of the key
[265.0s] things. Uh uh we can also ensure that we
[270.6s] treat um uh um we treat the water that
[275.9s] we are using and the water that we are
[278.2s] using um we can treat by boiling. We can
[281.3s] also treat by um putting in
[285.2s] um spa and water guard. Uh ensuring that
[289.3s] the water that we are using even for
[291.0s] washing utensils is also clean because
[292.9s] that's also one of the areas where we do
[295.4s] forget. Uh we you have a clean water but
[299.4s] the water that you are using to wash
[301.8s] utensil that you are using in the house
[304.1s] are um not clean enough. Uh there's also
[307.4s] a hotline uh a free number uh that
[311.3s] you'll be provided um uh that you can be
[314.6s] able to call and be able to be assisted.
[318.6s] And what can the church do about it by
[321.3s] continually sensitizing uh the church
[323.4s] members on the cola situation? Uh remind
[327.2s] the church members on how to respond in
[329.3s] case they have kolera. uh calling in our
[332.0s] healthcare workers, calling the hotline
[334.5s] the uh getting treated uh provide hand
[338.4s] washing facilities within the church
[339.9s] compound to ensure that uh church itself
[343.7s] doesn't become the center for
[345.2s] dissemination of kolera. uh maintain the
[348.5s] cleanliness within the church facility
[351.5s] uh in the church washroom and also
[354.0s] sharing the information widely with um
[357.8s] in the social media platform and in all
[360.2s] church gathering otherwise it was that
[363.0s] brief. I know uh 7th Day Adventist has
[366.6s] been at the forefront of of maintaining
[369.9s] um a healthy lifestyle uh and a healthy
[373.0s] hygiene but as they say remind them it
[375.9s] is time when this pandemic we have it
[378.2s] and we just want a heightened response a
[380.6s] heightened awareness among oursel so
[382.7s] that we can be able to respond much more
[384.8s] effectively to kera so I'll stop there
[389.5s] and uh hand it over to the deacon
[393.8s] on on
[402.6s] uh as you have been informed there's a
[405.0s] kolera outbreak that affects Nairobi
[408.2s] among other counties. So we're
[410.0s] encouraging church members to
[413.0s] uh adopt the practices that we've been
[415.4s] uh told and uh try contain the outbreak.
[419.2s] Ensure the water you are using is clean
[421.7s] and uh above all uh if you have the
[424.6s] symptoms again ensure that you visit a
[426.9s] health facility as soon as possible so
[428.9s] that you are managed. Thank you and have
[430.3s] a blessed Sabbath. Let's believe and
[432.3s] pray. Gracious and everlasting father we
[435.0s] thank you for the gift of life and the
[436.6s] gift of the Sabbath. Thank you for
[438.0s] allowing us uh to see this Sabbath day
[440.5s] and thank you Lord even for the
[442.2s] sensitization about Kolera. How we pray
[444.9s] father that our various places of
[446.5s] residence you may keep us safe even
[448.4s] together with our families and our
[450.0s] neighbors. We commit the rest of the
[451.7s] Sabbath program unto you that may you
[453.7s] lead us and may you guide us with the
[455.1s] wisdom of your holy spirit. For in the
