FULL TRANSCRIPT:
[Music] Happy Sabbath. Happy day. Happy Sabbath. Happy day. Happy day. Happy. Let's believe and pray. Lord, we are in your hands now. The hour has come. Speak. We your servants are listening. By the time we leave here, Lord, I sincerely plead. May every single individual who will have heard my voice today say that they only but heard you. Hide me behind the cross and lay my glory to the dust. That you, oh Lord, alone and you alone might be glorified above all else. To the glory and honor of your name. All this we ask. trusting and believing in the name of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. Amen. Happy Sabbath once again. My name is Kelvin Yabbouti um from Westland 7th Day Adventist Church and it is a privilege to be here. It is always an honor to come back to New Life. Um my Christian experience began as a result of the ministry of chapency in New Life. Um, and I was baptized in this very place 11 years ago, September 27th, 2014. And it is always a privilege to be back. It is always an honor to be amongst the members of New Life. Now, just a few quick uh preliminaries. I've been asked to acknowledge the presence of two servants of God who minister with ADRA. I think that's Adventist Disaster Relief Agency. Um, if they're in our midst, they can rise and wave. Yes, right at the back. Please wave back. The Lord bless you for for the amazing work you do. Uh second preliminary, I received greetings from my church pastor, Pastor John, and from my elder, Elder Calvin. I was with them in the morning and they asked me to pass their regards. Do you receive them? Amen. And finally, the third preliminary. I welcome you all to please keep quiet. Amen. We are in the Lord's temple. The Bible says in Habacook 2:20, "For the Lord is in his holy temple, let all earth keep silent before him." Let's pray once again now, dear Lord, as we open your word, speak to us now through to the very end. For this we ask in faith in Jesus' name. Amen. Turn with me to the book of John. Turn with me to the book of John. John the 13th chapter. Now, it is an honor to be speaking on the first ever ambassador's Sabbath. It is an honor. I was an ambassador long ago, you know, very long ago when I was a young man in my youth. Now, I have grown old and I have white hair and we praise the Lord for for age. Turn with me to the book of John 13:1. John the 13th chapter, the first text. And I want us to consider in the biblical narrative the idea of Jesus Christ. Remember we will talk about this in a few minutes. But as we are called to be ambassadors, we are called to then exemplify the reality of the gospel of Christ and preach to the world no other thing but that which Christ has desired of us. So that let's spend a little bit of time actually looking upon Christ. Let's spend a little bit of time meditating on what Jesus was, on what he did, and ultimately what then he calls us to tell to the whole world. Turn with me to John the 13th chapter. I am reading the first text. And the Bible says, I'll read from the King James version. Now before the feast of the Passover when Jesus knew that his hour was come that he should depart out of the world in out of this world unto the father. The Bible reads having loved his own which were in the world he loved them unto the end. The Bible here introduces to us a very simple but profound idea. Christ is at the last scenes of his experience. I want you to paint this picture in your mind. John 13 is actually the narrative of the last supper. Jesus is in his final hours right before he enters into the Gethsemane experience and ultimat ultimately to Calvary. And as the Bible as John writing in the inspiration of the spirit is reflecting on the life of Christ. The one thing that he highlighted I mean John would have said anything about our Lord. John would have said that the Lord performed the most amazing miracles that this world had ever seen. John would have said that he who is creator walked upon this earth and they saw mighty works that that no one had ever seen before. John would have spoken of the amazing impact that Christ had on the sick, on the lame, on the blind. John would have spoken of any single thing. But I want you to notice with such biblical clarity as John is contemplating on the last sins of the life of Christ, the commentary that he gives of Jesus is this that as Christ was about to leave this world, as Christ was about to be taken up unto the father, as Christ was about to exit the stage of humanity, the single phrase that John speaks of Messiah is this that having loved his own which were in the world, he loved them unto the end. That the singular ministry of Christ is reduced to this one profound idea that what gave the life of Jesus meaning while he was on earth is that he loved his people and he loved them all the way to the very end. So that Christ himself now commenting on this, turn with me to the book of John the 15th chapter. Christ commenting on this singular idea, John the 15th chapter gives us a bit more insight on what this means when the Bible says that God Christ God through Christ loved his own which were in the world and loved them even unto the end. In John the 15th chapter reading the 13th text, which text did I say? Ah, louder people of God. Which text? John 15:3. And the Bible reads, "Greater love, greater love hath no man than this, than that a man lay down his life for his friends." So the people of God, let's put things together. John commenting on the life of Messiah says that the singular thing that defined Christ as he was about to exit the stage of humanity is that he loved his own unto the end. And Christ describes what this love looks like and says that greater love hath no man than this than that a man lay down his own life for his brethren. So that people of God um one of my favorite authors Mrs. White commenting on this idea in the book of Desire of Ages page 19 paragraph 2. She says that it will be seen that the glory shining in the face of Christ is the glory of self sacrificing love. That when we look into the mind and heart of Jehovah. As we look at the face of Christ, we see a love that was willing to give up every single thing for those who he loved. We see a God who lived in such a genuine self-sacrificing manner thinking not of himself but thinking of his neighbor thinking not what can the world do for me but rather what can I do of the for the world you see people of God the reason why I have elected to begin this way is because often times we talk about being ambassadors of Christ we talk about how we are called to show forth the glory of Jehovah to the world. But if we are honest, the reality that we are showing the world is significantly distinct from that which Christ came to show while he was on earth. So I want you to ponder this for a minute. Now we have been asked to call ourselves ambassadors and beautifully so. But I want you to introspect for a second and ask when the world looks at you, do they see selfsacrificing love? Do they see a love and a life that is willing to live not for its own sake but for others? You see, there is nothing on this earth that lives unto itself except the selfish heart of man. Even the trees take in carbon dioxide that they might give out oxygen, that which we need that we might live. The rivers take the waters into the oceans which the oceans in return give them out again. But the selfish heart of man has been taught that the highest ideal is to live for itself. And you probably know this to be true because speaking of contemporary society, we have been taught that you know you do you. The highest ideal in this life is for yourself. We have been taught by the world as young young men and women of the Lord that you know you must consider yourself above everyone else. You must esteem your own opinions and if anyone comes against that you're told to cut them off. No. Is that not what the world teaches us? That the highest ideal the the highest ideal is self. We have placed ourselves on the throne where Christ is supposed to be and life lives revolving around us or as I as as as it is said in Jenz language we are supposed to be giving main character energy. You get it? We have been told that in the narrative of the world, we are the main characters and everything else ought to revolve around us. So that we are taught that life abounds in living just for ourselves in thinking what good does everyone else have toward me and as long as they do not have such good they are of no use and of no value to us. The kingdom of God comes against every such singular idea saying that he who is greatest in this kingdom is meant to be a servant is meant to give themselves to the service of God and to the service of humanity. So that it is in thus doing that we genuinely become ambassadors of Christ. You see people of God, the Bible tells us in the book of Romans chapter 3, actually Romans chapter 2, reading from around verse 12, God speaks to the Jews, the people who know him, and he talks with such pain saying how the name of God has been blasphemed amongst the Gentiles because of us. So that we who are supposed to be telling the world about Jesus, the Lord says that when the world looks at us, they see selfishness instead of selflessness. They see self-seeking instead of other centeredness. They see us esteeming ourselves above everything else rather than esteeming our neighbor above ourselves. And you know what the net effect has become? The Bible says that the name of God is blasphemed among the Gentiles because of us. So what does it mean for the world when we are calling them to Christ? When they look upon our lives, they only see people who care for themselves. People who care nothing about their neighbor. Whose highest ideal is to make sure that they are okay at the expense of their neighbors. What gospel are we preaching to the world when our lives are genuinely not in conformity with the principles of the gospel? Christ as he was exiting this stage, John describes his life simply as this that having loved his own which were in the world, he loved them even unto the end. And so, brethren, the question is this. We who have been called to be ambassadors of Jesus, representatives of Christ to this world, when the world looks at us, what do they see? Do they see people who have beheld the face of Jesus and are being daily transformed into the same image? Does the world look at us and see people who have tasted of the beautiful grace of Jehovah and their entire life then has been committed to ensuring that their neighbor experiences the same thing. Now, because I know most of you might get me wrong, it is important for me to add this. The Bible does not call does not say that we shouldn't love ourselves. The Bible does not anywhere say that we should disregard and hate ourselves. In fact, the Bible does say that we must love ourselves. But then it goes on to say that we must love our neighbor. Finish it. As we love ourselves. So that here's the thing. God is not telling you not to have self-esteem and self-care and not to care for yourself. No. God is not calling you to disregard yourself and not to care about your own existence. No. But God is reminding you that in the in the stage of life, we must esteem our neighbor as we esteem ourselves. We must love our neighbor. Not to a lesser degree than we love ourselves, but to the same exact degree. Why? Because we know that which the Lord did for us, he did also for them. Amen. That which the Lord did when he came down on earth to ransom us from the grave. He did it not just for us. He did it for that neighbor of yours who you have vowed in your life you will never ever come into contact with again. He did it for that friend of yours who has so offended you that in your heart there is so much hatred for you and you wish existence would have been better without them. The Lord reminds us that the singular act of Jehovah dying for us, giving up his life to show us that we are of infinite value is an act that he did not just for us but for every single individual next to you, around you in your church, the elder that you constantly talk ill about, the neighbor that you have disregarded, every single individual, the Lord reminds us that he gave up his life for them also. So that if our lives and our existence are of infinite value, then it means that their lives and their existence are also of what? Of infinite value. This singular idea might sound like it is simple. It might sound like something that we know. I'm I'm sure for a fact this is not something mindblowing. This is not a truth that you are probably hearing for the first time. This is probably something that you have heard so many times that you have been im that you're becoming immune against. But you see ambassadors of God, this is the thing our theme today is living for impact. The Bible describes that there is no impact that exists apart from this singular idea of loving God with all our hearts and loving our neighbors apart from ourselves. Turn with me once again to the book of John. Let's go to the 17th chapter and let's listen to the prayer of Christ. If you have your Bibles, turn with me to the book of John. We're reading the 17th chapter. John the 17th chapter. And as Christ is about to speak, as Christ is about to speak, he here is praying for his people. He is interceding. And I want you to notice the words that he begins describing when he's, you know, the words that he uses when he is talking about his church. John chapter 17, reading from verse 20, from verse 21. And the Bible reads thus. So this is Christ praying and he says, "Oh that they may be one as thou Father art in me and I in thee, that they also may be one in us." Listen to this. That the world may believe that thou hast sent us. Now I want to bust your Adventist bubble. that how the world is supposed to know that we belong to God is not simply because we keep the Sabbath. Now I will say that again. How the world is supposed to know that we belong to the Lord according to what Christ says is not simply that we keep the Sabbath. Now it is an important aspect of our experience that we keep the commandments of the Lord. But the Bible says the one singular thing that will allow our ministry to have impact in the world as Jesus is speaking and I want you, you know, I want you guys to actually pause and think. Let me let me let me take it a notch down. This is Christ. The very person that we are trying to preach to the world, the very person that we are trying to convert the whole world to. He comes and tells us this is what you guys are going to do so that the world knows that you belong to me. But then you know what we do? We go back to him and we tell him you know what Christ you sit down. Let us tell you what we need to do. For the world to know that we are yours we need to be more strict about X and Y and Zed. For the world to know that we are yours we need to become more rigid in X and Y and Zed. And don't get me wrong all those things are vital parts of our Christian experience. But Jesus, the very person who we are trying to preach to the world, comes to us and in his godhood with his authority as creator of heaven and earth, he comes and says, "Do you know how the world is going to know that you belong to me? It is not by how you dress. It is not just by how you eat. It is not just by how you live. But when they look at you as a people, do you love one another? Do they see selfs sacrificing love in the community of God? Now I have spent the bulk of my time since as a minister. I think I last stood here to preach in 2018 after I had just finished um from for the previous year on a chaplency Sabbath. And since then in my ministry I have spent so much time trying to convince people with very eloquent arguments that they should seek the Lord. trying to convince people with with text upon text and word upon word and I have spent a majority of my time in mission work trying to convince people with the most clear arguments. In fact, let me tell you an interesting story. In the first mission that I went to, this was in 2017. Uh we had just finished form four and the week after there's a ministry that I'm part of called the fountains of Christ and we went for mission immediately afterwards. Now, in my mind, I knew my work as a minister of God is to tell people about the Sabbath. So, this is what I did. I have a pretty good memory. And so, I sat down and committed to memory 30 verses about the Sabbath. How many verses? 30. So, this is what I'd do. I'd go into someone's house. We'd knock. We So, we're going for door to door. Knock on someone's house and be like, "Hi." You know, I have a very disarming smile. So, I just smile. I'm like, "Hi, guys. I promise I'm not here to kill you. I just want to tell you the word. And I'd go and I'd be like, "Okay, fine guys. We have been sent by the Lord and we have been sent specifically to you." And so what I'd do is this. I had carried um two Bibles, one Swahili, one English so that whether you speak English or Swahili, we are ready for you. And then I'd give them the Bible. I wouldn't even read the text myself. I'd tell them. And what I do from that point on, I'd begin beginning from Genesis chapter 2 after creation. Text upon text, I'd be like, "Let's go to the next one." Text upon text, text upon text. It didn't matter to me that some of those women were breastfeeding and their children were crying. I'd be like, you know, in my mind, I was intent on winning people for the Lord. And I knew what I needed was eloquent arguments. I knew what I needed was to have text upon text. And that, I promise I did. By now, you can already tell eloquence was not a problem. And so, I was ready for them. I was ready. I I used to go and tell them, you know, we have been sent here by the Lord. And the Lord says if you refuse we will leave and shake off our dust and say Lord we have done what you sent us to do now the rest to make. You see people of God I had spent so much time thinking that what the world needs is more content more truth more texts but all the reality that I came into as and I mean don't get me wrong I still look back to those times with gratefulness. If it were not for them I probably wouldn't be standing here now. I've gone to the world and right now I'd be a DJ somewhere. Sorry. But now circle back here. Now the Bible then reminds us that the whole idea of ministry is community. You see people of God, let me tell you this. Right now with simply a single Google search, someone can find as much content as they need. There is content available and there is no scarcity of it. In fact, I promise you with a single YouTube search, men can find preachers that are significantly more eloquent and more learned than all of us put together. True or false. So that what the world is lacking is not a scarcity of content. People have heard these things. People have known these things. In fact, there are places I have gone where even before I speak, someone says, "I even know the text." And I'm like, "Okay, you know that one. Let me show you another one." And they're like, "Even that one, I read it when I was when I was your age, you know, when I was still a young man. Now I'm there. I can say when I was a young man, you know, hi ambassadors." When I was a young man. But now what humanity is lacking and all of you will bear witness of this fact. What the world is actually looking for is community. A place where they can be fully known yet still deeply loved. A place where they can come without shame, without fear. They can come just as they are and find acceptance. And when they come they find that the very people dwelling in that midst are also living in love and dwelling in unity. You see the church of God is struggling because we are trying to bring the world into an experience that we do not now possess. And so people come and they find us divided amongst one another. And God asks if a kingdom is divided in itself can it truly stand? The world is coming to find community and they come and they find people here bearing tales about one another. The world is coming to find a place of acceptance and they find Christians who haven't accepted each other. The world is coming seeking for a love that looks like Jesus Christ where they will feel at home even though they are struggling. Where the standard will not be lowered. Yes. But they will be reminded that there is grace to reach that standard. The the world is looking for such a community. But when they come, what do they find? They find us bickering and fighting, harboring so much hatred one toward another, divided in so much pain and anguish because the people who have hurt us the most are people who dare name the name of Christ. They come and find that. They come and find that here there are people who we have vowed that we will never talk to. And so if we even enter the the compound and park and we find we've parked next to them, we'd rather go park outside. They find that there are people who when you walk along the streets, you would dare not say hi to them because you know Mimi and brother X and Y and Zed, we we are done. As as my grandmother would say, Our blood is not accepting each other. Yet the Bible tells us we are accepted in the blood of the beloved. Amen. The Bible reminds us, read with me, John 17:21, that they may be one as thou, Father, art in me, and I in thee, that they also may be one in us, that the world may believe that thou hast sent me. Verse 22 says, "And the glory which thou gavest me, which glory? The glory of self sacrificing love, the glory of Christ that says that greater love hath no man than this, than that he laid down his life for his brethren." The Bible says, "The glory that thou gavest me, I have given to them. I have shown them what it is like to live a self-sacrificing life. I have shown them what it is like to live not for themselves but for their neighbor. I have shown them what it is like to live life not asking what can my neighbor do for me but what can I do for my neighbor? The glory which thou gavest to me I have given them that what might happen. Read that next phrase. Uh, I lost you at some point. Praise God. The preacher is shouting. We are still together. Now the Bible reads, read with me. Read with me. We are in verse 22. And the glory that thou gavest me, I have given them that what might happen. Louder, people of God. That what might happen? That they may be one. that as we partake of the self-sacrificing spirit of God, asking not what our brethren can do for us, but what can we do for our brethren as we embrace the spirit of self sacrificing love. The Bible says that they may be one even as we are one. Proceeds on to say the 23rd text, I in them and thou in me. Listen to this. that they may be made perfect in one. And what shall happen? That the world may know that thou hast sent me and hast loved them and thou hast loved me. People of God, beloved, the Lord is intent on reminding us of this singular fact that we as ambassadors of Christ. We who on this inaugural Adventist World Ambassadors Day desire to take a stand that we have been called to show forth God to the world. The Lord reminds us that what that looks like is not eloquence of words. You see, what the Lord needs is not more eloquence. I dare say what the Lord needs is not simply more people who can quote and commit text to memory. I dare say what the Lord needs is not simply people who can stand and speak passionately about Jehovah. No, the Lord needs for the gospel to become real, to enter into human experience and transform. The Lord needs for the gospel to change our hardened hearts. That we might extend grace and love and forgiveness one to another. This is the glory of God. That the world might see that in New Life 7th Day Adventist Church, if you're feeling alone, that's the place to go. You will find people who care for you. Not because you do anything for them, but simply because they remember that you are that we are one family bound together by what Christ has done for us. What the world needs is a community of faith where when we stumble, we remember that we we need to hold each other up. When my brother offends me, I extend forgiveness to them. Like Stephen, even when they're stoning me with their words, I say, "Lord, forgive them for they know not what they do. The Lord desires a community of people who have so beheld the glory of God that all the things of earth have grown strangely dim in the light of his glory and his grace. Are people who have beheld Jesus so much that they say Lord take my life and let it be consecrated dear Lord to thee. are people who have been persuaded that living life in this manner living life in this manner is the most satisfying and most sustainable way to live. Turn with me to the book of Proverbs. Let's go to the fourth chapter. Proverbs the 4th chapter. Proverbs 4 is quickly becoming one of my favorite portions of scripture. Proverbs the 4th chapter. And I want to just read two texts here because as we listen to these things, as we listen to the things I'm telling you, it's easy to think that these are just mere recommendations that God is giving us and he is saying you can have them or not. But the wisdom of the Lord tells us something entirely different. Turn with me to the book of of Proverbs the 4th chapter reading verse 20. reading from verse 20 all the way to the 22nd text. And the Bible reads, I'm reading once again from the King James version, Proverbs 4:20 to verse 22. It says, "My son, attend to my words. Incline thine ears to my sayings. Let them not depart from thine eyes. Keep them in the midst of thine heart." Verse 22 says, "For they are life unto those that find them, and health to all thy flesh." Now, let me let me explain what I mean here. The Bible in telling us to live not for ourselves, but for others is speaking in what Solomon would call words of wisdom, describing to us the wisdom of God, that which goes on in his heart and his mind. And Solomon goes even as far in the inspiration of the spirit to tell us that when God tells us to do these things, he is not saying them as mere recommendations that we may do or not. The Bible says, and I want you to listen to that phrase very carefully. He says, "Keep my words for they are life to them that find them." that you see part of the reason why we live such unsatisfying lives is because we live for ourselves. Part of the reason why we have and have and have so much but we know for a fact we are so utterly unsatisfied is because according to the words of scripture there is no life that abounds in living apart from the wisdom of God. And the wisdom of God dictates that life abounds in giving and giving and giving. Again, the Bible reminds us in the book of Genesis that we were created in the image of Jehovah. So that if looking at Christ, we see self-sacrificing love. It means that we were also created to be selfsacrificing. And that in so doing humanity even finds what life is supposed to be. that the reason why we we chase and chase and chase and according to the words of the wise man we are chasing but wind. The reason why we we have sought for more and more and more and even when we arise to the highest peaks of life everything is still utterly unsatisfying is simply because we have set it in our hearts that we must live unto ourselves rather than for others. The Bible reminds us that the wisdom of God tells us that in yielding ourselves to God, allowing ourselves to live not just for ourselves but for others, in so doing, we then find what life abounds in. We find satisfaction when we live in service not to ourselves but for our neighbor. When we give ourselves for the work and life of Christ. And that looks like different things. Don't get me wrong, God is not calling us to give up our jobs and to spend the rest of our lives as min as as as as lay ministers. Some of us might be called to such work. If God calls you, yield and go. But the Lord is describing principles that reach into the reality of how we live life. You see, um I am a preacher. In my spare time, I am an engineer when I'm free during the week. And at when I when I was at work um in the office, I am I I'm consistently reminded of this idea because we have had we have had sessions with my workmates where we tried to philosophically talk about the gospel. I mean they know I'm a Seventh Day Adventist. Um but I was I was I I work at a place where people have never even heard the name Seventh Day Adventist. So they just know I'm a Christian. And so we've had philosophical discussions. We've had discussions about about theodysy and the question of the problem of pain and all these things. We have we have tried to dissect the logic of Christianity. And having spent so much time actually studying and understanding uh seeking to understand so much of this theology. I was ready with so many arguments. I was ready to counter every question, every thought, every single thing that they did. And that I promise you I did very well. When they'd bring up an argument, I'd overwhelm them with logic. But what was most striking to me is that during the times we'd actually spend this much time countering all the arguments. They would actually live there more hardened than before. They'd say, "You've won this time, but I'm going to come back with even more arguments next time." But what's interesting is that the things that ultimately won over some of my colleagues, some of whom have actually now joined the church, the 7th Day Adventist Church, is simply the fact that above everything else at work, God impressed upon my heart to learn to be kind to them. not to partake of this competitive spirit of the world where if if they have I don't where I want to show myself off to my boss that I am the one who is best at what I do and so that I am retained and they are not but rather one of the things that actually won over two of my colleagues is that um we in my in my dayto-day we we program a lot and I'm a fairly good programmer at work to the extent that my my supervisor had a particular liking toward me because I'd get the work done a bit fast. But what was interesting at least what won over two of these colleagues of mine is that at first they were very worried because they felt that I am now competing with them and now you know when when I because I work in a donor funded organization when funding is cut they will be removed and I will be kept and so we had built a very competitive spirit and I used to pray about this because I desired to reach out to them. I desired to show them what the gospel of Christ looks like. And one day the Lord impressed upon my heart that if the problem is that they are struggling to to to write code, then why not have sessions in the office with some of my colleagues who are interested to practice how to code. And so we set up a recurring meeting every day where we used to to write you know we started just learning a bit of Python and we you know we we we'd practice and just come curate amazing materials and you know the beauty of being a preacher is that you learn how to become a teacher cuz right now you're listening to me right? I know you're listening. And so we'd we'd we' we'd sit together and we'd and we'd code and stuff like that. And they were very intrigued until one day a certain lady um from from Kazakhstan who was one of my colleagues came to me and told me why is it that you are actually helping us? I mean if we become good at this we might take your job and in my office again I'm the youngest and I'm the only one without a master's degree. So that she was actually telling me, "Aren't you intimidated that we have master's degrees and the only edge you have over us is that you're a better programmer so that if we have that, you will be fired and we will remain." And that gave me entrance to tell to tell her that the reason why I'm not worried is because I serve a God who first opened this door for me. I serve a God who is keeping me here. I serve a God who when my time has come will remove me from here so that I am not worried about competition because I am not walking in a world where I am fighting for my own life. No, I am walking in a world where the Lord says he is my shepherd so that my work is to let him lead and I will follow. And if he leads me elsewhere, what do I do as sheep? May I ble my way following him? If he tells me, "My child, our time here is done." What do we do? We wake up and we leave. And so profoundly, someone who I had tried spending so much time to counter their arguments against the gospel by this simple thing was persuaded that if your God can allow you to do such things, then maybe maybe I should give that God a chance. Maybe there's a point to what he's trying to say. Maybe, just maybe, what the world is looking for is not more eloquent arguments. They have those eloquent arguments. You will meet people who will even tell you, "I know the Sabbath is Saturday. You're not telling me anything new." Maybe what the world is looking for when they're looking at people who are supposed to be proclaiming Jesus is to see a heart of love. To see kindness when hatred has been offered to them. To see love when envy has been offered to them. When maybe they're just looking for people who when the world has tried to mold them into its image and make them selfish, make them think about themselves. when the world has told them that your highest duty is to affirm yourself every day in the mirror and tell you and and tell them I am worthy. I am what maybe the world is looking for people who have read the gospel and can now look in the mirror and say I am not worthy of my own but I am worthy in Jesus Christ. And if God has done that for me then he can do it for you too. Maybe the world is looking for a gospel that can enter into the realm of human experience. Take hold of people, transform them into the image of Jesus. And then God will say in the book of 2 Corinthians 5:20, turn with me there. 2 Corinthians the 5th chapter the 20th text that once we have known Jesus as we are supposed to know him once we have beheld Christ as we are supposed to behold him once we have looked fully into the wonderful face of Jesus 2 Corinthians 5:20 says now then we are ambassadors for Christ that now then after having beheld who Jesus is after Having understood the truth that God is calling us to, after having been persuaded of the beauty of the gospel, the Bible says, "Now then we are ambassadors for Christ." After having partaken of the spirit of Jesus, now then we go into the world, into our workplaces, into our families, into our homes, our societies. We then go and say that come, come find a man. Come find Jesus who did all these things for me and can do them for you too. Come. And the Bible says, "Now then we are ambassadors for Christ as though God did beseech you by us." that God through our experience is begging you. You who are struggling to find community, come to our community. You who are struggling to accept yourself, come find acceptance in Jesus Christ. You who are struggling to think that you are of worth, come see a man who died for you, that you are worth dying for, that God is beseeching the world by us. That we pray you in Christstead. that we are standing to the world in the place of Jesus telling them guys we are just but beggars telling other beggars where you can go and find bread we were hungry and he fed us and so you don't need to be hungry anymore come find a Christ who will feed you and satisfy you this is what it means to be an ambassador for Christ this is what it means to live for Jesus it doesn't mean that all of us have been called to stand on pull pits and preach. No. To each of us has been given a ministry. To each of us has been given a place, a corner that we can brighten. To each of us has been given a center of influence wherein we may win people for the Lord. Some of us have not been called to stand here and speak for 40 plus minutes. But all of us have been called given a people or two that we may influence for the Lord. I will never have access to some of the people you do to tell them about the gospel. But God has called you in your experience to become the Bible in shoes to become the living exemplification of what it means to live for Jehovah, to trust him, to love him. In the grand scheme of existence, our lives become meaningful only when we begin living for God and for our fellow man. thinking not what can the whole world do for me but Lord what can I do for the world and if it means that what I can do for the world is to become a street sweeper Martin Luther King Jr. will say, "Let the Christian street sweeper become the best street sweeper that even angels in heaven and men on earth will say after his passing that here here lived a man, the best street sweeper that this street ever saw." God is calling you in the realm of your own experience, in the corner that only you can brighten to become the ultimate version of yourself. A version that can be found only through the salvation that is in Jesus Christ. A version that can be obtained only through the redemption that is in the face and heart of Jesus Christ. And you know what happens ultimately when we do this? Turn with me to our final text. Acts chapter one uh chapter se chapter 17 sorry our final text our key text. When we begin living like this living not for ourselves but for humanity. I want you to notice when the apostolic church lived like this, what did the Bible say of them? And I want to read from the King James version. I really love how it puts it here. And I want you to listen. Acts chapter 17 verse 6. The Bible speaks of such men, men who loved the Lord, men who lived for the Lord, men who were persuaded for Jehovah. The Bible says in verse 6, "And when they found them not, they drew Jason and certain brethren unto the rulers of the city crying." Listen to what they cry. They say, "This that have turned the world upside down." That the people who live for Jesus are the only people who will ever have true impact. Of such men. The Bible says the earth shall tremble beneath their tread. Of such men, the Bible says when Christ comes, he will look upon them and say, "Come, oh thou good and faithful servant. You have been faithful in little. Come, I will make you ruler over much." Let's pray. Father, all that we may look fully into the wonderful face of Jesus and that we may be persuaded that life abounds not in living for ourselves but in living for our neighbors. And Lord, may the wonderful grace of Jesus redeem us from our selfishness and transform us to selflessness to the glory and honor of your name now and forever more. Amen. [Music] Are you [Music] There is a place of quiet rest near to the heart of God. Lord, a place where sin can not more last near to the heart of God. Oh Jesus blessed [Laughter] redeemer sent from the heart of God. Lord does who wait before thee near to the heart of God. There is a place of comfort, sweet, near to the heart of God. [Applause] A place where we our savior meet near to the heart of God. Oh Jesus blessed [Applause] redeemer sent from the heart of God. Hold us who wait before thee near to the heart of God. There is a place all [Music] rel to the heart of God. [Music] A place where all is joy and peace. Near to the heart of God. Oh Jesus, blessed [Applause] redeemer, sent from the heart of God. Hold us to wait [Applause] [Music] before thee near to the heart of God. God dear Lord as we pray. Take heart and mind fire from the breast of the world all around to your throne where grace does abound. [Music] May our lives be transformed by your love. May our souls be refreshed from above. [Music] at this moment. Let's be born [Music] everywhere. Join us now as we come to you in prayer. [Music] Oh Jesus blessed redeemer sent from the heart of God. All who wait before all the me to the heart of God. Let's all rise. Let's all rise. And as we make this final prayer, I'd like for you to make the recommitment in your heart that Lord, help me not to live unto myself, but to live for you and for fellow man. Let's believe and pray. Lord, when all is said and done, when the voice of the preacher is no more to be heard, when the sound of music by silence has been drowned, Lord, then will we live for you or for the world. Oh, how I plead that dear Lord, the words that you have spoken unto us this day may not be taken away by the evil one, but that Lord, we may ponder upon them, that we may lay hold by your grace upon them, and that Father, you may by looking fully into your wonderful face, transform us into the same image from grace to grace and from glory to glory. Lord, how I pray that you may make us truly Christians in our hearts. Give us, Lord, the mind of Jesus. Make us holy as he is. And Lord, may we prove that we've been with Jesus who is all our righteousness. Lord, with all my heart I pray, make us Christians today. This we ask in Christ's name. Amen.

TIMESTAMPED TRANSCRIPT:
[2.9s] [Music]
[13.2s] Happy Sabbath. Happy day. Happy Sabbath.
[16.5s] Happy day. Happy day. Happy. Let's
[19.5s] believe and
[23.2s] pray.
[25.4s] Lord, we are in your
[28.2s] hands now. The hour has
[30.9s] come. Speak. We your servants are
[34.7s] listening. By the time we leave here,
[36.8s] Lord, I sincerely
[39.4s] plead. May every single individual who
[42.0s] will have heard my voice today say that
[44.4s] they only but heard you. Hide me behind
[47.7s] the cross and lay my glory to the dust.
[50.9s] That you, oh Lord, alone and you alone
[53.4s] might be glorified above all else. To
[56.5s] the glory and honor of your name. All
[58.0s] this we ask. trusting and believing in
[60.2s] the name of our Lord and Savior Jesus
[61.9s] Christ. Amen.
[66.2s] Happy Sabbath once again.
[69.0s] My name is Kelvin Yabbouti
[72.2s] um from Westland 7th Day Adventist
[74.2s] Church and it is a privilege to be here.
[76.5s] It is always an honor to come back to
[78.2s] New Life. Um my Christian experience
[81.8s] began as a result of the ministry of
[84.7s] chapency in New Life. Um, and I was
[87.2s] baptized in this very place 11 years
[89.7s] ago, September 27th,
[92.3s] 2014. And it is always a privilege to be
[95.6s] back. It is always an honor to be
[98.4s] amongst the members of New Life. Now,
[100.5s] just a few quick uh preliminaries. I've
[102.8s] been asked to acknowledge the presence
[104.8s] of two servants of God who minister with
[107.8s] ADRA. I think that's Adventist Disaster
[110.3s] Relief Agency. Um, if they're in our
[112.4s] midst, they can rise and wave.
[117.1s] Yes, right at the back. Please wave
[119.0s] back. The Lord bless you for for the
[121.4s] amazing work you do. Uh second
[123.7s] preliminary, I received greetings from
[125.9s] my church pastor, Pastor John, and from
[127.9s] my elder, Elder Calvin. I was with them
[130.2s] in the morning and they asked me to pass
[131.7s] their regards. Do you receive them?
[134.1s] Amen. And finally, the third
[136.5s] preliminary. I welcome you all to please
[139.4s] keep quiet. Amen. We are in the Lord's
[142.5s] temple. The Bible says in Habacook 2:20,
[144.6s] "For the Lord is in his holy temple, let
[147.0s] all earth keep silent before him." Let's
[149.4s] pray once again now, dear Lord, as we
[152.2s] open your word, speak to us now through
[155.3s] to the very end. For this we ask in
[157.5s] faith in Jesus' name. Amen. Turn with me
[160.6s] to the book of John. Turn with me to the
[163.3s] book of
[165.5s] John. John the 13th chapter. Now, it is
[168.6s] an honor to be speaking on the first
[171.3s] ever ambassador's Sabbath. It is an
[174.0s] honor. I was an ambassador long ago, you
[176.8s] know, very long ago when I was a young
[178.6s] man in my youth. Now, I have grown old
[181.6s] and I have white hair and we praise the
[183.6s] Lord for for age. Turn with me to the
[187.0s] book of John
[188.8s] 13:1. John the 13th chapter, the first
[191.3s] text. And I want us to consider in the
[193.5s] biblical narrative the idea of Jesus
[196.8s] Christ. Remember we will talk about this
[199.1s] in a few minutes. But as we are called
[201.3s] to be ambassadors, we are called to then
[204.6s] exemplify the reality of the gospel of
[207.1s] Christ and preach to the world no other
[209.8s] thing but that which Christ has desired
[212.3s] of us. So that let's spend a little bit
[214.3s] of time actually looking upon Christ.
[216.9s] Let's spend a little bit of time
[218.1s] meditating on what Jesus was, on what he
[220.8s] did, and ultimately what then he calls
[223.0s] us to tell to the whole world. Turn with
[225.4s] me to John the 13th chapter. I am
[227.5s] reading the first text. And the Bible
[229.7s] says, I'll read from the King James
[231.2s] version. Now before the feast of the
[234.2s] Passover when Jesus knew that his hour
[237.9s] was come that he should depart out of
[241.0s] the world in out of this world unto the
[244.4s] father. The Bible reads having loved his
[247.8s] own which were in the world he loved
[250.6s] them unto the end. The Bible here
[254.2s] introduces to us a very simple but
[256.3s] profound idea. Christ is at the last
[260.3s] scenes of his experience. I want you to
[262.2s] paint this picture in your mind. John 13
[264.8s] is actually the narrative of the last
[266.4s] supper. Jesus is in his final hours
[269.8s] right before he enters into the
[272.4s] Gethsemane experience and ultimat
[274.7s] ultimately to Calvary. And as the Bible
[277.8s] as John writing in the inspiration of
[280.1s] the spirit is reflecting on the life of
[283.3s] Christ. The one thing that he
[285.5s] highlighted I mean John would have said
[287.6s] anything about our Lord. John would have
[290.0s] said that the Lord performed the most
[291.8s] amazing miracles that this world had
[293.7s] ever seen. John would have said that he
[296.6s] who is creator walked upon this earth
[299.4s] and they saw mighty works that that no
[302.4s] one had ever seen before. John would
[304.7s] have spoken of the amazing impact that
[307.5s] Christ had on the sick, on the lame, on
[310.0s] the blind. John would have spoken of any
[312.1s] single thing. But I want you to notice
[314.8s] with such biblical
[316.8s] clarity as John is contemplating on the
[320.4s] last sins of the life of Christ, the
[323.3s] commentary that he gives of Jesus is
[325.8s] this that as Christ was about to leave
[328.9s] this world, as Christ was about to be
[331.9s] taken up unto the father, as Christ was
[335.0s] about to exit the stage of humanity, the
[338.4s] single phrase that John speaks of
[341.1s] Messiah is this that having loved his
[345.0s] own which were in the world, he loved
[348.1s] them unto the end. That the singular
[351.4s] ministry of Christ is reduced to this
[354.0s] one profound idea that what gave the
[358.0s] life of Jesus meaning while he was on
[361.3s] earth is that he loved his people and he
[365.2s] loved them all the way to the very end.
[367.9s] So that Christ himself now commenting on
[370.1s] this, turn with me to the book of John
[371.5s] the 15th chapter. Christ commenting on
[373.8s] this singular idea, John the 15th
[376.3s] chapter gives us a bit more insight on
[378.9s] what this means when the Bible says that
[381.1s] God Christ God through Christ loved his
[383.9s] own which were in the world and loved
[386.1s] them even unto the end. In John the 15th
[389.5s] chapter reading the 13th text, which
[391.6s] text did I say?
[394.1s] Ah, louder people of God. Which text?
[397.3s] John 15:3. And the Bible reads, "Greater
[401.1s] love, greater love hath no man than
[404.2s] this, than that a man lay down his life
[409.0s] for his friends." So the people of God,
[411.4s] let's put things together. John
[413.3s] commenting on the life of Messiah says
[415.4s] that the singular thing that defined
[418.2s] Christ as he was about to exit the stage
[421.3s] of humanity is that he loved his own
[424.6s] unto the end. And Christ describes what
[427.1s] this love looks like and says that
[430.1s] greater love hath no man than this than
[433.0s] that a man lay down his own life for his
[437.1s] brethren. So that people of God um one
[440.9s] of my favorite authors Mrs. White
[443.0s] commenting on this idea in the book of
[444.8s] Desire of Ages page 19 paragraph 2. She
[447.8s] says that it will be seen that the glory
[451.0s] shining in the face of Christ is the
[453.1s] glory of self sacrificing love. That
[457.4s] when we look into the mind and heart of
[459.6s] Jehovah. As we look at the face of
[461.6s] Christ, we see a love that was willing
[465.0s] to give up every single thing for those
[467.6s] who he loved. We see a God who lived in
[470.5s] such a genuine self-sacrificing manner
[473.8s] thinking not of himself but thinking of
[476.8s] his neighbor thinking not what can the
[479.4s] world do for me but rather what can I do
[483.0s] of the for the world you see people of
[485.7s] God the reason why I have elected to
[488.0s] begin this way is because often times we
[491.6s] talk about being ambassadors of Christ
[494.6s] we talk about how we are called to show
[496.9s] forth the glory of Jehovah to the world.
[500.3s] But if we are honest, the reality that
[502.6s] we are showing the world is
[504.3s] significantly distinct from that which
[507.1s] Christ came to show while he was on
[509.3s] earth. So I want you to ponder this for
[511.7s] a minute. Now we have been asked to call
[513.7s] ourselves ambassadors and beautifully
[515.4s] so. But I want you to introspect for a
[517.7s] second and ask when the world looks at
[521.3s] you, do they see
[524.0s] selfsacrificing love? Do they see a love
[527.6s] and a life that is willing to live not
[530.4s] for its own sake but for others? You
[533.3s] see, there is nothing on this earth that
[535.8s] lives unto itself except the selfish
[538.6s] heart of man. Even the trees take in
[542.0s] carbon dioxide that they might give out
[543.8s] oxygen, that which we need that we might
[545.6s] live. The rivers take the waters into
[547.9s] the oceans which the oceans in return
[550.0s] give them out again. But the selfish
[551.8s] heart of man has been taught that the
[555.0s] highest ideal is to live for itself. And
[558.8s] you probably know this to be true
[561.0s] because speaking of contemporary
[563.0s] society, we have been taught that you
[565.4s] know you do you. The highest ideal in
[568.4s] this life is for yourself. We have been
[570.3s] taught by the world as young young men
[572.9s] and women of the Lord that you know you
[575.2s] must consider yourself above everyone
[577.0s] else. You must esteem your own opinions
[579.6s] and if anyone comes against that you're
[581.8s] told to cut them off. No. Is that not
[584.2s] what the world teaches us? That the
[586.0s] highest ideal the the highest ideal is
[589.0s] self. We have placed ourselves on the
[591.6s] throne where Christ is supposed to be
[593.7s] and life lives revolving around us or as
[597.0s] I as as as it is said in Jenz language
[599.7s] we are supposed to be giving main
[601.1s] character
[602.2s] energy. You get it?
[605.0s] We have been told that in the narrative
[606.8s] of the world, we are the main characters
[608.8s] and everything else ought to revolve
[610.9s] around us. So that we are taught that
[613.1s] life abounds in living just for
[616.0s] ourselves in thinking what good does
[618.9s] everyone else have toward me and as long
[621.0s] as they do not have such good they are
[623.0s] of no use and of no value to us. The
[626.2s] kingdom of God comes against every such
[628.6s] singular idea saying that he who is
[631.5s] greatest in this kingdom is meant to be
[634.3s] a servant is meant to give themselves to
[637.6s] the service of God and to the service of
[640.4s] humanity. So that it is in thus doing
[643.1s] that we genuinely become ambassadors of
[646.2s] Christ. You see people of God, the Bible
[648.7s] tells us in the book of Romans chapter
[650.3s] 3, actually Romans chapter 2, reading
[652.8s] from around verse 12, God speaks to the
[655.8s] Jews, the people who know him, and he
[658.4s] talks with such pain saying how the name
[662.1s] of God has been blasphemed amongst the
[665.5s] Gentiles because of us. So that we who
[668.8s] are supposed to be telling the world
[670.3s] about Jesus, the Lord says that when the
[672.9s] world looks at us, they see selfishness
[676.0s] instead of selflessness. They see
[678.8s] self-seeking instead of other
[681.2s] centeredness. They see us esteeming
[683.8s] ourselves above everything else rather
[686.2s] than esteeming our neighbor above
[688.1s] ourselves. And you know what the net
[689.8s] effect has
[690.9s] become? The Bible says that the name of
[693.6s] God is blasphemed among the Gentiles
[695.7s] because of us. So what does it mean for
[698.3s] the world when we are calling them to
[700.5s] Christ? When they look upon our lives,
[703.6s] they only see people who care for
[705.6s] themselves. People who care nothing
[708.2s] about their neighbor. Whose highest
[710.1s] ideal is to make sure that they are okay
[712.5s] at the expense of their neighbors. What
[715.5s] gospel are we preaching to the world
[717.4s] when our lives are genuinely not in
[720.2s] conformity with the principles of the
[722.2s] gospel? Christ as he was exiting this
[726.2s] stage, John describes his life simply as
[729.8s] this that having loved his own which
[733.2s] were in the world, he loved them even
[736.4s] unto the end. And so, brethren, the
[739.0s] question is
[740.1s] this. We who have been called to be
[743.0s] ambassadors of Jesus, representatives of
[746.3s] Christ to this world, when the world
[749.4s] looks at us, what do they see? Do they
[752.7s] see people who have beheld the face of
[755.2s] Jesus and are being daily transformed
[758.1s] into the same image? Does the world look
[760.9s] at us and see people who have tasted of
[763.9s] the beautiful grace of Jehovah and their
[767.0s] entire life then has been committed to
[769.6s] ensuring that their neighbor experiences
[772.3s] the same thing. Now, because I know most
[775.6s] of you might get me wrong, it is
[777.0s] important for me to add this. The Bible
[779.4s] does not call does not say that we
[781.4s] shouldn't love
[782.6s] ourselves. The Bible does not anywhere
[785.2s] say that we should disregard and hate
[787.8s] ourselves. In fact, the Bible does say
[790.3s] that we must love ourselves. But then it
[793.0s] goes on to say that we must love our
[795.4s] neighbor. Finish it. As we love
[798.3s] ourselves. So that here's the thing. God
[800.7s] is not telling you not to have
[801.9s] self-esteem and self-care and not to
[804.3s] care for yourself. No. God is not
[806.2s] calling you to disregard yourself and
[808.2s] not to care about your own existence.
[809.8s] No. But God is reminding you that in the
[813.3s] in the stage of life, we must esteem our
[816.9s] neighbor as we esteem ourselves. We must
[819.7s] love our neighbor. Not to a lesser
[822.5s] degree than we love ourselves, but to
[825.2s] the same exact degree. Why? Because we
[829.0s] know that which the Lord did for us, he
[831.3s] did also for them. Amen. That which the
[834.2s] Lord did when he came down on earth to
[836.4s] ransom us from the grave. He did it not
[838.9s] just for us. He did it for that neighbor
[841.4s] of yours who you have vowed in your life
[843.8s] you will never ever come into contact
[845.7s] with again. He did it for that friend of
[848.7s] yours who has so offended you that in
[851.4s] your heart there is so much hatred for
[853.1s] you and you wish existence would have
[855.2s] been better without them. The Lord
[857.3s] reminds us that the singular act of
[859.6s] Jehovah dying for us, giving up his life
[862.7s] to show us that we are of infinite value
[866.0s] is an act that he did not just for us
[869.2s] but for every single individual next to
[873.0s] you, around you in your church, the
[875.8s] elder that you constantly talk ill
[877.7s] about, the neighbor that you have
[879.7s] disregarded, every single individual,
[882.4s] the Lord reminds us that he gave up his
[885.6s] life for them also. So that if our lives
[888.8s] and our existence are of infinite value,
[891.9s] then it means that their lives and their
[894.5s] existence are also of what? Of infinite
[899.0s] value. This singular
[901.6s] idea might sound like it is
[904.4s] simple. It might sound like something
[907.0s] that we know. I'm I'm sure for a fact
[909.4s] this is not something mindblowing. This
[912.1s] is not a truth that you are probably
[914.3s] hearing for the first time. This is
[916.8s] probably something that you have heard
[918.7s] so many times that you have been im that
[921.4s] you're becoming immune against. But you
[924.2s] see ambassadors of God, this is the
[927.2s] thing our theme today is living for
[930.1s] impact.
[931.8s] The Bible describes that there is no
[934.6s] impact that exists apart from this
[938.5s] singular idea of loving God with all our
[941.8s] hearts and loving our neighbors apart
[943.9s] from ourselves. Turn with me once again
[945.6s] to the book of John. Let's go to the
[947.3s] 17th chapter and let's listen to the
[949.4s] prayer of Christ. If you have your
[950.6s] Bibles, turn with me to the book of
[952.2s] John. We're reading the 17th
[954.5s] chapter. John the 17th chapter.
[958.9s] And as Christ is about to speak, as
[961.8s] Christ is about to speak, he here is
[964.1s] praying for his people. He is
[966.0s] interceding. And I want you to notice
[968.3s] the words that he begins describing when
[971.4s] he's, you know, the words that he uses
[973.1s] when he is talking about his church.
[975.1s] John chapter 17, reading from verse 20,
[978.4s] from verse 21. And the Bible reads
[981.5s] thus. So this is Christ praying and he
[984.8s] says, "Oh that they may be one as thou
[989.0s] Father art in me and I in thee, that
[993.8s] they also may be one in us." Listen to
[997.0s] this. That the world may believe that
[1001.1s] thou hast sent us. Now I want to bust
[1003.8s] your Adventist
[1005.9s] bubble. that how the world is supposed
[1008.6s] to know that we belong to God is not
[1011.3s] simply because we keep the
[1013.0s] Sabbath. Now I will say that again. How
[1016.5s] the world is supposed to know that we
[1018.8s] belong to the Lord according to what
[1020.8s] Christ says is not simply that we keep
[1024.0s] the Sabbath. Now it is an important
[1026.2s] aspect of our experience that we keep
[1028.6s] the commandments of the Lord. But the
[1031.4s] Bible says the one singular thing that
[1034.9s] will allow our ministry to have impact
[1037.2s] in the world as Jesus is speaking and I
[1040.2s] want you, you know, I want you guys to
[1041.5s] actually pause and think. Let me let me
[1043.1s] let me take it a notch down. This is
[1045.8s] Christ. The very person that we are
[1048.2s] trying to preach to the world, the very
[1050.9s] person that we are trying to convert the
[1053.1s] whole world to. He comes and tells us
[1056.3s] this is what you guys are going to do so
[1058.7s] that the world knows that you belong to
[1061.0s] me. But then you know what we do? We go
[1063.3s] back to him and we tell him you know
[1064.4s] what Christ you sit down. Let us tell
[1066.2s] you what we need to do. For the world to
[1068.6s] know that we are yours we need to be
[1070.2s] more strict about X and Y and Zed. For
[1072.9s] the world to know that we are yours we
[1074.2s] need to become more rigid in X and Y and
[1076.2s] Zed. And don't get me wrong all those
[1078.5s] things are vital parts of our Christian
[1080.4s] experience. But Jesus, the very person
[1083.3s] who we are trying to preach to the
[1084.7s] world, comes to us and in his godhood
[1089.0s] with his authority as creator of heaven
[1091.9s] and earth, he comes and says, "Do you
[1094.6s] know how the world is going to know that
[1096.7s] you belong to me? It is not by how you
[1099.4s] dress. It is not just by how you eat. It
[1102.2s] is not just by how you live. But when
[1104.1s] they look at you as a
[1106.7s] people, do you love one another? Do they
[1110.4s] see selfs sacrificing love in the
[1113.7s] community of God? Now I have spent the
[1116.4s] bulk of my time since as a minister. I
[1120.6s] think I last stood here to preach in
[1122.9s] 2018 after I had just finished um from
[1125.8s] for the previous year on a chaplency
[1127.3s] Sabbath. And since then in my ministry I
[1129.8s] have spent so much time trying to
[1131.6s] convince people with very eloquent
[1133.9s] arguments that they should seek the
[1136.2s] Lord. trying to convince people with
[1138.6s] with text upon text and word upon word
[1141.7s] and I have spent a majority of my time
[1143.5s] in mission work trying to convince
[1145.7s] people with the most clear arguments. In
[1147.8s] fact, let me tell you an interesting
[1149.0s] story. In the first mission that I went
[1151.1s] to, this was in 2017. Uh we had just
[1154.6s] finished form four and the week after
[1156.9s] there's a ministry that I'm part of
[1158.3s] called the fountains of Christ and we
[1160.1s] went for mission immediately afterwards.
[1162.2s] Now, in my mind, I knew my work as a
[1165.0s] minister of God is to tell people about
[1167.3s] the Sabbath. So, this is what I did. I
[1170.1s] have a pretty good memory. And so, I sat
[1172.7s] down and committed to memory 30 verses
[1176.2s] about the Sabbath. How many verses? 30.
[1179.2s] So, this is what I'd do. I'd go into
[1181.5s] someone's house. We'd knock. We So,
[1183.2s] we're going for door to door. Knock on
[1185.0s] someone's house and be like, "Hi." You
[1186.6s] know, I have a very disarming smile. So,
[1188.2s] I just smile. I'm like, "Hi, guys. I
[1190.4s] promise I'm not here to kill you. I just
[1191.9s] want to tell you the word. And I'd go
[1194.1s] and I'd be like, "Okay, fine guys. We
[1196.5s] have been sent by the Lord and we have
[1198.6s] been sent specifically to you." And so
[1200.9s] what I'd do is this. I had carried um
[1203.9s] two Bibles, one Swahili, one English so
[1206.9s] that whether you speak English or
[1208.3s] Swahili, we are ready for you. And then
[1210.8s] I'd give them the Bible. I wouldn't even
[1212.9s] read the text myself. I'd tell
[1216.1s] them. And what I do from that point on,
[1219.2s] I'd begin beginning from Genesis chapter
[1221.1s] 2 after creation. Text upon text, I'd be
[1227.3s] like, "Let's go to the next
[1230.2s] one." Text upon text, text upon text. It
[1233.4s] didn't matter to me that some of those
[1235.0s] women were breastfeeding and their
[1237.0s] children were crying. I'd be
[1242.4s] like, you know, in my mind, I was intent
[1245.7s] on winning people for the Lord. And I
[1248.6s] knew what I needed was eloquent
[1250.4s] arguments. I knew what I needed was to
[1253.1s] have text upon text. And that, I promise
[1255.4s] I did. By now, you can already tell
[1258.2s] eloquence was not a
[1260.0s] problem. And so, I was ready for them. I
[1263.8s] was ready. I I used to go and tell them,
[1265.7s] you know, we have been sent here by the
[1267.1s] Lord. And the Lord says if you refuse we
[1269.5s] will leave and shake off our dust and
[1271.9s] say Lord we have done what you sent us
[1273.6s] to do now the rest to
[1275.7s] make. You see people of God I had spent
[1278.3s] so much time thinking that what the
[1280.6s] world needs is more content more truth
[1283.9s] more texts but all the reality that I
[1287.0s] came into as and I mean don't get me
[1289.4s] wrong I still look back to those times
[1291.0s] with gratefulness. If it were not for
[1292.9s] them I probably wouldn't be standing
[1294.3s] here now. I've gone to the world and
[1296.3s] right now I'd be a DJ somewhere.
[1298.8s] Sorry. But now circle back here. Now the
[1302.2s] Bible then reminds us that the whole
[1305.0s] idea of ministry is community. You see
[1308.7s] people of God, let me tell you
[1310.4s] this. Right
[1312.8s] now with simply a single Google search,
[1317.8s] someone can find as much content as they
[1320.9s] need.
[1322.4s] There is content available and there is
[1324.7s] no scarcity of it. In fact, I promise
[1327.5s] you with a single YouTube search, men
[1329.9s] can find preachers that are
[1331.9s] significantly more eloquent and more
[1334.0s] learned than all of us put together.
[1335.9s] True or false. So that what the world is
[1338.6s] lacking is not a scarcity of content.
[1341.6s] People have heard these things. People
[1343.9s] have known these things. In fact, there
[1345.8s] are places I have gone where even before
[1348.6s] I speak, someone
[1350.4s] says, "I even know the text." And I'm
[1353.5s] like, "Okay, you know that one. Let me
[1354.6s] show you another one." And they're like,
[1355.8s] "Even that one, I read it when I was
[1357.5s] when I was your age, you know, when I
[1360.1s] was still a young man. Now I'm there. I
[1362.1s] can say when I was a young man, you
[1363.4s] know, hi ambassadors." When I was a
[1365.8s] young man. But now what humanity is
[1370.4s] lacking and all of you will bear witness
[1373.0s] of this
[1374.0s] fact. What the world is actually looking
[1376.8s] for is
[1378.8s] community. A place where they can be
[1381.7s] fully known yet still deeply loved. A
[1385.2s] place where they can come without shame,
[1387.8s] without fear. They can come just as they
[1390.3s] are and find acceptance. And when they
[1393.8s] come they find that the very people
[1396.2s] dwelling in that midst are also living
[1399.1s] in love and dwelling in unity. You see
[1401.8s] the church of God is struggling because
[1405.0s] we are trying to bring the world into an
[1407.6s] experience that we do not now possess.
[1410.7s] And so people come and they find us
[1413.0s] divided amongst one another. And God
[1415.1s] asks if a kingdom is divided in itself
[1418.6s] can it truly stand? The world is coming
[1421.8s] to find community and they come and they
[1424.0s] find people here bearing tales about one
[1427.0s] another. The world is coming to find a
[1429.8s] place of acceptance and they find
[1431.8s] Christians who haven't accepted each
[1434.1s] other. The world is coming seeking for a
[1437.4s] love that looks like Jesus Christ where
[1440.8s] they will feel at home even though they
[1443.3s] are struggling. Where the standard will
[1445.8s] not be lowered. Yes. But they will be
[1449.1s] reminded that there is grace to reach
[1451.7s] that standard. The the world is looking
[1455.0s] for such a community. But when they
[1457.3s] come, what do they find? They find us
[1461.2s] bickering and fighting, harboring so
[1464.6s] much hatred one toward
[1466.9s] another, divided in so much pain and
[1470.6s] anguish because the people who have hurt
[1473.0s] us the most are people who dare name the
[1475.4s] name of Christ. They come and find
[1480.0s] that. They come and find that here there
[1483.3s] are people who we have vowed that we
[1485.4s] will never talk to. And so if we even
[1487.8s] enter the the compound and park and we
[1489.9s] find we've parked next to them, we'd
[1491.4s] rather go park outside. They find that
[1494.0s] there are people who when you walk along
[1495.5s] the streets, you would dare not say hi
[1497.6s] to them because you know Mimi and
[1499.9s] brother X and Y and Zed, we we are done.
[1503.7s] As as my grandmother would say,
[1506.9s] Our blood is not accepting each other.
[1510.3s] Yet the Bible tells us we are accepted
[1511.9s] in the blood of the beloved. Amen.
[1514.6s] The Bible reminds us, read with me, John
[1517.1s] 17:21, that they may be one as thou,
[1520.3s] Father, art in me, and I in thee, that
[1523.8s] they also may be one in us, that the
[1527.3s] world may believe that thou hast sent
[1530.4s] me. Verse 22 says, "And the glory which
[1534.1s] thou gavest me, which glory? The glory
[1536.8s] of self sacrificing love, the glory of
[1541.0s] Christ that says that greater love hath
[1544.2s] no man than this, than that he laid down
[1547.0s] his life for his brethren." The Bible
[1549.8s] says, "The glory that thou gavest me, I
[1553.8s] have given to them. I have shown them
[1557.6s] what it is like to live a
[1560.0s] self-sacrificing life. I have shown them
[1563.0s] what it is like to live not for
[1565.4s] themselves but for their neighbor. I
[1568.1s] have shown them what it is like to live
[1570.4s] life not asking what can my neighbor do
[1573.4s] for me but what can I do for my
[1576.6s] neighbor? The glory which thou gavest to
[1579.4s] me I have given them that what might
[1581.8s] happen. Read that next phrase.
[1584.4s] Uh, I lost you at some point. Praise
[1586.2s] God. The preacher is shouting.
[1589.2s] We are still together. Now the Bible
[1591.4s] reads, read with me. Read with me. We
[1593.0s] are in verse 22. And the glory that thou
[1595.4s] gavest me, I have given them that what
[1598.3s] might happen.
[1600.5s] Louder, people of God. That what might
[1602.2s] happen?
[1603.9s] That they may be
[1607.6s] one. that as we partake of the
[1611.0s] self-sacrificing spirit of
[1613.1s] God, asking not what our brethren can do
[1616.2s] for us, but what can we do for our
[1618.2s] brethren as we embrace the spirit of
[1620.7s] self sacrificing love. The Bible says
[1623.6s] that they may be one even as we are one.
[1629.9s] Proceeds on to say the 23rd text, I in
[1633.3s] them and thou in me. Listen to this.
[1636.3s] that they may be made perfect in one.
[1640.5s] And what shall happen? That the world
[1643.8s] may know that thou hast sent
[1647.4s] me and hast loved them and thou hast
[1651.8s] loved
[1653.1s] me. People of
[1657.2s] God,
[1659.2s] beloved, the Lord is
[1661.5s] intent on reminding us of this singular
[1665.6s] fact that we as ambassadors of
[1669.4s] Christ. We who on this inaugural
[1673.0s] Adventist World Ambassadors Day desire
[1676.6s] to take a stand that we have been called
[1679.2s] to show forth God to the world. The Lord
[1681.8s] reminds us that what that looks like is
[1685.0s] not eloquence of words. You see, what
[1687.7s] the Lord needs is not more
[1690.9s] eloquence. I dare say what the Lord
[1693.3s] needs is not simply more people who can
[1695.4s] quote and commit text to memory. I dare
[1698.7s] say what the Lord needs is not simply
[1700.9s] people who can stand and speak
[1702.8s] passionately about Jehovah. No, the Lord
[1705.8s] needs for the gospel to become real, to
[1709.4s] enter into human experience and
[1711.8s] transform. The Lord needs for the gospel
[1714.6s] to change our hardened hearts. That we
[1716.8s] might extend grace and love and
[1719.8s] forgiveness one to another. This is the
[1722.7s] glory of God. That the world might see
[1726.2s] that in New Life 7th Day Adventist
[1729.2s] Church, if you're feeling alone, that's
[1731.8s] the place to go. You will find people
[1733.5s] who care for you. Not because you do
[1735.5s] anything for them, but simply because
[1737.4s] they remember that you are that we are
[1739.9s] one family bound together by what Christ
[1742.5s] has done for us. What the world needs is
[1745.2s] a community of faith where when we
[1747.3s] stumble, we remember that we we need to
[1750.5s] hold each other up. When my brother
[1753.0s] offends me, I extend forgiveness to
[1755.4s] them. Like Stephen, even when they're
[1757.6s] stoning me with their words, I say,
[1759.2s] "Lord, forgive them for they know not
[1761.2s] what they do.
[1762.5s] The Lord desires a community of people
[1764.7s] who have so beheld the glory of God that
[1769.0s] all the things of earth have grown
[1770.9s] strangely dim in the light of his glory
[1773.3s] and his grace. Are people who have
[1775.4s] beheld Jesus so much that they say Lord
[1778.2s] take my life and let it be consecrated
[1781.6s] dear Lord to thee. are people who have
[1784.6s] been persuaded that living life in this
[1788.5s] manner living life in this manner is the
[1791.4s] most satisfying and most sustainable way
[1794.5s] to live. Turn with me to the book of
[1796.8s] Proverbs. Let's go to the fourth
[1798.1s] chapter. Proverbs the 4th chapter.
[1801.0s] Proverbs 4 is quickly becoming one of my
[1803.0s] favorite portions of scripture. Proverbs
[1805.6s] the 4th chapter. And I want to just read
[1807.5s] two texts here because as we listen to
[1809.8s] these
[1810.8s] things, as we listen to the things I'm
[1813.1s] telling you, it's easy to think that
[1816.4s] these are just mere recommendations that
[1819.8s] God is giving us and he is saying you
[1822.2s] can have them or not. But the wisdom of
[1825.5s] the Lord tells us something entirely
[1828.2s] different. Turn with me to the book of
[1830.4s] of Proverbs the 4th chapter reading
[1833.3s] verse 20. reading from verse 20 all the
[1836.3s] way to the 22nd text. And the Bible
[1838.1s] reads, I'm reading once again from the
[1839.8s] King James version, Proverbs 4:20 to
[1842.7s] verse 22. It says, "My
[1846.3s] son, attend to my words. Incline thine
[1851.5s] ears to my
[1853.3s] sayings. Let them not depart from thine
[1856.6s] eyes. Keep them in the midst of thine
[1859.7s] heart." Verse 22 says, "For they are
[1863.6s] life unto those that find them, and
[1867.4s] health to all thy flesh." Now, let me
[1870.3s] let me explain what I mean
[1873.2s] here. The Bible in telling us to live
[1876.8s] not for ourselves, but for others is
[1880.1s] speaking in what Solomon would call
[1882.2s] words of wisdom, describing to us the
[1885.6s] wisdom of God, that which goes on in his
[1888.0s] heart and his mind.
[1890.2s] And Solomon goes even as far in the
[1892.3s] inspiration of the spirit to tell us
[1894.8s] that when God tells us to do these
[1896.9s] things, he is not saying them as mere
[1900.7s] recommendations that we may do or not.
[1903.9s] The Bible says, and I want you to listen
[1905.4s] to that phrase very carefully. He says,
[1907.8s] "Keep my words for they are life to them
[1912.6s] that find them."
[1915.3s] that you see part of the reason why we
[1918.6s] live such unsatisfying
[1921.1s] lives is because we live for
[1924.3s] ourselves. Part of the reason why we
[1927.4s] have and have and have so much but we
[1930.0s] know for a fact we are so utterly
[1932.6s] unsatisfied is because according to the
[1934.8s] words of scripture there is no life that
[1938.2s] abounds in living apart from the wisdom
[1941.5s] of God. And the wisdom of God dictates
[1944.2s] that life abounds in giving and giving
[1947.5s] and giving. Again, the Bible reminds us
[1950.3s] in the book of Genesis that we were
[1952.2s] created in the image of Jehovah. So that
[1955.1s] if looking at Christ, we see
[1957.5s] self-sacrificing love. It means that we
[1960.1s] were also created to be
[1962.9s] selfsacrificing. And that in so doing
[1965.5s] humanity even finds what life is
[1967.9s] supposed to be. that the reason why we
[1970.8s] we chase and chase and chase and
[1972.7s] according to the words of the wise man
[1974.2s] we are chasing but wind. The reason why
[1976.6s] we we have sought for more and more and
[1978.8s] more and even when we arise to the
[1981.0s] highest peaks of life everything is
[1983.8s] still utterly unsatisfying is simply
[1986.9s] because we have set it in our hearts
[1989.0s] that we must live unto ourselves rather
[1992.5s] than for others. The Bible reminds us
[1994.6s] that the wisdom of God tells us that in
[1998.3s] yielding ourselves to God, allowing
[2001.1s] ourselves to live not just for ourselves
[2003.8s] but for others, in so doing, we then
[2006.4s] find what life abounds in. We find
[2009.6s] satisfaction when we live in service not
[2013.6s] to ourselves but for our neighbor. When
[2016.7s] we give ourselves for the work and life
[2019.4s] of Christ. And that looks like different
[2022.1s] things. Don't get me wrong, God is not
[2025.1s] calling us to give up our jobs and to
[2027.4s] spend the rest of our lives as min as as
[2029.2s] as as lay ministers. Some of us might be
[2031.6s] called to such work. If God calls you,
[2033.8s] yield and go. But the Lord is describing
[2037.0s] principles that reach into the reality
[2039.5s] of how we live life. You see,
[2042.8s] um I am a
[2045.0s] preacher. In my spare time, I am an
[2048.0s] engineer when I'm free during the week.
[2052.9s] And at when I when I was at work um in
[2056.3s] the office, I am I I'm consistently
[2059.6s] reminded of this idea because we have
[2062.5s] had we have had sessions with my
[2065.1s] workmates where we tried to
[2067.8s] philosophically talk about the gospel. I
[2070.2s] mean they know I'm a Seventh Day
[2071.4s] Adventist. Um but I was I was I I work
[2073.8s] at a place where people have never even
[2075.8s] heard the name Seventh Day Adventist. So
[2078.6s] they just know I'm a Christian. And so
[2081.6s] we've had philosophical discussions.
[2083.9s] We've had discussions about about
[2086.4s] theodysy and the question of the problem
[2088.5s] of pain and all these things. We have we
[2091.1s] have tried to dissect the logic of
[2093.4s] Christianity. And having spent so much
[2095.8s] time actually studying and understanding
[2098.7s] uh seeking to understand so much of this
[2100.4s] theology. I was ready with so many
[2103.1s] arguments. I was ready to counter every
[2105.7s] question, every thought, every single
[2107.9s] thing that they did. And that I promise
[2109.8s] you I did very well. When they'd bring
[2112.9s] up an argument, I'd overwhelm them with
[2115.2s] logic. But what was most striking to me
[2118.6s] is that during the times we'd actually
[2120.5s] spend this much time countering all the
[2122.4s] arguments. They would actually live
[2124.5s] there more hardened than before. They'd
[2126.6s] say, "You've won this time, but I'm
[2129.0s] going to come back with even more
[2130.3s] arguments next time."
[2132.4s] But what's interesting is that the
[2134.6s] things that ultimately won over some of
[2136.9s] my colleagues, some of whom have
[2138.6s] actually now joined the church, the 7th
[2140.5s] Day Adventist Church, is simply the fact
[2142.8s] that above everything
[2145.4s] else at work, God impressed upon my
[2148.2s] heart to learn to be kind to them. not
[2152.5s] to partake of this competitive spirit of
[2155.7s] the world where if if they have I don't
[2159.5s] where I want to show myself off to my
[2161.4s] boss that I am the one who is best at
[2164.2s] what I do and so that I am retained and
[2166.9s] they are not but rather one of the
[2169.0s] things that actually won over two of my
[2170.9s] colleagues is that um we in my in my
[2174.9s] dayto-day we we program a lot and I'm a
[2177.9s] fairly good programmer at work to the
[2181.0s] extent that my my supervisor had a
[2183.3s] particular liking toward me because I'd
[2185.3s] get the work done a bit fast.
[2188.0s] But what was interesting at least what
[2190.2s] won over two of these colleagues of mine
[2192.2s] is that at first they were very worried
[2194.6s] because they felt that I am now
[2196.9s] competing with them and now you know
[2199.4s] when when I because I work in a donor
[2201.6s] funded organization when funding is cut
[2204.2s] they will be removed and I will be kept
[2206.5s] and so we had built a very competitive
[2209.1s] spirit and I used to pray about this
[2211.5s] because I desired to reach out to them.
[2213.9s] I desired to show them what the gospel
[2216.3s] of Christ looks like. And one day the
[2218.8s] Lord impressed upon my heart that if the
[2221.4s] problem is that they are struggling to
[2222.8s] to to write code, then why not have
[2227.0s] sessions in the office with some of my
[2229.4s] colleagues who are interested to
[2231.0s] practice how to code. And so we set up a
[2233.9s] recurring meeting every day where we
[2236.1s] used to to write you know we started
[2237.7s] just learning a bit of Python and we you
[2240.3s] know we we we'd practice and just come
[2242.6s] curate amazing materials and you know
[2244.9s] the beauty of being a preacher is that
[2246.6s] you learn how to become a teacher cuz
[2248.7s] right now you're listening to me right?
[2251.3s] I know you're listening. And so we'd
[2253.4s] we'd we' we'd sit together and we'd and
[2255.8s] we'd code and stuff like that. And they
[2258.3s] were very intrigued until one day a
[2261.4s] certain lady um from from Kazakhstan who
[2264.3s] was one of my colleagues came to me and
[2265.8s] told
[2266.6s] me why is it that you are actually
[2269.1s] helping us? I mean if we become good at
[2272.2s] this we might take your job and in my
[2276.4s] office again I'm the youngest and I'm
[2279.1s] the only one without a master's
[2281.0s] degree. So that she was actually telling
[2283.8s] me, "Aren't you intimidated that we have
[2286.2s] master's degrees and the only edge you
[2289.1s] have over us is that you're a better
[2290.8s] programmer so that if we have that, you
[2293.8s] will be fired and we will
[2295.9s] remain." And that gave me entrance to
[2298.7s] tell to tell her that the reason why I'm
[2301.0s] not
[2302.0s] worried is because I serve a God who
[2304.9s] first opened this door for me.
[2308.1s] I serve a God who is keeping me here.
[2312.1s] I serve a God who when my time has come
[2315.4s] will remove me from here so that I am
[2317.9s] not worried about competition because I
[2320.6s] am not walking in a world where I am
[2323.0s] fighting for my own life. No, I am
[2325.3s] walking in a world where the Lord says
[2327.3s] he is my shepherd so that my work is to
[2330.6s] let him lead and I will follow. And if
[2334.0s] he leads me elsewhere, what do I do as
[2336.2s] sheep? May I ble my way following him?
[2340.0s] If he tells me, "My child, our time here
[2341.8s] is done." What do we do? We wake up and
[2344.0s] we leave. And so profoundly, someone who
[2347.6s] I had tried spending so much time to
[2350.3s] counter their arguments against the
[2352.8s] gospel by this simple thing was
[2357.3s] persuaded that if your God can allow you
[2359.8s] to do such things, then maybe maybe I
[2362.4s] should give that God a chance. Maybe
[2364.8s] there's a point to what he's trying to
[2366.6s] say. Maybe, just maybe, what the world
[2370.8s] is looking for is not more eloquent
[2373.4s] arguments. They have those eloquent
[2375.9s] arguments. You will meet people who will
[2378.0s] even tell you, "I know the Sabbath is
[2379.8s] Saturday. You're not telling me anything
[2381.6s] new." Maybe what the world is looking
[2384.2s] for when they're looking at people who
[2386.3s] are supposed to be proclaiming Jesus is
[2389.0s] to see a heart of love. To see kindness
[2392.7s] when hatred has been offered to them. To
[2395.7s] see love when envy has been offered to
[2398.7s] them. When maybe they're just looking
[2401.1s] for people who when the world has tried
[2403.9s] to mold them into its image and make
[2406.2s] them selfish, make them think about
[2408.6s] themselves. when the world has told them
[2410.6s] that your highest duty is to affirm
[2413.0s] yourself every day in the mirror and
[2414.6s] tell you and and tell them I am worthy.
[2417.2s] I am what maybe the world is looking for
[2419.3s] people who have read the gospel and can
[2421.5s] now look in the mirror and say I am not
[2424.0s] worthy of my own but I am worthy in
[2426.7s] Jesus
[2427.6s] Christ. And if God has done that for me
[2430.9s] then he can do it for you too. Maybe the
[2434.0s] world is looking for a gospel that can
[2436.7s] enter into the realm of human
[2440.4s] experience. Take hold of people,
[2443.7s] transform them into the image of
[2446.3s] Jesus. And then God will say in the book
[2449.4s] of 2 Corinthians 5:20, turn with me
[2451.8s] there. 2 Corinthians the 5th chapter the
[2454.8s] 20th text that once we have known Jesus
[2458.0s] as we are supposed to know him once we
[2460.7s] have beheld Christ as we are supposed to
[2463.4s] behold him once we have looked fully
[2466.1s] into the wonderful face of Jesus 2
[2468.9s] Corinthians 5:20 says now then we are
[2474.7s] ambassadors for Christ that now then
[2478.0s] after having beheld who Jesus is after
[2481.6s] Having understood the truth that God is
[2483.8s] calling us to, after having been
[2486.4s] persuaded of the beauty of the gospel,
[2488.9s] the Bible says, "Now then we are
[2492.7s] ambassadors for Christ." After having
[2495.4s] partaken of the spirit of Jesus, now
[2497.8s] then we go into the world, into our
[2500.4s] workplaces, into our families, into our
[2502.8s] homes, our societies. We then go and say
[2506.0s] that come, come find a man. Come find
[2510.4s] Jesus who did all these things for me
[2512.6s] and can do them for you too. Come. And
[2515.0s] the Bible says, "Now then we are
[2516.9s] ambassadors for Christ as though God did
[2520.2s] beseech you by us." that God through our
[2523.8s] experience is begging you. You who are
[2526.3s] struggling to find community, come to
[2528.4s] our community. You who are struggling to
[2531.0s] accept yourself, come find acceptance in
[2534.2s] Jesus Christ. You who are struggling to
[2536.4s] think that you are of worth, come see a
[2538.5s] man who died for you, that you are worth
[2541.8s] dying for, that God is beseeching the
[2544.5s] world by us. That we pray you in
[2548.9s] Christstead. that we are standing to the
[2551.5s] world in the place of Jesus telling them
[2554.4s] guys we are just but beggars telling
[2558.2s] other beggars where you can go and find
[2560.4s] bread we were hungry and he fed us and
[2563.7s] so you don't need to be hungry anymore
[2566.2s] come find a Christ who will feed you and
[2569.8s] satisfy you this is what it means to be
[2572.9s] an ambassador for Christ this is what it
[2575.7s] means to live for Jesus it doesn't mean
[2579.3s] that all of us have been called to stand
[2581.0s] on pull pits and preach. No. To each of
[2583.1s] us has been given a ministry. To each of
[2585.6s] us has been given a place, a corner that
[2588.2s] we can brighten. To each of us has been
[2590.6s] given a center of influence wherein we
[2593.4s] may win people for the Lord. Some of us
[2595.4s] have not been called to stand here and
[2597.3s] speak for 40 plus
[2599.2s] minutes. But all of us have been called
[2601.9s] given a people or two that we may
[2604.6s] influence for the Lord. I will never
[2606.8s] have access to some of the people you do
[2608.6s] to tell them about the gospel. But God
[2610.9s] has called you in your experience to
[2613.2s] become the Bible in shoes to become the
[2616.3s] living exemplification of what it means
[2619.4s] to live for Jehovah, to trust him, to
[2622.2s] love
[2623.3s] him. In the grand scheme of existence,
[2627.0s] our lives become
[2629.2s] meaningful only when we begin living for
[2632.1s] God and for our fellow man. thinking not
[2635.5s] what can the whole world do for me but
[2638.4s] Lord what can I do for the world and if
[2642.2s] it means that what I can do for the
[2644.4s] world is to become a street
[2646.8s] sweeper Martin Luther King Jr. will say,
[2649.7s] "Let the Christian street sweeper become
[2652.2s] the best street sweeper that even angels
[2655.0s] in heaven and men on earth will say
[2657.6s] after his passing that here here lived a
[2661.1s] man, the best street sweeper that this
[2663.9s] street ever saw." God is calling you in
[2667.3s] the realm of your own experience, in the
[2670.1s] corner that only you can brighten to
[2672.5s] become the ultimate version of yourself.
[2675.8s] A version that can be found only through
[2678.0s] the salvation that is in Jesus Christ. A
[2680.8s] version that can be obtained only
[2682.5s] through the redemption that is in the
[2684.6s] face and heart of Jesus Christ. And you
[2687.2s] know what happens ultimately when we do
[2689.0s] this? Turn with me to our final text.
[2691.0s] Acts chapter one uh chapter se chapter
[2693.3s] 17 sorry our final text our key text.
[2697.0s] When we begin living like this living
[2699.2s] not for ourselves but for humanity. I
[2702.0s] want you to notice when the apostolic
[2704.2s] church lived like this, what did the
[2707.1s] Bible say of them? And I want to read
[2709.4s] from the King James version. I really
[2711.4s] love how it puts it here. And I want you
[2713.0s] to listen. Acts chapter 17 verse
[2717.4s] 6. The Bible speaks of such men, men who
[2721.7s] loved the Lord, men who lived for the
[2725.0s] Lord, men who were persuaded for
[2727.7s] Jehovah. The Bible says in verse 6, "And
[2730.9s] when they found them not, they drew
[2733.8s] Jason and certain brethren unto the
[2736.6s] rulers of the city crying." Listen to
[2738.6s] what they cry. They say, "This that have
[2741.7s] turned the world upside
[2745.5s] down." That the people who live for
[2749.2s] Jesus are the only people who will ever
[2753.6s] have true impact.
[2756.9s] Of such men. The Bible says the earth
[2759.8s] shall tremble beneath their tread.
[2764.2s] Of such men, the Bible says when Christ
[2767.9s] comes, he will look upon them and
[2770.8s] say, "Come, oh thou good and faithful
[2774.5s] servant. You have been faithful in
[2777.3s] little. Come, I will make you ruler over
[2782.8s] much." Let's pray.
[2790.3s] Father, all that we may look fully into
[2793.4s] the wonderful face of
[2795.2s] Jesus and that we may be
[2798.1s] persuaded that life abounds not in
[2801.5s] living for
[2802.8s] ourselves but in living for our
[2805.9s] neighbors. And Lord, may the wonderful
[2809.6s] grace of Jesus redeem us from our
[2814.0s] selfishness and transform us to
[2817.6s] selflessness to the glory and honor of
[2820.6s] your name now and forever more. Amen.
[2827.1s] [Music]
[2844.5s] Are you
[2847.6s] [Music]
[2881.2s] There
[2882.8s] is a place of

[2900.2s] place where sin can
[2904.8s] not more
[2907.6s] last near to the heart of God.
[2916.6s] Oh
[2918.6s] Jesus blessed
[2921.7s] [Laughter]
[2925.3s] redeemer sent from the heart of God.
[2934.4s] Lord
[2936.1s] does who wait
[2941.0s] before
[2943.3s] thee near to the heart of God.
[2952.2s] There
[2953.8s] is a place of
[2958.7s] comfort,
[2960.8s] sweet, near to the heart of God.
[2968.4s] [Applause]
[2969.7s] A
[2971.2s] place where we our
[2976.2s] savior
[2978.4s] meet near to the heart of God.
[2987.4s] Oh
[2989.2s] Jesus blessed
[2991.7s] [Applause]
[2996.0s] redeemer sent from the heart of God.
[3005.0s] Hold
[3006.5s] us who wait
[3011.4s] before
[3013.6s] thee near to the heart of God.
[3024.1s] There is a place

[3033.0s] rel to the heart of God.
[3040.1s] [Music]
[3041.2s] A

[3047.4s] joy and
[3050.2s] peace. Near to the heart of God.
[3059.1s] Oh
[3061.2s] Jesus, blessed
[3066.8s] [Applause]
[3068.1s] redeemer, sent from the heart of God.
[3077.4s] Hold
[3078.8s] us to wait

[3082.4s] [Music]
[3084.0s] before

[3096.7s] God dear Lord as we pray.
[3104.8s] Take
[3106.3s] heart and mind
[3113.3s] fire from the breast of the world all
[3122.8s] around to your throne where grace does
[3129.3s] abound.
[3130.5s] [Music]
[3133.3s] May our lives be
[3137.2s] transformed by your
[3142.1s] love. May our
[3144.9s] souls be
[3147.2s] refreshed from above.
[3152.2s] [Music]
[3153.7s] at this
[3155.6s] moment. Let's be born
[3159.2s] [Music]
[3162.5s] everywhere. Join us now as we come to
[3168.3s] you in prayer.
[3170.8s] [Music]
[3173.4s] Oh
[3175.6s] Jesus blessed
[3182.8s] redeemer sent from the heart of God.
[3193.9s] All who wait
[3198.0s] before all
[3204.3s] the me to the
[3208.6s] heart of
[3217.7s] God. Let's all rise. Let's all rise.
[3224.5s] And as we make this final prayer, I'd
[3227.6s] like for you to make the recommitment in
[3229.6s] your heart that Lord, help me not to
[3233.0s] live unto myself, but to live for you
[3236.6s] and for fellow
[3238.2s] man. Let's believe and pray.
[3242.8s] Lord, when all is said and
[3245.7s] done, when the voice of the preacher is
[3248.6s] no more to be
[3249.9s] heard, when the sound of music by
[3252.8s] silence has been
[3255.3s] drowned, Lord, then will we live for you
[3259.6s] or for the world.
[3261.8s] Oh, how I plead that dear Lord, the
[3264.6s] words that you have spoken unto us this
[3267.8s] day may not be taken away by the evil
[3270.8s] one, but that Lord, we may ponder upon
[3273.6s] them, that we may lay hold by your grace
[3276.5s] upon them, and that Father, you may by
[3279.7s] looking fully into your wonderful face,
[3282.5s] transform us into the same image from
[3285.8s] grace to grace and from glory to glory.
[3290.3s] Lord, how I pray that you may make us
[3293.8s] truly Christians in our hearts. Give us,
[3298.3s] Lord, the mind of Jesus. Make us holy as
[3302.8s] he is. And Lord, may we prove that we've
[3307.0s] been with Jesus who is all our
[3310.2s] righteousness.
[3312.2s] Lord, with all my heart I pray, make us
[3316.9s] Christians today. This we ask in
[3320.6s] Christ's name. Amen.
