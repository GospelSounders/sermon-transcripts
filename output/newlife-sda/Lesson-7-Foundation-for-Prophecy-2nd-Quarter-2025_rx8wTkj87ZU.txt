FULL TRANSCRIPT:
Praise God and happy Sabbath. Thank you so much for joining us today at New Life 7th Day Adventist Church, Fifth Gong Avenue, Nairobi for our Sabbath school lesson discussion. I'm excited, as I said, about this quarter. We are studying um illusions, symbols, and images. and to help us understand how to study Bible prophecy. Last week we studied nations part two after having gone through nations part one seeing how the nations of this world the leadership of this world degrades over time. But as we went into the throne room of heaven, we saw that the temple of God grows in glory more and more. And we are waiting for that temple that will be revealed. that temple which eye has not seen, ear has not heard, those things which the Lord has prepared for his children. It is our prayer that you will be there. But as we continue to see how God is preparing his children in these last days, we want to go even in further to understand who who is God sending to prepare us um for that second coming who are ministering to us today as we look at foundations for prophecy. I am joined by my friends uh this morning. I would like them to introduce my uh themselves starting from my furthest left um to see who is joining us today. H my name is Enango Rafany. It's a pleasure to be with you today. Amen. And my name is Daniel Kur. I'm equally glad to be with you. Amen. And we are joined as well by my husband. Kindly introduce yourself. Hi, my name is Jafet Rena. Happy to be here. Amen. Thank you so much. Today our key text comes from the book of Isaiah chapter 6:8. Brother Kitur, would you kindly read for us? So we're going to the book of Isaiah and we're going to chapter 6 and verse 8. The Bible says in Isaiah chapter 6 verse 8, also I heard the voice of the Lord saying, whom shall I send? M and who will go for us? Then said I here am I send me. You know it's a very important question that uh the Lord asks. It's the host of heaven. They are asking who will go on our behalf? Who in the world is worthy to go on our behalf to share this gospel message? Who would go? And this is a vision of Isaiah in the throne room of heaven. And he responds after seeing the holiness of God and tells God Lord here I am send me. The question that I would ask is why does God have the authority to ask who would go for us? Why would God have the authority to even send any of us to go? It is because he has earned his right both as our creator and secondly as our redeemer. that in the same manner in which we have been redeemed, God empowers us to go forth and do the same work of empowering others. I want us to go into further details of this vision that um we are told of um of that Isaiah had before he responded. Here I am send me. Please just give us the context even before we come to the book of Isaiah chapter 6. What is Isaiah talking about in Isaiah chapter 1 to chapter 5? My brother Raphael indeed in the book of Isaiah chapter uh chapter 1 to5 uh we see uh Isaiah is um in essence um a prophet who is being called and uh I believe uh as as he's being called uh I believe you you referred to chapter 6 verse 1-5. Yes. So um we see a prophet who's been called and he begins and says in verse one that in the year that King Uzziah died, I saw also the Lord sitting upon a throne high and lifted up and his train filled the temple. He is given uh in in heavenly vision a vision of the government of God, a literal a physical uh vision of of of how things are there. And the Bible records uh he says uh in verse two he says above uh this throne of God stood the saraphins. Each one had six wings with twain he covered his face and with twain he covered his feet and with twain did he fly. And if in verse three says and one cried unto the other and said holy, holy, holy is the Lord of hosts and the whole earth is full of his glory. Then continues and speaks to us about the posts of the door moved at the voice of him that cried and the house was filled with smoke. Verse five says eventually when Isaiah is taking in this scene now he gets to a point and he says woe is me for I am undone because I am a man of unclean lips and I dwell in the midst of a people of unclean lips for mine eyes have seen the king the Lord of hosts. Amen. In essence, uh it's speaking to us about uh Isaiah getting into the presence of God. And I can imagine in my mind at this particular point in time, Isaiah was considered to be a very holy man in Israel. In fact, he was he was uh the kings and the and and and the establishment of the day looked at him as a as um as as a as a too too good. Somebody would say a goody two shoes, you know. Uh but lo and behold the prophet in the presence of God realizes his unworthiness. You know sometimes we can feel like we are holy. We can feel like uh we are modernday prophets. We are modernday uh men and women of God. Yet in reality when things uh when things uh when we are faced face first face first face first face first face first face first face first face first face first face first face first face first face first face first face first face first face first face first face first face first to face with God we will realize that indeed all of us have fallen and sinned and have fallen short of the glory of God and so we require uh God's intervention we require God to touch us in one way or another as we will see uh Isaiah was touched. Amen. Amen. And you know you've just talked about the holiness of God and what it means to be in his presence. you've reminded me that we did not actually pray even as we entered into this study. So because we had prayed just before we had um started I would ask um my my husband to kindly pray with us and then we can continue with this discussion. Thank you so much. Let us pray. Heavenly father we thank you for the opportunity that you gave us for uh this ministry. We ask that you continue to abide with us as you uh began with us. We ask us we ask that you continue with us that we complete this uh study uh for the glory of your name in Jesus name I pray. Amen. Amen. Amen. Um you know this is Isaiah who from chapter 1 to chapter 5 is essentially cursing everyone else and seeing how fallen everyone else around him is. He's just saying woe unto you. War unto you for this. war to you from the head of from the head of from the head to the to the feet of you are sick with sin putting evil for good for evil. Exactly. Constantly from chapter one to chapter 5. He's just speaking of wars. War unto you. War unto that city. War unto those people who do this. War unto until he sees the he he's brought in into the presence of God. And for the first time, Isaiah does not say war unto you. It is no longer outward. He sees himself indeed. And what it means when we come into the presence of God humbly and God reveals to us who we truly are. And Isaiah cries out, "Woe is me." Brother Kitur, just give us a a few details of the setup of that throne room of God and what even caused Isaiah to make this cry after crying out and casting other people to make this cry and say, "Woe is me." Yeah. I mean, it's a very um majestic throne room. Um it's a throne room full of activity. um they are living beings whose um uh posture to their creator is one of awe and wonder and worship. So he sort of catches a glimpse of what is happening there and perhaps he's trying to relate with his own posture of heart and mind towards God. So he catches a glimpse of how these heavenly beings pay homage to this creator of the universe. There are angels there, saraphim, cherubs and they are all falling down to worship these creator and he realizes even in his own worship he falls short. Amen. So he his his response is one of humility. He sees himself as unworthy and he prostrates himself to worship God. So it's a it's it's he sees the beings but even above the beings he probably catches a glimpse of the creator you know one who is above everyone else and uh you see they say there is nothing that is so illuminating as light. So if it is if if you think what you have is light, then wait until Jesus lights you with his own light and then you begin to appreciate indeed my light actually may be darkness. Because when you when you appreciate the character of God, more and more you feel how unworthy and how unlike him you are. And then more you real the more you realize your need of him to transform you that you may also reflect uh his glory. Amen. Amen. You know some of us are so lifted up in our hearts and it could be it's because we have not caught a glimpse of our Lord. We have not seen him. This was not just only Isaiah who reacted like this. We we we are told of Daniel in the presence of Christ. He just lost all his um energy. If you if we if you know so to speak and say that his legs could no longer hold him and he fell down prostrate to worship. We speak of John who in the presence of his savior he just fell down prostrate to worship him. The character when you we eventually behold our God. Um Jaffith maybe just speak to us about the beings that are now introduced here. Um brother Kitur has just spoke about them but who are these beings in the throne room of heaven and what does what do they what does what do their names mean? If you could um speak to that. Uh thank you. So the beings that are introduced are saraphim. Saraphim actually means the burning ones, you know, um the ones who are like um like shining forth, you know, and these are the beings who um you could say it is not that they are the source of light, but they are almost in a sense the reflectors um of that light that comes from the glory of God. And it's it's it's in a sense that you know the way that Christ wants us to be the light of the world. It is not really that we would be a source of light. It is that we would be bearing that light that comes from God to those who others in this case Isaiah was an audience of um of said light. So uh we have an example of John in the book of uh John the Baptist in the book of John 5:35 who was called what a burning and shining and a shining light. I think that is the idea and the idea that God wants us to inhabit even in this world among uh in every space that we occupy at our places of work or school that God wants us to be a light and Christ repeats in Matthew chapter 5 that a city that is set on a hill sorry will not be hidden there's a reason why a um a light is there it is meant to give light to those um um in his vicinity and and God has a desire for us to reflect this light that comes from God not from within. We will actually discuss a particular being who thought the light came from within themselves and how dangerous that path is. But for now, for for now at least, it is necessary for us to appreciate that God has given us a particular office of being in a sense lightbearers. Amen. A burning and a shining light. As we conclude um on this uh brother Rafael just coming back to you maybe speak to us about how was Isaiah prepared for ministry and how can we pick lessons from that to show us what how we need to spend time with God in the study of his word and how we can also be prepared for ministry as some of us who minister indeed uh the Bible continues in Isaiah chapter 6:6 and it says the following after Isaiah is overwhelmed med by the burden, by the real realization that it is not the sins of Israel uh that are the problem, but rather it is personal uh imperfections, personal sins that indeed uh condemn us before God. It's not what your neighbor is doing or not doing. It's what you are doing or not doing. And so he says, "Woe is me." But then the Bible continues and says, "Then flew one of the seraraphims unto me, having a live call in his hand, which he had taken with the tongues from off the altar." And he said, "And he laid it upon my mouth, and said, Lo, this had touched thy lips, and thine iniquity is taken away, and thy sin is purged." And I heard a voice of the Lord saying, "Whom shall I send and who will go for us?" Then said I, "Here am I. Send me." We see a man who has come in contact with the light because God is the light. And in the light of this light, he realizes his unworthiness, his utter foolish unworthiness. He who hitherto had thought himself to be a special minister for God. He realizes he's nobody. He's nothing before God. That's interesting. So he didn't necessarily go because he was the worthiest. He was nothing before God. Continue. Then he then now suddenly he he sort of in a crisis. But we see in every crisis, in every situation where we we don't find answers, God always has an answer. God had prepared. And the Bible records an angel takes one of the calls, a live call. That's an interesting way of of of looking at it. A live call, you know, uh in his hand and and uh he says he takes it, he picks it the tongue and he laid lays it where? In his mouth. They were not dying embers. They not dying embers. This this thing was alive and and and and active and powerful. And it's interesting. He puts it where? In his mouth. In essence, it is answering the specific thing that he the specific thing that Isaiah had said. He is a man of what? Unclean lips. And he dwells with people what? Of unclean lips. You see, the gospel is is is is perfectly tailored for the issues of man. the gospel uh and the solutions that we get from God are are so powerful and so different from the solutions of of of human beings because the solutions of God are tailored to our individual situations and and circumstances. And so the angel comes to this man of of unclean lips and puts a live call and he puts it in his mouth and he takes away his iniquity. He takes away his iniquity. And we we are conversant that he's in the temple. You know, he's in the temple. The Bible records to us in verse one that smoke and the train what? And his train filled the filled the temple. And so we ask ourselves where in the temple do we find live calls. We for a fact are where we are in the holy place. And uh in the holy place there was the altar of incense where they would burn incense which is symbolic of the prayers of the saints as and the incense is um the merits of the blood of Christ which make our prayers u uh incense. What the the fact the the effect of incense is that it it um it it brings some aroma. It it it brings some nice taste to to nice smell to a room. Um some people would call it aura. And so and so um from among these calls, the angel picks uh a call and sanctifies uh the the the prophet's mouth. And now the prophet is ready and willing. Now the prophet is cleansed. And when the question is asked, whom shall I send and who will go for us? The angels do not answer. But Isaiah answers and says, "Here am I. Send me." Amen. Amen. I pray that your lips as well will be touched by the calls from heaven. Fresh calls from heaven. And you will be as those burning seraps burning with the zeal for Jesus. Burning as with the zeal for Jesus. Um my uh Jaffith maybe just take us through these seraps that we have been introduced to. Do we see saraphs ministering here on earth beyond heaven? Do we see them ministering here on earth as we move on to the Monday part? Thank you. So in the book of Genesis chapter 3, we actually find at the very beginning angels were already uh engaged in the work of ministering and in the work of interacting with humans, doing the Lord's work. uh in the book of Genesis 3:21, right after the fall, right after God has uh given his decree, he has brought judgment upon um or at least declared the judgment on the man, the woman, and the serpent. uh uh immediately in um verse 23 and 24, God actually sends angels to a to do a particular work uh that that at first appears negative but actually we'll see is is actually symbolic of hope that that God hoped and expected would be placed in the hearts of God's people. We are told in verse 23 of Genesis chapter uh 3, therefore the Lord God sent him forth from the garden. This is Adam and Eve of Eden and to till the ground from whence he was taken. And so he drove him out and so he drove out man and he placed at the east of the garden of Eden cherubims and a flaming sword which turned every way to keep the way to the tree of life. And this was specifically because um h God did not want Adam and Eve to be to uh to to live the lives of immortal sinners. But then at the same time, why is it that God did not just destroy, you know, like God could easily have destroyed the tree of life and says, "I'll build another one later." The point is it was meant to remain there as a symbol of hope. What we find in Genesis 3:15 is the gospel that whatever is going on, whatever has begun, this great controversy that has begun that humanity is now involved in h the the eventually eh the good will have victory over the evil. Eventually the devil and and and everyone who is the devil, sin and everything that is evil will ultimately be destroyed. And and the fact that the angel simply kept the way and guarded the tree tree of life indicated that there was a time and in fact now it is fulfilled elsewhere in scripture that all this evil will be undone. Amen. Amen. So the angels were not just there to protect it but to give human beings hope. Brother Kur, is this the first time we're interacting with angels beyond the heavenly visions? Where else do we see representations or angels working? How do we see angels working now? Um, angels have always uh been sent to minister to the needs of humanity. Um, as has been rightly stated there, we we see angels in u Genesis chapter 3. Beyond that, uh, in the records of of of scripture, we see people like uh Joshua, you know, interacting with even the angel of the Lord. He's another special angel here. But in the lives of men uh the ministry of angels is very very active. Actually God's throne room is pictured uh as having lightnings and thunders and this perhaps may be an indication of the speed with which these angels urgently minister to the needs of humanity. Um, think of Daniel, think of Haniah, think of Misha, think of Aariah, think of missionaries ministering in dangerous places, protected, delivered, suckered, whichever uh sort of interposition. Actually, there's an interesting book by um uh one Spicer called The Hand That Intervenes. And this is a depiction of God's miraculous deliverance of his children by the ministry of angels. Actually uh personally I would want to meet my angel. Uh someone was joking and saying perhaps the first thing before he hugs me is to slap me because of the very many things that I have probably taken him uh through in the course of my journey here on the planet. But we cannot take for granted the ministry of angels to help men. Uh we see Daniel in the book uh of Daniel, he is struggling to understand a vision and God responds to his prayer of faith by sending the angel Gabriel to give him skill and understanding regarding that vision. So men conversed with angels concerning their problems and God gave them solutions. Now a very interesting one is quite similar to what we are discussing regarding Isaiah. It's uh the vision that we find in the book of revelation. uh John sees a vision in the book of revelation and there are some similarities that we can we can capture there. But the thing is that we see the throne of God and this picture of the throne of God is just sort of cementing the idea that uh God is the majesty of the universe. We also see angelic beings in worship, the cherubs and the saraphim uh in worship. And then we see the cosmic response. We see Isaiah declaring that he's a man of unclean lips. And we also see John in the book of Revelation chapter 4 falling down and he's seeing uh elders prostrating themselves worshiping him. So we we we we we are we are able to see that in God's throne room there are angels and they are not idol they are ready to minister to the needs of humanity. Amen. Ministering to the needs of humanity. No, you've just reminded me of the vision I of Ezekiel when he was with his servant Ghazi and Ghazi was so troubled when they saw a whole army against them and you know Ezekiel was quick to say you have not you if only your eyes were to be opened you'll see all these angels brother Raphael um in context of Hebrews chapter 1:14 how can we quickly just commenting on this how can we see the work of angels especially as it relates to our salvation. All right. We've seen them in deliverance. We've seen them worshiping God as brother Kitur has spoken of. We've seen them as he has mentioned of them coming to answer difficult prayers or coming to an give us difficult answers to visions we've received. How do we see them working in our salvation? Hebrews chapter 1 verse14 speaks to us about angels and he says are they not all ministering spirits sent forth to minister for them who shall be heirs of salvation. Amen. That in the gospel story in the story of the salvation of this planet that has been wrecked by sin and by troubles uh from the days uh that Adam ate that fruit. Angels have been active. Angels were there in the Garden of Eden, not only protecting men, but also encouraging them, admonishing. The very fact that the Garden of Eden persisted for for that long was also in essence a way of of of of inspiring men that one day you will enter. You know, if God took away the garden of Eden, immediately Adam and Eve sinned, it it it would have shown some an aspect of some permanence in in in the punishment. But the garden of Eden persisted there and a watchman was kept there simply but for a time but for a time. But then Paul writes again in Hebrews 13 and:2 and he says be not forgetful to entertain strangers for thereby some have entertained angels unawares. He tells us that sometimes angels walk in our midst. this he's talking to the he's borrowing from the example of Abraham when he saw some three strange men and he decided to to to to to slaughter some sheep to give them meat and he decided to bake some bread for them and eventually that day is when he got the promise of a son. That day was when Sarah laughed and Sarah was told at a time like this next year I will come and surely you will have a child. They were just men walking as they were going towards Sodom and Gomorrah. And Sodom and Gomorrah at the gates, Lot welcomed angels of God. And the children of uh of of Sodom and Gomorrah were blinded and they wanted to to to to partake of deviant sexual behaviors and to abuse these men uh sexually. Yet these were angels. And so it simply tells us that the ministry of angels is alive and the power of God in our lives through through cherubim and saraphim is is a reality. And many a times we are told when we got when we get to heaven we shall read in the records how angels saved us and we did not know. Amen. You may never know maybe somebody you sat to next you sat next to was actually an angel and maybe he told you something and you decided to go a different direction whereas if you had gone where you were going you would have met with disaster. The ministry of angels is a reality and it is indeed a privilege to be ministered to and they minister to those who are heirs of salvation. And who are the heirs of salvation? It is us. It is us. you and me, whosoever believes and receives Christ in his heart. You know, God told the children of Israel when you're making the sanctuary, they had to put all these um paintings of angels even in the temple, paintings of angels to remind them of those ministers who will continually help them through this journey. Brother, there's a very very interesting vision. I want you to just go into it and just break it down for us because I would want us to finish this lesson without going into it. Exactly. Now, this is connected to what you're talking about. And if you could just mention this concerning angels and salvation. There could be a one who is probably in darkness right now. You're feeling like there's an envelope. There's a cloud of darkness that is surrounding you. But I want you to be encouraged that God through his angels send light and encouragement. Actually um even before one receives salvation, it is angels who protect such souls until light comes to them. Then they are able to decide for Jesus or otherwise. Amen. Um actually when people are getting discouraged and they're getting into they're sinking into uh despair, God sends encouragement through angels. And actually when when a sinner when you and I are bended low before God and we are uh confessing sin, angels are usually around us to beat back the forces of darkness and evil and to confirm us even in Christ Jesus. So angels are very active in the salvation of human beings. Now in the book of Ezekiel there is a special vision and I'll just read uh this is what Ezekiel says in Ezekiel 1 verse 4. I'll read a couple of verses. Uh the Bible says Ezekiel chapter 1 verse4 and I looked and behold a whirlwind came out of the north a great cloud and a fire infolding itself and a brightness was about it and out of the midst thereof as the color of amber out of the midst of the fire also out of the midst thereof came like the likeness of four living creatures and this was their appearance. They had the likeness of a man, and everyone had four faces, and everyone had four wings, and their feet were straight feet, and the sole of their feet was like the soul of a cal's foot, and they sparkled like the color of banished brass, and they had the hands of a man under their wings on their four sides, and they four had their faces and their wings, and their wings were joined joined one to another. They turned not when they went, they went everyone straight forward. And as for the likeness of their faces, they for had the face of a man, the face of a lion, and on the right side they they for had the face of an ox, and on the left side they for also had the face of an eagle. Now h we won't get into the very details of the vision but I want you to understand that um John also as a prophet of God catches a similar uh vision in the book of revelation chapter chapter 4. Uh we won't read revelation 4:1 to 111 but there are some striking similarities. Ezekiel also in later chapters of the book of Ezekiel adds details regarding these uh special uh you know vision that he has of beings with faces of a man, a lion uh eagle and he actually tells us that these are actually cherubs. angels, a special kind of angels. Actually, the word cherub means one who is like the father. One who is like the father. So um this is what John catches uh also in the book of revelation chapter 4 a picture of these angels and by the way who are meant to as has been alluded reflect God's character that shining burning bright lights. Amen. A very beautiful vision and you know we see them moving in harmony. One does not turn without the other turning. They are moving in harmony. And it's interesting to to see that the very they they they they are sort of under the very foundation of God's throne. God is it's it's as though they are just where God is and they are being they are directing the movements of God's throne. Let me ask let me ask you uh brother Rafael um do we see this depiction of these four faces here on earth for God continually remind us that the same creatures that are directing his the movement of his very throne in heaven we see the depictions of them here on earth when and how do we how does God remind his children of that indeed um it's it's interesting um these creatures uh one is a lion, the other one is a man, the other one is an ox and the other one is an eagle. and uh the way they are depicted uh amongst uh amongst humanity. In the book of numbers chapter 2, we find uh the children of Israel as they were moving uh from Egypt to the promised land and Moses had organized some some sort of temple which was called a tabernacle which was mobile. And we knew we know that the children of Israel had 12 tribes. And these 12 tribes were divided by four into into groups of threes. And they each uh moved uh almost um uh with the tabernacle at the center and then three tribes on each side. And so it was it was like a perfect square that kept moving. And amongst these amongst these tribes amongst these three tribes that are divided into four, there was one dominant tribe. And each tribe uh had an emblem. You know the way you can have a flag and uh your flag has got something to uh to the effect of um of uh of of Yes. Yes. Like it has some symbolism you know for example um um the national football team of Uganda is called what? The Uganda cranes. The crested cranes of the crested cranes of Uganda. you know and and and and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on all these creatures we we take some aspects uh the national football team for for England is the three lions you know they they're taking upon themselves the majesty and the power of the lion and so this did not start uh recently but even back then as they moving from Egypt to the promised land the children of Israel had these uh these symbolic uh symbols representing different uh different um uh leading tribes amongst the divisions of the trees And in numbers, you can read the story from the book of Numbers chapter 2. And basically, Judah was was represented by a lion. Reuben was represented by a man. And Ephraim was represented by an ox. Dan similarly was represented by an eagle. And so we see in something significant that they are all surrounding what the tabernacle. It was almost as if God was giving them a design almost a replica of how it is in heaven. We've seen in Isaiah sees God on his throne and then around him they this cherubim saraphene Ezekiel opens it up to us now and even tells us depictions of of of this of these of these of these of these of these beings and how they have different faces. And the same uh are also once again traced um in revelation and and this imagery continues all the way up to the new Jerusalem. Amen. We see in the new Jerusalem it has what we call it a kingdom four square as the himw writer says and and and there's there's a there's a gate on each what on each side of the of this door and on each and and on each panel of the doors we are told there are the not what the names of what of the tribes the names of the various tribes and different people will enter not all of us will we may get to heaven but the roots we'll take may be different yours may be the eastern gate my sister mine the northern But we'll meet at the center at the feet of Jesus. Amen. And so and so it's al it's also speaking to us about our various experiences. You know um one one author puts it puts it thus that even the gospels themselves are depictions of these things. That's actually what I was writing down and and and and he says for example Matthew shows us Christ the man you know Jesus's humanity and his kingship. Mark tells us about Christ as the lion, Jesus as the powerful and bold servant. Others Luke tells us as Christ as the ox, Jesus as the sacrifice and service. And then John tells us about Christ as the eagle. He speaks about his divinity and his heavenly nature. You see, it is an archetype and and and and and and a formation that is replete in the gospel story and repeated and ultimately even in the new Jerusalem. Amen. Amen. So interesting that the very throne room of heaven, God tries to replicate it here on earth to just remind us of what awaits us. That the same heavenly angels that minister to him, we also have our own ministering spirit sent to us who are the heirs of salvation. I want us to talk about a very specific angel. But before we go there, brother Kitan to ask you one question. The the the vision in the book of Ezekiel tells us that there are wheels. M what what do those wheels represent? Oh, I mean it's it's a very complicated uh uh vision that uh the prophet Ezekiel uh sees and he sees a wheel within a wheel and they are turning and they are moving and it's it's a vision of of God's throne room and also a depiction of his ultimate authority. Amen. and sovereignity that you know to us to the prophet he saw something that was very confusing. Uh something that he could not understand and sometimes like as human beings when we watch the events that are happening on the planet they are very confusing to us. We don't know what to tell. We don't know which direction things are going. But the vision of this will within a will reminds us that ultimately it is God who is in charge. Actually far above the destructions that Ezekiel was seeing, God was sit sat was still sat on his throne as in charge and actually he is the one who orders from his come eternity the events according to his own wisdom, will and power and glory. Amen. So God is in charge and actually um uh it's it's a very uh it it should give you and I hope and encouragement in the fact that this world is not without a ruler. Amen. Amen. You know life can look confusing but God is in charge. God is in control. Um, Jaffth, a heavenly vision of the throne room of heaven, perfect, everything moving in harmony. Angels who even in the presence of God, they veil their faces, everything looks like it is in order. How do we end up with Lucifer? Who was Lucifer to begin with? Thank you so much. Um uh in review of the Thursday uh part of the lesson, um Lucifer is is is is a being that is described first of all by Jesus Christ most importantly and he identifies him as as as the big bad. today. Um I think an excess of modernism um secularism, materialism can make us think that uh the evil described or the devil described in the Bible is like an embodiment of evil, a general embodiment of things that are evil and not an actual personal being. But the scriptures tell us that that being is an actual personal literal being. When in the book of John 8:44 when Jesus says you're of the father the devil, your lust of the father your your your last you will do because he was a murderer from the beginning and abode not in the truth. And again in the book of first John 3:8 we see he that committeth sin is of the devil. Why? For the devil sins from the beginning. For this purpose was the son of man manifested. The very reason that Jesus Christ was manifested was not to fight against clouds but was to destroy the works of an actual personal being. It says that he might destroy the works of the devil. Now in the book of uh um Ezekiel, I think that's a very powerful point that beyond taking away the sins of men, you know, you think he just he was coming to destroy the power of the devil. There were those people say I may be demonp possessed. Christ came to destroy them. Amen. Amen. Or something has come into my house. Christ came also. That was his mission to destroy the works of the devil. Amen. So now in the book of Ezekiel, we actually find uh two things. One, the description of of overtly um the prince of Ty, the king of Ty, the head of Ty. Um and Ty was a kingdom um in ancient times. But in interpass in this description, it is clear that a second being is being discussed. From the description of this being, we are told concerning this particular being in verse 12. Son of man, take up a lamentation upon the king of Tyrus and say, Thus said the Lord, thou sealest up the psalm, full of wisdom and perfect in beauty. Verse 13, thou hast been in Eden, the garden of God. Who could have been in Eden, the garden of God? Definitely not the king of T. Clearly not the king of T. And every precious stone was thy covering. And then it lists like nine bits of covering and the workmanship of the of nine bits of uh stones and all set in gold. Interestingly, the high priest had 12 bits of stone um set in gold. So this being was and and and the high priest clearly represents who? Jesus Christ. So this being it's like like almost approaching or approximating um that level of divinity. And you would think that you know this sort of thing will get to its head and that's unfortunately what happened. Thou at the anointed cherob that coverth verse 14 it's actually the clincher and I have set thee so thou upon the holy mountain of God. Thou hast walked up and down in the midst of the stones of earth. So, not only did this being have access to Eden, this being was actually in heaven. Unlike all over in the book of Ezekiel 27, there's a description about Egypt, about so many other kingdoms. There is no such thing of a supernatural nature except here. Here we actually find a description of a being having walked up and down in the midst of the stones and fire. Verse 15, you are perfect in thy ways from the day that thou was created till iniquity was found in thee. No human being um h e can have this as the description because all of us were shaped in iniquity. All of us including the actual king of ty must have been born of a sinful nature. But this particular being was perfect since its creation up until iniquity was found in it. This is a very special uh h being none other than the devil. And this is the origin of the devil that that is being described here. And then later in the book of Isaiah chapter 14 from verse 12 until 14 we are given a name of this being. Isaiah 14 12-4 it says how art thou fallen from heaven oh Lucifer. Oh Lucifer. Now uh this may shock some people but the word there you can actually go to Strong's concordance you find Lucifer is actually you know it's Latin. You know what's Latin doing in Hebrew text? The word is hell which means shining one which was translated by somebody who was writing the Latin vargate as Lucifer and then it stuck. Um and and so this this being was h Lucifer the lightbearer. How art thou fallen from heaven oh shining one? Oh Lucifer son of the morning how art thou cut down to the ground you who weaken the nations. Again in Isaiah chapter 14 it appears like it's a description of the king of Babylon. It looks like it, you know, from um verse one, it's saying about king of Babylon. But you look from 12:14, you actually see the power that is guiding the king of Babylon that's being described here. You have you have said in your heart, I will ascend into heaven. I will exalt my throne above the stars of God. I will sit also upon the mount of the congregation in the sides of the north. No actual king, even Nebuchadnezzar, these were never his ambitions. Clearly this is a separate very strange being that's being described. This being that we call Lucifer today. I will ascend above the heights of the clouds. I will be like the most high. So unfortunately you um to the the question he asked how did this being come to be? We are told in Ezekiel 28 God created the being as perfect as absolutely beautiful. In fact the description is almost like a living jewel. You know, imagine if the light with the glory of God just touches that being. It would just shine forth in the most magnificent display of color, the most wonderful. And unfortunately, this being um looked to itself and saw in itself God, not uh the blessing of God, but God, and now sought to usurp the position of God. Unfortunately, this being that sealed up the psalm, we are told, full of wisdom and perfect in beauty, unfortunately sought to be like God and eventually we are told was cast out of heaven. Amen. Very interesting. Brother Raphael, let me just ask you, how did a holy being was God's intention to create sin? Was it God's intention to create sin? How does this holy being living in a holy place end up committing sin? as the mystery of iniquity. We cannot really tell. Um in fact, Sister White writes and says to have an explanation for sin is to excuse it. Sin is an intruder. Uh and we can't truly um um really explain how it came to be. But we know uh that that that it it came to be. We can't really excuse it. But in essence it's significant in that it started in he one who was not just any cherub but a covering cherub a an angel so exalted an angel so respected in the government of heaven that I think there was no other angel above him after him. it was only the trinity, the father, the son, and the holy spirit. Yet he in his heart, I don't know how, but um but I believe as human beings now in our fallen nature, we sort of can understand jealousy and pride, you know, and and and and a desire, a covetousness of powers and authority which are not ours. You know sometimes u uh you see your friend prospering and you feel you ask yourself uh one preacher says um covetousness isn't wanting uh wanting a car like your brothers. It's wanting your brother's car. My brother's car. Yeah. Like it's good. You can you can see somebody and say that's a nice car. I would want to get one like that. Both of us can win. But for Lucifer he wanted everything for himself. He some some would say as Daniel was reminding me he had an eye problem you know I will do this I want this I will in fact he he say he was he was so ambitious that he says his government will be above the stars of God if gods is here mine will be above you know and so uh it's a mystery how it happened but we know pride was a key ingredient. Amen. Amen. I I just want to come to you uh brother Jaffet briefly and ask this question. What was God's reaction to Lucifer's uh fall? What was God's reaction when iniquity was found in his heart? Uh interestingly, he did not immediately obliterate the devil. He could have done that like in a moment, but he allowed the principles that he was espousing to reach their fruition because at that time um in fact we talked about here his actual ambition is what is described that he wanted the throne of God. But what did he speak with his mouth? It's what he told Adam and Eve. He told them what we can all be like God. All of us can share in divinity. But that's truly that wasn't what was he like in his heart is what it it says here that he actually wanted the highest position. It was to be um supreme. But God had to allow that to be manifested such that it is clear the supreme wickedness of sin. He was cast out of heaven eventually after it was he was given time to you could say canvas and evangelize his ideas in the the book of revelation chapter 12 we are told that he cast out um he went using his tail he took what oneird of the stars of heaven he was able to deceive onethird of the angels of heaven and was cast to the ground along with himself but um uh uh uh uh in essence um the reason is that God wanted the fruit to be revealed. Amen. Amen. Brother Ktor, you know the Bible here in Ezekiel 28 says, "Take up a lamentation upon the king of Tus." It's a lamentation. God is not rejoicing. God is not happy about this. So what is God's intention with Lucifer contrasting with God's intention with man? Now it's a very interesting choice word there. Lamentation. Actually the first tear ever shed at least in a in the record of inspiration by God was on the behalf of Lucifer. How sad. Yeah. So actually when you read the spirit of prophecy it says that for a time Satan was in meditation as he viewed his work. You know he he looked at the present. He looked at the past. He looked at the future of his plans and his mighty frame shook as with a tempest. But an angel from heaven was passing and then called him and then in treated an interview with Christ. So Lucifer was watching for the angels and then saw one and then asked could I could I meet with my master? Then this was granted him. He then related to the son of God that he repented of his rebellion and wished again the favor of God. He was willing to take the place that God previously had assigned him and be under his wise command. So he changed his mind at some point. Yes. So he changed his mind but he did not change his mind the way a repentant being should change their mind. So the interview was granted him. But listen to these sad words. Christ wept as at Satan's woe but told him as the mind of God that he could never be received into heaven. Heaven must not be placed in job. So divinity wept because of sin in Lucifer's heart. He was allowed to continue to be in existence. So that as has been alluded principles of his government would be clear. So that angels angels would see that indeed he was a murderer from the beginning. He actually sought the life of the son of God Jesus. And this actually was demonstrated when our maker that is Jesus himself responded to these urgent need of the fall of man after 4,000 years decided to take up a cross went to Calvary was nailed there. At that particular point, angels in heaven understood that indeed this was a murderer from the beginning. But for the sake of man, for you and me, because of you and me, we still hold this being in our affections. We choose his ways, we choose his interests, what he likes, we like. So there is still something that per perhaps attracts him to us and for our sake his existence is prolonged that you and I finally may make a choice between God's government and his governing government. And guess what? angels who now uh so that are willing to assist you and me in our daily battle against sin so that the enemy is rooted from our affections forever. Amen. Amen. And what a perfect way to conclude this that the angels are working for you and I so that the enemy is uprooted forever. You know, angelic perfection truly failed in heaven. We saw in the Garden of Eden, human perfection failed. But divinity, divinity combined with humanity will succeed until on Mount Zion, we see human beings perfected in Christ standing there having been redeemed. I pray that you and I will be there. Brother Raphael, kindly pray with us as we close. Let's believe and pray. Our kind and loving father and master art in heaven. You who whose throne is high and lifted up. I pray dear Jesus like Ezekiel and like Isaiah together with the hymn writer and like Moses also Lord give us a glimpse of you in glory and with it dear Lord as him writer says with all the toils of life repay teach us and help us to understand this reality that heaven dear Lord is cheap enough to this end I Pray dear Jesus that we may touch our tongues with coals of fire as you did for Isaiah because we are men and women of unclean lips who live in a society of men and women of unclean lips and when the time comes dear Lord in which the question is asked who shall go for us. It is my prayer and it is my desire dear Jesus if you have need for us that each and every single one of us will say here we are Lord send us. make this our experience for this our prayer through the mighty name of Christ Jesus our Lord our savior. Amen. Amen.

TIMESTAMPED TRANSCRIPT:
[7.9s] Praise God and happy Sabbath. Thank you
[11.0s] so much for joining us today at New Life
[13.4s] 7th Day Adventist Church, Fifth Gong
[15.5s] Avenue, Nairobi for our Sabbath school
[18.2s] lesson discussion. I'm excited, as I
[20.8s] said, about this quarter. We are
[22.7s] studying um illusions, symbols, and
[25.6s] images. and to help us understand how to
[28.4s] study Bible prophecy. Last week we
[31.4s] studied nations part two after having
[35.0s] gone through nations part one seeing how
[37.8s] the nations of this world the leadership
[40.2s] of this world degrades over time. But as
[43.0s] we went into the throne room of heaven,
[45.1s] we saw that the temple of God grows in
[47.8s] glory more and more. And we are waiting
[50.1s] for that temple that will be revealed.
[52.1s] that temple which eye has not seen, ear
[54.9s] has not heard, those things which the
[56.8s] Lord has prepared for his children. It
[59.3s] is our prayer that you will be there.
[61.4s] But as we continue to see how God is
[64.0s] preparing his children in these last
[65.9s] days, we want to go even in further to
[68.7s] understand who who is God sending to
[71.8s] prepare us um for that second coming who
[75.1s] are ministering to us today as we look
[77.4s] at foundations for prophecy. I am joined
[81.1s] by my friends uh this morning. I would
[83.9s] like them to introduce my uh themselves
[86.2s] starting from my furthest left um to see
[89.5s] who is joining us today. H my name is
[92.6s] Enango Rafany. It's a pleasure to be
[95.0s] with you today. Amen. And my name is
[97.8s] Daniel Kur. I'm equally glad to be with
[100.4s] you. Amen. And we are joined as well by
[102.9s] my husband. Kindly introduce yourself.
[104.9s] Hi, my name is Jafet Rena. Happy to be
[107.0s] here. Amen. Thank you so much. Today our
[110.3s] key text comes from the book of Isaiah
[113.1s] chapter 6:8. Brother Kitur, would you
[115.7s] kindly read for us?
[118.8s] So we're going to the book of
[121.0s] Isaiah and we're going to chapter
[124.4s] 6 and
[126.7s] verse 8. The Bible says in Isaiah
[130.5s] chapter 6 verse 8,
[133.4s] also I heard the voice of the Lord
[136.4s] saying, whom shall I send? M and who
[139.7s] will go for us? Then said I here am I
[144.7s] send me. You know it's a very important
[148.6s] question that uh the Lord asks. It's the
[151.4s] host of heaven. They are asking who will
[154.1s] go on our behalf? Who in the world is
[158.2s] worthy to go on our behalf to share this
[161.6s] gospel message? Who would go? And this
[164.4s] is a vision of Isaiah in the throne room
[167.3s] of heaven. And he responds after seeing
[170.0s] the holiness of God and tells God Lord
[173.2s] here I am send me. The question that I
[176.3s] would ask is why does God have the
[179.4s] authority to ask who would go for us?
[182.1s] Why would God have the authority to even
[185.2s] send any of us to go? It is because he
[188.6s] has earned his right both as our creator
[192.4s] and secondly as our redeemer. that in
[195.6s] the same manner in which we have been
[197.7s] redeemed, God empowers us to go forth
[201.1s] and do the same work of empowering
[204.0s] others. I want us to go into further
[206.2s] details of this vision that um we are
[208.7s] told of um of that Isaiah had before he
[212.3s] responded. Here I am send me. Please
[215.8s] just give us the context even before we
[217.7s] come to the book of Isaiah chapter 6.
[219.9s] What is Isaiah talking about in Isaiah
[222.2s] chapter 1 to chapter 5? My brother
[224.2s] Raphael indeed in the book of Isaiah
[227.0s] chapter uh chapter 1 to5 uh we see uh
[232.1s] Isaiah is um in essence um a prophet who
[236.1s] is being called and uh I believe uh as
[239.7s] as he's being called uh I believe you
[242.3s] you referred to chapter 6 verse 1-5.
[245.5s] Yes. So um we see a prophet who's been
[249.2s] called and he begins and says in verse
[251.5s] one that in the year that King Uzziah
[253.6s] died, I saw also the Lord sitting upon a
[257.8s] throne high and lifted up and his train
[261.1s] filled the temple. He is given uh in in
[264.5s] heavenly vision a vision of the
[267.5s] government of God, a literal a physical
[270.6s] uh vision of of of how things are there.
[273.4s] And the Bible records uh he says uh in
[276.5s] verse two he says above uh this throne
[279.4s] of God stood the saraphins. Each one had
[282.1s] six wings with twain he covered his face
[284.6s] and with twain he covered his feet and
[286.4s] with twain did he fly. And if in verse
[288.6s] three says and one cried unto the other
[291.2s] and said holy, holy, holy is the Lord of
[294.2s] hosts and the whole earth is full of his
[296.8s] glory. Then continues and speaks to us
[299.0s] about the posts of the door moved at the
[301.3s] voice of him that cried and the house
[303.4s] was filled with smoke. Verse five
[306.1s] says eventually when Isaiah is taking in
[310.2s] this scene now he gets to a point and he
[312.9s] says woe is me for I am undone because I
[316.8s] am a man of unclean lips and I dwell in
[319.6s] the midst of a people of unclean lips
[321.9s] for mine eyes have seen the king the
[324.6s] Lord of hosts. Amen. In essence, uh it's
[327.8s] speaking to us about uh Isaiah getting
[332.1s] into the presence of God. And I can
[336.0s] imagine in my mind at this particular
[338.3s] point in time, Isaiah was considered to
[340.2s] be a very holy man in Israel. In fact,
[342.5s] he was he was uh the kings and the and
[345.4s] and and the establishment of the day
[347.1s] looked at him as a as um as as a as a
[350.7s] too too good. Somebody would say a goody
[353.3s] two shoes, you know. Uh but lo and
[356.2s] behold the prophet in the presence of
[358.1s] God realizes his unworthiness. You know
[361.3s] sometimes we can feel like we are holy.
[363.4s] We can feel like uh we are modernday
[366.2s] prophets. We are modernday
[368.8s] uh men and women of God. Yet in reality
[374.0s] when things uh when things uh when we
[376.6s] are faced face first face first face
[377.1s] first face first face first face first
[377.1s] face first face first face first face
[377.1s] first face first face first face first
[377.2s] face first face first face first face
[377.2s] first face first face first face first
[377.4s] to face with God we will realize that
[379.4s] indeed all of us have fallen and sinned
[382.8s] and have fallen short of the glory of
[384.6s] God and so we require uh God's
[388.6s] intervention we require God to touch us
[390.6s] in one way or another as we will see uh
[393.6s] Isaiah was touched. Amen. Amen. And you
[396.3s] know you've just talked about the
[397.8s] holiness of God and what it means to be
[400.7s] in his presence. you've reminded me that
[402.5s] we did not actually pray even as we
[405.0s] entered into this study. So because we
[407.8s] had prayed just before we had um started
[410.6s] I would ask um my my husband to kindly
[413.5s] pray with us and then we can continue
[415.1s] with this discussion. Thank you so much.
[417.2s] Let us pray. Heavenly father we thank
[419.2s] you for the opportunity that you gave us
[421.4s] for uh this ministry. We ask that you
[424.2s] continue to abide with us as you uh
[426.3s] began with us. We ask us we ask that you
[428.2s] continue with us that we complete this
[430.4s] uh study uh for the glory of your name
[432.6s] in Jesus name I pray. Amen. Amen. Amen.
[435.4s] Um you know this is Isaiah who from
[439.0s] chapter 1 to chapter 5 is essentially
[442.8s] cursing everyone else and seeing how
[445.8s] fallen everyone else around him is. He's
[449.7s] just saying woe unto you. War unto you
[451.8s] for this. war to you from the head of
[453.8s] from the head of from the head to the to
[456.4s] the feet of you are sick with sin
[459.4s] putting evil for good for evil. Exactly.
[462.8s] Constantly from chapter one to chapter
[464.8s] 5. He's just speaking of wars. War unto
[467.7s] you. War unto that city. War unto those
[469.8s] people who do this. War unto
[472.6s] until he sees the he he's brought in
[476.6s] into the presence of God. And for the
[479.5s] first time, Isaiah does not say war unto
[483.4s] you. It is no longer outward. He sees
[487.1s] himself indeed. And what it means when
[490.0s] we come into the presence of God humbly
[492.6s] and God reveals to us who we truly are.
[496.3s] And Isaiah cries out, "Woe is me."
[500.2s] Brother Kitur, just give us a a few
[502.8s] details of the setup of that throne room
[505.5s] of God and what even caused Isaiah to
[508.9s] make this cry after crying out and
[511.3s] casting other people to make this cry
[513.7s] and say, "Woe is me." Yeah. I mean, it's
[518.4s] a very
[520.5s] um
[522.1s] majestic throne room. Um it's a throne
[526.6s] room full of activity.
[529.5s] um they are living beings whose um uh
[535.0s] posture to their creator is one of awe
[539.3s] and wonder and worship. So he sort of
[543.4s] catches a glimpse of what is happening
[546.1s] there and perhaps he's trying to relate
[548.9s] with his own posture of heart and mind
[552.7s] towards God. So he catches a glimpse of
[557.3s] how these heavenly beings pay homage to
[560.9s] this creator of the universe. There are
[563.8s] angels there,
[565.7s] saraphim, cherubs and they are all
[569.6s] falling down to worship these creator
[574.4s] and he realizes even in his own worship
[578.2s] he falls short. Amen. So he his his
[582.9s] response is one of humility.
[587.8s] He sees himself as unworthy
[592.2s] and he prostrates himself to worship
[595.9s] God. So it's a it's it's he sees the
[600.2s] beings but even above the beings he
[605.5s] probably catches a glimpse of the
[609.1s] creator you know one who is above
[612.9s] everyone else and uh you see they say
[616.3s] there is nothing that is so illuminating
[619.1s] as light. So if it is if if you think
[623.4s] what you have is light, then wait until
[626.2s] Jesus lights you with his own light and
[629.4s] then you begin to appreciate indeed my
[632.4s] light actually may be darkness. Because
[634.9s] when you when you appreciate the
[637.9s] character of God, more and more you feel
[642.6s] how unworthy and how unlike
[647.5s] him you are. And then more you real the
[651.4s] more you realize your need of him to
[655.2s] transform you that you may also reflect
[659.0s] uh his glory. Amen. Amen. You know some
[662.3s] of us are so lifted up in our hearts and
[665.4s] it could be it's because we have not
[667.4s] caught a glimpse of our Lord. We have
[670.4s] not seen him. This was not just only
[672.7s] Isaiah who reacted like this. We we we
[675.8s] are told of Daniel in the presence of
[678.1s] Christ. He just lost all his um energy.
[682.1s] If you if we if you know so to speak and
[684.6s] say that his legs could no longer hold
[687.4s] him and he fell down prostrate to
[689.9s] worship. We speak of John who in the
[692.6s] presence of his savior he just fell down
[696.1s] prostrate to worship him. The character
[698.9s] when you we eventually behold our God.
[701.9s] Um Jaffith maybe just speak to us about
[706.2s] the beings that are now introduced here.
[709.8s] Um brother Kitur has just spoke about
[712.0s] them but who are these beings in the
[714.2s] throne room of heaven and what does what
[716.7s] do they what does what do their names
[718.5s] mean? If you could um speak to that. Uh
[720.9s] thank you. So the beings that are
[722.6s] introduced are saraphim. Saraphim
[725.5s] actually means the burning ones, you
[727.5s] know, um the ones who are like um like
[730.8s] shining forth, you know, and these are
[733.2s] the beings who um you could say it is
[735.8s] not that they are the source of light,
[737.5s] but they are almost in a sense the
[739.4s] reflectors
[741.0s] um of that light that comes from the
[742.7s] glory of God. And it's it's it's in a
[745.4s] sense that you know the way that Christ
[747.6s] wants us to be the light of the world.
[749.2s] It is not really that we would be a
[751.2s] source of light. It is that we would be
[753.6s] bearing that light that comes from God
[755.4s] to those who others in this case Isaiah
[758.1s] was an audience of um of said light. So
[761.3s] uh we have an example of John in the
[763.4s] book of uh John the Baptist in the book
[765.0s] of John 5:35 who was called what a
[768.1s] burning and shining and a shining light.
[770.9s] I think that is the idea and the idea
[772.8s] that God wants us to inhabit even in
[775.0s] this world among uh in every space that
[777.5s] we occupy at our places of work or
[779.4s] school that God wants us to be a light
[781.6s] and Christ repeats in Matthew chapter 5
[784.6s] that a city that is set on a hill sorry
[787.9s] will not be hidden there's a reason why
[790.9s] a um a light is there it is meant to
[793.2s] give light to those um um in his
[795.5s] vicinity and and God has a desire for us
[797.8s] to reflect this light that comes from
[800.2s] God not from within. We will actually
[802.0s] discuss a particular being who thought
[803.8s] the light came from within themselves
[805.6s] and how dangerous that path is. But for
[808.2s] now, for for now at least, it is
[809.8s] necessary for us to appreciate that God
[812.4s] has given us a particular office of
[814.6s] being in a sense lightbearers. Amen. A
[818.2s] burning and a shining light. As we
[820.3s] conclude um on this uh brother Rafael
[823.2s] just coming back to you maybe speak to
[825.0s] us about how was Isaiah prepared for
[827.6s] ministry and how can we pick lessons
[830.2s] from that to show us what how we need to
[832.9s] spend time with God in the study of his
[835.7s] word and how we can also be prepared for
[838.5s] ministry as some of us who minister
[842.1s] indeed uh the Bible continues in Isaiah
[844.6s] chapter 6:6 and it says the following
[847.3s] after Isaiah is overwhelmed med by the
[851.0s] burden, by the real realization that it
[854.0s] is not the sins of Israel uh that are
[856.6s] the problem, but rather it is personal
[859.4s] uh imperfections, personal sins that
[862.6s] indeed uh condemn us before God. It's
[865.2s] not what your neighbor is doing or not
[867.0s] doing. It's what you are doing or not
[869.4s] doing. And so he says, "Woe is me."
[872.8s] But then the Bible continues and says,
[874.7s] "Then flew one of the seraraphims unto
[877.1s] me, having a live call in his hand,
[881.1s] which he had taken with the tongues from
[884.2s] off the altar." And he said, "And he
[888.2s] laid it upon my mouth, and said, Lo,
[892.0s] this had touched thy lips, and thine
[894.2s] iniquity is taken away, and thy sin is
[898.6s] purged." And I heard a voice of the Lord
[902.1s] saying, "Whom shall I send and who will
[904.9s] go for us?" Then said I, "Here am I.
[908.6s] Send me." We see a man who has come in
[913.0s] contact with the light because God is
[915.1s] the light. And in the light of this
[917.6s] light, he realizes his unworthiness, his
[920.8s] utter foolish unworthiness. He who
[923.4s] hitherto had thought himself to be a
[926.7s] special minister for God. He realizes
[929.2s] he's nobody. He's nothing before God.
[932.0s] That's interesting. So he didn't
[933.4s] necessarily go because he was the
[935.5s] worthiest. He was nothing before God.
[938.4s] Continue. Then he then now suddenly he
[941.8s] he sort of in a crisis. But we see in
[945.7s] every crisis, in every situation where
[947.8s] we we don't find answers, God always has
[951.0s] an answer. God had prepared. And the
[953.3s] Bible records an angel takes one of the
[956.4s] calls, a live call. That's an
[958.9s] interesting way of of of looking at it.
[961.4s] A live call, you know, uh in his hand
[964.8s] and and uh he says he takes it, he picks
[967.1s] it the tongue and he laid lays it where?
[969.8s] In his mouth. They were not dying
[971.4s] embers. They not dying embers. This this
[973.6s] thing was alive and and and and active
[976.8s] and powerful. And it's interesting. He
[979.4s] puts it where? In his mouth. In essence,
[982.5s] it is answering the specific thing that
[984.7s] he the specific thing that Isaiah had
[987.4s] said. He is a man of what? Unclean lips.
[990.6s] And he dwells with people what? Of
[992.6s] unclean lips. You see, the gospel is is
[996.3s] is is perfectly tailored for the issues
[999.4s] of man. the gospel uh and the solutions
[1002.6s] that we get from God are are so powerful
[1006.3s] and so different from the solutions of
[1007.8s] of of human beings because the solutions
[1010.1s] of God are tailored to our individual
[1012.8s] situations and and circumstances. And so
[1016.0s] the angel comes to this man of of
[1018.2s] unclean lips and puts a live call and he
[1021.7s] puts it in his mouth and he takes away
[1023.9s] his iniquity. He takes away his
[1025.8s] iniquity. And we we are conversant that
[1029.3s] he's in the temple. You know, he's in
[1031.6s] the temple. The Bible records to us in
[1033.5s] verse one that smoke and the train what?
[1036.3s] And his train filled the filled the
[1038.2s] temple. And so we ask ourselves where in
[1040.2s] the temple do we find live calls. We for
[1044.1s] a fact are where we are in the holy
[1046.7s] place. And uh in the holy place there
[1049.3s] was the altar of incense where they
[1051.4s] would burn incense which is symbolic of
[1054.6s] the prayers of the saints as and the
[1057.0s] incense is um the merits of the blood of
[1060.0s] Christ which make our prayers u uh
[1063.4s] incense. What the the fact the the
[1065.4s] effect of incense is that it it um it it
[1068.6s] brings some aroma. It it it brings some
[1071.2s] nice taste to to nice smell to a room.
[1075.2s] Um some people would call it aura. And
[1078.0s] so and so um from among these calls, the
[1082.8s] angel picks uh a call and sanctifies uh
[1087.7s] the the the prophet's mouth. And now the
[1091.1s] prophet is ready and willing. Now the
[1093.7s] prophet is cleansed. And when the
[1095.3s] question is asked, whom shall I send and
[1099.0s] who will go for us? The angels do not
[1102.2s] answer.
[1104.0s] But Isaiah answers and says, "Here am I.
[1107.6s] Send me." Amen. Amen. I pray that your
[1111.0s] lips as well will be touched by the
[1113.3s] calls from heaven. Fresh calls from
[1115.8s] heaven. And you will be as those burning
[1118.7s] seraps burning with the zeal for Jesus.
[1121.8s] Burning as with the zeal for Jesus. Um
[1125.0s] my uh Jaffith maybe just take us through
[1127.8s] these seraps that we have been
[1129.3s] introduced to. Do we see saraphs
[1131.8s] ministering here on earth beyond heaven?
[1134.7s] Do we see them ministering here on earth
[1137.3s] as we move on to the Monday part? Thank
[1139.2s] you. So in the book of Genesis chapter
[1141.4s] 3, we actually find at the very
[1143.3s] beginning angels were already uh engaged
[1146.3s] in the work of ministering and in the
[1148.2s] work of interacting with humans, doing
[1149.6s] the Lord's work. uh in the book of
[1151.4s] Genesis 3:21, right after the fall,
[1155.2s] right after God has uh given his decree,
[1157.9s] he has brought judgment upon um or at
[1160.1s] least declared the judgment on the man,
[1162.4s] the woman, and the serpent. uh uh
[1164.9s] immediately in um verse 23 and 24, God
[1168.3s] actually sends angels to a to do a
[1171.0s] particular work uh that that at first
[1173.8s] appears negative but actually we'll see
[1176.3s] is is actually symbolic of hope that
[1178.9s] that God hoped and expected would be
[1181.0s] placed in the hearts of God's people. We
[1183.0s] are told in verse 23 of Genesis chapter
[1185.1s] uh 3, therefore the Lord God sent him
[1187.8s] forth from the garden. This is Adam and
[1189.4s] Eve of Eden and to till the ground from
[1192.6s] whence he was taken. And so he drove him
[1195.2s] out and so he drove out man and he
[1197.5s] placed at the east of the garden of Eden
[1200.3s] cherubims and a flaming sword which
[1203.0s] turned every way to keep the way to the
[1205.5s] tree of life. And this was specifically
[1208.4s] because um h God did not want Adam and
[1211.6s] Eve to be to uh to to live the lives of
[1215.0s] immortal sinners. But then at the same
[1217.6s] time, why is it that God did not just
[1220.3s] destroy, you know, like God could easily
[1222.2s] have destroyed the tree of life and
[1223.4s] says, "I'll build another one later."
[1225.2s] The point is it was meant to remain
[1227.2s] there as a symbol of hope.
[1229.3s] What we find in Genesis 3:15 is the
[1231.4s] gospel that whatever is going on,
[1233.1s] whatever has begun, this great
[1234.9s] controversy that has begun that humanity
[1237.3s] is now involved in h the the eventually
[1241.0s] eh the good will have victory over the
[1243.5s] evil. Eventually the devil and and and
[1245.7s] everyone who is the devil, sin and
[1248.2s] everything that is evil will ultimately
[1250.1s] be destroyed. And and the fact that the
[1252.8s] angel simply kept the way and guarded
[1255.1s] the tree tree of life indicated that
[1257.7s] there was a time and in fact now it is
[1259.6s] fulfilled elsewhere in scripture that
[1261.4s] all this evil will be undone. Amen.
[1263.5s] Amen. So the angels were not just there
[1265.8s] to protect it but to give human beings
[1269.0s] hope. Brother Kur, is this the first
[1271.1s] time we're interacting with angels
[1273.0s] beyond the heavenly visions? Where else
[1276.2s] do we see representations or angels
[1278.3s] working? How do we see angels working
[1280.5s] now? Um, angels have always uh been sent
[1285.7s] to minister to the needs of humanity.
[1290.0s] Um, as has been rightly stated there, we
[1292.7s] we see angels in u Genesis chapter 3.
[1296.4s] Beyond that, uh, in the records of of of
[1300.1s] scripture, we see people like uh Joshua,
[1304.1s] you know, interacting with even the
[1306.1s] angel of the Lord. He's another special
[1308.2s] angel here. But in the lives of men uh
[1313.0s] the ministry of angels
[1315.5s] is very very active. Actually God's
[1319.2s] throne room is pictured uh as having
[1323.4s] lightnings and thunders and this perhaps
[1327.2s] may be an indication of the speed with
[1329.8s] which these angels urgently minister to
[1333.8s] the needs of humanity. Um, think of
[1339.0s] Daniel, think of Haniah, think of Misha,
[1342.4s] think of Aariah, think of missionaries
[1345.7s] ministering in dangerous places,
[1348.8s] protected, delivered, suckered,
[1351.7s] whichever uh sort of interposition.
[1355.4s] Actually, there's an interesting book by
[1358.3s] um uh one Spicer called The Hand That
[1363.6s] Intervenes. And this is a depiction of
[1366.8s] God's miraculous deliverance of his
[1370.4s] children by the ministry of angels.
[1373.5s] Actually uh personally I would want to
[1375.8s] meet my angel. Uh someone was joking and
[1379.0s] saying perhaps the first thing before he
[1381.0s] hugs me is to slap me because of the
[1384.1s] very many things that I have probably
[1387.4s] taken him uh through in the course of my
[1390.2s] journey here on the planet. But we
[1393.0s] cannot take for granted the ministry of
[1396.9s] angels to help men. Uh we see Daniel in
[1402.4s] the book uh of Daniel, he is struggling
[1405.0s] to understand a vision and God responds
[1409.1s] to his prayer of faith by sending the
[1412.5s] angel Gabriel
[1415.1s] to give him skill and understanding
[1418.2s] regarding that vision. So men conversed
[1422.5s] with angels concerning their problems
[1425.4s] and God gave them solutions. Now a very
[1428.8s] interesting one is quite similar to what
[1432.1s] we are discussing regarding Isaiah. It's
[1435.1s] uh the vision that we find in the book
[1437.8s] of revelation.
[1439.7s] uh John sees a vision in the book of
[1442.6s] revelation and there are some
[1445.0s] similarities that we can we can capture
[1448.0s] there. But the thing is that we see the
[1452.3s] throne of God and this picture of the
[1455.5s] throne of God is just sort of cementing
[1458.2s] the idea that uh God is the majesty of
[1462.1s] the universe. We also see angelic beings
[1466.3s] in worship, the cherubs and the saraphim
[1470.2s] uh in worship. And then we see the
[1473.6s] cosmic response. We see Isaiah declaring
[1477.8s] that he's a man of unclean lips. And we
[1480.2s] also see John in the book of Revelation
[1482.6s] chapter 4 falling down and he's seeing
[1487.4s] uh elders prostrating themselves
[1489.7s] worshiping him. So we we we we we are we
[1493.9s] are able to see that in God's throne
[1496.0s] room there are angels and they are not
[1500.0s] idol they are ready to minister to the
[1504.7s] needs of humanity. Amen. Ministering to
[1507.9s] the needs of humanity. No, you've just
[1510.4s] reminded me of the vision I of Ezekiel
[1514.0s] when he was with his servant Ghazi and
[1517.5s] Ghazi was so troubled when they saw a
[1519.5s] whole army against them and you know
[1521.8s] Ezekiel was quick to say you have not
[1523.8s] you if only your eyes were to be opened
[1525.8s] you'll see all these angels brother
[1527.9s] Raphael um in context of Hebrews chapter
[1531.4s] 1:14 how can we quickly just commenting
[1534.2s] on this how can we see the work of
[1536.7s] angels especially as it relates to our
[1539.8s] salvation.
[1541.4s] All right. We've seen them in
[1542.7s] deliverance. We've seen them worshiping
[1544.7s] God as brother Kitur has spoken of.
[1547.0s] We've seen them as he has mentioned of
[1548.8s] them coming to answer difficult prayers
[1551.4s] or coming to an give us difficult
[1553.7s] answers to visions we've received. How
[1555.8s] do we see them working in our salvation?
[1558.4s] Hebrews chapter 1 verse14 speaks to us
[1561.4s] about angels and he says are they not
[1564.2s] all ministering spirits sent forth to
[1566.3s] minister for them who shall be heirs of
[1569.3s] salvation. Amen. That in the gospel
[1573.0s] story in the story of the salvation of
[1575.8s] this planet that has been wrecked by sin
[1579.1s] and by troubles uh from the days uh that
[1584.3s] Adam ate that fruit. Angels have been
[1587.4s] active. Angels were there in the Garden
[1589.6s] of Eden, not only protecting men, but
[1592.2s] also encouraging them,
[1594.4s] admonishing. The very fact that the
[1596.3s] Garden of Eden persisted for for that
[1598.6s] long was also in essence a way of of of
[1601.8s] of inspiring men that one day you will
[1604.9s] enter. You know, if God took away the
[1607.2s] garden of Eden, immediately Adam and Eve
[1608.9s] sinned, it it it would have shown some
[1611.5s] an aspect of some permanence in in in
[1614.0s] the punishment. But the garden of Eden
[1615.8s] persisted there and a watchman was kept
[1618.6s] there simply but for a time but for a
[1621.5s] time. But then Paul writes again in
[1623.8s] Hebrews 13 and:2 and he says be not
[1626.5s] forgetful to entertain strangers for
[1628.6s] thereby some have entertained angels
[1630.9s] unawares. He tells us that sometimes
[1633.7s] angels walk in our midst. this he's
[1636.2s] talking to the he's borrowing from the
[1637.9s] example of Abraham when he saw some
[1640.2s] three strange men and he decided to to
[1642.6s] to to to slaughter some sheep to give
[1644.9s] them meat and he decided to bake some
[1647.0s] bread for them and eventually that day
[1649.4s] is when he got the promise of a son.
[1652.2s] That day was when Sarah laughed and
[1653.7s] Sarah was told at a time like this next
[1656.3s] year I will come and surely you will
[1658.6s] have a child. They were just men walking
[1661.3s] as they were going towards Sodom and
[1663.0s] Gomorrah. And Sodom and Gomorrah at the
[1665.3s] gates, Lot welcomed angels of God. And
[1668.6s] the children of uh of of Sodom and
[1671.3s] Gomorrah were blinded and they wanted to
[1674.2s] to to to partake of deviant sexual
[1677.9s] behaviors and to abuse these men uh
[1680.3s] sexually. Yet these were angels. And so
[1682.3s] it simply tells us that the ministry of
[1684.2s] angels is alive and the power of God in
[1687.0s] our lives through through cherubim and
[1689.8s] saraphim is is a reality. And many a
[1693.0s] times we are told when we got when we
[1696.4s] get to heaven we shall read in the
[1699.1s] records how angels saved us and we did
[1702.1s] not know. Amen. You may never know maybe
[1704.7s] somebody you sat to next you sat next to
[1707.1s] was actually an angel and maybe he told
[1709.3s] you something and you decided to go a
[1711.1s] different direction whereas if you had
[1712.6s] gone where you were going you would have
[1714.2s] met with disaster. The ministry of
[1716.6s] angels is a reality and it is
[1720.6s] indeed a privilege to be ministered to
[1724.2s] and they minister to those who are heirs
[1726.3s] of salvation. And who are the heirs of
[1728.0s] salvation? It is us. It is us. you and
[1730.2s] me,
[1731.2s] whosoever believes and receives Christ
[1733.5s] in his heart. You know, God told the
[1735.7s] children of Israel when you're making
[1737.2s] the sanctuary, they had to put all these
[1740.1s] um paintings of angels even in the
[1742.7s] temple, paintings of angels to remind
[1745.3s] them of those ministers who will
[1747.5s] continually help them through this
[1749.4s] journey. Brother, there's a very very
[1752.8s] interesting vision. I want you to just
[1755.4s] go into it and just break it down for us
[1758.1s] because I would want us to finish this
[1760.2s] lesson without going into it. Exactly.
[1762.3s] Now, this is connected to what you're
[1764.5s] talking about. And if you could just
[1765.9s] mention this concerning angels and
[1768.2s] salvation. There could be a one who is
[1770.9s] probably in darkness right now. You're
[1773.2s] feeling like there's an envelope.
[1776.2s] There's a cloud of darkness that is
[1778.6s] surrounding you. But I want you to be
[1781.7s] encouraged that God through his angels
[1785.0s] send light and encouragement. Actually
[1788.5s] um even before one receives
[1792.0s] salvation, it is angels who protect such
[1796.2s] souls until light comes to them. Then
[1799.7s] they are able to decide for Jesus or
[1802.6s] otherwise. Amen. Um actually when people
[1807.2s] are getting discouraged and they're
[1809.3s] getting into they're sinking into uh
[1813.0s] despair, God sends encouragement through
[1816.3s] angels. And actually when when a sinner
[1819.9s] when you and I are bended low before God
[1823.4s] and we are uh confessing sin, angels are
[1827.3s] usually around us to beat back the
[1830.6s] forces of darkness and evil and to
[1833.7s] confirm us even in Christ Jesus. So
[1837.6s] angels are very active in the salvation
[1840.9s] of human beings. Now in the book of
[1844.3s] Ezekiel there is a special vision and
[1847.9s] I'll just read uh this is what Ezekiel
[1850.5s] says in Ezekiel 1 verse 4. I'll read a
[1854.2s] couple of verses. Uh the Bible says
[1856.7s] Ezekiel chapter 1 verse4 and I looked
[1859.4s] and behold a whirlwind came out of the
[1862.1s] north a great cloud and a fire infolding
[1865.5s] itself and a brightness was about it and
[1868.1s] out of the midst thereof as the color of
[1872.1s] amber out of the midst of the fire also
[1876.2s] out of the midst thereof came like the
[1878.5s] likeness of four living creatures and
[1882.6s] this was their appearance. They had the
[1885.1s] likeness of a man, and everyone had four
[1888.6s] faces, and everyone had four wings, and
[1892.1s] their feet were straight feet, and the
[1894.8s] sole of their feet was like the soul of
[1897.1s] a cal's foot, and they sparkled like the
[1900.4s] color of banished brass, and they had
[1904.3s] the hands of a man under their wings on
[1907.4s] their four sides, and they four had
[1909.9s] their faces and their wings, and their
[1913.0s] wings were joined joined one to another.
[1915.3s] They turned not when they went, they
[1918.0s] went everyone straight
[1921.6s] forward. And as for the likeness of
[1924.3s] their faces, they for had the face of a
[1927.3s] man, the face of a lion, and on the
[1930.3s] right side they they for had the face of
[1933.4s] an ox, and on the left side they for
[1936.2s] also had the face of an eagle. Now h we
[1940.2s] won't get into the very details of the
[1942.9s] vision but I want you to understand that
[1947.2s] um John also as a prophet of God catches
[1952.2s] a similar uh vision in the book of
[1954.8s] revelation chapter chapter
[1957.4s] 4. Uh we won't read revelation 4:1 to
[1961.6s] 111 but there are some striking
[1963.5s] similarities.
[1965.4s] Ezekiel also in later chapters of the
[1968.6s] book of Ezekiel adds details regarding
[1972.0s] these
[1974.0s] uh special uh you know vision that he
[1977.4s] has of beings with faces of a man, a
[1982.2s] lion uh eagle and he actually tells us
[1987.8s] that these are actually cherubs.
[1990.8s] angels, a special kind of angels.
[1994.1s] Actually, the word cherub means one who
[1997.0s] is like the father. One who is like the
[2000.8s] father. So um this is what John catches
[2006.7s] uh also in the book of revelation
[2008.8s] chapter 4 a picture of these angels and
[2013.3s] by the way who are meant to as has been
[2016.8s] alluded reflect God's character that
[2021.6s] shining burning bright lights. Amen. A
[2027.0s] very beautiful vision and you know we
[2028.8s] see them moving in harmony. One does not
[2032.6s] turn without the other turning. They are
[2034.8s] moving in harmony. And it's interesting
[2037.4s] to to see that the very they they they
[2041.0s] they are sort of under the very
[2043.2s] foundation of God's throne. God is it's
[2046.0s] it's as though they are just where God
[2048.0s] is and they are being they are directing
[2050.2s] the movements of God's throne. Let me
[2053.2s] ask let me ask you uh brother Rafael um
[2056.4s] do we see this depiction of these four
[2060.3s] faces here on earth for God continually
[2063.2s] remind us that the same creatures that
[2067.0s] are directing his the movement of his
[2069.9s] very throne in heaven we see the
[2072.0s] depictions of them here on earth when
[2074.1s] and how do we how does God remind his
[2076.2s] children of that
[2078.3s] indeed um it's it's interesting um these
[2083.0s] creatures
[2085.2s] uh one is a lion, the other one is a
[2088.2s] man, the other one is an ox and the
[2090.3s] other one is an
[2091.5s] eagle. and uh the way they are depicted
[2095.8s] uh amongst
[2097.8s] uh amongst humanity. In the book of
[2101.0s] numbers chapter 2, we find uh the
[2103.8s] children of Israel as they were moving
[2106.8s] uh from Egypt to the promised land and
[2110.2s] Moses had organized some some sort of
[2112.6s] temple which was called a tabernacle
[2114.1s] which was mobile. And we knew we know
[2116.4s] that the children of Israel had 12
[2118.3s] tribes. And these 12 tribes were divided
[2120.9s] by four into into groups of threes. And
[2125.0s] they each uh moved uh almost um uh with
[2130.2s] the tabernacle at the center and then
[2132.3s] three tribes on each side. And so it was
[2134.6s] it was like a perfect square that kept
[2136.8s] moving. And amongst these amongst these
[2139.0s] tribes amongst these three tribes that
[2141.2s] are divided into four, there was one
[2143.2s] dominant tribe. And each tribe uh had an
[2147.0s] emblem. You know the way you can have a
[2149.2s] flag and uh your flag has got something
[2151.8s] to uh to the effect of um of uh of of
[2156.9s] Yes. Yes. Like it has some symbolism you
[2159.9s] know for example um um the national
[2163.8s] football team of Uganda is called what?
[2165.6s] The Uganda cranes. The crested cranes of
[2167.8s] the crested cranes of Uganda. you know
[2169.9s] and and and and on and on and on and on
[2170.9s] and on and on and on and on and on and
[2170.9s] on and on all these creatures we we take
[2172.6s] some aspects uh the national football
[2174.6s] team for for England is the three lions
[2176.8s] you know they they're taking upon
[2178.0s] themselves the majesty and the power of
[2180.0s] the lion and so this did not start uh
[2183.4s] recently but even back then as they
[2185.8s] moving from Egypt to the promised land
[2187.8s] the children of Israel had these uh
[2189.9s] these symbolic uh symbols representing
[2192.6s] different uh different um uh leading
[2195.9s] tribes amongst the divisions of the
[2197.8s] trees And in numbers, you can read the
[2200.4s] story from the book of Numbers chapter
[2202.0s] 2. And basically, Judah was was
[2206.1s] represented by a lion. Reuben was
[2208.8s] represented by a man. And Ephraim was
[2211.4s] represented by an ox. Dan similarly was
[2215.2s] represented by an eagle. And so we see
[2218.6s] in something significant that they are
[2221.1s] all surrounding what the tabernacle. It
[2223.4s] was almost as if God was giving them a
[2226.0s] design almost a replica of how it is in
[2228.9s] heaven. We've seen in Isaiah sees God on
[2233.0s] his throne and then around him they this
[2235.8s] cherubim saraphene Ezekiel opens it up
[2239.4s] to us now and even tells us depictions
[2241.4s] of of of this of these of these of these
[2244.6s] of these of these beings and how they
[2246.7s] have different faces. And the same uh
[2249.9s] are also once again traced um in
[2252.8s] revelation and and this imagery
[2255.5s] continues all the way up to the new
[2257.8s] Jerusalem. Amen. We see in the new
[2259.8s] Jerusalem it has what we call it a
[2262.2s] kingdom four square as the himw writer
[2264.1s] says and and and there's there's a
[2266.3s] there's a gate on each what on each side
[2269.0s] of the of this door and on each and and
[2271.4s] on each panel of the doors we are told
[2273.8s] there are the not what the names of what
[2276.0s] of the tribes the names of the various
[2277.9s] tribes and different people will enter
[2281.4s] not all of us will we may get to heaven
[2283.2s] but the roots we'll take may be
[2284.6s] different yours may be the eastern gate
[2286.6s] my sister mine the northern But we'll
[2288.9s] meet at the center at the feet of Jesus.
[2291.8s] Amen. And so and so it's al it's also
[2294.4s] speaking to us about our various
[2295.8s] experiences. You know
[2298.0s] um one one author puts it puts it thus
[2301.7s] that even the gospels themselves are
[2304.0s] depictions of these things. That's
[2305.0s] actually what I was writing down and and
[2306.8s] and and he says for example Matthew
[2309.3s] shows us Christ the man you know Jesus's
[2311.7s] humanity and his kingship. Mark tells us
[2314.7s] about Christ as the lion, Jesus as the
[2316.9s] powerful and bold servant. Others Luke
[2319.6s] tells us as Christ as the ox, Jesus as
[2321.9s] the sacrifice and service. And then John
[2324.7s] tells us about Christ as the eagle. He
[2326.8s] speaks about his divinity and his
[2328.6s] heavenly nature. You see, it is an
[2330.5s] archetype and and and and and and a
[2333.4s] formation that is replete in the gospel
[2336.1s] story and repeated and ultimately even
[2338.8s] in the new Jerusalem. Amen. Amen. So
[2341.0s] interesting that the very throne room of
[2343.0s] heaven, God tries to replicate it here
[2345.3s] on earth to just remind us of what
[2347.9s] awaits us. That the same heavenly angels
[2350.6s] that minister to him, we also have our
[2353.7s] own ministering spirit sent to us who
[2356.6s] are the heirs of salvation. I want us to
[2359.0s] talk about a very specific angel. But
[2361.6s] before we go there, brother Kitan to ask
[2364.0s] you one question. The the the vision in
[2367.0s] the book of Ezekiel tells us that there
[2369.0s] are wheels. M what what do those wheels
[2372.6s] represent? Oh, I mean it's it's a very
[2375.8s] complicated uh uh vision that uh the
[2379.6s] prophet Ezekiel uh sees and he sees a
[2383.2s] wheel within a wheel and they are
[2386.7s] turning and they are moving and it's
[2391.1s] it's a vision of of
[2393.5s] God's throne room and also a depiction
[2397.8s] of his ultimate authority. Amen. and
[2402.5s] sovereignity that you know to us to the
[2405.8s] prophet he saw something that was very
[2408.7s] confusing. Uh something that he could
[2411.5s] not understand and sometimes like as
[2415.0s] human beings when we watch the events
[2416.9s] that are happening on the planet they
[2419.0s] are very confusing to us. We don't know
[2420.8s] what to tell. We don't know which
[2423.0s] direction things are going. But the
[2426.1s] vision of this will within a will
[2429.0s] reminds us that ultimately it is God who
[2432.1s] is in charge. Actually far above the
[2435.1s] destructions that Ezekiel was seeing,
[2437.9s] God was sit sat was still sat on his
[2440.9s] throne as in charge and actually he is
[2444.5s] the one who
[2446.3s] orders from his come eternity the events
[2451.1s] according to his own wisdom, will and
[2455.5s] power and glory. Amen. So God is in
[2459.6s] charge and actually
[2461.8s] um uh it's it's a very uh it it should
[2465.8s] give you and I hope and encouragement in
[2469.4s] the fact that this world is not without
[2473.0s] a ruler. Amen. Amen. You know life can
[2475.8s] look confusing but God is in charge. God
[2479.8s] is in control. Um,
[2482.6s] Jaffth, a heavenly vision of the throne
[2486.2s] room of heaven, perfect, everything
[2489.4s] moving in harmony. Angels who even in
[2492.4s] the presence of God, they veil their
[2495.2s] faces, everything looks like it is in
[2497.7s] order. How do we end up with Lucifer?
[2500.8s] Who was Lucifer to begin with? Thank you
[2502.8s] so much. Um uh in review of the Thursday
[2505.6s] uh part of the lesson, um Lucifer is is
[2509.6s] is is a being that is described first of
[2512.4s] all by Jesus Christ most importantly and
[2515.6s] he identifies him as as as the big bad.
[2519.6s] today. Um I think an excess of modernism
[2523.8s] um secularism, materialism can make us
[2526.2s] think that uh the evil described or the
[2529.5s] devil described in the Bible is like an
[2531.8s] embodiment of evil, a general embodiment
[2534.1s] of things that are evil and not an
[2536.0s] actual personal being. But the
[2537.8s] scriptures tell us that that being is an
[2539.7s] actual personal literal being. When in
[2542.6s] the book of John 8:44 when Jesus says
[2545.7s] you're of the father the devil, your
[2547.9s] lust of the father your your your last
[2550.2s] you will do because he was a murderer
[2552.2s] from the beginning and abode not in the
[2554.4s] truth. And again in the book of first
[2556.4s] John 3:8 we see he that committeth sin
[2560.8s] is of the devil. Why? For the devil sins
[2564.0s] from the beginning. For this purpose was
[2566.8s] the son of man manifested. The very
[2570.0s] reason that Jesus Christ was manifested
[2572.4s] was not to fight against clouds but was
[2575.8s] to destroy the works of an actual
[2577.8s] personal being. It says that he might
[2579.9s] destroy the works of the devil. Now in
[2583.7s] the book of uh um Ezekiel, I think
[2586.0s] that's a very powerful point that beyond
[2587.8s] taking away the sins of men, you know,
[2589.8s] you think he just he was coming to
[2591.9s] destroy the power of the devil. There
[2594.7s] were those people say I may be demonp
[2596.8s] possessed. Christ came to destroy them.
[2598.8s] Amen. Amen. Or something has come into
[2601.2s] my house. Christ came also. That was his
[2605.0s] mission to destroy the works of the
[2606.9s] devil. Amen. So now in the book of
[2609.0s] Ezekiel, we actually find uh two things.
[2611.8s] One, the description of of overtly um
[2615.5s] the prince of Ty, the king of Ty, the
[2617.6s] head of Ty. Um and Ty was a kingdom um
[2621.2s] in ancient times. But in interpass in
[2624.8s] this description, it is clear that a
[2626.8s] second being is being discussed. From
[2629.0s] the description of this being, we are
[2631.0s] told concerning this particular being in
[2634.0s] verse 12. Son of man, take up a
[2636.6s] lamentation upon the king of Tyrus and
[2638.8s] say, Thus said the Lord, thou sealest up
[2641.6s] the psalm, full of wisdom and perfect in
[2644.6s] beauty. Verse 13, thou hast been in
[2647.8s] Eden, the garden of God. Who could have
[2650.6s] been in Eden, the garden of God?
[2651.8s] Definitely not the king of T. Clearly
[2653.7s] not the king of T. And every precious
[2656.5s] stone was thy covering. And then it
[2658.6s] lists like nine bits of covering and the
[2661.5s] workmanship of the of nine bits of uh
[2664.7s] stones and all set in gold.
[2667.3s] Interestingly, the high priest had 12
[2669.8s] bits of stone um set in gold. So this
[2673.4s] being was and and and the high priest
[2675.9s] clearly represents who? Jesus Christ. So
[2678.3s] this being it's like like almost
[2682.5s] approaching or approximating um that
[2685.2s] level of divinity. And you would think
[2686.7s] that you know this sort of thing will
[2688.5s] get to its head and that's unfortunately
[2690.4s] what happened. Thou at the anointed
[2693.5s] cherob that coverth verse 14 it's
[2695.3s] actually the clincher and I have set
[2698.6s] thee so thou upon the holy mountain of
[2701.8s] God. Thou hast walked up and down in the
[2704.0s] midst of the stones of earth. So, not
[2705.4s] only did this being have access to Eden,
[2708.6s] this being was actually in heaven.
[2711.1s] Unlike all over in the book of Ezekiel
[2713.5s] 27, there's a description about Egypt,
[2716.2s] about so many other kingdoms. There is
[2718.3s] no such thing of a supernatural nature
[2720.6s] except here. Here we actually find a
[2723.0s] description of a being having walked up
[2725.7s] and down in the midst of the stones and
[2727.1s] fire. Verse 15, you are perfect in thy
[2729.5s] ways from the day that thou was created
[2731.9s] till iniquity was found in thee. No
[2733.8s] human being um h e can have this as the
[2736.8s] description because all of us were
[2739.2s] shaped in iniquity. All of us including
[2741.4s] the actual king of ty must have been
[2743.7s] born of a sinful nature. But this
[2746.1s] particular being was perfect since its
[2749.1s] creation up until iniquity was found in
[2751.8s] it. This is a very special uh h being
[2754.6s] none other than the devil. And this is
[2757.3s] the origin of the devil that that is
[2759.4s] being described here. And then later in
[2761.4s] the book of Isaiah chapter 14 from verse
[2764.6s] 12 until 14 we are given a name of this
[2768.2s] being. Isaiah 14 12-4 it says how art
[2773.0s] thou fallen from heaven oh Lucifer. Oh
[2776.0s] Lucifer. Now uh this may shock some
[2778.8s] people but the word there you can
[2780.5s] actually go to Strong's concordance you
[2782.8s] find Lucifer is actually you know it's
[2784.8s] Latin. You know what's Latin doing in
[2787.0s] Hebrew text? The word is hell which
[2789.3s] means shining one which was translated
[2791.9s] by somebody who was writing the Latin
[2793.8s] vargate as Lucifer and then it stuck. Um
[2797.5s] and and so this this being was h Lucifer
[2801.3s] the lightbearer. How art thou fallen
[2804.2s] from heaven oh shining one? Oh Lucifer
[2806.7s] son of the morning how art thou cut down
[2808.8s] to the ground you who weaken the
[2810.2s] nations. Again in Isaiah chapter 14 it
[2812.9s] appears like it's a description of the
[2814.4s] king of Babylon. It looks like it, you
[2816.6s] know, from um verse one, it's saying
[2819.2s] about king of Babylon. But you look from
[2821.6s] 12:14, you actually see the power that
[2824.1s] is guiding the king of Babylon that's
[2826.4s] being described here. You have you have
[2829.7s] said in your heart, I will ascend into
[2831.8s] heaven. I will exalt my throne above the
[2834.2s] stars of God. I will sit also upon the
[2836.5s] mount of the congregation in the sides
[2838.3s] of the north. No actual king, even
[2840.9s] Nebuchadnezzar, these were never his
[2842.6s] ambitions. Clearly this is a separate
[2845.4s] very strange being that's being
[2846.8s] described. This being that we call
[2848.7s] Lucifer today. I will ascend above the
[2851.6s] heights of the clouds. I will be like
[2854.2s] the most high. So unfortunately you um
[2856.4s] to the the question he asked how did
[2858.3s] this being come to be? We are told in
[2860.0s] Ezekiel 28 God created the being as
[2862.6s] perfect as absolutely beautiful. In fact
[2865.4s] the description is almost like a living
[2867.6s] jewel. You know, imagine if the light
[2869.7s] with the glory of God just touches that
[2871.4s] being. It would just shine forth in the
[2873.1s] most magnificent display of color, the
[2875.4s] most wonderful. And unfortunately, this
[2877.3s] being um looked to itself and saw in
[2880.5s] itself God, not uh the blessing of God,
[2885.1s] but God, and now sought to usurp the
[2888.1s] position of God. Unfortunately, this
[2890.3s] being that sealed up the psalm, we are
[2892.4s] told, full of wisdom and perfect in
[2894.2s] beauty, unfortunately sought to be like
[2896.8s] God and eventually we are told was cast
[2899.9s] out of heaven. Amen. Very interesting.
[2903.4s] Brother Raphael, let me just ask you,
[2905.9s] how did a holy being was God's intention
[2909.3s] to create sin? Was it God's intention to
[2911.5s] create sin? How does this holy being
[2914.2s] living in a holy place end up committing
[2916.7s] sin?
[2920.6s] as the mystery of iniquity. We cannot
[2923.3s] really tell. Um in fact, Sister White
[2926.1s] writes and says to have an explanation
[2928.4s] for sin is to excuse it. Sin is an
[2931.0s] intruder. Uh and we can't truly um um
[2935.6s] really explain how it came to be. But we
[2939.3s] know uh that that that it it came to be.
[2942.9s] We can't really excuse it. But in
[2945.2s] essence it's significant in that it
[2948.8s] started in he one who was not just any
[2953.2s] cherub but a covering cherub a an angel
[2956.7s] so exalted an angel so respected in the
[2961.0s] government of heaven that I think there
[2963.5s] was no other angel above him after him.
[2966.8s] it was only the trinity, the father, the
[2968.8s] son, and the holy spirit. Yet he in his
[2972.5s] heart, I don't know
[2974.7s] how, but um but I
[2978.5s] believe as human beings now in our
[2980.7s] fallen nature, we sort of can understand
[2982.6s] jealousy and pride, you know, and and
[2985.4s] and and a desire, a covetousness of
[2989.2s] powers and authority which are not ours.
[2991.9s] You know sometimes u uh you see your
[2995.2s] friend prospering and you feel you ask
[2997.4s] yourself uh one preacher says um
[3000.7s] covetousness isn't wanting uh wanting a
[3004.8s] car like your brothers. It's wanting
[3006.9s] your brother's car. My brother's car.
[3008.5s] Yeah. Like it's good. You can you can
[3010.2s] see somebody and say that's a nice car.
[3011.7s] I would want to get one like that. Both
[3013.7s] of us can win. But for Lucifer he wanted
[3016.8s] everything for himself. He some some
[3019.1s] would say as Daniel was reminding me he
[3021.1s] had an eye problem you know I will do
[3024.0s] this I want this I will in fact he he
[3026.5s] say he was he was so ambitious that he
[3028.3s] says his government will be above the
[3031.0s] stars of God if gods is here mine will
[3033.5s] be above you know and so uh it's a
[3036.3s] mystery how it happened but we know
[3038.6s] pride was a key ingredient. Amen. Amen.
[3041.6s] I I just want to come to you uh brother
[3043.8s] Jaffet briefly and ask this question.
[3046.3s] What was God's reaction to Lucifer's
[3049.9s] uh fall? What was God's reaction when
[3053.0s] iniquity was found in his heart? Uh
[3055.6s] interestingly, he did not immediately
[3057.4s] obliterate the devil. He could have done
[3059.4s] that like in a moment, but he allowed
[3062.6s] the principles that he was espousing to
[3065.8s] reach their fruition because at that
[3068.6s] time um in fact we talked about here his
[3071.8s] actual ambition is what is described
[3073.2s] that he wanted the throne of God. But
[3075.0s] what did he speak with his mouth? It's
[3077.4s] what he told Adam and Eve. He told them
[3079.9s] what we can all be like God. All of us
[3082.6s] can share in divinity. But that's truly
[3084.6s] that wasn't what was he like in his
[3086.5s] heart is what it it says here that he
[3088.3s] actually wanted the highest position. It
[3091.1s] was to be um supreme. But God had to
[3094.8s] allow that to be manifested such that it
[3097.0s] is clear the supreme wickedness of sin.
[3100.2s] He was cast out of heaven eventually
[3102.0s] after it was he was given time to you
[3104.2s] could say canvas and evangelize his
[3106.5s] ideas in the the book of revelation
[3108.5s] chapter 12 we are told that he cast out
[3111.8s] um he went using his tail he took what
[3114.8s] oneird of the stars of heaven he was
[3117.1s] able to deceive onethird of the angels
[3119.0s] of heaven and was cast to the ground
[3121.0s] along with himself but um uh uh uh uh in
[3124.8s] essence um the reason is that God wanted
[3127.6s] the fruit to be revealed. Amen. Amen.
[3130.1s] Brother Ktor, you know the Bible here in
[3132.3s] Ezekiel 28 says, "Take up a lamentation
[3136.2s] upon the king of Tus." It's a
[3138.5s] lamentation. God is not rejoicing. God
[3141.0s] is not happy about this. So what is
[3144.0s] God's intention with Lucifer contrasting
[3146.5s] with God's intention with man? Now it's
[3150.4s] a very interesting choice word there.
[3152.4s] Lamentation. Actually the first tear
[3154.8s] ever shed at least in a in the record of
[3157.6s] inspiration by God was on the behalf of
[3160.0s] Lucifer. How sad. Yeah. So actually when
[3163.8s] you read the spirit of prophecy it says
[3165.8s] that for a time Satan was in meditation
[3169.6s] as he viewed his work. You know he he
[3172.7s] looked at the present. He looked at the
[3175.0s] past. He looked at the future of his
[3177.1s] plans and his mighty frame shook as with
[3181.0s] a tempest. But an angel from heaven was
[3185.4s] passing and then called him and then in
[3188.7s] treated an interview with Christ. So
[3190.6s] Lucifer was watching for the angels and
[3192.6s] then saw one and then asked could I
[3194.6s] could I meet with my master?
[3197.4s] Then this was granted him. He then
[3201.0s] related to the son of God that he
[3203.1s] repented of his rebellion and wished
[3205.8s] again the favor of God. He was willing
[3209.0s] to take the place that God previously
[3211.0s] had assigned him and be under his wise
[3214.8s] command. So he changed his mind at some
[3216.8s] point. Yes. So he changed his mind but
[3220.6s] he did not change his mind the way a
[3223.4s] repentant being should change their
[3226.3s] mind. So the interview was granted him.
[3229.8s] But listen to
[3230.9s] these sad words. Christ wept as at
[3236.2s] Satan's woe but told him as the mind of
[3240.2s] God that he could never be received into
[3244.1s] heaven. Heaven must not be placed in
[3248.9s] job. So
[3252.6s] divinity wept because of sin in
[3257.8s] Lucifer's heart. He was allowed to
[3260.8s] continue to be in existence. So that as
[3263.4s] has been
[3264.4s] alluded principles of his government
[3267.5s] would be
[3268.8s] clear. So that angels angels would see
[3272.6s] that indeed he was a murderer from the
[3275.4s] beginning. He actually sought the life
[3277.8s] of the son of God Jesus. And this
[3281.4s] actually was demonstrated when our maker
[3285.7s] that is Jesus himself responded to these
[3289.9s] urgent need of the fall of man after
[3293.4s] 4,000 years decided to take up a cross
[3298.1s] went to Calvary was nailed there. At
[3301.5s] that particular point, angels in heaven
[3304.1s] understood that indeed this was a
[3306.7s] murderer from the beginning.
[3308.6s] But for the sake of man, for you and me,
[3312.2s] because of you and me, we still hold
[3314.4s] this being in our affections.
[3317.4s] We choose his ways, we choose his
[3320.1s] interests, what he likes, we like. So
[3323.0s] there is still something that per
[3325.8s] perhaps attracts him to
[3329.4s] us and for our sake his existence is
[3334.7s] prolonged that you and I finally may
[3338.6s] make a choice between God's government
[3341.3s] and his governing government. And guess
[3343.7s] what?
[3345.1s] angels who now
[3348.4s] uh so that are willing to assist you and
[3352.9s] me in our daily battle against sin so
[3356.9s] that the enemy is rooted from our
[3359.9s] affections forever. Amen. Amen. And what
[3363.2s] a perfect way to conclude this that the
[3365.7s] angels are working for you and I so that
[3369.4s] the enemy is uprooted forever. You know,
[3372.2s] angelic perfection truly failed in
[3375.0s] heaven. We saw in the Garden of Eden,
[3377.3s] human perfection failed. But divinity,
[3381.0s] divinity combined with humanity will
[3383.9s] succeed until on Mount Zion, we see
[3386.9s] human beings perfected in Christ
[3389.2s] standing there having been redeemed. I
[3392.3s] pray that you and I will be there.
[3394.6s] Brother Raphael, kindly pray with us as
[3396.6s] we close. Let's believe and pray. Our
[3399.9s] kind and loving father and master art in
[3402.3s] heaven. You who whose throne is high and
[3406.1s] lifted up. I pray dear Jesus like
[3410.0s] Ezekiel and like Isaiah together with
[3413.0s] the hymn
[3414.3s] writer and like Moses also Lord give us
[3418.6s] a glimpse of you in glory and with it
[3421.5s] dear Lord as him writer says with all
[3425.4s] the toils of life
[3428.1s] repay teach us and help us to understand
[3431.5s] this reality that heaven dear Lord is
[3434.2s] cheap enough to this end I Pray dear
[3437.8s] Jesus that we may touch our tongues with
[3441.4s] coals of fire as you did for Isaiah
[3444.3s] because we are men and women of unclean
[3446.7s] lips who live in a society of men and
[3450.1s] women of unclean lips and when the time
[3452.6s] comes dear Lord in which the question is
[3454.2s] asked who shall go for us. It is my
[3456.6s] prayer and it is my desire dear Jesus if
[3458.8s] you have need for us that each and every
[3461.0s] single one of us will say here we are
[3463.3s] Lord send us. make this our experience
[3465.7s] for this our prayer through the mighty
[3467.4s] name of Christ Jesus our Lord our
[3468.4s] savior. Amen. Amen.
