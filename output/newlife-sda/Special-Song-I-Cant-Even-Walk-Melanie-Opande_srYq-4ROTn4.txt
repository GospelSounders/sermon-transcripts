FULL TRANSCRIPT:
[Music] I thought that I had done a lot on my own. I thought that I could make it all on my own. I thought that I could build on life's shrinking sense. that I can't even walk without you holding my hand. Oh Lord, I can't even walk without you holding my hand. The mountains too high and the valleys too wide. Down on my knees. I learn how to stand. Lord, I can't even walk without you holding my [Music] hand. I thought I could be all I wanted to be. I thought I could walk on the path that I alone have made. And I thought of myself though I'm a woman but I thought was a mighty big man but I can't even walk without you holding. Hold in my hand. Join me, church, please. I can't even walk. There you go. Without you holding. Amen. Praise the Lord. The mountains is too high. What about the valley? And the valley is too wide. So down on our knees. down on my knees. That's where I land. How to stand. Lord, I can't even walk without you holding my hand. Yes. Down on our knees. Yes. Down on our knees. That's where we learn how to [Music] stand. Precious Lord, take my hand. Lead me on and help me stand. For I am weak and I am worn. I can't even walk. I can't even walk. I can't even walk without you holding holding my hand. [Music]

TIMESTAMPED TRANSCRIPT:
[7.3s] [Music]
[17.8s] I
[19.0s] thought that I had
[21.9s] done a lot on my own.
[27.2s] I
[28.8s] thought that I could make
[32.4s] it all
[34.7s] on my
[37.2s] own. I
[39.2s] thought that I could
[42.3s] build on life's
[45.5s] shrinking
[47.2s] sense. that I can't
[50.7s] even walk without you
[55.3s] holding my
[59.1s] hand. Oh Lord, I can't
[63.6s] even
[65.2s] walk without you
[68.2s] holding my hand.
[72.2s] The
[73.8s] mountains too
[76.2s] high and the
[79.1s] valleys too
[82.1s] wide. Down on my
[87.5s] knees. I learn how to
[91.9s] stand. Lord, I can't
[95.2s] even
[96.8s] walk without you
[100.0s] holding my
[104.6s] [Music]
[111.2s] hand. I
[113.3s] thought I could
[116.0s] be all I
[118.9s] wanted to be.
[122.3s] I
[123.5s] thought I could
[126.1s] walk on the path that I alone have
[131.6s] made. And I
[133.9s] thought of myself though I'm a woman but
[137.0s] I thought was a
[139.1s] mighty big
[142.0s] man but I can't
[145.3s] even walk without you holding.
[151.0s] Hold in my
[153.3s] hand. Join me, church, please. I
[157.6s] can't even walk. There you go. Without
[161.5s] you
[163.8s] holding. Amen. Praise the Lord. The
[168.1s] mountains is too high. What about the
[170.9s] valley? And the
[174.0s] valley is too wide. So down on our
[177.3s] knees. down on my
[180.8s] knees. That's where I land. How to
[186.6s] stand. Lord, I can't
[189.8s] even
[191.3s] walk without you
[194.2s] holding my
[197.8s] hand. Yes. Down on our knees. Yes. Down
[202.6s] on our knees.
[206.4s] That's where we learn how to
[209.8s] [Music]
[211.5s] stand. Precious
[213.6s] Lord, take my
[216.4s] hand. Lead me on and help me
[220.0s] stand. For I am
[222.7s] weak and I am
[225.7s] worn. I can't even
[228.8s] walk. I can't even walk.
[234.6s] I can't even
[239.2s] walk without you
[243.4s] holding holding my hand.
[262.5s] [Music]
