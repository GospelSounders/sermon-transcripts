South Nairobi Kajado field. We are all aware that uh the month of May has been um mental health awareness month and this has been celebrated all over the world various institutions and uh last weekend I'm sure you are aware that uh our church the 7th day Adventist church has been very vocal in uh mobilizing walks to say no to drugs. So basically today we are going to look at um uh impact of drugs on mental health. Impact of drugs on mental health. I want us to I want just just want to give us a brief disin. This is any substance that can cause physiological effect when ingested or introduced into the body. Drugs should be used to prevent, treat, diagnose or relieve pain when put to proper use. We are also aware that drugs may be abused. But how do we find ourselves abusing drugs? It starts as a trial. Many of us are aware either we have siblings or we ourselves or neighbors or parents who are abusing drugs. We must be aware there must be some people in our communities or in our families who have fallen victim into drug and substance abuse. How does it come about? Some of us have uh gotten into this habit either through um parties, birthday parties, office parties, uh family gatherings or even because of the many um challenges that we have faced back in our families. Some of us come from broken families. Some of us are struggling with depression because of uh joblessness. um joblessness or death or even uh poverty levels. This is how we find ourselves getting into the habit of using drugs and substance. What are some of the various drug categories? I'm trying to be very brief and this information you can get it from the various uh medical journals. You can access them via WH website or even back at home the NADA website. What are some of the drug categories? Some of the drug categories um include depressants, hallucinogens and stimulants. Just as the names uh go by, some of the depressants most commonly abused are alcohol and canabis. Canabis uh being bang uh locally known as bang local um alcohol is a central nervous system depressant. It slows down brain activity. It can change one's mood behavior and self-control. It can cause problems with memory and effect clear thinking. That is from the category of depressants. What are hallucinogens? Hallucinogens. A good example that is commonly abused is ketamine. And some of um our prescription drugs actually fall in this uh category. These drugs distort perception of reality causing one to have hall hallucinations. You see things that are not there, hear voices, see flashes of light and feel like insects are crawling on your skin. So just like from the name hallucinogens, these are the effects of these drugs on our physiological, physical and mental um uh conditions. Um the third category of drugs is stimulants. Stimulants and the most common ones I'm just going to mention a few. These are cocaine falls under this category. Then caffeine. Caffeine you can um pick the most common cigarette, tobacco, coffee, cocoa, tea. And then the third one most commonly abused as well is the cat which is muga or mirror. How do these how does this category affect our physical and mental? While stimulants uh raise blood pressure and increase heart rate and breathing rate thereby increase alertness, phys physical activity and energy. These stimulants activate your central stimulate your central nervous system. So basically what are some of the effects? What are some of the effects when you get used to these drugs and you begin abusing them? misusing using using them uh as per note as per describe uh prescribed. Some of the physical uh short-term effects are dizziness, slide speech, shallow breathing, increased heart rate, anxiety, altered mood, panic attacks, irritability, impaired judgment, aggression, uh appetite changes, sleep problems, and memory issues. So you can imagine if you have been on these drugs and you start experiencing some of these effects, please seek uh medical attention. And if you see anybody with this kind of um behavior, you can quickly uh be able to tell if there's something that this person has been taking and you are not aware. What are the long-term effects of using this drug? Some of the long-term effects uh include drug addiction because if you have been using these drugs eventually you'll start seeking a higher or stronger drug that will give you the high that you have been looking for. So basically some of the long-term effects include drug addiction, liver damage, renal or kidney damage, gastrointest gastrointestinal damage, sexual dysfunction, neurological abnormalities. I'm sure you have seen in our media um radio and TV some of the counties in our country where families have been seriously affected and there has been a lot of campaign to try and get our youth in um rehabs so that we can continue our families. Basically, what are some of the effects of these drugs on mental health? Some of the effects of these drugs on mental health include depression, anxiety, psychosis, which is a mental disorder because of prolonged use of these drugs, um cognitive decline, panic attacks, and emotional instability. You have seen families that have broken because of either one or two or both of the spouses in the family are abusing drugs or even uh siblings or children in these families. You will not be able to maintain healthy relationships. You will lose your employment. You are not have to have you are not able to have um um proper judge judge judgment on issues or matters and you get into depression. So how what do you what should you do in case you are a victim? You are already abusing drugs and substance. What should you do? Seek help. Seek medical help. And uh I would encourage you with Psalms 33:20-22. When you get time, you go and read it. But it is important that you seek help for yourself or for the loved one. Get a support system. If you are just recovering from this, get a support system or a responsibility partner so that you do not fall back into this uh addiction. Then you must change your attitude. It is important that you change your attitude towards uh everything and all the matters that have been depressing you before that got you into that position. So you must change your attitude. Then thirdly or fourthly, you must be hopeful. Let us be hopeful. God cares and he can restore what the devil has taken away from us, our health most especially and God heals. Look at Job 33:23. So we must be hopeful. Then finally, in case you have not gotten into this habit or behavior, you can avoid bad company because basically most of the people that we know who have started uh abusing drugs began small and it is because of the company they have been keeping. So avoid bad company and also be alert. 1 Peter 5:8, the enemy pearls looking for whom to devour and avoiding bad company. 1 Corinthians uh chapter 15:33. And may the Lord bless us. I pray that we shall be on the lookout for our loved ones and for ourselves not to fall into this uh tempting devil's snare. May the Lord bless us. Let's pray. Our kind and loving father in heaven, we are before your throne of grace again with thanksgiving. We thank you even for the many insights that we have learned this morning. Many of us have been struggling with uh drug and substance abuse. We know of loved ones. We know of broken families. We know we have not done enough. My father, we commit each and every one of them. We commit our youths, our children, our parents, our siblings who have been struggling with this um uh drug addiction. My father, we thank you because of the hope that we know that is in your word that when we seek you, we shall find you and you shall deliver us from all our cares and our troubles and you shall restore our health. We pray this with thanksgiving in Jesus holy name. Amen. [Music]

[32.6s] basically today we are going to look at
[34.8s] um
[36.8s] uh impact of drugs on mental health.
[41.6s] Impact of drugs on mental health. I want
[44.1s] us to I want just just want to give us a
[46.7s] brief
[48.3s] disin. This is any substance that can
[51.0s] cause physiological effect when ingested
[54.5s] or introduced into the body. Drugs
[57.7s] should be used to prevent, treat,
[60.0s] diagnose or relieve pain when put to
[63.3s] proper use. We are also aware that drugs
[66.6s] may be
[68.2s] abused. But how do we find ourselves
[71.3s] abusing
[72.8s] drugs? It
[74.8s] starts as a
[76.8s] trial. Many of us are aware either we
[80.3s] have siblings or we ourselves or
[82.9s] neighbors or parents who are abusing
[85.4s] drugs. We must be aware there must be
[88.8s] some people in our communities or in our
[90.9s] families who have fallen victim into
[93.9s] drug and substance
[96.7s] abuse. How does it come about? Some of
[100.0s] us have uh gotten into this habit either
[103.5s] through um parties, birthday parties,
[107.0s] office parties, uh family gatherings or
[110.8s] even because of the many um challenges
[115.3s] that we have faced back in our families.
[118.0s] Some of us come from broken families.
[120.5s] Some of us are struggling with
[122.6s] depression because of uh joblessness.
[127.2s] um joblessness or death or even uh
[131.8s] poverty levels. This is how we find
[134.8s] ourselves getting into the habit of
[137.7s] using drugs and substance. What are some
[140.8s] of the various drug categories? I'm
[143.5s] trying to be very brief and this
[145.4s] information you can get it from the
[147.2s] various uh medical journals. You can
[149.6s] access them via WH website or even back
[153.8s] at home the NADA website. What are some
[157.4s] of the drug categories? Some of the drug
[159.8s] categories
[161.6s] um include depressants, hallucinogens
[166.2s] and stimulants. Just as the names uh go
[169.9s] by, some of the depressants most
[172.7s] commonly abused are alcohol and canabis.
[176.7s] Canabis uh being bang uh locally known
[180.5s] as
[182.4s] bang local um alcohol is a central
[185.8s] nervous system depressant. It slows down
[188.4s] brain activity. It can change one's mood
[191.4s] behavior and self-control. It can cause
[194.8s] problems with memory and
[198.2s] effect clear thinking. That is from the
[201.8s] category of depressants. What are
[204.2s] hallucinogens? Hallucinogens. A good
[206.7s] example that is commonly abused is
[209.4s] ketamine. And some of um our
[212.4s] prescription drugs actually fall in this
[215.2s] uh category. These drugs distort
[218.5s] perception of reality causing one to
[221.5s] have hall hallucinations. You see things
[224.8s] that are not there, hear voices, see
[227.9s] flashes of light and feel like insects
[230.9s] are crawling on your skin. So just like
[233.8s] from the name hallucinogens, these are
[236.8s] the effects of these drugs on our
[240.5s] physiological, physical and mental um uh
[247.6s] conditions. Um the third category of
[251.8s] drugs is stimulants. Stimulants and the
[254.6s] most common ones I'm just going to
[256.4s] mention a few. These are cocaine falls
[259.8s] under this category. Then caffeine.
[262.4s] Caffeine you can um pick the most common
[265.7s] cigarette, tobacco, coffee, cocoa, tea.
[269.8s] And then the third one most commonly
[271.7s] abused as well is the cat which is muga
[275.1s] or
[276.4s] mirror. How do these how does this
[279.0s] category affect our physical and mental?
[283.3s] While stimulants uh raise blood pressure
[287.2s] and increase heart rate and breathing
[289.8s] rate
[291.1s] thereby increase alertness, phys
[294.4s] physical activity and energy. These
[298.0s] stimulants activate your central
[301.4s] stimulate your central nervous system.
[303.6s] So basically what are some of the
[305.4s] effects? What are some of the effects
[307.9s] when you get used to these drugs and you
[311.0s] begin abusing them?
[313.6s] misusing using using them uh as per note
[317.4s] as per describe uh prescribed.
[321.4s] Some of the physical uh short-term
[324.1s] effects are dizziness, slide speech,
[327.1s] shallow breathing, increased heart rate,
[330.1s] anxiety, altered mood, panic attacks,
[333.8s] irritability, impaired judgment,
[336.4s] aggression, uh appetite changes, sleep
[339.9s] problems, and memory issues. So you can
[343.0s] imagine if you have been on these drugs
[346.1s] and you start experiencing some of these
[348.8s] effects, please seek uh medical
[353.1s] attention. And if you see anybody with
[355.8s] this kind of um behavior, you can
[359.2s] quickly uh be able to tell if there's
[362.6s] something that this person has been
[364.4s] taking and you are not aware. What are
[367.0s] the long-term effects of using this
[369.2s] drug? Some of the long-term effects uh
[371.6s] include drug addiction because if you
[374.2s] have been using these drugs eventually
[377.0s] you'll start seeking a higher or
[379.9s] stronger drug that will give you the
[382.0s] high that you have been looking for. So
[384.8s] basically some of the long-term effects
[386.6s] include drug addiction, liver damage,
[390.0s] renal or kidney damage,
[392.8s] gastrointest
[394.8s] gastrointestinal damage, sexual
[397.6s] dysfunction, neurological abnormalities.
[400.8s] I'm sure you have seen in our media um
[404.5s] radio and TV some of the counties in our
[408.1s] country where families have been
[410.7s] seriously affected and there has been a
[414.2s] lot of campaign to try and get our youth
[419.0s] in um rehabs so that we can continue our
[423.2s] families.
[425.7s] Basically, what are some of the effects
[428.2s] of these drugs on mental health? Some of
[431.0s] the effects of these drugs on mental
[433.0s] health include depression, anxiety,
[436.7s] psychosis, which is a mental disorder
[439.4s] because of prolonged use of these drugs,
[442.6s] um cognitive decline, panic attacks, and
[446.7s] emotional instability.
[450.0s] You have seen families that have broken
[452.6s] because of either one or two or both of
[455.0s] the spouses in the family are abusing
[457.0s] drugs or even uh siblings or children in
[460.2s] these families. You will not be able to
[463.0s] maintain healthy relationships. You will
[465.8s] lose your employment. You are not have
[468.5s] to have you are not able to have um um
[472.2s] proper judge judge judgment on issues or
[475.8s] matters and you get into depression. So
[479.1s] how what do you what should you do in
[482.0s] case you are a victim? You are already
[485.0s] abusing drugs and substance. What should
[487.4s] you do? Seek help. Seek medical help.
[492.2s] And uh I would encourage you with Psalms
[496.7s] 33:20-22. When you get time, you go and
[498.9s] read it. But it is important that you
[501.3s] seek help for yourself or for the loved
[504.4s] one. Get a support system. If you are
[507.4s] just recovering from this, get a support
[509.4s] system or a responsibility partner so
[511.9s] that you do not fall back into this uh
[514.8s] addiction. Then you must change your
[516.9s] attitude. It is important that you
[518.9s] change your attitude towards uh
[521.4s] everything and all the matters that have
[524.5s] been depressing you before that got you
[526.2s] into that position. So you must change
[528.6s] your attitude. Then thirdly or fourthly,
[532.3s] you must be hopeful. Let us be hopeful.
[535.4s] God cares and he can restore what the
[537.8s] devil has taken away from us, our health
[540.5s] most especially and God heals. Look at
[543.5s] Job
[545.0s] 33:23. So we must be hopeful. Then
[547.9s] finally, in case you have not gotten
[550.2s] into this habit or behavior, you can
[552.6s] avoid bad company because basically most
[555.6s] of the people that we know who have
[557.4s] started uh abusing drugs began small and
[561.0s] it is because of the company they have
[563.7s] been keeping. So avoid bad company and
[566.4s] also be alert. 1 Peter 5:8, the enemy
[570.4s] pearls looking for whom to devour and
[573.0s] avoiding bad company. 1 Corinthians uh
[575.9s] chapter
[577.1s] 15:33. And may the Lord bless us. I pray
[581.4s] that we shall be on the lookout for our
[584.3s] loved ones and for ourselves not to fall
[587.4s] into this uh tempting devil's snare. May
[591.7s] the Lord bless us. Let's pray. Our kind
[594.6s] and loving father in heaven, we are
[597.1s] before your throne of grace again with
[598.8s] thanksgiving. We thank you even for the
[601.3s] many insights that we have learned this
[603.2s] morning. Many of us have been struggling
[605.5s] with uh drug and substance abuse. We
[608.7s] know of loved ones. We know of broken
[610.6s] families. We know we have not done
[612.7s] enough. My father, we commit each and
[615.0s] every one of them. We commit our youths,
[617.3s] our children, our parents, our siblings
[619.5s] who have been struggling with this um uh
[622.8s] drug addiction. My father, we thank you
[625.0s] because of the hope that we know that is
[627.1s] in your word that when we seek you, we
[630.1s] shall find you and you shall deliver us
[632.6s] from all our cares and our troubles and
[635.5s] you shall restore our health. We pray
[637.5s] this with thanksgiving in Jesus holy
[639.6s] name. Amen.
