FULL TRANSCRIPT:
uh my name is Ono uh now that we are talking about names my name is onong rafaam it's my pleasure and my privilege to be able to Fellowship together with you I'm a member of this church and um I'm I'm I'm glad to be here unfortunately my introduction ends there I've not done much in life apart from acquiring a few academic certificates here and there but uh those are not very important in in an occasion such as this all right S I think then it being the youth Sabbath we will all become youth amen or youthful at heart it is 11:28 which is good time which is good time I will not uh uh I don't want to keep us any longer for that reason I made some notes uh so that I'll be able to time myself therefore have no fear if you have met me somewhere else and I preached for an hour I have changed okay s s let's bow our heads let's Close Our Eyes let's believe and pray a kind and loving father and master behold the time has come you've spoken to us through the Children's Story You've spoken to us through the songs that have been sung and now dear Lord arrest our consciences and take us to the text help us to see you dear Lord and speak to us in your word GL you say that where two or three are gathered together to seek after your face and to seek after salvation that your very presence will be in the midst of them and in this place this day dear Lord are gathered more than two or three dear Lord we believe and we know that you are here with us guide us through this service is our prayer in Jesus name amen amen our this being a youth Sabbath it was material produced by the general conference supposed to been a week preceding uh this particular Sabbath but the week will follow and uh the overhanging theme the the theme that was uh anchoring this whole week was communities doing what being transformed communities being transformed so what exactly is a community what exactly is a community why and why does it require to be transformed the word Community comes from the Latin word communist which simply means to common or public and shared by all when we're talking about a community in this particular context it's a group of people living in the same place or having a shared characteristic sometimes uh some say it has it connotes a sense of Fellowship a network of support where people help and interact with each other the dictionary the m Webster dictionary says it is a unified body of individuals when you're talking about a community people with common interests living in a particular area and therefore we have various types of communities a community could be geographical a community could be tribal a community could be spiritual and therefore when we are talking about communities being transformed we are talking about people being transformed we're talking about individuals networks being being transformed but then the question we must ask ourselves is if a community is a group of people who share a common interests values location culture or purpose therefore Community is based on relationships geography and shared identity but why do communities need to be transformed the Bible speaks to us that since the fall in Genesis chapter 3 When sin entered into our world there was the need for communities to be transformed there was the need for changes to happen because what happened one at the fall we are told there was a spiritual separation between man and God and therefore that communion between man and God that was there in the Garden of Eden was changed that that that dichotomy was broken that Union between God and man and as a result Isaiah speaking to us say says in Isaiah 59 and ver2 that our iniquities have separated us from God and our sins have hidden his face Paul writing in Ephesians says as for you as for us rather we who were dead in our transgressions and our sins it tells us that communities have aspects of separation from God another aspect uh some of the reasons and challenges by for which communities need to be transformed is the very reality of death and Decay Genesis 2 and ver1 17 says the command was given in the day that they would eat of that tree for a fact they would die but Grace intervenes but nonetheless as a result of of of sin in our lives then we have suffering we have pain humans have become mortal subject to aging to disease and to eventual death death and decay in everything and in all places that we see Romans simply says it 5 and verse2 Paul says therefore just as Sin entered into the wild through one man and death through sin and in this way death came to all people because all have sinned and fallen short of the glory of God for this reason then communities require to be transformed we have broken relationships one of the first things that happened uh When sin came we see Adam and Eve blaming one another we see things happening Genesis 3:15 Adam says this woman whom you put to here with me she gave me this fruit to eat we see marriages and families communities experiencing strife and Brokenness selfishness jealousy and pride all of these are aspects that need to be addressed in our community for our communities to truly be transformed broken relationship amongst ourselves and with others James 4: 1-2 says what causes fights what causes quarrels among you don't they come from your desires that battle within you father Mo we are told that the ground itself was cast and the environment itself shares in the impact of the Fall Genesis 3:1 17 to9 God castes the ground and he says cast is the ground because of you through pain ful toil you will eat food of it from it in the all the days of your lives later on Paul himself writing in Romans chapter 5 and uh Romans chapter 8 says all creation waiting groans for the revelation of the children of God even creation itself our world in itself is suffering because of that separation that breach in the communion with God we see as a result of sin there is a distortion of identity and purpose sin has not only distorted nature itself but even man his identity of him his understanding of of himself his purpose and even his calling in Genesis 3 and: 7 we we are told that the eyes of both of them after they had eaten after Adam had eaten that uh forbidden fruit they were was open and they realized that they were naked and as a result of that they tried to se fig leaves together and make coverings for themselves they try to to to patch up to to to to sort of clothe themselves to understand themselves a bit better but lo and behold since then men and women have been struggling with shame with insecurity with confusion even about their self one in that we require a lot of transformation there's a lot of evil and suffering there are lot of many things there are many things that indeed are required of us since the fall in which aspects in which our world has suffered since the fall but then we look at ourselves as Africans what are some of the challenges closer Home to the African context and even by extension it being a youth Sabbath what are some of the challenges that we as youth because we are all youthful today face one we have the reality of poverty and economic inequality many African nations and well and indeed even our nation and even young people struggle with extreme poverty unemployment as well as inequalities even in income amongst genders and even amongst races corruption poor governance and of in infrastructure and many other reasons that we come up as to why our communities are suffering and have need for transformation there's conflicts and political instability creating an environment that is has a lot of tension you know and power struggles and a lack of reconciliation and F fuel ongoing violence we have differences in access to Quality education as well as healthare all of these are challenges that are present and prevalent in the communities from which we hail and in which we exist and live indeed environmental challenges as well as climate change are realities diseases such as HIV and AIDS and uh recently other non-communicable illnesses are on the rise in our society and in our communities and this particular Sabbath we are saying and we are speaking that indeed we must change our communities that communities require changing youth unemployment and an oranization a large percentage of uh young people are of the population is is youthful but the job opportunities are scar many other issues food insecurity and hunger we could talk about substance abuse and addiction plaguing both young and old alike alcoholic ISM and addiction are growing problems not only uh in the west but also in Africa young people who are idle with inadequate resources choosing to drown their sorrows so to say the many issues many challenges to the young person existing today all of these issues we must face but today we are saying that communities must be transformed Comm communities transformed how then shall we be able to transform our communities we look at some examples in the Bible of men and women who are able to transform their communities we find one man to consider is Moses he liberated the Jews from slavery in Egypt and he establishes he leads them up to the border of the promised land and and gives them delivers to them a Constitution which is the which is The Ten Commandments and and gives the children of Israel structure and praise presence and a sense of nationhood and identity amongst the heathan Nations Moses was a man who did not shine these responsibilities in Paul writing about Moses in Hebrews chapter 11 in that role of men and women who by faith did wonderful wonderful things says Moses did not consider the Privileges of being known as Pharaoh's son the Privileges of being the next in line in Egypt as something to be compared as opposed to the suffering together with the children of God Moses was a man who transformed his community we have an example of another lady for those of us who uh like gender balance Esther Esther comes into play at a time when the children of Israel as a nation are are are surrounded by their enemy enemies and their enemies have plotted to destroy them Esther goes and wins favor before the king and as a result this young lady saves the Jews from genocide under Persian rule she risked her own life approaching the king to reveal hammon's plot she advocated for justice and secured protection for her people she transformed her community when it needed her we have Nehemiah after the children of Israel are recovering from Babylonian captivity and now they're going back to rebuild their Nation Nehemiah leading as a leader helps to organize to rebuild the walls of Jerusalem and to restore the community not only physically but Also spiritually he addressed social injustices such as death and slavery and exploitation in nemiah chapter 5 in nemiah chapter 2-6 he he motivate he organizes the people and he motivates the people to rebuild the city walls despite opposition both within and without but then the question is can the Youth of today rebuild our communities can the Youth of today transform our communities are they equal and up to the task Proverbs 20 and verse 29 says the glory of young men is their strength and the beauty of old men is their gray head that indeed to transform our communities requires collaboration that if we compare the Vigor and the strength of Youth with the resources and the wisdom of the Aged indeed we can transform our communities amen Ecclesiastes 12 and verse1 Solomon writing to the youth today says that we should remember our creator in in the days of our youth before the days of trouble come Paul in encouraging this young man Timothy in 1 Timothy 4:12 speaks to Timothy and tells him let no man despise what despise your youth but be an example to the Believers in word in conduct in love in spirit in faith and in Purity that as young people yes we can transform our communities yes we have the strength we have the capabilities to transform our communities now to our scripture reading the book of Lamentations CH 3 and: 27 it calls calls to us as young people if we are truly to transform our communities that then Jeremiah writes and says it is good for a man where a man here is generic for a human being whether male or female it is good for a man that he bear the Yoke in his youth it is good for a man that he bear the Yoke in his youth that is from the King James version The New International Version says it is good for man to Bear the Yoke while he is Young the New Living Translation says it is good for people to submit at an early age to the Yoke of discipline The Message Bible simply says it is a good thing when you are young to stick it out through the hard times young people must be able to appreciate the challenges of society and look for solutions for these challenges we must be involved amen for us to transform our communities we must face these challenges because they are the realities in which we exist and the Bible is replete with examples of young people who have equally contributed to their communities I would like us to consider a few in the the book of First Kings chapter 2 Kings rather 2 Kings 11: 27 we hear of a king know known as Who joash and the Bible records that joash started leading Israel not even his home he started leading Israel as a King when he was how old 7 years old it is possible my brothers and my sisters that as youth when we talking about communities we must know that we belong to these communities amen we belong we are part and parcel when Society has got problems we are part and parcel of finding the solutions to this to this to this uh to this problem and it's not simply the issues of the old and the Aged but we must participate we see joash at 7 years old rising and taking up uh responsibility as a king in Israel we have Josiah at 8 years old in 2 Kings 22 and verse1 equally at 8 years old he begins to reign in Israel we have Manassa in 2 Kings chapter 21 and verse1 begins becomes king in Israel at 12 years of age we have King jein at 18 years of age he is able to lead the children of Israel we have King ahaz at 20 years of age in 2 Kings 16 and verse 2 ah has his 20 when he begins to lead the nation of Israel a nation under God we have eah 25 years old 2 Kings chapter 18 and verse 2 these were men who led from youth king amaziah 25 years old 2 Kings 14 and ver2 King jeos at 25 years old also at 2 Kings 13 and: 10 King Uzziah or aarah some know him at 16 years of age he begins to rule and to reign in Israel and many examples Solomon himself when he was around 20 years of age comes into power and so it goes to shows us that indeed God uses young people to lead amen God uses young people to lead and faithfulness to God is the only thing that is required for us to be successful and sometimes we say that wisdom comes with age but I'd like to tell us today sometimes age comes alone just because you have a few white hairs on your head does not mean that you are wise sometimes wisdom is not the exclusive habitation does not simply live among those who are old but even the young can be old amen the young rather can be wise wisdom matters more than age as young people we can transform our communities amen we can transform our communities but the Bible says we can only do this if we do what we bear the Yoke in our youth if we put in the work if we put in the work sister white writes in the book messages to Young People page 16 paragraph 1 she says the youth need need to keep ever before them the course that Christ followed that Christ is our example at every step it was a course of overcoming Christ did not come to the Earth as a king to rule the Nations he came as a humble man to be tempted to overcome temptation to follow on as we must to know the Lord in the study of his life we shall learn how much God through him will do for his children and as and as we shall learn that however great our trials may be they cannot exceed that which Christ endured that we might know the way the truth and the life amen by a life of Conformity to his example we are to show our appreciation of his sacrifice on our behalf we are called to consider the example of Christ to consider the trials of of Christ to consider his life and how he B he bore the Yoke in his Youth Christ in the Book of Matthew chapter 4 where I would like us to domicile ourselves as we look to bring this message to an end very soon we see Christ at the age of 30 years he has been baptized and something happens which has has never happened when did not happen when I was baptized the heavens opened up and the Holy Spirit did what descended as a dve and God himself spoke and said what this is my son do what listen to him interesting that never happened when I was baptized I don't know about your experience but then the next thing that happens in The Book of Matthew chapter 4 is significant and the Bible records that Christ was taken by the Holy Spirit Matthew 4:1 it says then Jesus was led up of the Holy Spirit Spirit where Into the Wilderness to be tempted of the devil that's interesting immediately after your baptism you are LED into temptation to be tempted by the devil and it is significant that the Bible says he wasn't led by Friends by bad Friends by Bad Company but he was led by who by the spirit of God sometimes God leads us as young people through difficult Parts but then we must bear the Yoke in our youth amen the trial and tribulation does not mean that God is not with us that difficulties on our Pathways as we are making our our a place and our presence felt here on Earth does not mean that God is not with us but rather it seems it means that God has seen something precious in US amen it means sometimes that indeed God is holding your hand and he's got a purpose and a plan for your life Christ is Led at 30 years into the Wilderness to be tempted by the devil and see what is the first Temptation that Christ is given the Bible records the setting of these Temptations in verse two says and when he had fasted for 40 days and 40 nights he was afterwards what hungry I've tried fasting I can tell you I am not very good at it I don't know for many of you sometimes they say I don't know the first Sabbath of every quarter is prayer and fasting but most of you eat very well at home and then you come here and you pretend like you're fasting and you are part of the of the prayer program during lunch hour but the Bible records that Christ did what fasted for 40 days and for 40 nights and then after that that's when the devil appears sometimes after you have had difficulty for long and and you are you you you are exhausted both spiritually and physically sometimes that's when the devil now shows up and tells you that was just the rehearsal this is the real thing the Bible comes and the Bible say says in verse three and when the tempter came to him he said if thou be the son of who of God command that these Stones be made into what into bread if thou be the Son of God the first principle that we must uh embrace if we are to truly transform our communities is that we must know who we are identity is key and is important who are you know yourself outside of your job after you have retired do you decrease then if youve been defined by being a doctor or by being an engineer when you have retired or when engineering changes because knowledge changes you know your first sergeant were barers but nowadays Barbers are not Sergeant things change so who are you are you defined by your accomplishments or do you truly are you truly in touch with who you are and it is important when the devil come came to Christ he says if you are the Son of God identity is important we must find ourselves we must know who we are and ultimately whose we are our identity is linked with our purpose our identity is linked with even the way we live our lives our Outlook our worldview our approach to problems is is is pegged upon whom we have believed we are we deviate from the story briefly to consider the book of Acts chapter 19 and verse 13 and the Bible tells a story and and it says then certain Vagabond Jews exorcists took upon them to call over them that had evil spirits the name of the Lord who Jesus saying we are Jew You by Jesus whom Paul does what whom Paul preaches and we told who are these men and these were seven sons of onekea a Jew and a chief of the priests which did so these were the children it was today would say they were the children of the pastor the children of the president of the General Conference you know the children of the highest office in the land Children of the chief of priests and they had seen Paul when he was when he was he healing those who are sick and healing those who were were were possessed that they thought this thing had a formula there was some science to Salvation you know and to deliverance and so they said we saw Paul put his hands on these people and then he would say say in the name of Jesus and so just to be sure they said Jesus whom Paul preaches so that the evil spirits can know for a fact whom they were talking about but the Bible continues and says but the evil spirit answered and said what Jesus I know Paul I know but who are you it tells us as young people your father could be the first Elder could be the head Deacon but that's not who you are Jesus we know the devil say Paul we know but who are you as young people if we are to transform our communities we must be clear as to who we are amen we must be clear as to who we are and whom whose we are that story does not end very well for those seven men those seven boys Children of The Preacher Man Children of the Elder we told that the evil spirits leaped on them and overcame them one mad man overcame seven sons of a of a of of a holy man the Bible says he prevailed against them so that they fled out of that house naked and wounded if we do not know our identities my brothers and my sisters out here we will equally be assaulted by the world and it will leave us naked and wounded so who are we who are we John writes in John 1 and: 12 he says but to all who did receive him who believed in his name he gave the right to be called children of God Amen Romans writes and says Paul writes in Romans 8:1 16 and verse1 17 it says the spirit himself Bears witness with our spirit that we are the children of God Amen the spirit of God himself Bears witness you know it's not it's not a title that you've put upon yourself but even the Holy Spirit Bears witness that we are the children of God and if then we are the children of God then we are hes and Joint HS together with Christ amen Matthew 6 and ver9 when Christ was teaching his disciples when they came to him and told him teacher Master teach us how to pray Christ tells them when you come to pray pray how pray like this say w Our Father Who Art in Heaven amen it doesn't matter who your Earthly father is here on Earth it doesn't matter what your background is here on Earth what is important is have you accepted Christ in your life have you embraced the new birth have you been born again I remember friend of mine in was telling me a story that happened in his high school there was a new teacher who was hired and this new teacher loved this was uh in 844 when children are being canned I know many of us here have been canned but these days we are talking to our children you know and negotiating with them but the way we were brought up the the Ken reigned Supreme uh where iniquity abounded the can much more abound but these days were in the dispensation of Grace but this teacher decided to punish some children for whatever iniquity that they had committed and so he hits some some some child there and then The Story Goes the next day at around break time suddenly the gates of the school were flung open and and Land Rovers one after the other drove into the school compound and lo and behold the child that this new teacher had had hit was a child of some some big man in government told I don't know some some some man in the military and he came to find out who touched his son and of course conveniently the teacher went missing and the principal had to intervene and after everything had come down the principal went to the teacher and told him next time before you hit a child make sure you ask him who his father is my brothers and my sisters behold what manner of love the father has bestowed upon us that we should be called the Sons and Daughters of God Amen we must know who we are and if we are children of God then we are HS and coair together with Christ we must divide ourselves from that thinking sometimes as young people we carry scars and Bens of where we've come from you know your excuse as to why you've not made it in life is because your father didn't make it in life that when other people's fathers were stealing land or working hard whatever it is how they got they got their wealth your father was somewhere Idol you know and therefore you don't have generational wealth indeed it is a saying that was common even in Israel in Ezekiel chapter 18 and verse2 God asks this question what mean ye when you say this proverb concerning the land of Israel saying the fathers have eaten sour graps and it is the children's teeth that are set what on edge same is echoed in Jeremiah 31:29 that in those days they shall say no more the fathers have eaten a sour grap and the children's teeth are set on edge when we accept AC Christ it doesn't matter who your father was it doesn't matter what your father has done we become sons and children of God Amen Sons and Daughters of God and you do not need to carry the the burden of your background but with new Vitality with new uh conviction we can set forth to conquer the day and its activities we can set forth to change our communities amen we must identify who we are we must identify who we are we go back to our text as we look to learn this plane Bible records and says the Devils asks Christ in verse three if thou be the Son of God command that these Stones be made what into bread verse four but Christ answers and says it is what written it is written principle number two that we must follow if if we are to transform our communities my brothers and my sisters we must be readers amen we must read go on are the days when they would say that if you want to keep something from an African do what put it in a book it shouldn't be said so in this day and age I know the the conveners of CBC are removing mathematics from the syab from being compulsory I don't know what will happen but nonetheless we must read Beyond own curriculums amen it is a sad thing that many of us don't read as young people because of our experiences in school because we were forced to read the same way I don't like bread because bread reminds me of of hard times I had in boarding school they used to give us three slices and we were very hungry every time I see bread I have some PTSD for that reason I don't like bread now that I can afford many loaves but my brothers and my sisters if we are to transform our communities we must be readers amen those who read are those who will lead only those who read are those who we lead if the youth would but make time if the youth would but make the Bible their study would but calm their impetuous desires and listen to the voice of their creator and their redeemer they would would not only be at peace with God but would find themselves en nobl and elevated it will be for your Eternal interest my young friend to give heed to the instructions of the word of God for they are inestimable they are of inestimable importance to you messages to Young People page 21 paragraph 1 if Christ had not read his Bible and the devil came to him perhaps he would have Fallen but Christ answers the devil and says what it is what it is written you can only know it is written if you have read it we must have a culture of reading not only reading frivolous novels and soas and and and and and and and and fiction but even involve ourselves in Reading nonfiction read science understand how our world works and operates understands the of economy the rules of demand and Supply we must read if we are to transform our communities amen we must be readers the second command the second Temptation comes and the Bible records um in verse 5 it says then the devil took him up into the holy city and set him on a pinnacle of the temple and the Bible records it's interesting that the Holy Spirit took Christ to the Wilderness to be tempted but lo and behold the devil takes Christ to church it's interesting that the Holy Spirit can take you to the Wilderness but the devil can bring you to church young people we must be awake and all of us that not everybody who is in church has been brought by God Amen not everybody who is sitting in our midst is here for the right purpose es singing the songs of Zion the Bible says the devil took him into the holy city and the Bible says continues it just didn't take him and put him and make him a backbencher no he put him where to The Pinacle of the temple at the very front therefore when we come to this house that is called the house of prayer this house of God and perhaps you are assailed by somebody somebody talks badly to you somebody gossips about you somebody cors you some church members a COR men you must be aware something can happen to you it's nothing new my brothers and sisters amen don't rush out of the church because you real you found strange men don't rush out of the church because you found strange ladies stay in the church the Bible records the Devil Himself quoted scripture in verse 6 it says to him if thou be the Son of God cast thyself down for it is written he quotes the Psalms there but then the Bible tells us how did Christ answer Christ answers and says again to him it is what it is written third principle which is Al also related to our second one is we simply shouldn't be surface readers but we must study God's word in its entirety amen if you Christ I just read a few portions here and there and then the Devil comes along and quotes a convenient a misquote in this era of disinformation and misinformation and all other manners of information apart from the truth we must be stud and we must be able to study and see the big picture we must study and see what the big the big picture our final Principle as I would like to end is in the third in the in the third Temptation and the Bible records and says in verse 8 again the devil takes him up into an exceedingly high mountain and shows him all the kingdoms of the world and the glory of them must be nice as I stand Here in My 30 something years of existence the Fest I have traveled is Uganda and even then I think I was taken by by the gospel I'm going to to do some some Evangelistic campaign in maker but many young people here and young people youthful at heart want to travel the world true or false you want to see the Eiffel Tower you want to see London ey you want to experience this world and and its things you know you want to post for us the kingdoms of this world and their glory on your WhatsApp status and on your Instagram you know you have a bucket list things that you want to do but lo and behold the reality of life or of where you come from is that these things cost money but Along Comes The Devil with a solution the Bible says the devil took him up into an exceedingly high mountain I don't know maybe he took him to Everest I don't know and in this mountain he gives him a panoramic view a panorama of the world and its and its cultures and its beauty to own everything not just to own a plot in Karen or in whatever up up up up market area every young person is is is is struggling to to to buy an apartment Bible says he puts him up there and he says in verse 9 all these things I will give you if you will fall down and do what and worship me if you will fall down and worship me principle number four which is related to our text is do not take shortcuts amen there are no shortcuts there are no shortcuts on the path to succeed to success there are no shortcuts to True success and I will tell you there are no shortcuts on the way to Heaven There Are No short shortcuts there is no connection even if your father is the high priest your father is the head Elder your father is this and that no we must put in the work amen we must bear the Yoke in our youth even if we have many desires even if we have many things that we want to to to do we want to experience we must do it the right way sister white writes in the book testimon to the church Volume 5 says the Pains of study and the pleasures of sin are the cords with which Satan binds men in his snares the Pains of Duty rather and the pleasures of sin we want we live in a microwave generation we want things to be very easy and convenient everything is is at the is accessible the power of our hands the pain of Duty we don't like work because we get tired and the pleasures of what and the pleasures of sin those who would rather die than form a wrong act than perform a wrong act are the only ones who will be found faithful those who say no to taking shortcuts those who say no to F and power those who say no in the history of Joseph and Joseph and Daniel and his fellows we see how the golden chain of Truth May bind the youth to the throne of God they could not be tempted to turn aside from their course of Integrity they valued the favor of God above the Praises of princes and God loved them and spread his shield over them because of their faithful Integrity because of their determination to honor God above every human power the Lord signally honored them before men they were honored by the Lord of hosts Whose power is over all the works of his hand in the heaven above and in the earth beneath these youth were not ashamed to display their true colors even in the court of the king in their words in their habits in their practices they confessed their faith in the Lord God Of Heaven they refused to bow to any Earthly mandate and be detracted from the honor of God they had strength from Heaven to confess their allegiance to God we must not take shortcuts as a young lady I remember I was once speaking to a young lady it's a sad story I met her during um during uh chaplaincy nice Adventist young girl last time I I checked in on her I met with her she was outside the church and in talking to her she told me through her cousin she was told if you are beautiful and you are poor it is your fault that beauty and poverty are mutually exclusive that the beautiful cannot be poor and all of us want wealth and some of us are willing to take shortcuts for it the Bible speaks Christ when Christ was writing Christ speaks to them when Judas was speaking about what Mary Magdalene had said and Mary Magdalene um had uh had poured that expensive oil and Judah says it could have been sold to feed the poor Christ said what the poor you will always have with you the problem we have as Christians is we don't marry the fact that the poor that Christ is referring to could be you and me that the poor will always have and so we want to do all manner of things even unethical things denying one another and as a result our communities suffer my brothers and my sisters we must not take any shortcuts we some one somebody said if the mountain was smooth nobody would be able to climb the difficulties and the challenges are there to mold our characters the difficulties and the challenges are there for my sake and for your sake my final point is if we are to change our communities let us dream Amen Let Us dream and hope let us dream and hope like Joseph who had a dream and he did wonderful things because of his dream i' like us to consider this text and it says from messages to Young People page 36 paragraph 1 it says Dear youth what is the aim and purpose of your life are you ambitious for Education that you may have a name and position in the world have you thoughts that you dare not express that you may one day stand upon the summit of intellectual greatness sometimes our friends laugh at us when we share our dreams like Joseph's brothers share shared laughed at him and even his parents at some point said hey this son of ours is is now gone beyond his brothers is now also saying that the Sun and the Moon did what bowed to him and they wonder do you have any of these things have you thoughts that you dare not express that you may one day stand upon the summit of intellectual greatness that you may sit in deliberative and legislative councils and help to enact laws for the nation there is nothing wrong with these aspirations you may you may everyone of you make your mark you should be you should be content with no mean attainments aim high and spare no pains to reach the standard amen but do not take any shortcuts do not take any shortcuts higher than the highest human thought can reach is God's ideal for his children godliness godlikeness is the goal to be reached before the student is opened a path of continual progress he has an object to achieve a standard to attain that includes everything good pure and Noble he will advance as fast and as far as possible in every branch of true knowledge but his efforts will be directed to objects as much higher and than mere selfish and temporal interests as the heavens are higher to the Earth so from from the book education aim high my brothers and my sisters aim to change our communities not simply for selfish interest I can tell you in my whatever I do for life I've interacted with people I once even interacted with a man who told me he's a billionaire and I checked it is true but if I consider my satisfaction with life I'm not very satisfied let me not lie to you but compared to this man who has a lot of wealth he was in divorce in court fighting divorces his children alienated from him but yet he was there advising me you know telling me to enjoy life but when I looked at his life he was sick he was a he was he was had all manner of things all manner of stresses even told me that he's enjoying life he told me he even has a young girlfriend now this man was in his 70s and his girlfriend was 23 even told me he's sure that his girlfriend is is is prettier than mine and even showed me and I told him yes it's true but I must say I don't have any but one thing this man affirmed in me is that money is important yes but money is not everything money is important yes but it is not what is not everything my brothers and my sisters let us aim high Amen Let Us aim to sort the problems of society to transform our communities to live a positive Mark let us dream like Martin Luther King dreamed of a time in which we will live in harmony and in unity let us dream as young people as a church we have a history sometimes of being plagued by tribalism by nepotism as a nation let us dream of a time when indeed my value to you is not simply pegged on what I do for a living on my paycheck my social economic status let us dream of a time in which men and women can see eye to eye kisses and LS Kiku and cenin let us have a dream and let us put in the work amen let us put in the work to be able to see this come to fruition it is possible many other things I would have told us but like Solomon to the writing of many books there is no end and this someon must needs come to an end I end it this way today as young people to ask young people and young people at at at heart do you have dreams do you have aspirations big be courageous of course there will be challenges there will be people who will Who who will Who will discourage you but press on press forward Lamentations 3 and: 27 it is good for a man for the Youth to do what to Bear the Yoke let's take the challenges that come in our lives let us embrace our identities in Christ and let us has put our full trust and faith in him we'll rise As we sing Our closing song give me the Bible give me the Bible after each then we will share together in a final prayer [Music] song number 272 give me the

TIMESTAMPED TRANSCRIPT:
[1.4s] uh my name is Ono uh now that we are
[4.1s] talking about names my name is onong
[7.5s] rafaam it's my pleasure and my privilege
[10.6s] to be able to Fellowship together with
[12.8s] you I'm a member of this church and um
[16.5s] I'm I'm I'm glad to be here
[18.7s] unfortunately my introduction ends
[21.5s] there I've not done much in
[24.8s] life apart from acquiring a few academic
[27.6s] certificates here and there but uh those
[30.4s] are not very important in in an occasion
[32.8s] such as this all right S I think then it
[37.0s] being the youth Sabbath we will all
[39.0s] become youth amen or youthful at heart
[42.6s] it is
[43.7s] 11:28 which is good time which is good
[46.2s] time I will not uh uh I don't want to
[49.1s] keep us any longer for that reason I
[51.6s] made some notes uh so that I'll be able
[55.0s] to time myself therefore have no fear if
[58.3s] you have met me somewhere else and I
[60.0s] preached for an hour I have changed okay
[64.2s] s s let's bow our heads let's Close Our
[66.6s] Eyes let's believe and
[69.6s] pray a kind and loving father and master
[72.9s] behold the time has come you've spoken
[75.6s] to us through the Children's Story
[77.1s] You've spoken to us through the songs
[78.5s] that have been sung and now dear Lord
[81.5s] arrest our consciences and take us to
[84.3s] the text help us to see you dear Lord
[87.9s] and speak to us in your word GL you say
[90.4s] that where two or three are gathered
[91.7s] together to seek after your face and to
[94.4s] seek after salvation that your very
[96.2s] presence will be in the midst of them
[98.2s] and in this place this day dear Lord are
[100.0s] gathered more than two or three dear
[102.8s] Lord we believe and we know that you are
[105.1s] here with us guide us through this
[107.0s] service is our prayer in Jesus name amen
[111.6s] amen our this being a youth Sabbath it
[116.0s] was material produced by the general
[118.8s] conference supposed to been a week
[121.3s] preceding uh this particular Sabbath but
[124.6s] the week will follow and uh the
[128.7s] overhanging theme the the theme that was
[132.5s] uh anchoring this whole week was
[136.2s] communities doing what being transformed
[139.8s] communities being transformed so what
[142.8s] exactly is a community what exactly is a
[146.0s] community why and why does it require to
[148.6s] be transformed the word Community comes
[151.0s] from the Latin word communist which
[153.2s] simply means to common or public and
[156.8s] shared by all when we're talking about a
[160.2s] community in this particular context
[162.4s] it's a group of people living in the
[164.4s] same place or having a shared
[167.0s] characteristic sometimes uh some say it
[170.3s] has it connotes a sense of Fellowship a
[173.4s] network of support where people help and
[176.7s] interact with each other the dictionary
[179.5s] the m Webster dictionary says it is a
[181.4s] unified body of individuals when you're
[183.6s] talking about a community people with
[185.8s] common interests living in a particular
[188.0s] area and therefore we have various types
[191.3s] of communities a community could be
[193.6s] geographical a community could be tribal
[196.3s] a community could be spiritual and
[198.8s] therefore when we are talking about
[201.1s] communities being transformed we are
[203.2s] talking about people being transformed
[206.2s] we're talking about individuals networks
[209.6s] being being transformed but then the
[212.1s] question we must ask ourselves is if a
[215.2s] community is a group of people who share
[217.5s] a common interests values location
[220.7s] culture or purpose therefore Community
[225.0s] is based on relationships geography and
[227.7s] shared identity but why do communities
[231.4s] need to be
[232.4s] transformed the Bible speaks to us that
[235.2s] since the fall in Genesis chapter
[238.7s] 3 When sin entered into our world there
[241.9s] was the need for communities to be
[243.9s] transformed there was the need for
[246.4s] changes to happen because what happened
[249.0s] one at the fall we are told there was a
[252.3s] spiritual separation between man and God
[255.2s] and therefore that communion between man
[258.0s] and God that was there in the Garden of
[260.1s] Eden was changed that that that
[263.3s] dichotomy was broken that Union between
[266.1s] God and man and as a result Isaiah
[268.7s] speaking to us say says in Isaiah 59 and
[271.1s] ver2 that our iniquities have separated
[274.2s] us from God and our sins have hidden his
[278.0s] face Paul writing in Ephesians says as
[281.4s] for you as for us rather we who were
[285.0s] dead in our transgressions and our sins
[287.9s] it tells us that communities have
[290.4s] aspects of separation from God another
[293.6s] aspect uh some of the reasons and
[295.8s] challenges by for which communities need
[298.2s] to be transformed is the very reality of
[302.2s] death and Decay Genesis 2 and ver1 17
[305.2s] says the command was given in the day
[308.2s] that they would eat of that tree for a
[310.6s] fact they would die but Grace intervenes
[313.7s] but nonetheless as a result of of of sin
[316.8s] in our lives then we have suffering we
[319.0s] have pain humans have become mortal
[321.8s] subject to aging to disease and to
[324.4s] eventual death death and decay in
[327.0s] everything and in all places that we see
[331.1s] Romans simply says it 5 and verse2 Paul
[334.4s] says therefore just as Sin entered into
[337.3s] the wild through one man and death
[339.3s] through sin and in this way death came
[342.1s] to all people because all have sinned
[344.8s] and fallen short of the glory of God for
[347.8s] this reason then communities require to
[350.6s] be transformed we have broken
[352.8s] relationships one of the first things
[354.7s] that
[355.7s] happened uh When sin came we see Adam
[358.8s] and Eve blaming one another we see
[362.0s] things happening Genesis
[364.7s] 3:15 Adam says this woman whom you put
[368.0s] to here with me she gave me this fruit
[370.6s] to eat we see marriages and families
[374.0s] communities experiencing strife and
[377.0s] Brokenness selfishness jealousy and
[379.6s] pride all of these are aspects that need
[383.2s] to be addressed in our community for our
[386.0s] communities to truly be transformed
[388.6s] broken relationship amongst ourselves
[390.9s] and with others James 4: 1-2 says what
[395.1s] causes fights what causes quarrels among
[397.2s] you don't they come from your desires
[399.7s] that battle within
[402.9s] you father Mo we are told that the
[405.7s] ground itself was cast and the
[408.1s] environment itself shares in the impact
[411.1s] of the Fall Genesis 3:1 17 to9 God
[415.3s] castes the ground and he says cast is
[417.7s] the ground because of you through pain
[419.7s] ful toil you will eat food of it from it
[423.6s] in the all the days of your lives later
[425.9s] on Paul himself writing in Romans
[428.9s] chapter 5 and uh Romans chapter 8 says
[431.2s] all creation waiting groans for the
[434.8s] revelation of the children of God even
[438.1s] creation itself our world in itself is
[441.7s] suffering because of that separation
[444.7s] that breach in the communion with
[448.5s] God we see as a result of sin there is a
[454.7s] distortion of identity and purpose sin
[458.4s] has not only distorted nature itself but
[461.0s] even
[462.2s] man his identity of him his
[464.6s] understanding of of himself his purpose
[466.5s] and even his
[468.1s] calling in Genesis 3 and:
[471.4s] 7 we we are told that the eyes of both
[475.0s] of them after they had eaten after Adam
[476.9s] had eaten that uh forbidden fruit
[480.0s] they were was open and they realized
[481.8s] that they were naked and as a result of
[484.8s] that they tried to se fig leaves
[487.5s] together and make coverings for
[489.0s] themselves they try to to to patch up to
[492.0s] to to to sort of clothe themselves to
[495.3s] understand themselves a bit
[497.5s] better but lo and
[499.6s] behold since then men and women have
[503.0s] been struggling with shame with
[505.0s] insecurity with
[506.8s] confusion even about their self one
[510.6s] in that we require a lot of
[514.2s] transformation there's a lot of evil and
[516.2s] suffering there are lot of many things
[518.0s] there are many things that indeed are
[521.4s] required of us since the fall in which
[525.1s] aspects in which our world has suffered
[527.2s] since the fall but then we look at
[530.4s] ourselves as
[532.2s] Africans what are some of the challenges
[534.4s] closer Home to the African context and
[538.0s] even by extension it being a youth
[540.0s] Sabbath what are some of the challenges
[542.3s] that we as youth because we are all
[544.2s] youthful today face one we have the
[547.9s] reality of poverty and economic
[550.6s] inequality many African nations and well
[553.8s] and indeed even our nation and even
[556.3s] young people struggle with extreme
[558.0s] poverty unemployment as well as
[561.3s] inequalities even in income amongst
[563.6s] genders and even amongst
[566.4s] races corruption poor governance and of
[569.8s] in infrastructure and many other reasons
[572.5s] that we come up as to why our
[575.6s] communities are suffering and have need
[578.8s] for
[580.2s] transformation there's conflicts and
[582.2s] political instability creating an
[584.4s] environment that is has a lot of tension
[587.7s] you
[588.6s] know and power struggles and a lack of
[592.1s] reconciliation and F fuel ongoing
[595.0s] violence we have differences in access
[598.4s] to Quality education
[599.9s] as well as healthare all of these are
[602.3s] challenges that are present and
[603.8s] prevalent in the communities from which
[606.4s] we hail and in which we exist and live
[610.3s] indeed environmental challenges as well
[613.1s] as climate change are realities diseases
[616.4s] such as HIV and AIDS and uh recently
[619.4s] other non-communicable illnesses are on
[622.2s] the rise in our society and in our
[624.8s] communities and this particular Sabbath
[627.7s] we are saying and we are speaking that
[629.8s] indeed we must change our communities
[633.0s] that communities require changing youth
[637.2s] unemployment and an oranization a large
[640.7s] percentage of uh young people are of the
[644.8s] population is is youthful but the job
[647.4s] opportunities are
[649.6s] scar many other issues food insecurity
[652.4s] and hunger we could talk about substance
[654.2s] abuse and addiction plaguing both young
[657.4s] and old alike alcoholic ISM and
[660.1s] addiction are growing problems not only
[663.0s] uh in the west but also in Africa young
[665.5s] people who are idle with inadequate
[667.8s] resources choosing to drown their
[669.4s] sorrows so to
[672.8s] say the many
[676.0s] issues many challenges to the young
[679.7s] person existing today all of these
[682.4s] issues we must face but today we are
[685.0s] saying that communities must be
[688.1s] transformed Comm communities transformed
[691.4s] how then shall we be able to transform
[693.4s] our communities we look at some examples
[695.6s] in the Bible of men and women who are
[697.7s] able to transform their communities we
[699.8s] find one man to consider is Moses he
[703.8s] liberated the Jews from slavery in Egypt
[706.3s] and he establishes he leads them up to
[708.7s] the border of the promised land and and
[712.0s] gives them delivers to them a
[713.8s] Constitution which is the which is The
[715.6s] Ten Commandments and and gives the
[717.2s] children of Israel structure and praise
[719.3s] presence and a sense of nationhood and
[721.7s] identity amongst the heathan Nations
[725.1s] Moses was a man who did not shine these
[729.3s] responsibilities in Paul writing about
[731.6s] Moses in Hebrews chapter 11 in that role
[734.5s] of men and women who by faith did
[737.1s] wonderful wonderful things says
[740.0s] Moses did not consider the Privileges of
[744.0s] being known as Pharaoh's son the
[746.5s] Privileges of being the next in line in
[750.5s] Egypt as something to be compared as
[753.9s] opposed to the suffering together with
[755.7s] the children of God Moses was a man who
[760.1s] transformed his
[761.6s] community we have an example of another
[764.4s] lady for those of us who uh like gender
[768.2s] balance
[769.8s] Esther Esther comes into play at a time
[774.5s] when the children of Israel as a nation
[776.6s] are are are surrounded by their enemy
[779.2s] enemies and their enemies have plotted
[781.6s] to destroy them Esther goes and wins
[785.3s] favor before the king and as a result
[788.0s] this young lady saves the Jews from
[790.6s] genocide under Persian rule she risked
[794.6s] her own life approaching the king to
[797.3s] reveal hammon's plot she advocated for
[800.4s] justice and secured protection for her
[802.8s] people she transformed her community
[806.4s] when it needed her
[809.5s] we have Nehemiah after the children of
[811.8s] Israel are recovering from Babylonian
[813.7s] captivity and now they're going back to
[817.2s] rebuild their Nation Nehemiah leading as
[821.1s] a leader helps to organize to rebuild
[824.2s] the walls of Jerusalem and to restore
[826.2s] the community not only physically but
[828.6s] Also spiritually he addressed social
[831.3s] injustices such as death and slavery and
[834.7s] exploitation in nemiah chapter 5 in
[837.1s] nemiah chapter 2-6 he he motivate he
[840.2s] organizes the people and he motivates
[842.3s] the people to rebuild the city walls
[845.3s] despite opposition both within and
[850.2s] without but then the question is can the
[854.3s] Youth of today rebuild our communities
[858.0s] can the Youth of today transform our
[860.5s] communities are they equal and up to the
[863.1s] task Proverbs 20 and verse 29 says the
[866.1s] glory of young men is their strength and
[868.7s] the beauty of old men is their gray head
[872.6s] that indeed to transform our communities
[875.2s] requires
[876.4s] collaboration that if we compare the
[879.2s] Vigor and the strength of Youth with the
[882.8s] resources and the wisdom of the Aged
[886.1s] indeed we can transform our communities
[889.7s] amen Ecclesiastes 12 and verse1 Solomon
[893.8s] writing to the youth today says that we
[896.6s] should remember our creator in in the
[899.3s] days of our youth before the days of
[902.2s] trouble
[903.4s] come Paul in encouraging this young man
[907.5s] Timothy in 1 Timothy 4:12 speaks to
[910.1s] Timothy and tells him let no man despise
[913.6s] what despise your youth but be an
[916.4s] example to the Believers in word in
[919.6s] conduct in love in spirit in faith and
[922.6s] in Purity that as young people yes we
[926.3s] can transform our communities yes we
[929.5s] have the strength we have the
[931.4s] capabilities to transform our
[935.4s] communities now to our scripture reading
[938.8s] the book of Lamentations CH 3 and: 27 it
[942.2s] calls calls to us as young people if we
[945.1s] are truly to transform our communities
[947.5s] that then Jeremiah writes and says it is
[951.4s] good for a man where a man here is
[953.6s] generic for a human being whether male
[955.9s] or female it is good for a man that he
[959.4s] bear the Yoke in his youth it is good
[963.5s] for a man that he bear the Yoke in his
[966.1s] youth that is from the King James
[967.4s] version The New International Version
[969.4s] says it is good for man to Bear the Yoke
[971.9s] while he is Young the New Living
[974.7s] Translation says it is good for people
[977.3s] to submit at an early age to the Yoke of
[981.5s] discipline The Message Bible simply says
[984.7s] it is a good thing when you are young to
[987.9s] stick it out
[989.8s] through the hard
[991.7s] times young people must be able to
[995.3s] appreciate the challenges of society and
[997.9s] look for solutions for these challenges
[1001.0s] we must be involved amen for us to
[1004.6s] transform our
[1006.4s] communities we must face these
[1008.7s] challenges because they are the
[1010.5s] realities in which we exist and the
[1013.3s] Bible is replete with examples of young
[1016.0s] people who have equally contributed to
[1019.0s] their communities I would like us to
[1020.9s] consider a
[1022.1s] few in the the book of First Kings
[1025.2s] chapter 2 Kings rather 2 Kings 11: 27 we
[1029.3s] hear of a king know known as Who joash
[1032.6s] and the Bible records that joash started
[1034.5s] leading Israel not even his home he
[1038.2s] started leading Israel as a King when he
[1040.2s] was how old 7 years old it is possible
[1044.2s] my brothers and my sisters that as youth
[1048.2s] when we talking about communities we
[1050.5s] must know that we belong to these
[1053.1s] communities
[1054.3s] amen we belong we are part and parcel
[1057.5s] when Society has got problems we are
[1059.8s] part and parcel of finding the solutions
[1062.8s] to this to this to this uh to this
[1064.9s] problem and it's not simply the issues
[1068.0s] of the old and the Aged but we must
[1070.8s] participate we see joash at 7 years old
[1074.4s] rising and taking up uh responsibility
[1077.2s] as a king in Israel we have Josiah at 8
[1081.0s] years old in 2 Kings 22 and verse1
[1083.6s] equally at 8 years old he begins to
[1085.8s] reign in
[1086.9s] Israel we have Manassa in 2 Kings
[1089.8s] chapter 21 and verse1 begins becomes
[1092.9s] king in Israel at 12 years of age we
[1095.8s] have King jein at 18 years of age he is
[1099.7s] able to lead the children of
[1102.1s] Israel we have King ahaz at 20 years of
[1105.6s] age in 2 Kings 16 and verse 2 ah has his
[1109.8s] 20 when he begins to lead the nation of
[1112.9s] Israel a nation under God we have eah 25
[1118.2s] years old 2 Kings chapter 18 and verse 2
[1121.9s] these were men who led from youth king
[1127.8s] amaziah 25 years old 2 Kings 14 and ver2
[1131.6s] King jeos at 25 years old also at 2
[1134.3s] Kings 13 and: 10 King Uzziah or aarah
[1138.8s] some know him at 16 years of age he
[1141.2s] begins to rule and to reign in Israel
[1145.4s] and many examples Solomon himself when
[1147.4s] he was around 20 years of age comes into
[1150.2s] power and so it goes to shows us that
[1153.6s] indeed God uses young people to lead
[1156.5s] amen God uses young people to lead and
[1160.0s] faithfulness to God is the only thing
[1162.9s] that is required for us to be successful
[1165.5s] and sometimes we say that wisdom comes
[1168.5s] with
[1169.2s] age but I'd like to tell us today
[1171.7s] sometimes age comes
[1174.9s] alone just because you have a few white
[1177.6s] hairs on your head does not mean that
[1179.0s] you are
[1180.0s] wise sometimes wisdom is not the
[1186.1s] exclusive habitation does not simply
[1188.4s] live among those who are old but even
[1190.7s] the young can be old amen the young
[1193.3s] rather can be wise wisdom matters more
[1197.0s] than age as young people we can
[1201.0s] transform our communities
[1202.7s] amen we can transform our communities
[1206.7s] but the Bible says we can only do this
[1209.7s] if we do what we bear the Yoke in our
[1213.5s] youth if we put in the work if we put in
[1217.8s] the
[1220.5s] work sister white writes in the book
[1222.7s] messages to Young People page 16
[1225.8s] paragraph 1 she says the youth need need
[1228.8s] to keep ever before them the course that
[1231.7s] Christ followed that Christ is our
[1234.6s] example at every step it was a course of
[1238.6s] overcoming Christ did not come to the
[1240.6s] Earth as a king to rule the Nations he
[1243.0s] came as a humble man to be tempted to
[1246.2s] overcome temptation to follow on as we
[1249.8s] must to know the Lord in the study of
[1252.8s] his life we shall learn how much God
[1255.7s] through him will do for his children
[1259.4s] and as and as we shall learn that
[1262.0s] however great our trials may be they
[1265.2s] cannot exceed that which Christ endured
[1268.1s] that we might know the way the truth and
[1270.5s] the life
[1271.6s] amen by a life of Conformity to his
[1274.5s] example we are to show our appreciation
[1277.9s] of his sacrifice on our
[1281.0s] behalf we are called to consider the
[1285.0s] example of Christ to consider the trials
[1288.4s] of of Christ to consider his life and
[1291.0s] how he B he bore the Yoke in his Youth
[1295.2s] Christ in the Book of Matthew chapter 4
[1298.6s] where I would like us to domicile
[1300.3s] ourselves as we look to bring this
[1303.0s] message to an end very
[1305.6s] soon we see Christ at the age of 30
[1308.6s] years he has been baptized and something
[1312.6s] happens which has has never happened
[1315.3s] when did not happen when I was baptized
[1317.4s] the heavens opened up
[1319.3s] and the Holy Spirit did what descended
[1321.4s] as a dve and God himself spoke and said
[1323.6s] what this is my son do what listen to
[1328.3s] him interesting that never happened when
[1330.6s] I was baptized I don't know about your
[1332.8s] experience but then the next thing that
[1335.0s] happens in The Book of Matthew chapter 4
[1337.2s] is significant and the Bible records
[1339.9s] that Christ was taken by the Holy Spirit
[1344.2s] Matthew 4:1 it says then Jesus was led
[1347.4s] up of the Holy Spirit Spirit where Into
[1349.9s] the Wilderness to be tempted of the
[1353.1s] devil that's interesting immediately
[1356.2s] after your
[1358.6s] baptism you are LED into temptation to
[1361.6s] be tempted by the devil and it is
[1364.0s] significant that the Bible says he
[1365.6s] wasn't led by
[1367.6s] Friends by bad Friends by Bad Company
[1370.5s] but he was led by who by the spirit of
[1374.6s] God sometimes God leads us as young
[1378.0s] people
[1379.1s] through difficult Parts but then we must
[1382.4s] bear the Yoke in our youth amen the
[1385.6s] trial and tribulation does not mean that
[1387.9s] God is not with us that difficulties on
[1390.7s] our Pathways as we are making our our a
[1393.7s] place and our presence felt here on
[1395.5s] Earth does not mean that God is not with
[1397.8s] us but rather it seems it means that God
[1401.0s] has seen something precious in US amen
[1403.6s] it means sometimes that indeed God is
[1405.3s] holding your hand and he's got a purpose
[1407.4s] and a plan for your life
[1409.1s] Christ is Led at 30 years into the
[1411.3s] Wilderness to be tempted by the
[1414.4s] devil and see what is the first
[1417.6s] Temptation that Christ is given the
[1420.3s] Bible records the setting of these
[1422.5s] Temptations in verse two says and when
[1424.8s] he had fasted for 40 days and 40 nights
[1426.9s] he was afterwards what
[1429.0s] hungry I've tried fasting I can tell you
[1432.7s] I am not very good at
[1434.9s] it I don't know for many of you
[1437.6s] sometimes they say I don't know the
[1438.7s] first Sabbath of every quarter is prayer
[1441.0s] and fasting but most of you eat very
[1443.5s] well at home and then you come here and
[1445.6s] you pretend like you're fasting and you
[1447.1s] are part of the of the prayer program
[1449.6s] during lunch
[1450.8s] hour but the Bible records that Christ
[1453.2s] did what fasted for 40 days and for 40
[1456.4s] nights and then after that that's when
[1458.7s] the devil
[1459.8s] appears sometimes after you have had
[1463.0s] difficulty for long and and you are you
[1466.2s] you you are exhausted both spiritually
[1468.2s] and physically sometimes that's when the
[1470.1s] devil now shows up and tells you that
[1472.7s] was just the rehearsal this is the real
[1476.2s] thing the Bible comes and the Bible say
[1479.2s] says in verse three and when the tempter
[1481.1s] came to him he said if thou be the son
[1484.7s] of who of God command that these Stones
[1487.8s] be made into what into bread if thou be
[1491.8s] the Son of God the first principle that
[1495.0s] we
[1495.9s] must uh embrace if we are to truly
[1499.4s] transform our communities is that we
[1501.7s] must know who we
[1503.7s] are identity is key and is important who
[1509.0s] are you know yourself outside of your
[1513.5s] job after you have retired do you
[1516.4s] decrease then if youve been defined by
[1518.5s] being a doctor or by being an engineer
[1521.4s] when you have retired or when
[1523.7s] engineering changes because knowledge
[1525.7s] changes you know your first sergeant
[1528.4s] were barers but nowadays Barbers are not
[1533.5s] Sergeant things change so who are you
[1537.3s] are you defined by your accomplishments
[1540.6s] or do you truly are you truly in touch
[1543.8s] with who you are and it is important
[1547.6s] when the devil come came to Christ he
[1549.8s] says if you are the Son of
[1553.0s] God identity is important we must find
[1557.1s] ourselves we must
[1558.8s] know who we are and ultimately whose we
[1561.9s] are our identity is linked with our
[1564.8s] purpose our identity is linked with even
[1567.3s] the way we live our lives our Outlook
[1569.2s] our worldview our approach to problems
[1572.6s] is is is pegged upon whom we have
[1576.2s] believed we
[1578.5s] are we deviate from the story briefly to
[1581.7s] consider the book of Acts chapter 19 and
[1583.6s] verse 13 and the Bible tells a
[1587.0s] story and and it says then certain
[1589.9s] Vagabond Jews exorcists took upon them
[1592.8s] to call over them that had evil spirits
[1595.0s] the name of the Lord who Jesus saying we
[1598.8s] are Jew You by Jesus whom Paul does what
[1603.1s] whom Paul preaches and we told who are
[1606.2s] these men and these were seven sons of
[1608.7s] onekea a Jew and a chief of the priests
[1612.7s] which did so these were the
[1616.5s] children it was today would say they
[1618.5s] were the children of the
[1620.4s] pastor the children of the president of
[1622.9s] the General Conference you know the
[1625.4s] children of the highest office in the
[1626.8s] land Children of the chief of priests
[1630.4s] and they had seen Paul when he was when
[1632.9s] he was he healing those who are sick and
[1635.7s] healing those who were were were
[1637.4s] possessed that they thought this thing
[1640.0s] had a formula there was some science to
[1641.4s] Salvation you know and to deliverance
[1644.2s] and so they said we saw Paul put his
[1646.4s] hands on these people and then he would
[1648.0s] say say in the name of Jesus and so just
[1651.4s] to be sure they said Jesus whom Paul
[1654.9s] preaches so that the evil spirits can
[1657.2s] know for a fact whom they were talking
[1658.8s] about but the Bible continues and says
[1661.7s] but the evil spirit answered and said
[1663.5s] what Jesus I know Paul I know but who
[1668.2s] are
[1669.2s] you it tells us as young people your
[1672.0s] father could be the first Elder could be
[1674.0s] the head Deacon but that's not who you
[1676.4s] are
[1678.3s] Jesus we know the devil say Paul we know
[1682.7s] but who are
[1684.4s] you as young people if we are to
[1687.5s] transform our communities we must be
[1690.0s] clear as to who we are amen we must be
[1694.5s] clear as to who we are and whom whose we
[1697.9s] are that story does not end very well
[1700.0s] for those seven men those seven boys
[1703.4s] Children of The Preacher Man Children of
[1706.1s] the Elder we told that the evil spirits
[1709.4s] leaped on them and overcame them one mad
[1713.0s] man overcame seven sons of a of a of of
[1717.0s] a holy
[1718.4s] man the Bible says he prevailed against
[1721.4s] them so that they fled out of that house
[1723.5s] naked and
[1726.0s] wounded if we do not know our identities
[1728.8s] my brothers and my sisters out here we
[1731.8s] will equally be assaulted by the world
[1736.9s] and it will leave us naked and wounded
[1740.1s] so who are we who are
[1742.8s] we John writes in John 1 and: 12 he says
[1747.3s] but to all who did receive him who
[1749.6s] believed in his name he gave the right
[1751.9s] to be called children of God
[1754.6s] Amen Romans writes and says Paul writes
[1757.8s] in Romans 8:1 16 and verse1 17 it says
[1760.8s] the spirit himself Bears witness with
[1762.6s] our spirit that we are the children of
[1764.9s] God Amen the spirit of God himself Bears
[1769.2s] witness you know it's not it's not a
[1771.0s] title that you've put upon yourself but
[1773.0s] even the Holy Spirit Bears witness that
[1776.3s] we are the children of God and if then
[1779.6s] we are the children of God then we are
[1781.5s] hes and Joint HS together with Christ
[1787.5s] amen Matthew 6 and ver9 when Christ was
[1791.4s] teaching his disciples when they came to
[1793.0s] him and told him teacher Master teach us
[1795.7s] how to pray Christ tells them when you
[1798.4s] come to pray pray how pray like this say
[1801.6s] w Our Father Who Art in Heaven amen it
[1806.5s] doesn't matter who your Earthly father
[1808.9s] is here on Earth it doesn't matter what
[1810.9s] your background is here on Earth what is
[1813.4s] important is have you accepted Christ in
[1816.9s] your life have you embraced the new
[1821.0s] birth have you been born
[1824.5s] again I remember friend of mine in was
[1828.3s] telling me a story that happened in his
[1829.7s] high school there was a new teacher who
[1832.4s] was
[1833.1s] hired and this new
[1835.5s] teacher loved this was uh in 844 when
[1840.4s] children are being canned I know many of
[1842.4s] us here have been canned but these days
[1844.8s] we are talking to our children you know
[1847.2s] and negotiating with them but the way we
[1849.7s] were brought up the the Ken reigned
[1852.7s] Supreme uh where iniquity abounded the
[1856.3s] can much more abound
[1859.4s] but these days were in the dispensation
[1860.8s] of
[1863.0s] Grace but this
[1865.5s] teacher decided to punish some children
[1870.1s] for whatever iniquity that they had
[1871.7s] committed and so he hits some some some
[1875.2s] child there and then The Story Goes the
[1878.5s] next
[1880.2s] day at around break time
[1884.2s] suddenly the gates of the school were
[1886.3s] flung open and and Land Rovers one after
[1889.2s] the other drove into the school
[1891.9s] compound and lo and
[1894.3s] behold the child that this new teacher
[1896.7s] had had hit was a child of some some big
[1900.0s] man in government told I don't know some
[1902.3s] some some man in the military and he
[1905.0s] came to find out who touched his son and
[1908.0s] of course conveniently the teacher went
[1911.3s] missing and the principal had to
[1913.6s] intervene and after everything had come
[1916.0s] down the principal went to the teacher
[1918.0s] and told him next time before you hit a
[1921.1s] child make sure you ask him who his
[1923.6s] father
[1925.0s] is my brothers and my sisters behold
[1927.9s] what manner of love the father has
[1929.9s] bestowed upon us that we should be
[1932.0s] called the Sons and Daughters of God
[1934.5s] Amen we must know who we are and if we
[1938.6s] are children of God then we are HS and
[1941.2s] coair together with
[1944.7s] Christ
[1946.4s] we must
[1948.7s] divide ourselves from that thinking
[1952.2s] sometimes as young people we carry scars
[1955.5s] and Bens of where we've come from you
[1958.3s] know your excuse as to why you've not
[1960.9s] made it in life is because your father
[1963.4s] didn't make it in
[1964.8s] life that when other people's fathers
[1967.2s] were stealing land or working hard
[1969.6s] whatever it is how they got they got
[1971.6s] their wealth your father was somewhere
[1973.6s] Idol you know and therefore you don't
[1976.5s] have generational wealth
[1979.1s] indeed it is a saying that was common
[1980.8s] even in Israel in Ezekiel chapter 18 and
[1984.0s] verse2 God asks this question what mean
[1987.0s] ye when you say this proverb concerning
[1988.9s] the land of Israel saying the fathers
[1990.8s] have eaten sour graps and it is the
[1992.6s] children's teeth that are set what on
[1995.7s] edge same is echoed in Jeremiah 31:29
[1999.7s] that in those days they shall say no
[2001.3s] more the fathers have eaten a sour grap
[2003.3s] and the children's teeth are set on
[2006.0s] edge when we accept AC Christ it doesn't
[2009.2s] matter who your father was it doesn't
[2011.1s] matter what your father has done we
[2013.4s] become sons and children of God Amen
[2016.6s] Sons and Daughters of God and you do not
[2018.8s] need to carry the the burden of your
[2020.8s] background but with new Vitality with
[2025.4s] new uh conviction we can set forth to
[2029.2s] conquer the day and its activities we
[2031.4s] can set forth to change our communities
[2034.6s] amen
[2037.8s] we must identify who we are we must
[2042.2s] identify who we are we go back to our
[2044.7s] text as we look to learn this
[2047.6s] plane Bible records and says the Devils
[2051.0s] asks Christ in verse three if thou be
[2053.2s] the Son of God command that these Stones
[2054.9s] be made what into bread verse four but
[2058.1s] Christ answers and says it is what
[2061.5s] written it is
[2064.0s] written principle number two that we
[2066.6s] must follow if if we are to transform
[2069.2s] our communities my brothers and my
[2071.4s] sisters we must be readers amen we must
[2075.8s] read go on are the days when they would
[2078.3s] say that if you want to keep something
[2080.6s] from an African do what put it in a book
[2084.1s] it shouldn't be said so in this day and
[2087.0s] age I know the the conveners of CBC are
[2091.3s] removing mathematics from the syab from
[2093.5s] being compulsory I don't know what will
[2095.3s] happen but nonetheless we must read
[2097.3s] Beyond own curriculums amen it is a sad
[2101.2s] thing that many of us don't read as
[2103.1s] young people because of our experiences
[2105.5s] in school because we were forced to read
[2109.1s] the same way I don't like bread because
[2111.3s] bread reminds me of of hard times I had
[2114.1s] in boarding school they used to give us
[2116.1s] three slices and we were very hungry
[2118.0s] every time I see bread I have some
[2121.3s] PTSD for that reason I don't like bread
[2124.7s] now that I can afford many loaves
[2128.8s] but my brothers and my sisters if we are
[2131.5s] to transform our communities we must be
[2133.8s] readers
[2134.8s] amen those who read are those who will
[2138.6s] lead only those who read are those who
[2141.9s] we
[2143.4s] lead if the youth would but make time if
[2147.7s] the youth would but make the Bible their
[2149.9s] study would but calm their impetuous
[2153.3s] desires and listen to the voice of their
[2155.5s] creator and their redeemer they would
[2157.6s] would not only be at peace with God but
[2159.7s] would find themselves en nobl and
[2163.0s] elevated it will be for your Eternal
[2165.4s] interest my young friend to give heed to
[2167.6s] the instructions of the word of God for
[2170.0s] they are inestimable they are of
[2172.0s] inestimable importance to you messages
[2175.5s] to Young People page 21 paragraph 1 if
[2179.9s] Christ had not read his Bible and the
[2183.6s] devil came to
[2186.0s] him perhaps he would have Fallen but
[2189.1s] Christ answers the devil and says what
[2191.0s] it is what it is written you can only
[2193.2s] know it is written if you have read
[2196.1s] it we must have a culture of reading not
[2202.2s] only reading frivolous novels and soas
[2206.4s] and and and and and and and and fiction
[2209.2s] but even involve ourselves in Reading
[2212.0s] nonfiction read science understand how
[2214.8s] our world works and operates understands
[2217.3s] the of economy the rules of demand and
[2219.8s] Supply we must read if we are to
[2223.2s] transform our communities
[2225.3s] amen we must be readers the second
[2228.6s] command the second Temptation comes and
[2230.8s] the Bible records um in verse 5 it says
[2234.4s] then the devil took him
[2237.0s] up into the holy city and set him on a
[2242.0s] pinnacle of the temple and the Bible
[2244.5s] records it's
[2246.5s] interesting that the Holy Spirit took
[2249.4s] Christ to the Wilderness to be
[2251.3s] tempted but lo and behold the devil
[2254.0s] takes Christ to
[2256.1s] church it's
[2258.5s] interesting that the Holy Spirit can
[2260.6s] take you to the Wilderness but the devil
[2262.4s] can bring you to
[2263.9s] church young people we must be awake and
[2267.9s] all of us that not everybody who is in
[2270.6s] church has been brought by God Amen not
[2273.9s] everybody who is sitting in our midst is
[2276.2s] here for the right purpose es singing
[2278.4s] the songs of
[2281.0s] Zion the Bible says the devil took him
[2284.3s] into the holy
[2285.6s] city and the Bible says continues it
[2288.6s] just didn't take him and put him and
[2290.1s] make him a backbencher no he put him
[2292.8s] where to The Pinacle of the temple at
[2296.6s] the very
[2300.0s] front therefore when we come to this
[2304.2s] house that is called the house of prayer
[2305.8s] this house of God and perhaps you are
[2308.6s] assailed by somebody somebody talks
[2311.3s] badly to you somebody gossips about you
[2313.7s] somebody cors you some church members a
[2315.6s] COR men you must be
[2318.0s] aware something can happen to
[2321.6s] you it's nothing new my brothers and
[2324.2s] sisters amen don't rush out of the
[2326.6s] church because you real you found
[2329.3s] strange men don't rush out of the church
[2332.2s] because you found strange
[2334.6s] ladies stay in the church the Bible
[2337.6s] records the Devil Himself quoted
[2339.4s] scripture in verse 6 it says to him if
[2341.8s] thou be the Son of God cast thyself down
[2344.2s] for it is written he quotes the Psalms
[2347.8s] there but then the Bible tells us how
[2351.2s] did Christ answer Christ answers and
[2354.6s] says again to him it is what it is
[2360.0s] written third principle which is Al also
[2363.5s] related to our second one is we simply
[2366.9s] shouldn't be surface readers but we must
[2369.3s] study God's word in its entirety
[2372.6s] amen if you Christ I just read a few
[2375.5s] portions here and there and then the
[2377.0s] Devil comes along and quotes a
[2379.4s] convenient a misquote in this era of
[2382.4s] disinformation and misinformation and
[2384.7s] all other manners of information apart
[2387.0s] from the
[2388.4s] truth we must be
[2391.8s] stud and we must be able to study and
[2395.2s] see the big picture we must study and
[2398.0s] see what the big the big picture our
[2401.7s] final Principle as I would like to end
[2404.9s] is in the third in the in the third
[2408.0s] Temptation and the Bible records and
[2409.9s] says in verse 8 again the devil takes
[2413.4s] him up into an exceedingly high mountain
[2416.8s] and shows him all the kingdoms of the
[2418.7s] world and the glory of them must be
[2423.7s] nice as I stand Here in My 30 something
[2426.9s] years of
[2427.8s] existence the Fest I have traveled is
[2432.2s] Uganda and even then I think I was taken
[2434.8s] by by the gospel I'm going to to do some
[2437.6s] some Evangelistic campaign in
[2441.1s] maker but many young people here and
[2444.0s] young people youthful at heart want to
[2445.8s] travel the world true or false you want
[2448.2s] to see the Eiffel Tower you want to see
[2450.8s] London ey you want to experience this
[2453.5s] world and and its things you know you
[2455.8s] want to post for us the kingdoms of this
[2458.5s] world and their glory on your WhatsApp
[2460.2s] status and on your Instagram you
[2462.9s] know you have a bucket list things that
[2465.5s] you want to do but lo and behold the
[2467.7s] reality of life or of where you come
[2469.9s] from is that these things cost
[2474.0s] money but Along Comes The Devil with a
[2478.2s] solution the Bible says the devil took
[2481.4s] him up into an exceedingly high mountain
[2483.3s] I don't know maybe he took him to
[2484.5s] Everest I don't know
[2488.6s] and in this mountain he gives him a
[2490.3s] panoramic view a panorama of the world
[2494.0s] and its and its cultures and its beauty
[2496.8s] to own everything not just to own a plot
[2500.2s] in Karen or in whatever up up up up
[2503.7s] market area every young person is is is
[2506.3s] is struggling to to to buy an apartment
[2509.8s] Bible
[2511.1s] says he puts him up there and he says in
[2515.1s] verse 9 all these things I will give you
[2518.9s] if you will fall down and do what and
[2521.3s] worship me if you will fall down and
[2524.8s] worship
[2527.0s] me principle number four which is
[2530.4s] related to our text
[2532.6s] is do not take shortcuts amen there are
[2536.8s] no
[2538.1s] shortcuts there are no shortcuts on the
[2540.3s] path to succeed to success there are no
[2542.8s] shortcuts to True success and I will
[2545.5s] tell you there are no shortcuts on the
[2547.4s] way to
[2548.9s] Heaven There Are No short shortcuts
[2551.4s] there is no connection even if your
[2553.4s] father is the high priest your father is
[2555.5s] the head Elder your father is this and
[2557.5s] that no we must put in the work amen we
[2562.1s] must bear the Yoke in our
[2566.5s] youth even if we have many desires even
[2570.5s] if we have many things that we want to
[2573.7s] to to do we want to
[2575.8s] experience we must do it the right way
[2580.3s] sister white writes in the book testimon
[2581.6s] to the church Volume 5 says the Pains of
[2584.7s] study and the pleasures of sin are the
[2587.0s] cords with which Satan binds men in his
[2590.5s] snares the Pains of Duty rather and the
[2593.8s] pleasures of
[2595.5s] sin we want we live in a microwave
[2598.6s] generation we want things to be very
[2600.6s] easy and convenient everything is is at
[2604.4s] the is accessible the power of our
[2608.6s] hands the pain of Duty we don't like
[2611.5s] work because we get
[2613.0s] tired and the pleasures of what and the
[2615.8s] pleasures of sin those who would rather
[2618.5s] die than form a wrong act than perform a
[2621.0s] wrong act are the only ones who will be
[2623.4s] found
[2624.8s] faithful those who say no to taking
[2628.2s] shortcuts those who say no to F and
[2631.7s] power those who say
[2634.8s] no in the history of Joseph and Joseph
[2637.8s] and Daniel and his fellows we see how
[2640.5s] the golden chain of Truth May bind the
[2642.8s] youth to the throne of God they could
[2645.4s] not be tempted to turn aside from their
[2647.2s] course of Integrity they valued the
[2649.6s] favor of God above the Praises of
[2653.9s] princes and God loved them and spread
[2656.6s] his shield over them because of their
[2659.2s] faithful Integrity because of their
[2661.3s] determination to honor God above every
[2663.6s] human power the Lord signally honored
[2666.8s] them before men they were
[2670.2s] honored by the Lord of hosts Whose power
[2674.2s] is over all the works of his hand in the
[2676.7s] heaven above and in the earth beneath
[2679.7s] these youth were not ashamed to display
[2681.4s] their true colors even in the court of
[2683.6s] the king in their words in their habits
[2686.6s] in their practices they confessed their
[2690.1s] faith in the Lord God Of Heaven they
[2693.8s] refused to bow to any Earthly mandate
[2696.5s] and be detracted from the honor of God
[2700.2s] they had strength from Heaven to confess
[2702.6s] their allegiance to God we must not take
[2707.9s] shortcuts as a young lady I remember I
[2710.7s] was once speaking to a young
[2712.7s] lady it's a sad story I met her during
[2718.0s] um
[2720.4s] during uh chaplaincy nice Adventist
[2723.5s] young girl last time I I checked in on
[2726.2s] her I met with her she was outside the
[2728.2s] church
[2729.9s] and in talking to her she told me
[2733.5s] through her cousin she was told if you
[2735.4s] are beautiful and you are poor it is
[2737.8s] your
[2738.9s] fault that beauty and poverty are
[2741.8s] mutually exclusive that the beautiful
[2744.3s] cannot be
[2747.0s] poor and all of us want wealth and some
[2750.6s] of us are willing to take shortcuts for
[2753.8s] it the Bible speaks Christ when Christ
[2757.9s] was writing Christ speaks to them when
[2761.1s] Judas was speaking about what Mary
[2763.2s] Magdalene had
[2765.1s] said and Mary
[2767.2s] Magdalene um had uh had poured that
[2772.0s] expensive
[2773.3s] oil and Judah says it could have been
[2775.3s] sold to feed the poor Christ said what
[2779.5s] the poor you will always have with you
[2782.8s] the problem we have as Christians is we
[2785.6s] don't marry the fact that the poor that
[2787.3s] Christ is referring to could be you and
[2789.8s] me that the poor will always
[2792.6s] have and so we want to do all manner of
[2796.1s] things even unethical things denying one
[2799.0s] another and as a result our communities
[2803.4s] suffer my brothers and my sisters we
[2807.0s] must not take any
[2809.2s] shortcuts we some one somebody said if
[2812.2s] the mountain was smooth nobody would be
[2814.5s] able to climb
[2817.9s] the difficulties and the challenges are
[2819.9s] there to mold our characters the
[2822.3s] difficulties and the challenges are
[2823.8s] there for my sake and for your
[2827.5s] sake my final point is if we are to
[2831.2s] change our communities let us dream Amen
[2835.0s] Let Us dream and hope let us dream and
[2838.4s] hope like
[2840.2s] Joseph who had a dream and he did
[2843.7s] wonderful things because of his dream
[2848.5s] i' like us to consider this text and it
[2851.4s] says from messages to Young
[2854.0s] People page 36 paragraph 1 it says Dear
[2856.6s] youth what is the aim and purpose of
[2858.8s] your life are you ambitious for
[2861.0s] Education that you may have a name and
[2863.1s] position in the world have you thoughts
[2866.4s] that you dare not express that you may
[2868.7s] one day stand upon the summit of
[2870.5s] intellectual greatness sometimes our
[2872.1s] friends laugh at us when we share our
[2874.2s] dreams like Joseph's brothers share
[2876.4s] shared
[2877.7s] laughed at him and even his parents at
[2879.6s] some point said hey this son of ours is
[2882.6s] is now gone beyond his brothers is now
[2885.2s] also saying that the Sun and the Moon
[2886.6s] did what bowed to him and they
[2891.8s] wonder do you have any of these
[2894.8s] things have you thoughts that you dare
[2896.9s] not express that you may one day stand
[2899.1s] upon the summit of intellectual
[2900.3s] greatness that you may sit in
[2901.6s] deliberative and legislative councils
[2904.2s] and help to enact laws for the nation
[2907.1s] there is nothing wrong with these
[2908.8s] aspirations you may you may everyone of
[2912.8s] you make your mark you should be you
[2916.2s] should be content with no mean
[2918.6s] attainments aim high and spare no pains
[2922.3s] to reach the standard
[2924.5s] amen but do not take any
[2928.1s] shortcuts do not take any shortcuts
[2930.8s] higher than the highest human thought
[2932.6s] can reach is God's ideal for his
[2935.0s] children godliness godlikeness is the
[2938.2s] goal to be reached before the student is
[2941.1s] opened a path of continual progress he
[2944.1s] has an object to achieve a standard to
[2946.2s] attain that includes everything good
[2949.1s] pure and Noble he will advance as fast
[2952.0s] and as far as possible in every branch
[2953.9s] of true knowledge but his efforts will
[2956.7s] be directed to objects as much higher
[2959.8s] and than mere selfish and temporal
[2962.7s] interests as the heavens are higher to
[2965.1s] the Earth so from from the book
[2968.1s] education aim high my brothers and my
[2970.5s] sisters aim to change our communities
[2973.5s] not simply for selfish interest I can
[2975.6s] tell you in
[2977.7s] my whatever I do for life I've
[2980.5s] interacted with
[2982.7s] people I once even interacted with a man
[2985.6s] who told me he's a billionaire and I
[2988.1s] checked it is
[2989.5s] true but if I consider my satisfaction
[2993.2s] with life I'm not very satisfied let me
[2995.5s] not lie to you but
[2997.2s] compared to this man who has a lot of
[3000.2s] wealth he was in divorce in court
[3005.3s] fighting divorces his children alienated
[3008.7s] from him but yet he was there advising
[3011.8s] me you know telling me to enjoy life but
[3015.0s] when I looked at his life he was sick he
[3017.3s] was a he was he was had all manner of
[3019.4s] things all manner of stresses even told
[3021.7s] me that he's enjoying life he told me he
[3024.1s] even has a young girlfriend now this man
[3025.8s] was in his 70s
[3027.6s] and his girlfriend was 23 even told me
[3030.2s] he's sure that his girlfriend is is is
[3032.5s] prettier than mine and even showed me
[3034.8s] and I told him yes it's
[3038.8s] true but I must say I don't have
[3044.7s] any but one thing this man affirmed in
[3047.8s] me is that money is important yes but
[3052.0s] money is not
[3053.6s] everything money is important yes but it
[3056.1s] is not what is not
[3059.9s] everything my brothers and my sisters
[3063.2s] let us aim high Amen Let Us aim to sort
[3067.2s] the problems of
[3068.6s] society to transform our communities to
[3071.7s] live a positive Mark let us dream like
[3075.7s] Martin Luther King dreamed of a time in
[3079.0s] which we will live in harmony and in
[3081.9s] unity let us dream as young people as a
[3086.1s] church we have a history sometimes of
[3088.2s] being plagued by tribalism by nepotism
[3092.5s] as a nation let us dream of a time when
[3096.6s] indeed my value to you is not simply
[3099.4s] pegged on what I do for a living on my
[3101.6s] paycheck my social economic status let
[3103.8s] us dream of a time in which men and
[3106.6s] women can see eye to eye kisses and LS
[3109.9s] Kiku and cenin let us have a
[3113.2s] dream and let us put in the work amen
[3116.7s] let us put in the work to be able to see
[3119.7s] this come to fruition it is possible
[3124.0s] many other things I would have told us
[3126.6s] but like Solomon to the writing of many
[3129.4s] books there is no end and this someon
[3131.8s] must needs come to an
[3133.4s] end I end it this way today as young
[3137.6s] people to ask young people and young
[3139.5s] people at at at
[3142.6s] heart do you have dreams do you have
[3145.3s] aspirations big be courageous of course
[3148.6s] there will be challenges there will be
[3150.5s] people who will Who who will Who will
[3152.8s] discourage you
[3155.2s] but press on press
[3158.6s] forward Lamentations 3 and: 27 it is
[3162.2s] good for a man for the Youth to do what
[3167.2s] to Bear the Yoke let's take the
[3170.4s] challenges that come in our lives let us
[3173.6s] embrace our identities in Christ and let
[3176.3s] us has put our full trust and faith in
[3178.9s] him we'll rise As we sing Our closing
[3181.9s] song give me the Bible give me the Bible
