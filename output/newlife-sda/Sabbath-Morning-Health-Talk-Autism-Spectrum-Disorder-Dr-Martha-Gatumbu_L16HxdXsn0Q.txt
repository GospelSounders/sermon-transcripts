FULL TRANSCRIPT:
[Music] Happy Sabbath. Happy Sabbath. Happy day. Happy day. My name is Dr. Martha Gatumbu Mmani and I'll be giving the health talk today. Today we are going to be discussing about autism spectrum disorders in childhood. And in a nutshell, we can define autism as a complex neurobbehavioral uh condition that leads to impairment in three facets for a child. They they impaired in their social interaction, in their language and communication skills and they may also have rigid and repetitive behaviors. Um some of the risk factors for autism spectrum disease include genetics. So if there's family history of a child with autism, there are higher risks. Environmental toxins such as heavy metals, chemicals, and pesticides, viral infections, and medications or complications in pregnancy. Uh, and autism tends to be more common among boys and pre-term babies. Some of the ways you can recognize an autistic child is from very early from as early as 6 months. Um this happens like if the child is not gesturing or is not um uh giving you good facial interaction. Uh so a child who doesn't bubble or coup by 12 months uh does not gesture that is any pointing or waving by 12 months and cannot say a single word by 16 months should be evaluated for autism. If by 2 years that's 24 months they are not able to make uh two word phrases that's another red flag. And if at any point in their development they lose their language skills that's also a red flag. So for these children uh and generally for all children especially under the age of five we advise that when they see a pediatrician they are screened for uh developmental uh delays especially in speech and communication from as early as 9 months then again at 18 months and 24 to 36 months. Thereafter if the child has suspicious signs for autism we can be able to uh do some comprehensive screening tests. So on the management of autism it involves both um pharmacotherapy. So there are drugs for the associated conditions that they may have like hyperactivity, anxiety, um ticks or seizures. There are medications they can have. Um but largely autism is managed by behavioral therapy. So there are certain behavioral techniques that we are able to offer children um who are autistic. The most common is called applied uh behavior analysis where we are able to teach children how to adapt in their everyday lives in a context that they'll be able to understand. We also do social skills training. So that is trying to teach the child how to interact normally with children of the same age and integrate. And then speech therapy is also a core management principle in management of autism. Uh play therapy. Play therapy is important for children because children require play and in autism um children tend to play alone. They're not very interactive. So play therapy is a modality that can be used to help them integrate into their normal uh age groups. Family education and counseling is important. The whole family needs to be aware about what autism is and uh they need to be able to provide a consistent structure and routine. For autistic children, they thrive in environments where there's a lot of structure and routine. uh and it helps them self-regulate themselves and uh for the family it's important for them to be aware of their condition and know where when to seek help help for specific concerns. In terms of prevention there's no um definite way you can prevent autism spectrum disorders. We said for most reasons it's genetics and uh but early diagnosis and intervention is key. So as a parent, if you're concerned about the developmental milestones of your child, specifically towards language and speech and the way they're interacting with other children, you advised to seek medical advice. And there are various centers you can go go to um to seek help, specifically uh child development clinics. Yeah. And that's the end of the health talk.

[3.7s] Happy
[5.6s] Sabbath. Happy Sabbath. Happy day. Happy
[10.2s] day. My name is Dr. Martha Gatumbu Mmani
[14.0s] and I'll be giving the health talk
[15.9s] today. Today we are going to be
[17.8s] discussing about autism spectrum
[20.2s] disorders in childhood.
[22.7s] And in a nutshell, we can define autism
[25.8s] as a complex neurobbehavioral uh
[29.0s] condition that leads to impairment in
[31.9s] three facets for a child. They they
[34.5s] impaired in their social interaction, in
[37.3s] their language and communication skills
[40.4s] and they may also have rigid and
[42.9s] repetitive
[44.7s] behaviors. Um some of the risk factors
[47.5s] for autism spectrum disease include
[50.6s] genetics. So if there's family history
[53.2s] of a child with autism, there are higher
[55.5s] risks. Environmental toxins such as
[58.8s] heavy metals, chemicals, and pesticides,
[62.6s] viral infections, and medications or
[65.4s] complications in pregnancy. Uh, and
[68.5s] autism tends to be more common among
[71.1s] boys and pre-term babies. Some of the
[74.6s] ways you can recognize an autistic child
[78.1s] is from very early from as early as 6
[80.7s] months. Um this happens like if the
[83.7s] child is not gesturing or is not um uh
[88.6s] giving you good facial interaction. Uh
[91.7s] so a child who doesn't bubble or coup by
[94.6s] 12 months uh does not gesture that is
[97.8s] any pointing or waving by 12 months and
[101.4s] cannot say a single word by 16 months
[104.5s] should be evaluated for autism. If by 2
[107.9s] years that's 24 months they are not able
[110.7s] to make uh two word phrases that's
[113.2s] another red flag. And if at any point in
[116.3s] their development they lose their
[117.8s] language skills that's also a red flag.
[121.7s] So for these children
[124.0s] uh and generally for all children
[125.6s] especially under the age of five we
[127.8s] advise that when they see a pediatrician
[130.7s] they are screened for uh developmental
[134.0s] uh delays especially in speech and
[136.3s] communication from as early as 9 months
[139.6s] then again at 18 months and 24 to 36
[142.6s] months. Thereafter if the child has
[145.9s] suspicious signs for autism we can be
[148.8s] able to uh do some comprehensive
[152.4s] screening tests. So on the management of
[155.8s] autism it involves both um
[158.7s] pharmacotherapy. So there are drugs for
[160.8s] the associated conditions that they may
[163.8s] have like
[165.2s] hyperactivity, anxiety,
[167.8s] um ticks or seizures. There are
[170.2s] medications they can have. Um but
[173.4s] largely autism is managed by behavioral
[176.1s] therapy. So there are certain behavioral
[178.6s] techniques that we are able to offer
[181.3s] children um who are autistic. The most
[184.3s] common is called applied uh behavior
[186.9s] analysis where we are able to teach
[189.3s] children how to adapt in their everyday
[192.7s] lives in a context that they'll be able
[194.8s] to understand. We also do social skills
[198.2s] training. So that is trying to teach the
[201.4s] child how to interact normally with
[204.2s] children of the same age and integrate.
[207.7s] And then speech therapy is also a core
[210.4s] management principle in management of
[213.6s] autism. Uh play therapy. Play therapy is
[217.1s] important for children because children
[218.9s] require play and in autism um children
[223.2s] tend to play alone. They're not very
[225.0s] interactive. So play therapy is a
[228.0s] modality that can be used to help them
[231.4s] integrate into their normal uh age
[233.8s] groups. Family education and counseling
[236.6s] is important. The whole family needs to
[238.9s] be aware about what autism is and uh
[242.6s] they need to be able to provide a
[244.9s] consistent structure and routine. For
[247.3s] autistic children, they thrive in
[249.0s] environments where there's a lot of
[251.4s] structure and routine. uh and it helps
[254.5s] them self-regulate
[256.6s] themselves and uh for the family it's
[259.8s] important for them to be aware of their
[261.8s] condition and know where when to seek
[263.7s] help help for specific
[266.4s] concerns. In terms of prevention there's
[269.5s] no um definite way you can prevent
[272.9s] autism spectrum disorders. We said for
[275.8s] most reasons it's genetics and uh but
[279.4s] early diagnosis and intervention is key.
[282.1s] So as a parent, if you're concerned
[283.8s] about the developmental milestones of
[286.2s] your child, specifically towards
[288.6s] language and speech and the way they're
[291.0s] interacting with other children, you
[293.4s] advised to seek medical advice. And
[296.2s] there are various centers you can go go
[298.6s] to um to seek help, specifically uh
[302.1s] child development clinics. Yeah. And
[305.0s] that's the end of the health talk.
