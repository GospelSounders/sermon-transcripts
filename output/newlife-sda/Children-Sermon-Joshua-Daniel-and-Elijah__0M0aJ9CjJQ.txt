FULL TRANSCRIPT:
My name is Daniel. Happy Sabbath. Happy day. Happy day. Happy. My name is Joshua. Happy Sabbath. Happy day. My name is Elijah. Let's pray. Our graciously father, we thank you. Thank for the week and how it will be now as it's a blessed day. Be with us, guide us, protect us, be with us in Jesus name. Amen. Today's title is born to soul living above the world. May today's message remind us of who we are in Christ and how we are to live as we wait for his soon return. The story of the eagle and the turkeys. There was once a baby eagle, a strong and majestic bird by design. But something happened. The egg of this eagle somehow ended up in a turkeyy's nest. So when the eagle hatched, it was surrounded by turkeys. It didn't know it was different. it. It learned how to scrut the ground like the turkeys, to peg for worms and seeds, and to flap its wings just enough to make it hop around. It lived just like the turkeys, even though it was not one of them. One day, as it was pecking the ground, the eagle looked up and saw a mighty bird soaring high in the sky, wings stretched wide, gliding effortlessly through the clouds. With its amazing vision, it started to notice that it had simalities to this majestic creature. Out of curiosity, the eagle flapped its wings harder and harder until it left the ground towards the sky. It went higher and higher, enjoying its new found ability. The lesson, we are in the world, but not of the world. Jesus said in John 14 from John 17 from 14-16 when he prayed for us, "They are not of the world just as I am not of the world. My prayer for them is not that you may take them out of the world, but that you might deliver them from the evil one. We live among the world at our work, at our school, and at our neighborhood just like the ego lived among the turkeys. But God didn't create us to live like the world, following its ways and coping its habits. God created us to soar high in love, in faith, in obedience, and in hope. We are made for heaven's ways, not the low earthbound ways of sin. Our memory verse comes from Philippian 3:20. It says, "Our citizenship is in heaven." It means we don't belong to this world. Our home is in heaven. So boys and girls, do you want to be like an who or a turkey who can't fly? I believe because God made us to rise high and follow Jesus. Yes, God wants us to be like the eagle looking up, obeying his commands and remembering Jesus is coming soon. The reflection. Parents, raise your children up as eagles, teaching them who they are in Christ. Young people, don't let the world tell you that you're just another person in the crowd. You are made for God's purpose. All of us, let us look up and not down. Let us rise above the ways of sin, above compromise, above fear, because Jesus prayed for us that he live in the world but not of it. Like the eagle looked up at the sky, he must look up because Jesus is coming again. Let us sing him number 596. Look for the way marks and remind ourselves to look at the signs of the times of Jesus soon return. Look for the way mark as you journey on. Look for the way out. Passing one by one down through the edges past the kingdom floor. Where are we standing? Look the way mark. Look for the way marks the great prophetic way marks. Now through the ages past the kingdom flow. Look for the way the great prophetic way marked. The journey is almost store. First the Assyrian kingdom ruled the world. Then made banners were unfree [Music] universal way. Rome sees the center. Where are we today? Look for the way back the great prophetic way. Mark down through the ages. Past the kingdom fall. Look for the way marks the great prophetic way marks. The journey is almost down in the feet of iron and of clay. We can divide soon to pass away. What will the next great glorious drama be?

[66.7s] nest.
[69.0s] So when the eagle hatched, it was
[71.3s] surrounded by turkeys. It didn't know it
[74.1s] was different.
[82.1s] it. It learned how to scrut the ground

[206.3s] this world. Our home is in heaven. So
