FULL TRANSCRIPT:
Happy Sabbath and a happy day in your life. My name is Warren Dwight Dalo. I'm a medical doctor currently practicing in Kenyat International Hospital in the accident and emergency department also doing my first year in masters specifically specializing in internal medicine and I'm blessed to be here with you. I'll be doing the health nugget. So let's start with a word of prayer. Our father art in heaven, we thank you for giving us a chance to be here in front of you as we share and learn from you in terms of health. May you be our great physician for this is a humble prayer us in Christ's name. Amen. So just to start, I'd like to take us back to 2022. 2022 was a was a special point in my life or rather a cornerstone in my career life and I'll call it in the internship year. I mean for the doctors out there or any medics know what internship means or even unmedics and I remember it was a Wednesday afternoon in the clinic somewhere in Tarakan in a very busy hospital. I was working in PCH agora a man called Dr. Kirimi, not his real name, walked in. He's a at that point he was about 63 years old, a father of five, a man who was well known in the local village for his his kindness, the love he had for the people within the village. And he was strong and was quite loud. Let me just say he was a man of the people. But that day, he looked very weak. Something was just off about him. And he was next in line. So as he approached I asked him for those who know what that means from me side basically I asked him Kimi hi what's is there any problem and I know it's a rhetorical question it's just I didn't have the vocabulary to ask him what is the problem and he just sat down weekly and quietly and he went straight to the point he spoke in but I'll say it in English doctor. I can't pee as I used to pee. And sometimes when I pee, it's burning. It's painful. And there's blood in my urine once in a while. And of late, I'm so weak. When I walk, my knees just give way. And I've been losing kgs. I've been losing my weight. For the past 1 month, I've lost 8 kgs. Doctor, what is going on? And remember I told you he's about that time, he was about 63 years old. He told me, could it be that age is catching up with me? So I just sat on did my check up on him and told him reassured him and told him let's just do a few tests then we'll get back to you. Few hours later the test trickled into the computer and as I was scrolling in there I saw what the issue is. So I called Kirimi. Kimi I have something to tell you. The issue is this is a this is a reason as to why I've come this morning to talk about prostate cancer. But my emphasis today will be on prevention. As we talk about it, it will be more of screening. So just to give us a brief about prostate cancer. We know that prostate cancer only affects the male. So we can't find when you have a lady, we cannot talk about prostate cancer, only men. And in this case, we always talk about men of 50 and above. So because of the short time, I'll just be specific. The things to look out when when you think about prostate cancer, one is age. Usually affects people above 50 years, but you'll see that based on research, we found that people from the black race like me and a number of people here tend to have pro cancer even from 40 years and above. For the Caucasians and Asians, tends to be from 55 years to 69 years. The other thing is also if someone in your family, let's say your grandpa, your uncle or even your father has a history of prostate cancer means that there's a likelihood two times more chance of you actually getting it. Also, if someone in the family has had breast cancer, something like colurectal cancer, they tend to be very heritable and that's also a red flag. And of course our obese men when you talk about high levels of dietary fat that's also another high risk. So when you talk about screening in this case screening of disease what does it involve? Involves testing someone who's apparently healthy meaning that you don't have to be sick for you to be screened. You actually we need someone who's healthy who has no symptoms but cares about his health and comes forward. So we've talked about the 50 year old persons in our context even 40 and above is is falls in the falls in this stratification. So we'll have an individual health individual come and they'll have tests done just to enable us to rule out whether there's any disease or to reassure them and know tell them that you can continue with life and come back maybe years later for another screening test. And when we talk about screening, it means that these diseases like prostate cancer, they're very forgiving. It grows slowly and slowly. Therefore, we can catch it in good time and therefore be able to intervene in good time. So again just to reiterate I've talked about if you're 40 years old and above most 50 and above and you've not gone for screening that's my reason as to why I'm here this morning to encourage you not to fear the test that will be done most of times there are two tests one is a blood test just uh it's called serum prostate specific antigen initials um just PSA when you go to the hospital and you say you want to screen for prostate, they'll definitely do a blood sample on you. And the other test is something that not any of us like, even myself, when I think about it, I dread getting to 50 years of age. It's called digital rectal examination. Just from what I've said, basically a doctor has a glove that is lubricated and inserts the index finger through the rectum. And why we do this is because the prostate is in close relation to the rectum. And sometimes if there's an issue, you'll feel the hard lumps. You'll feel that it's not as soft as as it should be. And those are telltale signs of could there be an issue with the prostate. So other other symptoms like Mr. Karimi that came came up with you say you're 50 years old and you can't pee as used to. You have to strain yourself. Sometimes when you strain there's so much pain and once in a while there's blood in both urine and also in your semen. Such things should make you feel that make you want to go to the hospital and get checked up. All this not to scare us but it's just to enable us to be educated and to enable us to have wellinformed decisions. So if at all someone a friend, a relative, a father, even a husband comes to you and tells you that nowadays whenever I pee, I pee but I feel like I've not finished peeing or sometimes they have to go to the toilet quite a number of times. Frequent the the the toilet a number of times. Most times they have to wake up at night. If they used to wake up once at night or never, now they have to wake up five times because the prostate has really obstructed the urethra and therefore cannot pass urine as normal. That's a tital sign that they need to get checked up and again remember this is one cancer that is very forgiving once captured early or early detected can be helped out. There are very ways there are very many ways of sorting it out. could be surgical, could be ready radiotherapy. But again, I'll take you back to my emphasis today. Screening your 40year-old or 50 year old male. Please feel free to get screened. I don't think it's expensive. Just a free examination and maybe a blood sample. That way you'll be able to c the increasing number of proceed cancers in our country. Thank you so much. Let's pray. Our father art in heaven, again we thank you for giving us a chance to listen from you. We pray that you may give us strength to take care good care of ourselves and that health will be our number one priority with the great physician and we ask you to help us prevent rather than cure. Be this Sabbath for this is our humble prayer. Believe me and trust in Christ's name. Amen. Thank you.

TIMESTAMPED TRANSCRIPT:
[6.0s] Happy Sabbath
[8.0s] and a happy day in your life.
[10.8s] My name is Warren Dwight Dalo. I'm a
[13.8s] medical doctor currently practicing in
[15.8s] Kenyat International Hospital in the
[17.7s] accident and emergency department also
[20.5s] doing my first year in masters
[22.2s] specifically specializing in internal
[23.8s] medicine and I'm blessed to be here with
[26.2s] you. I'll be doing the health nugget. So
[28.4s] let's start with a word of prayer. Our
[30.8s] father art in heaven, we thank you for
[32.5s] giving us a chance to be here in front
[34.6s] of you as we share and learn from you in
[37.6s] terms of health. May you be our great
[39.5s] physician for this is a humble prayer us
[41.8s] in Christ's name. Amen. So just to
[45.1s] start, I'd like to take us back to 2022.
[49.0s] 2022 was a was a special point in my
[52.2s] life or rather a cornerstone in my
[54.9s] career life and I'll call it in the
[57.5s] internship year. I mean for the doctors
[59.8s] out there or any medics know what
[62.0s] internship means or even unmedics and I
[65.5s] remember it was a Wednesday afternoon in
[68.5s] the clinic somewhere in Tarakan in a
[70.5s] very busy hospital. I was working in PCH
[72.9s] agora a man called Dr. Kirimi, not his
[76.5s] real name, walked in. He's a at that
[79.8s] point he was about 63 years old, a
[82.0s] father of five, a man who was well known
[84.2s] in the local village for his his
[87.4s] kindness, the love he had for the people
[89.8s] within the village. And he was strong
[91.9s] and was quite loud. Let me just say he
[94.4s] was a man of the people. But that day,
[97.1s] he looked very weak. Something was just
[99.4s] off about him. And he was next in line.
[102.1s] So as he approached
[104.1s] I asked him
[109.2s] for those who know what that means from
[111.4s] me side basically I asked him Kimi hi
[116.2s] what's is there any problem
[118.7s] and I know it's a rhetorical question
[120.6s] it's just I didn't have the vocabulary
[122.2s] to ask him what is the problem and he
[125.3s] just sat down weekly and quietly and he
[128.5s] went straight to the point he spoke in
[131.0s] but I'll say it in English doctor. I
[133.8s] can't pee as I used to pee. And
[135.8s] sometimes when I pee, it's burning. It's
[138.2s] painful. And there's blood in my urine
[140.2s] once in a while. And of late, I'm so
[142.3s] weak. When I walk, my knees just give
[144.3s] way. And I've been losing kgs. I've been
[147.0s] losing my weight. For the past 1 month,
[149.4s] I've lost 8 kgs. Doctor, what is going
[152.2s] on? And remember I told you he's about
[154.6s] that time, he was about 63 years old. He
[157.5s] told me, could it be that age is
[159.3s] catching up with me? So I just sat on
[162.2s] did my check up on him and told him
[164.3s] reassured him and told him let's just do
[166.7s] a few tests then we'll get back to you.
[169.1s] Few hours later the test trickled into
[171.4s] the computer and as I was scrolling in
[174.0s] there I saw what the issue is. So I
[176.2s] called Kirimi. Kimi I have something to
[179.0s] tell you. The issue is this is a this is
[183.0s] a reason as to why I've come this
[184.6s] morning to talk about prostate cancer.
[187.8s] But my emphasis today will be on
[191.0s] prevention. As we talk about it, it will
[193.8s] be more of screening. So just to give us
[196.5s] a brief about prostate cancer. We know
[198.5s] that prostate cancer only affects the
[201.2s] male. So we can't find when you have a
[203.6s] lady, we cannot talk about prostate
[205.1s] cancer, only men. And in this case, we
[208.2s] always talk about men of 50 and above.
[211.9s] So because of the short time, I'll just
[213.5s] be specific.
[215.4s] The things to look out when when you
[218.2s] think about prostate cancer, one is age.
[221.1s] Usually affects people above 50 years,
[224.0s] but you'll see that based on research,
[226.4s] we found that people from the black race
[229.7s] like me and a number of people here tend
[232.6s] to have pro cancer even from 40 years
[235.1s] and above.
[236.8s] For the Caucasians and Asians, tends to
[239.1s] be from 55 years to 69 years. The other
[242.3s] thing is also if someone in your family,
[245.0s] let's say your grandpa, your uncle or
[248.1s] even your father has a history of
[250.3s] prostate cancer means that there's a
[252.4s] likelihood two times more chance of you
[254.9s] actually getting it. Also, if someone in
[257.8s] the family has had breast cancer,
[260.6s] something like colurectal cancer, they
[262.8s] tend to be very heritable and that's
[265.3s] also a red flag. And of course our obese
[269.7s] men when you talk about high levels of
[272.6s] dietary fat that's also another high
[275.4s] risk. So when you talk about screening
[278.6s] in this case screening of disease what
[280.8s] does it involve? Involves testing
[283.2s] someone who's apparently healthy meaning
[285.0s] that you don't have to be sick for you
[287.5s] to be screened. You actually we need
[290.2s] someone who's healthy who has no
[292.2s] symptoms but cares about his health and
[295.7s] comes forward. So we've talked about the
[297.8s] 50 year old persons in our context even
[301.0s] 40 and above is is falls in the falls in
[304.6s] this stratification.
[306.7s] So we'll have an individual health
[308.6s] individual come and they'll have tests
[311.0s] done just to enable us to rule out
[313.1s] whether there's any disease or to
[315.3s] reassure them and know tell them that
[317.6s] you can continue with life and come back
[319.3s] maybe years later for another screening
[321.3s] test. And when we talk about screening,
[323.4s] it means that these diseases like
[325.8s] prostate cancer, they're very forgiving.
[328.9s] It grows slowly and slowly. Therefore,
[331.7s] we can catch it in good time and
[333.5s] therefore be able to intervene in good
[336.6s] time. So
[339.2s] again just to reiterate I've talked
[340.8s] about if you're 40 years old and above
[344.5s] most 50 and above and you've not gone
[346.4s] for screening that's my reason as to why
[348.8s] I'm here this morning to encourage you
[351.2s] not to fear the test that will be done
[353.8s] most of times there are two tests one is
[355.8s] a blood test just uh it's called serum
[359.5s] prostate specific antigen initials um
[363.2s] just PSA
[365.3s] when you go to the hospital and you say
[366.6s] you want to screen for prostate, they'll
[368.6s] definitely do a blood sample on you. And
[370.6s] the other test is something that not any
[373.0s] of us like, even myself, when I think
[374.8s] about it, I dread getting to 50 years of
[377.5s] age. It's called digital rectal
[380.6s] examination. Just from what I've said,
[383.3s] basically a doctor has a glove that is
[386.6s] lubricated and inserts the index finger
[389.9s] through the rectum. And why we do this
[392.2s] is because the prostate is in close
[394.9s] relation to the rectum. And sometimes if
[397.1s] there's an issue, you'll feel the hard
[399.0s] lumps. You'll feel that it's not as soft
[401.8s] as as it should be. And those are
[404.1s] telltale signs of could there be an
[406.4s] issue with the prostate.
[408.8s] So other other symptoms like Mr. Karimi
[411.4s] that came came up with you say you're 50
[414.6s] years old and you can't pee as used to.
[417.6s] You have to strain yourself. Sometimes
[420.0s] when you strain there's so much pain and
[422.6s] once in a while there's blood in both
[425.0s] urine and also in your semen. Such
[427.5s] things should make you feel that make
[429.9s] you want to go to the hospital and get
[431.8s] checked up. All this not to scare us but
[434.7s] it's just to enable us to be educated
[438.0s] and to enable us to have wellinformed
[440.8s] decisions. So if at all someone a
[444.9s] friend, a relative, a father, even a
[448.5s] husband comes to you and tells you that
[450.6s] nowadays whenever I pee, I pee but I
[453.7s] feel like I've not finished peeing or
[455.8s] sometimes they have to go to the toilet
[458.5s] quite a number of times. Frequent the
[461.0s] the the toilet a number of times. Most
[463.8s] times they have to wake up at night. If
[465.7s] they used to wake up once at night or
[467.5s] never, now they have to wake up five
[469.2s] times because the prostate has really
[472.3s] obstructed the urethra and therefore
[475.5s] cannot pass urine as normal. That's a
[478.4s] tital sign that they need to get checked
[480.2s] up and again remember this is one cancer
[483.5s] that is very forgiving once captured
[486.3s] early or early detected can be helped
[489.2s] out. There are very ways there are very
[491.5s] many ways of sorting it out. could be
[493.4s] surgical, could be ready radiotherapy.
[496.1s] But again, I'll take you back to my
[497.6s] emphasis today. Screening your
[500.2s] 40year-old or 50 year old male. Please
[503.4s] feel free to get screened. I don't think
[505.5s] it's expensive. Just a free examination
[508.2s] and maybe a blood sample. That way
[510.4s] you'll be able to c the increasing
[513.3s] number of proceed cancers in our
[516.2s] country. Thank you so much. Let's pray.
[519.9s] Our father art in heaven, again we thank
[522.6s] you for giving us a chance to listen
[524.3s] from you. We pray that you may give us
[526.2s] strength to take care good care of
[528.2s] ourselves and that health will be our
[530.2s] number one priority with the great
[532.1s] physician and we ask you to help us
[534.8s] prevent rather than cure. Be this
[537.2s] Sabbath for this is our humble prayer.
[539.3s] Believe me and trust in Christ's name.
[541.3s] Amen. Thank you.
