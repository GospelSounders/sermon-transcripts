FULL TRANSCRIPT:
name of the father, the son, and the holy spirit. I said we bless the name of the father, the son, and the holy spirit. Amen. The lord is good, church. At all the time. We want to thank God for the abundance of his goodness. Indeed, the bible says he renews his mercies aresh every morning. His steadfast love is always. Somebody say amen to that. Thank you very much, Daniel. and uh Elijah and was that Joshua? Yes, Daniel, Elijah and Joshua. Uh I have a sense there's a sense in which I feel the sermon was already done and we only needed to just focus ourselves on the holy communion. I almost wanted to ask all in favor say I. So that I just pray but I'm feeling like you might say yes and then I just have to go and see it. So I don't want to put you into that temptation. Last week we had a number of uh berments and uh yesterday we were divided into different locations. I know that my colleague Pastor Polycap left for Eldor a little bit earlier I think early in the week middle in the middle part of the week and my colleague Pastor Elvis was at Muaroni yesterday I traveled to Yamira Kiriggo yesterday and all of us who are there to comfort the families that had lost their loved ones from this church. I pray to God that you may continue to put them in prayer. I also want to thank God for the lessons that we learned by the day. And believe you me, this day I feel as if I have felt the lesson that all those that were locked out of Noah's ark, I was part of those that were locked outside. It's unfortunate because some of you might not know that I've actually landed this morning from kissing. What happened is a terrible lesson for me and I told my wife, please don't don't don't don't don't put it deep so that I can get it. I want to teach myself a lesson so that I don't miss when Christ comes again. It was raining very heavy from Oyuki's all the way to Aero and uh the driver that was dropping me at uh Kisumu couldn't see. So we struggled our way and when we reached Aero and we are heading now to Kisumu town. Hell broke loose. It is as if all persons that work in the city were headed for the weekend in Kisumu. And so they were all vehicles all through. So we were going at 2 cm per hour if there's such a thing. And I was actually looking at it and I'm saying my flight is gone. The flight was supposed to take off at 8. And at 7:56 I am in a for those of you who understand what I'm talking about. I bowed my head because I didn't want to see what the driver is doing. And I said, I want to pray. I told God, God, I remember a time Joshua prayed and you stopped the sun. Do something that that flight might be stopped. Allow me to let you know this morning, brothers and sisters, that the flight was stopped. I testify yes that the flight was stopped up to 8:35 but you need to ask me what time I landed there. So did God answer my prayer? Yes or no? He did. And I thought to myself indeed God has answered my prayer because by the time we are arriving it was 8:33. And so when I'm moving in, we reach at the gate and for heaven's sake, I don't understand why the policemen there are trying to put all the gadget and trying to say now fix this number. Remove this number. Fix this number. I'm saying I'm getting late. No, no, no, no. Fix this number. And they're telling the driver, you've got to get the ticket. Fix this number. Don't remove this one. Fix the guy is not getting it cuz I'm under pressure. I felt like getting out and running to the gate. And to cut the whole story short is that I reached there and I was told the gate has been closed. Now while I'm rushing I called their airline and I told them I'm running late. Can I make it? They said try and run. We are waiting for you. And as I'm doing that I tried to keep the lady busy that was talking to me. And as I'm talking to her, my phone went off. Had it not gone off, I'm sure that lady would have kept me busy until I reached there. And indeed, I testify that because when I reached, she was actually kept on looking at me. When she when I arrived, that's when she says, "Seriously, sorry. They actually have closed the flight door. Had they not closed the flight door would have taken you in." I looked down and I told myself, "Here cometh the Noah's experience." So I had to be there the entire night. I just flew in this morning. Hallelujah. Today we are celebrating the Lord's supper. I do not know what happened, but I gave the song 281, but I think whoever must have given it out gave it as 181. My apologies for that. And I'm requesting that we sing it one more time. 281. Turn your attention to SDA Hypnos 281. As you sing that song, I would like you to understand that I have heard uh Dr. Moger stand up here and say that let us begin planning on how we shall give. I heard my elder, our first elder stand again and told us passionately how we need to prepare to give. And I would like you not to look at how much we should give or what it is that we have to give. But I want you before you imagine to give or to even think to give to look at the ultimate sacrifice of Christ Jesus which he himself gave and try and compare that with what you want to give. You will find that what it is that we want to give is way below the mark compared with what he gave. I gave my life for thee. I gave my life for thee. My precious blood shall be me and we from the dead. I give I give my life for thee. What does thou give for me? I gave I gave my life for thee. What are thee for me? My father's house of light. My glory of control. I live for all for I for thee as for me. I let I let it all for thee as thou art for me. I s for thee more than my can. Oh, God to rescue me from my fore. What has thou for me for thee? What was thou for me? Blessed redeemer, give us a glimpse of heaven to fathom the song that we have sung, this is not just another song. It's your story. And it is a question that you're giving unto us that it may left it may leave us pondering on what you've given us. Yet thou has asked, "What have we given you?" And so today as we deliberate on this sacrifice that was made on the cross, your broken body and the blood that cleanses us. Oh, we pray heavenly father that the Holy Spirit may impress these things upon our hearts to give us the conviction of heaven that indeed we may be drawn closer to you. So speak to us at this moment and my father because it is not any one of our day, it's your day. Allow heavenly father that each one of us may be blotted out from the minds of this congregation and Christ may you be exalted as you draw all of us to yourself. These things I ask in Jesus name. And let God's children say amen. Amen. Allow me to take you to the book of John chapter 8. And in the first 12 verses, there is a story there that I don't want to put my emphasis so much in the story, but I want to put an emphasis on in an act that Jesus did. I know some of you have read that story. We have been preached to from that story again and again. But I want to pick an act that Christ did that reflects the very story of redemption. From the word go in Genesis to the very word last in Revelation, what he shall do and what he has done and what he has been doing. And so, not to speak about Mary, but to speak about Christ. Allow me to take you to verse six. The title of my message this afternoon is he still stoops for me. The Bible says in verse six this they said testing him. Now you all know what has happened. Certain lady has been found committing adultery and they want to test Christ Jesus. They have all come and they have brought her closer to the temple where Christ is teaching. And whilst they are teaching, brothers and sisters, I like I just want you to look at it. Put your mind in that particular picture, not on the lady, but on what Christ shall do because that's where I want to take you to. And as they bring the lady, they throw her down there. And desire of ages tells me that that victim was shaking and trembling because her anticipation was that stones were going to be laid upon her one after the other because that was to be the last of her days. And so the Bible tells me in verse six that now they said this testing him that they might have something of which to do what church. Somebody's reading that. To do what? accuse him. But Jesus, and I would like you to read it from the screen. But Jesus did what? What did Jesus do? Are you hearing me from this side? What did Jesus do? What is stooping down? The Bible tells me, "And Jesus stooped down and wrote on the ground with his finger as though he did not do what?" Here. Put your fingers there and go with me to verse eight. The Bible tells me in verse 8, "And again," put it for me on the screen. The Bible says what? And again, he did what? Now, I want you to note that three times. Let's read it together. The Bible says, "And again he did what?" He stooped down and wrote where? On the ground. How many times did he write? Two. Allow me church members to let you know that this act of stooping down has been an act of God from the very word go. It was his act in the plan of salvation. It was his act in the plan of redemption. It will be his act in the plan of restoration. Put for me on the screen the very first slide that I have for us. In Genesis, Christ when he was creating, he stooped down. I'm waiting for it. In Genesis, go with me to the second slide. In Genesis when Christ was creating the book Desire of Ages says this in creation the master and his father in agreement stooped down to make man in their image. And so number one, I would like us to understand that this act that you find in the book of John chapter 8 verse 6 and verse 8. It is an act that didn't begin then is an act that began way back in creation. You find Christ going down with his father and there they are molding. And make no mistake brothers and sisters, it wasn't an easy thing after that because when you read the book uh no desire of ages but story of redemption in the chapter the plan of salvation, it tells us that immediately they had stooped down and man fell again. Number two, he stooped down again to take the form of humanity that in it he might be able to deliver yourself and myself. Somebody say amen to that. And I'm going to read you a caption here from the book story of redemption pages 36 paragraph 42 paragraph 1. Now when man had fallen they had had a very good communion with the father and the son. We are told when you read that chap that book I like to ask every one of you to get the book of story of redemption and you go through it. It is a powerful book. It starts with the chapter Lucifer and then it goes to creation. Then it goes to the plan of salvation. It goes all the way down and it tells us the story as it were. Brothers and sisters, there was a grand and beautiful communion between the father and the son and then the son and also Adam and Eve. It is elaborated so very well. But when man fell, we are told that Christ Jesus had to go inside the throne of the father. Let me read it. It says, "I saw the lovely Jesus and beheld an expression of sympathy and sorrow upon his countenance. Soon I saw him approach the exiting bright light with which enshrouded the m the father and bowing down said my accompanying angel, he is in close converse with his father. The angels that were surrounding the master had thrown down their crowns because they saw the sorrow that was in the eyes and in the face of the master. He was about to do something beyond what they could fathom. And because of that, the anxiety of the angels seemed to be intense while Jesus was communing with his father. Listen to this. Three times he was shut in by the glorious light about the father. And at the third time only then when he had stooped down that he may in the future take the human form that he came out from the father his person could be seen. Now listen to me. Let me explain that brothers and sisters. Don't ever imagine, don't ever think that it was an easy thing for the father to have released the son. The Bible tells me, know spiritual prophecy says, how many times did he go inside? Three times. The angels had almost wanted to give their lives a ransom. And one thing happened. Jesus explained to them that the law and the standard of God's law is so high that even the life of an angel cannot redeem mankind. It only had to take him to come and take when he explained to the angel that and he gave them a glimpse a panorama of what is going to happen in the future about himself. They all took their crowns and threw them down because this was the commander of heaven himself and he had explained what was going to happen. It tells me here that he entered into the glorious abboard of the father and he pleaded with him after explaining to him what was going to take place. And guess what? The father never gave an answer. He came out and the angels were still looking down because salvation for the human race had not yet been sealed. He went in the second time. He spoke to the father. The father never gave an answer. He came out and the angels still their faces were down because all the human race that was come after Adam was had not yet been sealed. Their salvation had not been sealed. He went in the third time and explained to the father and together when they looked at the panorama and saw everyone that shall be saved because of the ultimate sacrifice of Christ, the father nodded to the son. And that is when when the son came out after accepting to take the form of man by stooping down that he was able to be accepted and when he came out the angels shouted hallelujah because the plan of salvation was sealed stooping down. Number two, the book Philippians chapter 2 from verse 5 to verse 80 says, "He who was equal with God thought it not robbery to be equal with God, but he accepted to take the form of who? Mankind. He stooped down." Number two, brothers and sisters, allow me to take you to the third time when the sec the third time when he stooped down. Bring it to me on the screen again. And I would like you to understand that in the plan of creation, the Lord stooped down. In the plan of salvation, as they sat with the father, the son again stooped down. And in the plan of redemption, the son stooped down again. That he had to take the cross and die the death of the cross that you and I might find salvation. This is what it says in uh ministry acts of the apostles page 473. This stooping will be forever. He stooped in creation. He stooped in the plan of salvation. He stooping to pay the price for the sinner. The son of God stooped to uplift the unfallen. He gave up what was his that we might have what belonged to him. and he took what belonged to us that we may have what belonged to him. What manner of love, brothers and sisters, Bible, the pen of inspiration continues to say the son of God stooped to uplift the fallen. For this he left the sinless worlds on high. Christ stooped, it continues, Christ stooped to take upon himself the human nature that he might reach the fallen race and lift them up. And brothers and sisters, then that takes me to the last stooping, which makes the context of our message today. And so number one, he stooped during creation. Number two, he stooped again to enter into the holiest of the father to accept that he may take the human form. Number three, he stooped during redemption that he may lift up the human race. And now listen to what he has done in John chapter 8. And give it to me again on the screen. And this is where you find John chapter 8 6 in that particular story. Mankind has fallen into sin. And that is exhibited by the life of Mary Magdalene. Mary and Martha and Lazarus had been left by their parents at a tender age. Their uncle who was a priest in the Sanhedrin didn't want to really take good care of them. And so he releases them. When you read Doug Bachelor's book Mary at the feet of Jesus, it tells you that it is the uncle of Mary that introduced him to prostitution that he may gather for herself and left Lazarus to do that work that he did by himself and Martha was with her. This was this family at Bethany Magdala. And Christ knowing what had happened to this family tells us he drew himself closer to this particular family that he may identify with their infirmities. Brothers and sisters, it is at that time when Mary is in her usual business which the uncle had introduced her to and several times again and again the uncle knew that my niece is in this particular job. Mary at the feet of Jesus by dark bachelor tells us this that Simon no Peter that priest who is the uncle to Mary was amongst those who had gone to identify Mary when she was going in that very act and when Jesus is coming to forgive her. He felt guilty that when leprosy came upon him those 10 lepers he was one amongst them. You read the story in that book Mary at the feet of Jesus by that bachelor. It tells you that of all the 10 that were healed, it is only the Samaritan who came back to give thanksgiving. This priest never came back. That is the uncle of Mary. And because of the guilt, he went and prepared a meal. And when he went and prepared a meal, he invited Jesus into his home. And when he invited Jesus into his home, who who comes? Guess church members, the niece comes into that home. And as they are dining because of the guilt he had, that is when this woman comes and finds where Jesus was. And again she takes her hair and washes the feet of Christ Jesus with her tears. And when this Peter again the uncle saw he started thinking in his mind and says, "If only Jesus knew who it is that is doing what she's doing." And that is when Jesus rebuked the men that were in the house again. and stooping down he lifted up this lady for the fourth time in that plan of redemption he lifts that lady way after and he says listen he who has be been forgiven much loves the more but this is not what happened immediately allow me to have it on the screen again brothers and sisters when they have accused her of what has happened she has fallen down and her life is almost being taken away that is when they all come and Christ does what stoops down and begins to write Number one. Number two, he tells them if there is anyone around here who has no sin, let them do what? Throw the first stone. Number two, in verse 8, he says, "And again he stooped down." Number two, he was doing it. When everyone had looked down and they had seen that their sin was there, they all vanished. That is when he stooped down. Number three and the last one. He lifted up the lady and asked her the simple question, "Where are they that accused you?" And she said, "I don't see them." Then he says this once, "Neither do I accuse you. Go woman and sin no more." How many times did Jesus sto members? How many times church members? How many times again? Listen to this. With all their professions of reverence for the law, these rabbis in bringing the charge against the woman were disregarding its very provisions. It was the husband's duty to take action against her and the guilty parties were to be punished. Desire of Ages 461. Equally, the action of the accusers was holy unauthorized. Jesus, however, met them on their own ground. The law specified that in punishing punishment by stoning, the witnesses in the case should be the first to cast a stone. Now rising and fixing his eyes upon the plotting elders, Jesus said, "He that is without sin among you, let him be the first one to cast a stone on her." Then Desire of Ages says this, "And stooping down, he continued writing on the ground." The same same paragraph as I conclude. says, "Jesus looked for a moment upon the scene. The trembling victim in her shame, the hard-faced dignitaries devoid of even human pity. His spirit of stainless purity shrank from the spectacle. Well, he knew for what purpose this case had been brought to him. He read the heart and he knew the character and the life history of everyone in his presence. These will be guardians of justice had they themselves led their victim into sin. Because they themselves had led the victim into sin. This is what I was narrating. That they might lay a snare on Jesus. Giving no sign that he had had their attention or question. He stooped and fixed his eyes upon the ground and upon the victim and began to write. Brothers and sisters, I'm here today to allow us fix our eyes upon what Christ has stooped to do on our behalf. Church members, there are some that have stooped to circulate unfavorable reports. There are some that have stooped to indulge in contemptable gossip. There are some that have stooped so low to bear burdens that are poisonous in their lives as fruit. And some have continued to stoop with hatred one with another. There are some that have stooped so low to kill each other. But if only they could see the creator of the universe stooping down on their behalf, how bait they will linger again. Now listen to me church members and I would like to request every one of you to be on your feet please. Desire of ages says these church members Christ has stooped in all the human race lifetime. He stooped at creation, at the plan of salvation. He stooped not only at the plan of salvation, but at the plan of redemption. And in redeeming mankind, he has stooped. Desire of Ages finishes by this. He will never cease to stoop until he has seen the last of the human race in his bosom. No, no, no, no, no. Somebody didn't hear what I said. He will never cease to stoop until he sees all that he died for in his bosom. All eyes closed, all heads bowed. If there be anyone here today who thinks that your life has gone so low that Christ can't stoop down for you to lift you up, allow me to assure you today, Christ will never cease to stoop down until he has seen you in his bosom. If there is any parent here today who thinks their children have strayed so far that he can't stoop down to deliver them, allow me to say Christ will walk with you by stooping down until he delivers your children. If there's anyone who thinks that the church of God has fallen so much down, allow me to let you know. He is not only at the helm of this church. At the helm of the church, but he has stooped down to hold this ship not to sink. He is in his church. Allow me to even talk to spouses here today. If any one of you thinks, if any one of you has any doubt that your spouse has gone astray that cannot be delivered, allow me to let you know. Allow me to let you know. Christ has stooped on behalf of your spouse. There was a man who came here 3 weeks ago and the wife had accused him of raping the daughter. The man has been in prison for more than 11 years. The accusation was false. He was a reverend of a Sunday keeping church. New Life has been going to minister at Nairobi Remand prison. That man was there. Long story short, it is at that moment that he knew about the Sabbath truth. He converted, was baptized, he became a Sabbathke keeper. Christ had stooped down for him, too. Not only that, when he was released 3 weeks ago, the first stop he made is right here in our offices. When the Sunday church members were looking for him to give him back the church, he said, "I have understood the Sabbath message and the three angels message. Christ did it all for me." Today, the church is embracing him and that man is going to be one of the ministers of the Seventh Day Adventist Church. Stooped down. The very week a young man comes into this office again. Having been accused of murder and many other things, New Life Church ministered to that young man in prison. On 1st of May, he was released from prison. He came to that office and he cried and said, "I want to change my life." Are you listening? P church members with your heads bowed and your eyes closed listen to this very carefully. There are people that have understood the plan of redemption and salvation and they have accepted that Christ has stooped in their behalf. This young man gives us the phone number of the mother and asks us to call the mother and the mother says this one word the government has not shot him. I want him to be shot dead for me to go and pick his body and bury it. Painful as it sounded, I used my mediation skills and my little counseling skills and convinced the mother to travel all the way from the village and come here. She came on a Sabbath morning and sat on that corner there where Elder Rotic and Elder Yo and Elder Munda teach their class. The son was teaching on sitting on that corner there. They never saw eye to eye the entire day. When evening came, we took them to the office. I spoke to the son separately, spoke to the mother separately and then come at the moment when I had to bring them together. The mother who had wanted the son shot embraced the son in tears. They left this compound holding hand to hand. To date, that young man is transformed and preparing himself to start a new life. He refused to go home. He said, "I want to remain in new life." But like Jesus told that man from Gaderea, we also told him, "Go back to your home and testify of what God has done for you." Church members, if there is anyone here today, may this sacrifice of Christ Jesus remind you, he stooped down for you. He stooped down for your spouse. He stooped down for your son and for your daughter. Don't you ever give up. Loving Jesus. One more time. When you had expressed how you have stooped down from creation, it never stopped there. Before you left to heaven again, you gathered the disciples together. You put a towel round about your waist and you stooped down again and washed the feet of the disciples, showing them that this is the ministry that we shall have one with another. How bait we ought to serve one another. And today, dear father, as we commemorate this ordinance of humility, let it not just be a ritual, one of its kind, enable us also to learn how to be humble enough to stoop down and put others needs first as we stoop low like you did. Father, I'm here at this moment making a call for those who have not witnessed the experience that Christ you did for us. Not just in creation, in the plan of salvation and redemption, but even in the plan of restoration. And if there's anyone who has had a doubt before that your son can never be delivered, I would like you to lift up your hand. If there's anyone who has a doubt that your daughter will never be delivered, I'd like you to lift up your hand. And if there's anyone who ever thinks that their parent, their spouse cannot be delivered, today I'm here to let you know that the ultimate sacrifice of Christ delivers even to the uttermost. Just raise your hand. Thank you for those hands. Please raise them up properly. Thank you for those hands. Thank you for those hands. Father, because you see in secret and answer publicly, come through for us, heavenly father, and especially for those that have raised up their hands, that none of us may give up on our children, none of us may give up on our spouses. None of us may give up on our families and none of us may give up on this family because indeed you gave up your life and stoop down to lift us up that one day in the near future rest and only rest shall be when each one of us shall be at the bosom of Christ Jesus. So I pray grant victory upon those whom their loved ones have raised their hands that as they stand in the gap in their behalf please my father as you stoop down to lift Mary and gave her a new life if prayed today stoop down one more time and lift up those to whom their loved ones have raised to their hands. We thank you for we know you've heard and answered our prayer for these things we have prayed in Jesus name. Amen. Please be seated.

[25.8s] amen to that.
[27.4s] Thank you very much, Daniel. and uh
[29.5s] Elijah and was that Joshua?
[32.9s] Yes, Daniel, Elijah and Joshua. Uh I
[36.6s] have a sense there's a sense in which I
[38.4s] feel the sermon was already done and we
[41.8s] only needed to just focus ourselves on
[44.6s] the holy communion. I almost wanted to
[47.9s] ask all in favor say I. So that I just
[52.2s] pray but I'm feeling like you might say
[55.2s] yes and then I just have to go and see
[57.0s] it. So I don't want to put you into that
[59.4s] temptation.
[64.6s] Last week we had a number of uh berments
[69.1s] and uh yesterday we were divided into
[72.4s] different locations. I know that my
[75.2s] colleague Pastor Polycap left for Eldor
[78.6s] a little bit earlier I think early in
[81.2s] the week middle in the middle part of
[83.0s] the week and my colleague Pastor Elvis
[87.8s] was at Muaroni yesterday I traveled to
[92.4s] Yamira Kiriggo yesterday
[95.7s] and all of us who are there to comfort
[97.5s] the families that had lost their loved
[99.3s] ones from this church. I pray to God
[102.0s] that you may continue to put them in
[104.4s] prayer.
[106.5s] I also want to thank God for the lessons
[110.3s] that we learned by the day. And believe
[113.6s] you me, this day I feel as if I have
[118.5s] felt the lesson that all those that were
[122.6s] locked out of Noah's ark,
[126.8s] I was part of those that were locked
[128.4s] outside. It's unfortunate
[132.0s] because
[134.3s] some of you might not know that I've
[137.1s] actually landed this morning from
[140.4s] kissing.
[142.3s] What happened is a terrible lesson for
[144.6s] me and I told my wife, please don't
[147.1s] don't don't don't don't put it deep so
[149.4s] that I can get it. I want to teach
[151.5s] myself a lesson so that I don't miss
[153.1s] when Christ comes again.
[155.8s] It was raining very heavy from Oyuki's
[157.8s] all the way to Aero
[159.8s] and uh the driver that was dropping me
[161.8s] at uh Kisumu couldn't see. So we
[166.0s] struggled our way and when we reached
[167.8s] Aero and we are heading now to Kisumu
[170.1s] town.
[171.7s] Hell broke loose.
[174.6s] It is as if all
[177.4s] persons that work in the city were
[180.7s] headed for the weekend in Kisumu. And so
[183.9s] they were all vehicles all through. So
[186.2s] we were going at 2 cm per hour if
[190.7s] there's such a thing. And I was actually
[194.0s] looking at it and I'm saying my flight
[196.1s] is gone. The flight was supposed to take
[199.2s] off at 8.
[202.7s] And at 7:56 I am in a for those of you
[206.9s] who understand what I'm talking about.
[210.0s] I bowed my head because I didn't want to
[213.0s] see what the driver is doing. And I
[214.6s] said, I want to pray. I told God, God, I
[218.5s] remember a time Joshua prayed and you
[222.0s] stopped the sun.
[224.4s] Do something that that flight might be
[226.6s] stopped.
[228.3s] Allow me to let you know this morning,
[229.9s] brothers and sisters, that the flight
[231.8s] was stopped.
[240.4s] I testify yes that the flight was
[242.7s] stopped up to 8:35
[246.0s] but you need to ask me what time I
[247.9s] landed there. So did God answer my
[249.6s] prayer? Yes or no?
[251.2s] He did. And I thought to myself indeed
[254.8s] God has answered my prayer because by
[257.8s] the time we are arriving it was 8:33.
[265.2s] And so when I'm moving in, we reach at
[267.8s] the gate and for heaven's sake, I don't
[270.5s] understand why the policemen there are
[273.3s] trying to put all the gadget and trying
[275.1s] to say now fix this number. Remove this
[277.1s] number. Fix this number. I'm saying I'm
[279.2s] getting late.
[281.5s] No, no, no, no. Fix this number. And
[283.4s] they're telling the driver, you've got
[284.6s] to get the ticket. Fix this number.
[286.2s] Don't remove this one. Fix the guy is
[287.8s] not getting it cuz I'm under pressure. I
[290.2s] felt like getting out and running to the
[292.2s] gate. And to cut the whole story short
[295.3s] is that I reached there and I was told
[298.2s] the gate has been closed. Now while I'm
[302.1s] rushing I called their airline and I
[304.6s] told them I'm running late. Can I make
[306.6s] it? They said try and run. We are
[308.4s] waiting for you. And as I'm doing that I
[311.2s] tried to keep the lady busy that was
[312.7s] talking to me. And as I'm talking to
[315.5s] her, my phone went off.
[318.2s] Had it not gone off, I'm sure that lady
[320.6s] would have kept me busy until I reached
[322.7s] there. And indeed, I testify that
[325.3s] because when I reached, she was actually
[327.0s] kept on looking at me. When she when I
[328.6s] arrived, that's when she says,
[330.6s] "Seriously, sorry. They actually have
[333.7s] closed the flight door. Had they not
[335.6s] closed the flight door would have taken
[337.2s] you in." I looked down and I told
[340.5s] myself, "Here cometh the Noah's
[343.8s] experience."
[346.2s] So I had to be there the entire night. I
[349.6s] just flew in this morning.
[353.6s] Hallelujah.
[357.5s] Today we are celebrating the Lord's
[362.1s] supper.
[364.7s] I do not know what happened, but I gave
[366.6s] the song 281, but I think whoever must
[369.8s] have given it out gave it as 181. My
[374.2s] apologies for that. And I'm requesting
[376.3s] that we sing it one more time. 281.
[381.2s] Turn your attention to SDA Hypnos 281.
[396.8s] As you sing that song, I would like you
[398.5s] to understand that I have heard uh Dr.
[401.5s] Moger stand up here and say that let us
[404.2s] begin planning on how we shall give.
[408.2s] I heard my elder, our first elder stand
[410.8s] again and told us passionately how we
[414.1s] need to prepare to give.
[418.0s] And I would like you not to look at how
[420.7s] much we should give or what it is that
[423.5s] we have to give. But I want you before
[426.5s] you imagine to give or to even think to
[428.8s] give to look at the ultimate sacrifice
[432.3s] of Christ Jesus which he himself gave
[438.4s] and try and compare that with what you
[441.4s] want to give. You will find that what it
[443.9s] is that we want to give is way below the
[447.3s] mark compared with what he gave. I gave
[452.2s] my life for thee.
[465.4s] I gave my life for thee.
[471.4s] My precious blood shall
[480.6s] be me
[483.3s] and we from the dead.
[489.3s] I give I give my life for thee. What
[496.0s] does thou give for me?
[501.6s] I gave I gave my life for thee. What
[509.6s] are thee for me?
[514.1s] My father's
[516.2s] house of light.
[520.3s] My glory
[522.4s] of control.
[526.6s] I live for all
[532.7s] for
[539.0s] I
[543.8s] for thee as
[548.5s] for me.
[551.8s] I let I let it all for thee as thou
[560.2s] art for me.
[564.6s] I s
[567.8s] for thee
[571.0s] more than my
[574.3s] can.
[577.6s] Oh,
[580.6s] God
[583.7s] to rescue me from
[590.1s] my
[595.0s] fore.
[596.9s] What has thou
[600.0s] for me
[608.2s] for thee? What was thou
[613.8s] for me?
[619.1s] Blessed redeemer,
[622.6s] give us a glimpse of heaven to fathom
[624.6s] the song that we have sung,
[628.2s] this is not just another song. It's your
[630.5s] story.
[632.9s] And it is a question that you're giving
[634.9s] unto us
[638.0s] that it may left it may leave us
[639.8s] pondering on what you've given us.
[643.2s] Yet thou has asked, "What have we given
[646.8s] you?"
[648.6s] And so today as we deliberate on this
[651.3s] sacrifice that was made on the cross,
[654.5s] your broken body and the blood that
[657.4s] cleanses us. Oh, we pray heavenly father
[660.4s] that the Holy Spirit may impress these
[661.9s] things upon our hearts to give us the
[663.4s] conviction of heaven that indeed we may
[666.2s] be drawn closer to you.
[668.7s] So speak to us at this moment and my
[671.5s] father because it is not any one of our
[673.8s] day, it's your day. Allow heavenly
[676.6s] father that each one of us may be
[677.9s] blotted out from the minds of this
[680.6s] congregation and Christ may you be
[682.4s] exalted as you draw all of us to
[684.7s] yourself. These things I ask in Jesus
[686.9s] name. And let God's children say amen.
[689.5s] Amen.
[700.5s] Allow me to
[702.8s] take you to the book of John chapter 8.
[709.8s] And in the first 12 verses,
[713.0s] there is a story there that I don't want
[716.0s] to put my emphasis so much in the story,
[719.7s] but I want to put an emphasis on in an
[722.4s] act that Jesus did.
[726.7s] I know some of you have read that story.
[728.6s] We have been preached to from that story
[730.6s] again and again.
[733.6s] But I want to pick an act that Christ
[736.6s] did that reflects the very story of
[739.6s] redemption.
[741.1s] From the word go
[743.3s] in Genesis to the very word last in
[747.3s] Revelation, what he shall do and what he
[749.5s] has done and what he has been doing.
[753.2s] And so, not to speak about Mary, but to
[756.7s] speak about Christ. Allow me to take you
[758.9s] to verse six.
[761.4s] The title of my message this afternoon
[765.4s] is he still stoops for me. The Bible
[770.6s] says in verse six this they said testing
[775.4s] him. Now you all know what has happened.
[778.0s] Certain lady has been found committing
[779.8s] adultery and they want to test Christ
[782.1s] Jesus. They have all come and they have
[785.4s] brought her closer to the temple where
[788.8s] Christ is teaching.
[791.5s] And whilst they are teaching, brothers
[793.1s] and sisters, I like I just want you to
[795.3s] look at it. Put your mind in that
[797.1s] particular picture, not on the lady, but
[799.0s] on what Christ shall do because that's
[800.6s] where I want to take you to. And as they
[803.1s] bring the lady, they throw her down
[805.0s] there. And desire of ages tells me that
[808.6s] that victim was shaking and trembling
[811.4s] because her anticipation was that stones
[815.0s] were going to be laid upon her one after
[817.7s] the other because that was to be the
[819.8s] last of her days. And so the Bible tells
[822.7s] me in verse six that now they said this
[825.8s] testing him that they might have
[828.4s] something of which to do what church.
[831.7s] Somebody's reading that. To do what?
[834.6s] accuse him. But Jesus, and I would like
[837.5s] you to read it from the screen. But
[839.0s] Jesus did what?
[841.4s] What did Jesus do?
[844.1s] Are you hearing me from this side? What
[845.6s] did Jesus do?
[848.1s] What is stooping down? The Bible tells
[852.0s] me, "And Jesus stooped down and wrote on
[855.1s] the ground with his finger as though he
[857.9s] did not do what?" Here. Put your fingers
[860.9s] there and go with me to verse eight. The
[863.8s] Bible tells me in verse 8, "And again,"
[867.5s] put it for me on the screen. The Bible
[869.1s] says what? And again, he did what?
[873.8s] Now, I want you to note that three
[875.7s] times. Let's read it together. The Bible
[877.2s] says, "And again he did what?" He
[880.2s] stooped down and wrote where? On the
[883.0s] ground. How many times did he write?
[884.7s] Two. Allow me church members to let you
[887.9s] know that this act of stooping down has
[892.2s] been an act of God from the very word
[895.6s] go. It was his act in the plan of
[899.2s] salvation. It was his act in the plan of
[903.1s] redemption. It will be his act in the
[906.3s] plan of restoration.
[909.5s] Put for me on the screen the very first
[911.8s] slide that I have for us.
[914.7s] In Genesis,
[917.2s] Christ when he was creating,
[921.3s] he stooped down. I'm waiting for it.
[925.9s] In Genesis, go with me to the second
[927.8s] slide. In Genesis
[931.2s] when Christ was creating
[934.7s] the book Desire of Ages says this in
[938.0s] creation
[939.6s] the master and his father in agreement
[944.2s] stooped down to make man in their image.
[949.1s] And so number one, I would like us to
[951.0s] understand that this act that you find
[952.7s] in the book of John chapter 8 verse 6
[955.8s] and verse 8. It is an act that didn't
[959.1s] begin then is an act that began way back
[962.7s] in creation. You find Christ going down
[965.6s] with his father and there they are
[968.4s] molding. And make no mistake brothers
[971.3s] and sisters, it wasn't an easy thing
[974.2s] after that because when you read the
[976.5s] book uh no desire of ages but story of
[979.1s] redemption in the chapter the plan of
[981.8s] salvation, it tells us that immediately
[984.6s] they had stooped down and man fell
[988.5s] again. Number two, he stooped down again
[992.6s] to take the form of humanity that in it
[996.0s] he might be able to deliver yourself and
[998.2s] myself. Somebody say amen to that.
[1000.6s] And I'm going to read you a caption here
[1002.2s] from the book story of redemption pages
[1004.9s] 36 paragraph 42 paragraph 1. Now when
[1009.7s] man had fallen they had had a very good
[1012.0s] communion with the father and the son.
[1014.0s] We are told when you read that chap that
[1015.4s] book I like to ask every one of you to
[1017.5s] get the book of story of redemption and
[1019.0s] you go through it. It is a powerful
[1020.6s] book. It starts with the chapter Lucifer
[1022.6s] and then it goes to creation. Then it
[1024.4s] goes to the plan of salvation. It goes
[1026.1s] all the way down and it tells us the
[1028.3s] story as it were. Brothers and sisters,
[1031.2s] there was a grand and beautiful
[1033.0s] communion between the father and the son
[1035.3s] and then the son and also Adam and Eve.
[1037.8s] It is elaborated so very well. But when
[1040.5s] man fell,
[1043.2s] we are told that Christ Jesus
[1046.2s] had to go inside the throne of the
[1049.6s] father. Let me read it. It says, "I saw
[1053.6s] the lovely Jesus and beheld an
[1057.0s] expression of sympathy and sorrow upon
[1059.8s] his countenance.
[1061.8s] Soon I saw him approach the exiting
[1065.4s] bright light with which enshrouded the m
[1068.0s] the father and bowing down said my
[1071.7s] accompanying angel, he is in close
[1075.1s] converse with his father.
[1077.8s] The angels that were surrounding the
[1079.8s] master had thrown down their crowns
[1083.3s] because they saw the sorrow that was in
[1086.1s] the eyes and in the face of the master.
[1088.9s] He was about to do something beyond what
[1092.4s] they could fathom. And because of that,
[1095.2s] the anxiety of the angels seemed to be
[1097.8s] intense while Jesus was communing with
[1101.0s] his father. Listen to this. Three times
[1105.8s] he was shut in by the glorious light
[1109.0s] about the father. And at the third time
[1113.1s] only then when he had stooped down that
[1116.7s] he may in the future take the human form
[1120.6s] that he came out from the father his
[1122.9s] person could be seen. Now listen to me.
[1125.0s] Let me explain that brothers and
[1126.2s] sisters.
[1127.7s] Don't ever imagine, don't ever think
[1129.6s] that it was an easy thing for the father
[1132.0s] to have released the son. The Bible
[1134.1s] tells me, know spiritual prophecy says,
[1136.2s] how many times did he go inside? Three
[1138.4s] times. The angels had almost wanted to
[1143.0s] give their lives a ransom. And one thing
[1145.9s] happened. Jesus explained to them that
[1149.6s] the law and the standard of God's law is
[1152.5s] so high that even the life of an angel
[1155.4s] cannot redeem mankind. It only had to
[1158.2s] take him to come and take when he
[1161.1s] explained to the angel that and he gave
[1163.6s] them a glimpse a panorama of what is
[1166.6s] going to happen in the future about
[1169.8s] himself. They all took their crowns and
[1172.7s] threw them down because this was the
[1174.7s] commander of heaven himself and he had
[1176.6s] explained what was going to happen. It
[1178.5s] tells me here that he entered into the
[1181.0s] glorious abboard of the father and he
[1183.5s] pleaded with him after explaining to him
[1185.6s] what was going to take place. And guess
[1187.5s] what? The father never gave an answer.
[1189.4s] He came out and the angels were still
[1191.4s] looking down because salvation for the
[1194.0s] human race had not yet been sealed. He
[1196.2s] went in the second time. He spoke to the
[1198.3s] father. The father never gave an answer.
[1200.2s] He came out and the angels still their
[1202.9s] faces were down because all the human
[1205.2s] race that was come after Adam was had
[1208.3s] not yet been sealed. Their salvation had
[1209.9s] not been sealed. He went in the third
[1212.6s] time and explained to the father and
[1215.3s] together when they looked at the
[1216.4s] panorama and saw everyone that shall be
[1219.3s] saved because of the ultimate sacrifice
[1221.6s] of Christ, the father nodded to the son.
[1224.2s] And that is when when the son came out
[1226.7s] after accepting to take the form of man
[1230.1s] by stooping down that he was able to be
[1233.4s] accepted and when he came out the angels
[1235.6s] shouted hallelujah because the plan of
[1238.1s] salvation was sealed
[1240.4s] stooping down. Number two, the book
[1243.4s] Philippians chapter 2 from verse 5 to
[1245.4s] verse 80 says, "He who was equal with
[1248.2s] God thought it not robbery to be equal
[1250.9s] with God, but he accepted to take the
[1253.4s] form of who? Mankind. He stooped down."
[1257.0s] Number two, brothers and sisters, allow
[1259.5s] me to take you to the third time when
[1261.9s] the sec the third time when he stooped
[1263.6s] down. Bring it to me on the screen
[1264.9s] again. And I would like you to
[1266.2s] understand that in the plan of creation,
[1269.8s] the Lord stooped down. In the plan of
[1273.1s] salvation, as they sat with the father,
[1275.4s] the son again stooped down. And in the
[1278.5s] plan of redemption, the son stooped down
[1282.9s] again. That he had to take the cross and
[1286.2s] die the death of the cross that you and
[1290.5s] I might find salvation. This is what it
[1293.3s] says in uh ministry acts of the apostles
[1296.5s] page 473.
[1299.4s] This stooping will be forever. He
[1302.8s] stooped in creation. He stooped in the
[1305.6s] plan of salvation. He stooping to pay
[1307.8s] the price for the sinner. The son of God
[1311.5s] stooped to uplift the unfallen. He gave
[1315.8s] up what was his that we might have what
[1319.2s] belonged to him. and he took what
[1321.8s] belonged to us that we may have what
[1324.2s] belonged to him. What manner of love,
[1326.2s] brothers and sisters, Bible, the pen of
[1328.8s] inspiration continues to say the son of
[1331.0s] God stooped to uplift the fallen. For
[1334.6s] this he left the sinless worlds on high.
[1338.7s] Christ stooped, it continues, Christ
[1341.7s] stooped to take upon himself the human
[1343.9s] nature that he might reach the fallen
[1346.6s] race and lift them up. And brothers and
[1349.1s] sisters, then that takes me to the last
[1351.6s] stooping, which makes the context of our
[1354.3s] message today. And so number one, he
[1356.9s] stooped during creation. Number two, he
[1359.7s] stooped again to enter into the holiest
[1362.6s] of the father to accept that he may take
[1365.0s] the human form. Number three, he stooped
[1367.6s] during redemption that he may lift up
[1370.5s] the human race. And now listen to what
[1373.0s] he has done in John chapter 8. And give
[1375.0s] it to me again on the screen. And this
[1377.2s] is where you find John chapter 8
[1381.4s] 6 in that particular story. Mankind has
[1385.0s] fallen into sin. And that is exhibited
[1389.0s] by the life of Mary Magdalene. Mary and
[1393.2s] Martha and Lazarus had been left by
[1395.9s] their parents at a tender age. Their
[1399.0s] uncle who was a priest in the Sanhedrin
[1402.9s] didn't want to really take good care of
[1405.3s] them. And so he releases them. When you
[1407.8s] read Doug Bachelor's book Mary at the
[1410.1s] feet of Jesus, it tells you that it is
[1412.5s] the uncle of Mary that introduced him to
[1416.1s] prostitution that he may gather for
[1418.2s] herself and left Lazarus to do that work
[1421.1s] that he did by himself and Martha was
[1424.2s] with her. This was this family at
[1425.9s] Bethany Magdala. And Christ knowing what
[1429.4s] had happened to this family tells us he
[1431.7s] drew himself closer to this particular
[1434.6s] family that he may identify with their
[1437.4s] infirmities. Brothers and sisters, it is
[1439.8s] at that time when Mary is in her usual
[1442.6s] business which the uncle had introduced
[1445.9s] her to and several times again and again
[1450.4s] the uncle knew that my niece is in this
[1454.2s] particular job. Mary at the feet of
[1457.3s] Jesus by dark bachelor tells us this
[1459.9s] that Simon no Peter that priest who is
[1463.4s] the uncle to Mary was amongst those who
[1466.3s] had gone to identify Mary when she was
[1469.1s] going in that very act and when Jesus is
[1472.6s] coming to forgive her. He felt guilty
[1476.4s] that when leprosy came upon him those 10
[1479.4s] lepers he was one amongst them. You read
[1481.6s] the story in that book Mary at the feet
[1483.8s] of Jesus by that bachelor. It tells you
[1485.8s] that of all the 10 that were healed, it
[1489.4s] is only the Samaritan who came back to
[1491.9s] give thanksgiving. This priest never
[1494.2s] came back. That is the uncle of Mary.
[1496.3s] And because of the guilt, he went and
[1498.5s] prepared a meal. And when he went and
[1500.4s] prepared a meal, he invited Jesus into
[1502.4s] his home. And when he invited Jesus into
[1504.5s] his home, who who comes? Guess church
[1506.6s] members, the niece comes into that home.
[1509.1s] And as they are dining because of the
[1510.6s] guilt he had, that is when this woman
[1513.1s] comes and finds where Jesus was. And
[1515.9s] again she takes her hair and washes the
[1518.6s] feet of Christ Jesus with her tears. And
[1520.8s] when this Peter again the uncle saw he
[1524.2s] started thinking in his mind and says,
[1526.0s] "If only Jesus knew who it is that is
[1530.4s] doing what she's doing." And that is
[1531.9s] when Jesus rebuked the men that were in
[1534.6s] the house again. and stooping down he
[1536.8s] lifted up this lady for the fourth time
[1539.6s] in that plan of redemption he lifts that
[1541.8s] lady way after and he says listen he who
[1545.4s] has be been forgiven much loves the more
[1548.8s] but this is not what happened
[1550.2s] immediately allow me to have it on the
[1551.8s] screen again brothers and sisters when
[1553.7s] they have accused her of what has
[1555.6s] happened she has fallen down and her
[1558.4s] life is almost being taken away that is
[1561.0s] when they all come and Christ does what
[1563.3s] stoops down and begins to write Number
[1565.6s] one. Number two, he tells them if there
[1569.0s] is anyone around here who has no sin,
[1572.2s] let them do what? Throw the first stone.
[1574.7s] Number two, in verse 8, he says, "And
[1576.7s] again he stooped down." Number two, he
[1579.4s] was doing it. When everyone had looked
[1582.1s] down and they had seen that their sin
[1584.6s] was there, they all vanished. That is
[1587.6s] when he stooped down. Number three and
[1589.5s] the last one. He lifted up the lady
[1593.0s] and asked her the simple question,
[1595.4s] "Where are they that accused you?" And
[1599.2s] she said, "I don't see them." Then he
[1602.2s] says this once, "Neither do I accuse
[1606.2s] you. Go woman and sin no more." How many
[1611.2s] times did Jesus sto members? How many
[1614.4s] times church members? How many times
[1617.2s] again? Listen to this.
[1621.0s] With all their professions of reverence
[1623.5s] for the law, these rabbis in bringing
[1627.0s] the charge against the woman were
[1629.6s] disregarding its very provisions. It was
[1632.7s] the husband's duty to take action
[1635.4s] against her and the guilty parties were
[1638.4s] to be punished. Desire of Ages 461.
[1640.4s] Equally, the action of the accusers was
[1643.8s] holy unauthorized.
[1646.3s] Jesus, however, met them on their own
[1649.8s] ground. The law specified that in
[1652.2s] punishing punishment by stoning, the
[1654.8s] witnesses in the case should be the
[1656.5s] first to cast a stone. Now rising and
[1660.0s] fixing his eyes upon the plotting
[1662.1s] elders, Jesus said, "He that is without
[1666.2s] sin among you, let him be the first one
[1669.3s] to cast a stone on her." Then Desire of
[1671.6s] Ages says this, "And stooping down, he
[1675.0s] continued writing on the ground." The
[1677.6s] same same paragraph as I conclude. says,
[1679.9s] "Jesus looked for a moment upon the
[1682.2s] scene. The trembling victim in her
[1685.0s] shame, the hard-faced dignitaries devoid
[1688.0s] of even human pity. His spirit of
[1691.1s] stainless purity shrank from the
[1692.9s] spectacle. Well, he knew for what
[1695.7s] purpose this case had been brought to
[1697.4s] him. He read the heart and he knew the
[1699.9s] character and the life history of
[1702.2s] everyone in his presence. These will be
[1705.0s] guardians of justice had they themselves
[1707.6s] led their victim into sin. Because they
[1709.6s] themselves had led the victim into sin.
[1711.4s] This is what I was narrating. That they
[1713.4s] might lay a snare on Jesus. Giving no
[1716.8s] sign that he had had their attention or
[1719.3s] question. He stooped and fixed his eyes
[1723.0s] upon the ground and upon the victim and
[1725.8s] began to write. Brothers and sisters,
[1728.2s] I'm here today to allow us fix our eyes
[1733.3s] upon what Christ has stooped to do on
[1736.9s] our behalf.
[1741.6s] Church members, there are some that have
[1744.5s] stooped to circulate unfavorable
[1746.8s] reports. There are some that have
[1749.0s] stooped to indulge in contemptable
[1751.4s] gossip. There are some that have stooped
[1753.7s] so low to bear burdens that are
[1756.4s] poisonous in their lives as fruit. And
[1758.9s] some have continued to stoop with hatred
[1762.0s] one with another. There are some that
[1763.9s] have stooped so low to kill each other.
[1767.2s] But if only they could see the creator
[1770.2s] of the universe stooping down on their
[1773.0s] behalf, how bait
[1775.8s] they will linger again. Now listen to me
[1778.8s] church members and I would like to
[1781.0s] request every one of you to be on your
[1783.3s] feet
[1784.9s] please.
[1796.0s] Desire of ages says these church members
[1800.0s] Christ has stooped in all the human race
[1805.0s] lifetime.
[1806.5s] He stooped at creation, at the plan of
[1809.5s] salvation. He stooped not only at the
[1812.1s] plan of salvation, but at the plan of
[1814.4s] redemption. And in redeeming mankind, he
[1817.6s] has stooped. Desire of Ages finishes by
[1819.9s] this. He will never cease to stoop until
[1823.9s] he has seen the last of the human race
[1826.4s] in his bosom.
[1828.4s] No, no, no, no, no. Somebody didn't hear
[1830.1s] what I said. He will never cease to
[1833.4s] stoop until he sees all that he died for
[1837.8s] in his bosom.
[1842.6s] All eyes closed,
[1845.5s] all heads bowed.
[1851.6s] If there be anyone here today
[1855.6s] who thinks that your life has gone so
[1857.7s] low that Christ can't stoop down for you
[1860.3s] to lift you up, allow me to assure you
[1863.5s] today, Christ will never cease to stoop
[1866.8s] down until he has seen you in his bosom.
[1871.8s] If there is any parent here today who
[1874.3s] thinks their children have strayed so
[1876.8s] far that he can't stoop down to deliver
[1880.1s] them, allow me to say Christ will walk
[1883.8s] with you by stooping down until he
[1887.5s] delivers your children.
[1889.8s] If there's anyone who thinks that the
[1891.8s] church of God has fallen so much down,
[1895.4s] allow me to let you know. He is not only
[1898.8s] at the helm of this church. At the helm
[1902.7s] of the church,
[1904.9s] but he has stooped down to hold this
[1907.7s] ship not to sink. He is in his church.
[1913.0s] Allow me to even talk to spouses here
[1915.7s] today. If any one of you thinks, if any
[1918.2s] one of you has any doubt that your
[1921.0s] spouse has gone astray that cannot be
[1923.9s] delivered, allow me to let you know.
[1927.4s] Allow me to let you know. Christ has
[1930.6s] stooped on behalf of your spouse.
[1935.0s] There was a man who came here 3 weeks
[1938.4s] ago and the wife had accused him
[1943.8s] of raping the daughter.
[1946.4s] The man has been in prison
[1949.8s] for more than 11 years.
[1952.6s] The accusation was false.
[1955.4s] He was a reverend of a Sunday keeping
[1957.8s] church. New Life has been going to
[1961.5s] minister at Nairobi Remand prison. That
[1965.0s] man was there.
[1967.8s] Long story short, it is at that moment
[1971.0s] that he knew about the Sabbath truth. He
[1975.7s] converted, was baptized, he became a
[1978.6s] Sabbathke keeper. Christ had stooped
[1981.8s] down for him, too.
[1984.2s] Not only that, when he was released 3
[1987.4s] weeks ago, the first stop he made is
[1991.1s] right here in our offices. When the
[1993.9s] Sunday church members were looking for
[1996.3s] him to give him back the church, he
[1998.4s] said, "I have understood the Sabbath
[2002.4s] message and the three angels message.
[2006.0s] Christ did it all for me."
[2009.3s] Today, the church is embracing him and
[2012.3s] that man is going to be one of the
[2014.6s] ministers of the Seventh Day Adventist
[2016.0s] Church. Stooped down. The very week a
[2020.9s] young man comes into this office again.
[2023.8s] Having been accused of murder and many
[2026.7s] other things,
[2028.5s] New Life Church ministered to that young
[2030.5s] man in prison.
[2032.8s] On 1st of May, he was released from
[2035.8s] prison. He came to that office and he
[2038.3s] cried and said, "I want to change my
[2042.2s] life." Are you listening? P church
[2044.6s] members with your heads bowed and your
[2046.9s] eyes closed listen to this very
[2048.6s] carefully. There are people that have
[2050.4s] understood the plan of redemption and
[2052.5s] salvation and they have accepted that
[2054.7s] Christ has stooped in their behalf. This
[2057.5s] young man gives us the phone number of
[2059.8s] the mother and asks us to call the
[2062.5s] mother and the mother says this one word
[2068.6s] the government has not shot him. I want
[2071.4s] him to be shot dead for me to go and
[2073.9s] pick his body and bury it.
[2077.0s] Painful as it sounded, I used my
[2079.9s] mediation skills and my little
[2082.2s] counseling skills and convinced the
[2084.7s] mother to travel all the way from the
[2087.3s] village and come here. She came on a
[2090.8s] Sabbath morning and sat on that corner
[2093.0s] there where Elder Rotic and Elder Yo and
[2095.8s] Elder Munda teach their class. The son
[2098.6s] was teaching on sitting on that corner
[2100.6s] there. They never saw eye to eye the
[2103.0s] entire day.
[2105.0s] When evening came, we took them to the
[2108.0s] office. I spoke to the son separately,
[2111.4s] spoke to the mother separately and then
[2114.2s] come at the moment when I had to bring
[2115.9s] them together. The mother who had wanted
[2118.9s] the son shot embraced the son in tears.
[2124.2s] They left this compound holding hand to
[2126.9s] hand. To date, that young man is
[2129.6s] transformed and preparing himself to
[2133.4s] start a new life. He refused to go home.
[2136.6s] He said, "I want to remain in new life."
[2139.4s] But like Jesus told that man from
[2141.5s] Gaderea, we also told him, "Go back to
[2145.0s] your home and testify of what God has
[2147.8s] done for you." Church members, if there
[2151.0s] is anyone here today, may this sacrifice
[2154.6s] of Christ Jesus remind you, he stooped
[2158.2s] down for you. He stooped down for your
[2162.2s] spouse. He stooped down for your son and
[2166.1s] for your daughter. Don't you ever give
[2168.5s] up.
[2170.7s] Loving Jesus.
[2173.3s] One more time. When you had expressed
[2177.4s] how you have stooped down from creation,
[2180.7s] it never stopped there.
[2183.5s] Before you left to heaven
[2187.0s] again, you gathered the disciples
[2189.5s] together.
[2191.1s] You put a towel round about your waist
[2194.7s] and you stooped down again and washed
[2198.6s] the feet of the disciples, showing them
[2202.0s] that this is the ministry that we shall
[2203.7s] have one with another. How bait we ought
[2206.8s] to serve one another.
[2209.8s] And today, dear father, as we
[2211.7s] commemorate this ordinance of humility,
[2213.9s] let it not just be a ritual, one of its
[2216.2s] kind, enable us also to learn how to be
[2219.0s] humble enough to stoop down and put
[2221.8s] others needs first as we stoop low like
[2224.6s] you did. Father, I'm here at this moment
[2229.4s] making a call for those who have not
[2232.6s] witnessed the experience that Christ you
[2235.0s] did for us. Not just in creation, in the
[2237.4s] plan of salvation and redemption, but
[2239.2s] even in the plan of restoration.
[2241.6s] And if there's anyone who has had a
[2243.0s] doubt before that your son can never be
[2245.9s] delivered, I would like you to lift up
[2248.3s] your hand. If there's anyone who has a
[2250.6s] doubt that your daughter will never be
[2252.2s] delivered, I'd like you to lift up your
[2254.2s] hand. And if there's anyone who ever
[2256.1s] thinks that their parent, their spouse
[2258.2s] cannot be delivered, today I'm here to
[2260.1s] let you know that the ultimate sacrifice
[2261.8s] of Christ delivers even to the
[2264.8s] uttermost. Just raise your hand.
[2271.7s] Thank you for those hands. Please raise
[2273.0s] them up properly. Thank you for those
[2274.5s] hands. Thank you for those hands.
[2276.7s] Father,
[2278.8s] because you see in secret and answer
[2281.0s] publicly,
[2282.8s] come through for us, heavenly father,
[2285.4s] and especially for those that have
[2286.8s] raised up their hands, that none of us
[2289.2s] may give up
[2291.5s] on our children, none of us may give up
[2293.7s] on our spouses. None of us may give up
[2297.1s] on our families and none of us may give
[2299.7s] up on this family because indeed you
[2302.9s] gave up your life and stoop down to lift
[2307.1s] us up that one day in the near future
[2310.9s] rest and only rest shall be when each
[2313.5s] one of us shall be at the bosom
[2316.5s] of Christ Jesus. So I pray grant victory
[2320.0s] upon those whom their loved ones have
[2323.0s] raised their hands that as they stand in
[2325.2s] the gap in their behalf please my father
[2327.8s] as you stoop down to lift Mary and gave
[2330.5s] her a new life if prayed today stoop
[2333.0s] down one more time and lift up those to
[2335.4s] whom their loved ones have raised to
[2336.7s] their hands. We thank you for we know
[2338.7s] you've heard and answered our prayer for
[2342.6s] these things we have prayed in Jesus
[2344.9s] name.
[2345.7s] Amen. Please be seated.
