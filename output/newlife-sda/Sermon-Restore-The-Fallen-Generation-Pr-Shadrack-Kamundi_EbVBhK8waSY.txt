In the last graduation, we had the we had the president of the republic of Kenya, honorable Samo Ruto, and he received honorary degree from Baraton. And he said, "I've always refused to get honorary degrees, but today I'm happy and I accepted this because I'm getting it from the first chartered university in the Republic of Kenya."

May you fill us with your Holy Spirit now and interpret the word ahead for us. We pray in Jesus name. Amen. For all have sinned and fallen short of God's glory. All look at the friend sitting to next to you and say pastor says all including you and I for all have sinned. When the Bible talks about all have sinned it is not the sin of action. It is the sin a state of being. For we have all fallen and now we are in the state of sinfulness. Therefore, we have fallen short of God's glory. There's a time I was a district pastor and I was uh interviewing the baptismal candidates one by one and I brought this verse to my baptismal candidates and I asked them a question. What does the Bible mean when it says all have sinned? Have you also sinned? One lady told me, "Yes, pastor, personally, I have sinned a lot. Therefore, why why are you going to baptistry when you have sinned?" And she told me, "You know, pastor, when the Bible says we have all sinned, it is simply means zilindogo." And I went ahead to ask her, which are these small small sins that you committed? And she said kudanga you see everybody thinks kudanga is a small sin lying what other sin being jealousha all these she mentioned several and then I asked her another question now you're going to the water when will you stop sinning she said pastor since we are going to the No sooner. Hey, you people forgot no sooner in high school. No sooner will I step into the water. Oh, thank you. Sa we were we studied together. We did the exam same room SDA. You remember the English of Mr. Musumbi, no sooner than Mhm. She said, "No sooner will I step into the water than all the remaining sins in me will go down the water. For all have sinned." Friends, this verse is not a simple verse. The verse is not a simple one. It is simply reminds us of how sinful you, I for all have sinned. By the way, when you look at the people here, we all look so holy, including your pastor. Your pastor looks so holier than all of us. When you look at me, you might say, "Oh, I wish I were like pastor Camundi. He looks so holy by appearance." But I want to tell you, if there is an animal which is very dangerous to deal with, to stay with, to mingle with, to associate with it's a human being. Whether a pastor, whether an elder, whether church board member, all have sinned naturally. We are born sinners. And our message today is how can we rescue ourselves and our children from this state in which we are. People are suffering. Families are in trouble because of the fallenness in us. I may not trust my children anymore. I may not trust my wife anymore. You may not trust your husband anymore despite the fact that he or she is serving in the church. There's a problem. There is a problem. If you ask Elder Wangai, he'll tell you the problem is called we here. A state of being. Nature is a problem to a human being. We here by the way Dr. We here and may hear are two different words. If you ask my brother from the Lu community by the way I I am I am a very proud member. I'm a very proud friend of the L community. When I was young I used to tell my dad and and I attempted severally Mhm. And my wife knows all of them and they are good friends. Amen. You don't Hey, when I said the man, very few people are wondering. That is one of the sinfulness of the pastor. No sin. No sin. The L people whom I cherish, they say there's a difference between Richo and Timoro. I hope those who understand Lu understand better here. There is a difference between our challenge as human being and our actions out of the sinful nature in which we are born. the other communities including my community uh the meu people we have no detailed way of differentiating our sinful nature and the actions of that sinful nature. I like it the way it is in Kikuyu. I like it the way it is in the lower languages that we have all sinned in Eden. All the challenges that we are going through started from Eden and you know that and you don't need to be explained in into details. A human being that you see here. I saw the choir singing. I admired the choir. Thank you choir. That was a great song. I looked at how holy you looked. And then I wondered if I could visit your office on man on Tuesday. Monday is a public holiday, I'm told. And I come and uh I don't look at you forget about me. You don't remember that I was here this Sabbath. And uh by chance I annoy you. So please, I've come here to be served. Can you serve me quickly? I should do that as a little mass. I said, "Please, you don't know whom I am. I need to be served quickly. I'm going for another appointment." Then I'll see the true color of that choir member. If you are in a hurry, please, we don't work that way here. If you're in hurry, get out of my office. You can come when you organized. Then I see then I remind her, "Oh, I saw you singing in New Life SDA." and she'll say, "Oh, uh, pastor, are you the one who preached?" Ah, true Christianity is never seen on Sabbath. True Christianity is you in your office, you in the jam, traffic jam. And I remember there is a day I was late in a traffic jam here in Nairobi. and I was trying to overtake and the next car was blocking me and I said today I'm going to use all the tactics to ensure this guy does not overtake me. So, and I overtook him. Then I opened the window to remind him that he should have given me way only to realize that this was one of the elders of Lovington SDA. And he said, "Oh, pastor, you're the one. Oh, I'm sorry." I said, "I'm also the the pastor, you know, I'm also sorry, elder." And we created more jam as we were reconciling in Kenyata Avenue. For all have sinned and fallen short of God's glory. friends, we in trouble. And the worst of all is the children that we give birth to. I want to tell you that the children we give birth to, whether he is a PK, whether he is an elder's child, that child is not an elder. That child is sinful. That child is dangerous. And I have a message for parents today that the child you are carrying today could be your killer tomorrow. Say God forbid the child. I saw a lady here who is almost being blessed already blessed and almost being blessed fully. I don't know where she sat during the children's story. Mama, I'm praying for you. Where is she? Anyway, that is a private way of our life. But when you're blessed, we see it. You can't hide when you're blessed. I saw it myself and I thanked God for her. Any other one who is blessed the same way? God bless you more. the moment. May I talk to the young people here? My son included. He's still young. I came with my wife. He came without any. You still have my prayers all through. I pray for you daily. Anyway, I promised I'll not talk about this. So, let me keep quiet. Young people the moment you marry and please marry. Young people marry marry. The earlier the better in this life where the youth youth youth youth put up your hand you need to marry. I don't know what's happening. Parents we are wailing. Oh, please. My daughter is still here. Your son can come for her. I'm also saying I'm also saying my son is here. Please, your daughter. Uhhuh. I even saw one when I was coming in. She used to be a member of the proactive kids. I don't know where she is seated. We are still praying together with her. Let's pray more. The moment they marry, the next thing we expect is to see blessings coming up. May I remind the young parents and the parents to be the day you go for honeymoon. Maybe you planned to to conceive in the honeymoon or you planned to conceive later and that you conceive during honeymoon. That very moment of conception, the child who has been conceived becomes sinful immediately. That child according to Romans 3:23 has sinned and fallen short of God's glory naturally. That's why when a mother is walking with this child in the you know in K we don't have a uterus allow me say in the stomach. when the child is when the mother is walking with a child in the stomach. I've seen somebody from the west. Please excuse me. Here in Africa, we don't differentiate. Everything is stop tumbbo. Tumbo. When the child is in the in the tumbbo, I remember there is a time when this man was in the mother's womb in the mother's stomach. We I I taught at Changamo school, Adventist school and we went to town with the mother to do some shopping and we were in Ner Avenue and all of a sudden I saw my wife hold the stomach. I hope you understand the stomach so far, right? She held the stomach and told me, "Yeah, somebody is stepping on me badly and all of a sudden she fell on the ground." I was so And uh I was so worried that she was dying. You know when you are newly married, you are so careful. Mhm. And uh this child can disturb the mother badly. The last one never disturbed the mother like this one. One time, one evening, we were in in our house in Changamu at around 6:00 p.m. and my wife told me, "I feel like eating cava, which is roasted at least time." And she told me, "Oh yes, I can't sleep without that cava. I'll die." The sinner in her was pushing. And I told her, "Okay, I didn't have a car." So went to Changam roundabout and we took a m to Zimma Ferry Ferry all the way to Lon. went to Mangginina Drive to buy cava roasted cava nazil crisps is all. Can I give you another no sooner no sooner did she see the cava The husbands who are here please you must understand your wives and bring up your family in the Lord. No sooner did she see the cava then she told me the earlier we leave the this place the better less I vomit. Come on. But we came all the way at night to for you to hit the and off. We left and in my mind the Christian that I was was being replaced by the omeu in me. almost mentioning from my mouth but I was careful in my in my inside me. It never came out traveling all the way at night. Why did you behave this way? But it remained in me because I understood there is a sinful man in her who is troubling her. human beings. I thank God that when you come to church, Dr. Wangai, your children are also in church. It's not an easy thing. It's not easy. The children that we are bringing up today, today your child accompanying you to church. Thank God all have sinned. And when the Bible says come short of g's glory, the Bible simply means they've lacked the power of God in them. Remember thou shalt not eat of the fruit lest you do what? What? But after eating suffering came shame, enmity with God. We are born inclined to sin. By the way, we need to understand our friends, our spouse is very much our children. By understanding that a human being is inclined to sin as fire is inclined to petrol. The only solution is keep off from petrol when you know you are fire the moment they come close. Whether you are ordained yesterday, whether you are ordained today like those deacons who are ordained, we pray for them that they will keep off petrol if they are fire since they are fire and the fire the the the the petrol should keep away from fire as much as possible because that is how we are in our sinful nature towards sin. Remember when in high school I was in Keria High School SDA of course my dad was a pastor I had no choice than going to Adventist schools by force and I thank God by God's grace I knew some English to speak to God's people. We had baptism in in school done by pastor Matsuma Johnson in the evening. Among the baptismal candidates was those who sneaked from school and she was baptized in the afternoon during roll call. She could not be found anywhere. with whom she sneaked the school was the choir leader who was conducting songs in the river. Then the principal went to the dome. We checked his this choir leader a student did not only sneak from the school but his mattress was also missing from from the dome. So the principal said, "Keep quiet. Don't worry. Go back to class. It doesn't require you to to have a degree to to reason where he is and the mattress." And the other young lady is also lost. Give them time. We went back for preps and the the dogs were left open. And then we came back at around uh 10 to sleep. Guess what? The mattress was back and somebody was sleeping on it. Then the principal, our principal is a Ugandan then. You remember those days when all teachers were from Uganda in the 70s, early 80s? Uh the principal came and told the young man, "Excuse me, uh you were not here a few minutes ago. Where were you?" Said, "Ah, Bana principal, I got malaria. I'm so sick. Even standing, even talking. Please let me sleep. And the principal gave him a very hard slap. Said, "Tell me the truth." He said, "Malimu, don't kill me. It is a sinful nature. It is a sinful nature. I'm sinful." Then to the other dome, the girl said, "H confessed everything. baptized on Sabbath, tempted on Sabbath, fell on Sabbath. The church board met on Sunday morning, proposed the removal of the name from the church register. How many of you read about Simon Mande? Oh, you people are forgetting about Simon McCand's story. This girl's story was shorter than Simon Mandes. Pastor, I'm praying for you. You have the sinful nature. You have sinned and fallen short of God's glory. Me, too. And that's why the Bible says, "Please carry each other's burden because we are at a risk of falling into sin." Friends, the minutes I I was given are almost over. Restoration is required especially for you and your your family. We as a human being remember the Lord differentiated us from animals. He give us the intellect and the intellect which we are given at creation human beings have misused it. Instead of being to the glory of God we are using the intellect to cause a in the world. The intellect that the Lord has given us is leading us to cause violence, lies, addictive behaviors, alcoholism, drug abuse, stealing, sexual misbehavior. And I I I underline sexual misbehavior especially in our colleges and universities. When colleges and university students are done with exams, when they are done with class, when they are bored, the only remedy for boredom among our children these days is sexual misbehavior, alcoholism or drug abuse. Is there a remedy? Where are we headed to? New Life Church members, are you exceptional? May I talk now about our children? And today being Adventist Education Day, may I say that there are three levels of schools for our children. Level number one is your home. Level number one is your home where the the father is the principal of this school. The mother is the head mistress of this school and the teacher. I shared with elder during the children's story and I sympathize with these young people here. Those children, some were jumping, others were not listening. And I told Elder, do you know these children are not for the members of New Life Church? You remember what I told you? These children belong to house girls, house. So when you see a child misbehave here, don't blame the father, don't blame the mother, blame the other mother, the house help. And if it were possible, we would only employ Adventist house helps. Parents of today are so much inclined to looking for money. Money, money, money, money will never be enough. Let me tell you my my brother, my sister, never sacrifice your family for money. Where possible, I say where possible, one of you should forfeit job and bring up children to a certain level. But in this economy, so you have to employ somebody to bring up your children. When you come home one evening, you hear your child utter a very abusive terminology and you ask him or her where did you hear that from? Auntie auntie when I retire and god willing I should retire soon. Dr. Wangaya have started putting my 39th year of service. I started working at 19 and so in 2027 March I've even notified the university that I need to to retire in less than one in less than two years from now when I retire one of the things I want to specialize in is parenting and I want to conduct seminars all over all over all over on parenting because we are losing it. When it comes to parenting, we've lost and we are losing it. And I'll talk more on this in the afternoon. Recently, we lost a church elder who was stabbed with a knife by his son. He died here in Nairobi. Killed by his son. In my village, in my village, 3 4 kilometers from my home, a mother was stabbed to death by a son. prior to which he had followed the mother in the market forcing her to give him money for drugs. Even the other elder was killed by the son. It was for the same reason. Our young people are lost into drugs. sinful nature. We wish we had another continent on where to bring up our children. Congratulations to you who has succeeded in this, but it's not easy. Where should we hide our children today? No wonder Sister White says yes, there is a remedy. Adventist education should be Adventist schools in the last days should be refugee camps for the tempted youth. I quote, I said young people are marrying, they conceive, they get they get children. But I want to say the first level of education starts in the home during expectancy. That is the time you need the father. Hey Reuben, I hope you're hearing this. I'm preparing you. When you marry my daughter-in-law and you know in our family we have never given birth with that lady. A lady and we are anxiously waiting to have our first daughter. And so is Dr. Wangai. The day we'll get that girl, I think we'll spoil her because that happened was it. So Reuben, when you marry, say amen. Please, the moment you see her spitting and spitting, that's how your mother started. I remember we were we were on our way from Kamagambo teachers conference and on the way she was spitting spitting the moment you see that know that Shadrachamundi Jr. is coming. That's our culture. The firstborn son, my name. Mhm. That is the time you need to bal your wife like an egg. Every morning, my dear. Good morning. How's our baby? Mhm. Two weeks. Two weeks. baby quatumbo. That is that time a wise man should always know how to treat the wife like an egg because the initial stages of bringing up a children the children is during expectancy. Let this mama never be stressed because by being stressed the baby shares the stress hormones. Born stressed tomorrow a stressed man, a stressed manager, a stress everything, a corrupt person. No wonder we are not short of corrupt people in this country because of the way we bring up our children. When she says let's go to go ahead of her when she says I don't need the cava anymore. Understand? Say I also feel like vomiting. Mhm. She cannot vomit alone. Move with her and move with their children at all levels. Behave like by the way we adise as parents we need to grow with our children. When the child is in form one be in form one psychologically. When the child is in primary grade one be in grade one. When the child is in the university be in the university psychologically. currently. Where do you think I am now? Where am I? It's natural. You have to move with your children. I saw a lady who sang here. I saw her and then I looked this way to see whether somebody is seeing like me. Move with the life of your child. Don't be left behind. That's where I am. Move with the light. Move with them. Homeschool. Homeschool. Homeschool. Befriend your child. Dr. Wangai when my dad was uh heading Kenya coast field. I remember you started Kizingua CDA church during that crusade. My dad I was teaching in Changam school. My dad was a field president. In the evening when we meet in the house, we used to play at a table tennis with my dad and this bonded us so closely. I loved him. He loved me and we were friends. You must befriend your child for you to win that child. Homeschool. The second level of education is the church. New life sda church. Let your child be in new life throughout. If it comes to adventurer, buy uniform. When it comes to whatever is required in the church, please commit your child of the church activities. By so doing, remember you are assisting to fight the sinful nature which can lead to your death if not directed. Psychologists say if your child grows with animals, no human being. level to the age of the pastor. The only language your child will know is bucking. Nothing else despite the intellect. When your child grows with chicken, the advanced level will be coo. That will be your child. The way you bring them up is the way they'll grow. Train up your child. 226 of Proverbs. Deuteronomy says 6 verse 6 to9. Teach them diligently and committedly. You must commit yourself your life to them. Forget about looking for money. You have to come home on time. You have to take them through the homework. You have to commit time with them. You have to befriend your child for this child to be somebody tomorrow. Somebody said, "If you don't know the virginity status of your child, you are an enemy to your child." Can I repeat that, pastor? If you don't know the virginity status of your daughter, of your son, you are an enemy to your child. I know my son will ask me do you know mine I know and you need to keep talking to them for warning them reminding them of what lays ahead so that when you are close very close and they go and see what you used to tell them in school and I could Mom, I shouldn't take care of these boys. Exactly what you told me is what a boy told me today. A a child who does not share a feedback with a with a parent. There's a very big gap and the wider the gap, the more you lose your child. The third level is Adventist school which many of you don't like to hear. Adventist school. I thank God my parents went through Kura school. I thank God the grandparents of my wife grandparents went through Kura school. By the way, my wife's grandmother on the maternal side was the first Adventist Mumeu. He brought the church from Changamu to Dakanidi the grand the grandfather and they studied in Kara school and married the grandmother in the old sanctuary of Kura. You cannot you can't you can't miss it by extending the home school to the church school to the to the church education here in New Life and then proceeding the same education to an Adventist level of education. You can't lose it. Remember all the school system that you see in the world today have their roots in Eden. That was where the first school was. Through the schools of the prophets, through Kamusinga school, through Rabbi school, through the goto Kenya High, not Kenya High alliance, through Kamagambo among many other schools. There is no education in Kenya which was started by any government. All education comes from Eden through the schools of the prophets through the missionaries for the purpose of as I conclude remember in Eden there was a curriculum and the aim of the curriculum before the fall read education to retain the image of God in man. That was the purpose of Adventist education in Eden. Education to retain God's image in man. Immediately after the fall, God revealed the curriculum and it read and it has read. It has been reading and it is today. All education that you give to your child should the curriculum should read. Aim of the curriculum education to regain. The other one was to retain. This is now to regain the lost image of God in man. So wherever you want to take your child, take them anywhere. Let them get academics. It's upon you as a parent. But remember Matthew 9:35. One of the purposes for this education is Jesus went to the cities and synagogues and everywhere teaching them preaching and healing. You remember one of the advantages of Adventist education is to preach and to heal and to educate them. Academics is not enough. May I tell you friends, academics minus Jesus equals your child disturbing you in need of drugs. I never finished for you the story about the lady in my village back in the county 4 kilometers from my home. He went looking for the mother and he found the mother in the market asked the mother to give him money for drugs. The mother said, "My son, I have nothing." Then the son in the market stripped the mother naked in search of money. Alang was then the neighbors the the the those who were selling bless came and tied more. She was taken he was taken for remand uh arrested and taken for remand. After a few months after a few months listen to this. After a few months, the mother went and said, "My mother will die. My my my son will die in the remand. Please I I I I forgive him." You know that is foolish foolishness of mothers at the highest level. Even if you love your child, you have to love your child reasonably. There there comes a time when you as the mother will call the police and say, "Let him be arrested. let him be imprisoned for 2 three years for him to come to his senses. After he was taken from the remand, he went to the mother and said, "Mom, thank you. I really appreciate, but 5,000 anytime I need keep it. The moment you miss that money, I'll kill you." So he went away. One time he came home and met the mother alone in at home. Asked for the mother money. The money was not there. Then he told the mother, "Today comes the end of your life." The mother ran from the house. He ran after he ran after her, put her on the ground. As she was making noise, he cut of the lips, cut off the lips and said, "Today is not a joke. You must give me the money. I'm killing you." This young young man chopped off the head of the mother, separated the body of the mother from the head and threw it away. The child you are seated with now. I'm praying for that child. I'm praying for your grandchild. I'm praying for your daughter that they this should never happen to you from your child. The other day in one of the neighboring uh one of the neighboring counties of Nairobi, a young man raped the the mother successfully. The father was in the farm. On hearing the noise from his wife, he ran to rescue the the wife. He thought thieves have abandoned the house. only to run straight to the bedroom and met his son. The very act because of use of these drugs and name it when he trying to separate the son from he had a weapon. He had a metal bar. He hid the father on the forehead. He fell on the on the pool of blood blood and he went back to the mother. That's where we've reached today. Bringing up a child, you must follow the three levels. Come home dedicatedly. Teach them as they go out. Put on the door posts. Teach them all the time. Bring them to church. Let them not miss any find you've washed your hands. Then take them for Adventist education where the teachers will continue from where you left. It is my prayer, friends, that this education Sabbath today marks a difference on the way you bring up your family. When I talk about taking your child to Adventist school, it's not a must by the way, but as for me and my house will do the same. for you. When I married her, Kumbuka, our children was study in Adventist schools. And when he went to Kitoui boarding, SDA boarding primary school, he passed well, I thank God. He was sent to a national school which is not Adventist. Kar was not performing well, but we risked and said, "Let let let let let let let let let let let let let let let let let let let let let let let let let let let let let let let let let let let let let let let let let let let let let let let let let let let let let let let let let let let let let let let the Bible says let the children come to me." And I remember that is the day my wife reminded me that she went to Kenya High School and I went to Motito SDA that we are spoiling the life of this young man. But I said if you if you must risk with the life of your child risking the Lord today is a surgeon through Kura through Adventist schools. You'll never be mistaken by committing your life to your child from the stomach. Amen. To the infancy. Commit yourself. Don't quarrel your wife at all when she is expectant. You are destroying this child. Remember, you're in the process of mentoring and bringing him up. May the Lord bless you. How many of you pray? Say with me, oh my dear God, I commit my family to you. I'll now be committed to the bringing up these children and the children who are here. I will ask my parents, I'll befriend my parents so that they can give me the very best. When I talk about adventist education, it is not at the expense of academic performance. Your child must perform so that the career can be successful. Those who do pray with me that God intervene for my children, intervene for my family. As I pray, pray for them, pray for yourself, pray for that wisdom. Heavenly Father, King of glory, we thank you so much for this church. We thank you for the listener, may we have a turn around to the behavior of our children, our grandchildren. Lord, our father, on that day, we would wish to hear where are the children that I gave you. You say they are not only my children, but I bring you even the grandchildren. Bless us. Make us understand our sinful nature. Make us know that you are our remedy through the cross and through believing. Because the Bible says those who believe in you and accept you, they will be given the power and the right to become your children. We claim that right. Lord, bless this church even in the afternoon programs. Be with us to the end. We pray in Jesus name. Amen. God bless you. [Music]

[248.4s] um the university of eastern Africa
[251.1s] baraton was started in
[254.4s] 1979 as the first private university in
[258.6s] the Republic of
[260.7s] Kenya and Baraton is known to and
[264.7s] proudly known to be the first university
[267.6s] in this
[268.8s] republic to get a government
[272.1s] charter. It is the mother of all
[274.5s] chartered universities in the Republic
[276.7s] of Kenya.
[279.6s] first chartered university. In the last
[282.7s] graduation, we had the we had the
[284.8s] president of the republic of
[287.0s] Kenya, honorable Samo
[289.6s] Ruto, and he received honorary degree
[292.6s] from Baraton. And he said, "I've always
[296.6s] refused to get honorary degrees, but
[299.8s] today I'm happy and I accepted this
[302.5s] because I'm getting it from the first
[305.5s] chartered university in the Republic of
[307.7s] Kenya." Tell your friend I didn't know
[310.1s] that. Now I'm I'm more
[313.6s] proud. That is your
[316.1s] university and is there
[319.9s] serving your
[322.3s] children. Briefly I remind you that we
[325.0s] have new courses upcoming this year,
[327.4s] this academic
[328.8s] year. From September, God willing, we
[331.5s] are starting a bachelor of laws. So we
[334.6s] we will start now training Adventist
[338.8s] lawyers and we will need lecturers to
[341.4s] come and teach those
[343.8s] courses. At the same time we are
[346.3s] starting aviation bachelor of uh
[349.6s] aviation. Uh in addition we also are
[353.8s] starting clinical medicine both diploma
[356.9s] and
[358.0s] bachelor's degrees.
[360.7s] We wish you well as you join
[363.4s] us to study or to bring your child to
[366.8s] stand to study at the University of
[370.0s] Eastern
[371.9s] Africa situated at Baraton

[395.5s] daughter can do two years in
[398.5s] Baraton and then the other two years in
[402.4s] Michigan, USA at Andrews University. You
[406.7s] remember Baraton was born by Andrews
[410.2s] University before the charter
[412.4s] 1991 Baraton used to offer degrees from
[416.4s] Andrews
[418.4s] University. I'm happy that
[421.2s] uh our last born my family is a family
[425.4s] of four
[426.7s] people those seated there and another
[429.5s] one who is not with us. He studied at
[433.4s] Kura of
[436.0s] course you know uh I breathe Adventist
[440.3s] education I sleep Adventist education
[443.8s] and I talk Adventist
[446.0s] education. So our last born including
[449.0s] our first born went through Kura
[451.8s] primary, Kura secondary. Then our last
[454.9s] born after that went to
[456.8s] Baraton studied software
[459.6s] engineering. After two years he
[461.8s] transferred to Andrews University in the
[464.4s] US and we thank God that uh next month
[468.6s] we are going for his graduation because

[546.5s] 072245 647. I know people of New Life
[550.2s] are sharp. You got the
[552.2s] number
[554.6s] 0722
[556.5s] 45
[561.3s] 647. Uh friends, can we pray? Heavenly
[565.4s] Father, we thank you for this
[567.2s] opportunity to worship you and to listen
[570.6s] to
[571.5s] you. May you fill us with your Holy
[573.8s] Spirit
[574.9s] now and interpret the word ahead for us.
[578.2s] We pray in Jesus name. Amen.
[584.7s] For all have
[587.9s] sinned and fallen
[590.5s] short of
[592.8s] God's glory.
[597.8s] All look at the friend sitting to next
[600.8s] to you and say pastor says
[605.2s] all including you and
[609.2s] I for all have
[614.3s] sinned. When the Bible talks about all
[617.3s] have sinned it is not the sin of
[621.6s] action. It is the sin a state of
[626.5s] being. For we have all
[629.9s] fallen and now we are in the state of
[634.4s] sinfulness. Therefore, we have fallen
[638.9s] short of God's glory. There's a time I
[642.0s] was a district
[644.8s] pastor and I was uh interviewing the
[648.2s] baptismal
[650.1s] candidates one by
[652.9s] one and I brought this verse to my
[656.0s] baptismal candidates and I asked them a
[658.8s] question. What does the Bible mean when
[661.5s] it says all have
[665.2s] sinned? Have you also sinned?
[668.8s] One lady told me, "Yes,
[671.0s] pastor, personally, I have sinned a lot.
[675.7s] Therefore, why why are you going to
[678.9s] baptistry when you have
[681.2s] sinned?" And she told me, "You know,
[683.3s] pastor, when the Bible says we have all
[685.0s] sinned, it is simply means
[689.9s] zilindogo." And I went ahead to ask her,
[692.5s] which are these small small sins that
[695.8s] you committed?
[698.0s] And she said kudanga you see everybody
[702.2s] thinks
[703.8s] kudanga is a small sin
[706.8s] lying what other sin being
[711.1s] jealousha all these she mentioned
[713.8s] several and then I asked her another
[716.4s] question now you're going to the water
[719.0s] when will you stop
[721.6s] sinning she said pastor since we are
[725.0s] going to the
[727.8s] No
[730.5s] sooner. Hey, you people forgot no sooner
[733.3s] in high
[736.4s] school. No sooner will I step into the
[743.3s] water. Oh, thank you.
[745.9s] Sa we were we studied together. We did
[749.3s] the exam same
[751.6s] room SDA. You remember the English of
[755.4s] Mr. Musumbi, no sooner than
[758.8s] Mhm. She said, "No sooner will I step
[761.5s] into the water than all the remaining
[764.7s] sins in
[768.4s] me will go down the
[773.2s] water. For all have
[776.1s] sinned."
[778.2s] Friends, this
[780.0s] verse is not a simple verse.
[784.6s] The verse is not a simple
[787.3s] one. It is simply reminds
[790.8s] us of how sinful you,
[797.5s] I for all have sinned. By the way, when
[801.6s] you look at the people here, we all look
[804.5s] so
[805.6s] holy, including your
[807.9s] pastor. Your pastor looks so holier than
[810.9s] all of us.
[812.6s] When you look at me, you might say, "Oh,
[815.4s] I wish I were like pastor
[817.6s] Camundi. He looks so holy by
[820.8s] appearance." But I want to tell you, if
[824.2s] there is an
[826.9s] animal which is very
[830.1s] dangerous to deal
[832.3s] with, to stay with, to mingle with, to
[837.0s] associate with it's a human being.
[841.1s] Whether a
[842.2s] pastor, whether an elder, whether church
[846.0s] board
[846.8s] member, all have
[851.1s] sinned
[852.6s] naturally. We are born
[855.0s] sinners. And our message
[857.7s] today
[859.2s] is how can we rescue ourselves and our
[865.1s] children from this state in which we
[871.3s] are. People are suffering. Families are
[875.0s] in trouble because of the fallenness in
[880.3s] us. I may not trust my children anymore.
[885.5s] I may not trust my wife
[887.8s] anymore. You may not trust your husband
[891.4s] anymore despite the fact that he or she
[895.1s] is serving in the church. There's a
[898.7s] problem. There is a
[900.8s] problem. If you ask Elder Wangai, he'll
[904.4s] tell you the problem is
[906.4s] called we here. A state of being. Nature
[910.9s] is a problem to a human being. We here
[914.6s] by the way Dr. We here and may hear are
[918.2s] two different
[921.2s] words. If you ask my brother from the Lu
[926.3s] community by the way I I am I am a very
[929.5s] proud member. I'm a very proud friend of
[932.1s] the L
[933.5s] community. When I was young I used to
[935.8s] tell my
[938.8s] dad and and I attempted
[942.0s] severally
[946.6s] Mhm. And my wife knows all of
[950.4s] them and they are good friends. Amen.
[955.1s] You don't Hey, when I said the man, very
[957.4s] few people are
[958.5s] wondering. That is one of the sinfulness
[961.5s] of the
[963.2s] pastor. No sin. No sin. The L people
[969.0s] whom I cherish, they say there's a
[971.9s] difference between
[974.6s] Richo and
[978.6s] Timoro. I hope those who understand Lu
[981.4s] understand better here. There is a
[985.2s] difference between our challenge as
[987.8s] human being and our actions out of the
[991.9s] sinful nature in which we are born. the
[995.5s] other communities including my community
[999.1s] uh the meu
[1000.7s] people we have no detailed way of
[1004.6s] differentiating our sinful nature and
[1007.6s] the actions of that sinful nature. I
[1010.4s] like it the way it is in Kikuyu. I like
[1012.3s] it the way it is in the lower
[1014.8s] languages that we have all
[1018.0s] sinned in Eden.
[1021.1s] All the challenges that we are going
[1022.6s] through started from Eden and you know
[1024.8s] that and you don't need to be explained
[1027.0s] in into
[1029.2s] details. A human being that you see
[1032.0s] here. I saw the choir singing. I admired
[1035.1s] the choir. Thank you choir. That was a
[1037.2s] great
[1038.8s] song. I looked at how holy you
[1044.3s] looked. And then I wondered if I could
[1047.8s] visit your office on man on Tuesday.
[1051.4s] Monday is a public holiday, I'm
[1053.8s] told. And I come and
[1057.0s] uh I don't look at you forget about me.
[1060.4s] You don't remember that I was here this
[1064.5s] Sabbath. And uh by
[1068.1s] chance I annoy
[1071.0s] you. So please, I've come here to be
[1073.2s] served. Can you serve me quickly? I
[1075.7s] should do that as a little mass.
[1079.4s] I said, "Please, you don't know whom I
[1081.2s] am. I need to be served quickly. I'm
[1083.0s] going for another
[1084.7s] appointment." Then I'll see the true
[1087.6s] color of that choir
[1090.8s] member. If you are in a hurry, please,
[1093.2s] we don't work that way here. If you're
[1095.0s] in hurry, get out of my office. You can
[1097.1s] come when you
[1098.4s] organized. Then I see then I remind her,
[1101.8s] "Oh, I saw you singing in New Life SDA."
[1106.9s] and she'll say, "Oh,
[1109.9s] uh, pastor, are you the one who
[1113.2s] preached?" Ah, true Christianity is
[1116.7s] never seen on
[1118.3s] Sabbath. True
[1120.3s] Christianity is you in your office, you
[1124.6s] in the jam, traffic
[1128.0s] jam. And I remember there is a day I was
[1130.6s] late in a traffic jam here in
[1133.6s] Nairobi. and I was trying to overtake
[1136.8s] and the next car was blocking
[1139.7s] me and I said today I'm going to use all
[1142.8s] the
[1143.8s] tactics to ensure this guy does not
[1146.5s] overtake me.
[1152.3s] So, and I overtook him. Then I opened
[1155.5s] the
[1156.5s] window to remind him that he should have
[1160.3s] given me
[1163.7s] way only to
[1166.8s] realize that this was one of the elders
[1169.8s] of Lovington SDA.
[1177.1s] And he said, "Oh, pastor, you're the
[1178.8s] one. Oh, I'm
[1180.4s] sorry." I said, "I'm also the the
[1183.0s] pastor, you know, I'm also sorry,
[1184.7s] elder." And we created more jam as we
[1188.2s] were
[1191.0s] reconciling in Kenyata
[1196.0s] Avenue. For all have sinned and fallen
[1200.4s] short of God's glory.
[1204.7s] friends, we in
[1207.1s] trouble. And the worst of all is the
[1209.9s] children that we give birth
[1213.0s] to. I want to tell you that the children
[1215.4s] we give birth to, whether he is a PK,
[1218.7s] whether he is an elder's child, that
[1221.3s] child is not an elder. That child is
[1226.7s] sinful. That child is dangerous.
[1230.8s] And I have a message for parents today
[1232.9s] that the child you are carrying today
[1235.5s] could be your killer tomorrow. Say God
[1241.0s] forbid the child. I saw a lady here who
[1244.0s] is almost being blessed already blessed
[1247.2s] and almost being blessed fully. I don't
[1250.4s] know where she sat during the children's
[1252.6s] story. Mama, I'm praying for you. Where
[1255.4s] is
[1256.8s] she? Anyway, that is a private way of
[1260.8s] our life. But when you're blessed, we
[1263.4s] see
[1265.5s] it. You can't hide when you're blessed.
[1269.1s] I saw it myself and I thanked God for
[1272.6s] her. Any other one who is blessed the
[1275.2s] same
[1276.0s] way? God bless you
[1278.8s] more. the
[1281.4s] moment. May I talk to the young people
[1284.3s] here? My son
[1287.2s] included. He's still
[1289.8s] young. I came with my wife. He came
[1292.7s] without
[1296.4s] any. You still have my prayers all
[1299.2s] through. I pray for you
[1303.5s] daily. Anyway, I promised I'll not talk
[1306.1s] about this. So, let me keep quiet.
[1310.4s] Young people the moment you
[1312.9s] marry and please
[1316.3s] marry. Young people
[1318.9s] marry
[1320.8s] marry. The earlier the better in this
[1323.6s] life where the youth youth youth youth
[1326.4s] put up your
[1330.1s] hand you need to marry. I don't know
[1332.4s] what's happening. Parents we are
[1334.0s] wailing.
[1338.6s] Oh, please. My daughter is still here.
[1341.8s] Your son can come for her. I'm also
[1344.8s] saying I'm also saying my son is here.
[1348.5s] Please, your daughter. Uhhuh. I even saw
[1351.5s] one when I was coming in. She used to be
[1354.6s] a member of the proactive kids. I don't
[1357.0s] know where she is seated. We are still
[1358.9s] praying together with her. Let's pray
[1361.4s] more. The moment they
[1365.6s] marry, the next thing we
[1368.8s] expect is to see
[1371.4s] blessings coming up. May I remind the
[1375.0s] young parents and the parents to be the
[1378.3s] day you go for honeymoon.
[1383.4s] Maybe you planned to to conceive in the
[1386.0s] honeymoon or you planned to conceive
[1388.4s] later and that you conceive during
[1393.5s] honeymoon. That very
[1397.4s] moment of
[1400.0s] conception, the child who has been
[1403.1s] conceived becomes sinful immediately.
[1410.6s] That child according to Romans
[1414.4s] 3:23 has sinned and fallen short of
[1418.2s] God's glory
[1420.4s] naturally. That's why when a mother is
[1423.4s] walking with this child in the you know
[1426.9s] in K we don't have a uterus allow me say
[1429.4s] in the stomach. when the child is when
[1431.9s] the mother is walking with a child in
[1433.8s] the stomach.
[1436.0s] I've seen somebody from the west. Please
[1438.9s] excuse me. Here in
[1440.7s] Africa, we don't differentiate.
[1443.0s] Everything
[1444.0s] is stop
[1445.9s] tumbbo. Tumbo. When the child is in the
[1450.1s] in the tumbbo, I remember there is a
[1453.2s] time when this man was in the mother's
[1458.1s] womb in the mother's
[1462.2s] stomach. We I I taught at Changamo
[1465.5s] school, Adventist school and we went to
[1468.8s] town with the mother to do some shopping
[1472.2s] and we were
[1475.0s] in Ner
[1477.8s] Avenue and all of a sudden I saw my wife
[1480.9s] hold the
[1482.2s] stomach. I hope you understand the
[1484.2s] stomach so far, right? She held the
[1487.8s] stomach and told me,
[1490.4s] "Yeah, somebody is stepping on me
[1494.7s] badly and all of a sudden she fell on
[1497.4s] the
[1499.1s] ground." I was so And uh I was so
[1503.0s] worried that she was dying. You know
[1505.3s] when you are newly married, you are so
[1507.3s] careful.
[1509.1s] Mhm. And uh this child can disturb the
[1512.9s] mother badly.
[1515.4s] The last one never disturbed the mother
[1517.4s] like this one.
[1522.4s] One time, one evening, we were in in our
[1524.8s] house in
[1526.1s] Changamu at around 6:00
[1528.9s] p.m. and my wife told me, "I feel like
[1533.1s] eating
[1534.9s] cava, which is roasted at
[1545.5s] least time." And she told me, "Oh yes, I
[1549.9s] can't
[1550.8s] sleep without that cava. I'll
[1556.0s] die." The sinner in her was
[1560.2s] pushing. And I told her, "Okay, I didn't
[1563.0s] have a car." So went to Changam
[1565.7s] roundabout and we took a m to Zimma
[1569.1s] Ferry Ferry all the way to Lon.
[1575.2s] went to Mangginina Drive to buy cava
[1579.1s] roasted cava nazil crisps is
[1583.5s] all. Can I give you another no
[1593.4s] sooner no sooner did she see the cava
[1604.3s] The husbands who are here please you
[1606.9s] must understand your wives and bring up
[1610.2s] your family in the
[1612.4s] Lord. No sooner did she see the
[1615.8s] cava then she told
[1618.4s] me the earlier we leave the this
[1622.9s] place the better less I
[1628.4s] vomit. Come on. But we came all the way
[1631.1s] at night to for you to hit
[1636.7s] the and
[1639.1s] off. We
[1643.3s] left and in my
[1645.9s] mind the Christian that I was was being
[1650.0s] replaced by the omeu in me.
[1655.8s] almost mentioning from my mouth but I
[1659.1s] was
[1661.8s] careful in my in my inside me. It never
[1665.9s] came
[1667.9s] out traveling all the way at night. Why
[1671.1s] did you behave this way? But it remained
[1673.8s] in
[1674.6s] me because I
[1676.7s] understood there is a sinful
[1680.0s] man in her who is troubling her.
[1693.5s] human
[1696.8s] beings. I thank God that when you come
[1700.7s] to church, Dr. Wangai, your children are
[1703.6s] also in church. It's not an easy thing.
[1707.8s] It's not easy. The children that we are
[1711.3s] bringing up
[1712.6s] today,
[1714.4s] today your child accompanying you to
[1717.9s] church. Thank
[1719.8s] God all have
[1723.1s] sinned. And when the Bible says come
[1726.9s] short of g's glory, the Bible simply
[1730.2s] means they've lacked the power of God in
[1734.8s] them.
[1737.1s] Remember thou shalt not eat of the fruit
[1741.9s] lest you do what?
[1743.8s] What? But after
[1746.7s] eating suffering came
[1750.1s] shame, enmity with
[1753.3s] God. We are born inclined to sin. By the
[1757.6s] way, we need to understand our friends,
[1760.2s] our spouse is very much our children.
[1763.8s] By understanding that a human being is
[1766.9s] inclined to sin as fire is inclined to
[1772.5s] petrol. The only solution is keep off
[1776.8s] from petrol when you know you are fire
[1779.4s] the moment they come
[1783.1s] close. Whether you are ordained
[1786.4s] yesterday, whether you are ordained
[1788.4s] today like those deacons who are
[1790.4s] ordained, we pray for them that they
[1793.3s] will keep off petrol if they are fire
[1796.2s] since they are fire and the fire the the
[1799.2s] the the petrol should keep away from
[1802.9s] fire as much as possible because that is
[1805.8s] how we are in our sinful nature towards
[1810.5s] sin.
[1812.2s] Remember when in high school I was in
[1814.8s] Keria High School SDA of course my dad
[1818.2s] was a pastor I had no choice than going
[1821.0s] to Adventist schools by force and I
[1824.5s] thank
[1825.2s] God by God's grace I knew some
[1829.6s] English to speak to God's people.
[1833.8s] We had baptism in in school done by
[1837.4s] pastor Matsuma
[1839.9s] Johnson in the evening. Among the
[1842.6s] baptismal candidates was those who
[1845.8s] sneaked from school and she was baptized
[1848.4s] in the
[1850.8s] afternoon during roll call. She could
[1853.8s] not be found
[1856.1s] anywhere. with whom she sneaked the
[1858.9s] school was the choir leader who was
[1861.7s] conducting songs in the
[1867.0s] river. Then the principal went to the
[1869.4s] dome. We checked his this choir leader a
[1874.4s] student did not only sneak from the
[1877.1s] school but his mattress was also missing
[1880.8s] from from the dome. So the principal
[1883.9s] said, "Keep quiet. Don't worry. Go back
[1886.0s] to class. It doesn't require you to to
[1889.0s] have a degree to to reason where he is
[1894.1s] and the
[1895.5s] mattress." And the other young lady is
[1897.8s] also lost. Give them time. We went back
[1901.0s] for preps and the the dogs were left
[1904.8s] open. And then we came back at around uh
[1908.6s] 10 to sleep. Guess what? The mattress
[1911.9s] was back and somebody was sleeping on
[1915.6s] it. Then the
[1917.6s] principal, our principal is a Ugandan
[1920.0s] then. You remember those days when all
[1921.7s] teachers were from Uganda in the 70s,
[1924.3s] early
[1926.0s] 80s? Uh the principal came and told the
[1928.6s] young man, "Excuse me, uh you were not
[1931.0s] here a few minutes ago. Where were you?"
[1933.6s] Said, "Ah, Bana principal, I got
[1935.6s] malaria. I'm so sick. Even standing,
[1938.9s] even talking. Please let me
[1941.6s] sleep. And the principal gave him a very
[1946.0s] hard
[1947.7s] slap. Said, "Tell me the
[1950.8s] truth." He said, "Malimu, don't kill
[1954.7s] me. It is a sinful
[1958.2s] nature. It is a sinful nature. I'm
[1961.6s] sinful." Then to the other dome, the
[1965.1s] girl said, "H confessed everything.
[1967.9s] baptized on
[1970.5s] Sabbath, tempted on
[1973.3s] Sabbath, fell on
[1976.0s] Sabbath. The church board met on Sunday
[1980.1s] morning, proposed the removal of the
[1982.9s] name from the church
[1985.2s] register. How many of you read about
[1987.4s] Simon
[1990.7s] Mande? Oh, you people are forgetting
[1993.0s] about Simon McCand's story. This girl's
[1997.0s] story was shorter than Simon
[1999.3s] Mandes. Pastor, I'm praying for you. You
[2002.6s] have the sinful nature. You have sinned
[2004.8s] and fallen short of God's glory. Me,
[2007.8s] too. And that's why the Bible says,
[2011.2s] "Please carry each other's burden
[2014.6s] because we are at a risk of falling into
[2017.9s] sin."
[2024.0s] Friends, the minutes I I was given are
[2026.7s] almost
[2030.8s] over. Restoration is
[2035.1s] required
[2037.2s] especially for you and your your
[2042.8s] family. We as a human being remember the
[2046.5s] Lord differentiated us from animals. He
[2049.4s] give us the intellect and the intellect
[2052.4s] which we are given at creation human
[2055.4s] beings have misused
[2058.6s] it. Instead of being to the glory of God
[2062.2s] we are using the intellect to cause a in
[2066.2s] the
[2069.6s] world. The intellect that the Lord has
[2072.1s] given us is leading us to cause
[2074.4s] violence, lies, addictive behaviors,
[2079.2s] alcoholism, drug abuse, stealing, sexual
[2084.6s] misbehavior. And I I I underline sexual
[2087.8s] misbehavior especially in our colleges
[2091.0s] and
[2096.4s] universities. When colleges and
[2098.6s] university students are done with exams,
[2101.6s] when they are done with class, when they
[2103.8s] are bored, the only remedy for boredom
[2107.2s] among our children these days is sexual
[2110.9s] misbehavior, alcoholism or drug
[2116.4s] abuse. Is there a remedy? Where are we
[2118.7s] headed to? New Life Church members, are
[2122.3s] you exceptional?
[2131.2s] May I talk now about our
[2134.5s] children? And today being Adventist
[2137.1s] Education Day, may I say that there are
[2140.1s] three levels of schools for our
[2143.2s] children. Level number one is your home.
[2147.7s] Level number one is your
[2151.2s] home where the the father is the
[2154.9s] principal of this
[2156.6s] school. The mother is the head
[2159.7s] mistress of this school and the
[2163.9s] teacher. I shared with elder during the
[2167.7s] children's story and I sympathize with
[2169.9s] these young people here. Those children,
[2173.8s] some were jumping, others were not
[2176.4s] listening. And I told
[2178.8s] Elder, do you know these children are
[2181.1s] not for the members of New Life
[2183.3s] Church? You remember what I told you?
[2186.5s] These children belong to house girls,
[2192.8s] house. So when you see a child misbehave
[2195.8s] here, don't blame the father, don't
[2198.4s] blame the mother, blame the other
[2201.9s] mother, the house
[2204.1s] help. And if it were possible, we would
[2207.5s] only employ Adventist house
[2212.1s] helps. Parents of today are so much
[2214.8s] inclined to looking for
[2217.3s] money. Money, money, money, money will
[2220.7s] never be enough. Let me tell you my my
[2222.9s] brother, my
[2224.9s] sister, never sacrifice your family for
[2232.3s] money. Where
[2234.1s] possible, I say where
[2236.8s] possible, one of you should forfeit job
[2240.4s] and bring up children to a certain
[2244.0s] level. But in this
[2246.0s] economy, so you have to employ somebody
[2248.5s] to bring up your children.
[2252.4s] When you come home one
[2254.0s] evening, you hear your child
[2257.6s] utter a very abusive terminology and you
[2261.8s] ask him or her where did you hear that
[2263.4s] from?
[2265.3s] Auntie
[2274.7s] auntie when I
[2278.0s] retire and god willing I should retire
[2282.8s] soon. Dr. Wangaya have started putting
[2285.7s] my 39th year of service.
[2288.8s] I started working at
[2291.3s] 19 and so in 2027
[2295.3s] March I've even notified the university
[2298.2s] that I need to to
[2301.9s] retire in less than one in less than two
[2304.9s] years from now when I retire one of the
[2307.8s] things I want to specialize
[2309.6s] in
[2311.3s] is
[2313.2s] parenting and I want to conduct seminars
[2316.3s] all over all over all over on
[2320.0s] parenting because we are losing
[2324.4s] it. When it comes to parenting, we've
[2328.0s] lost and we are losing it. And I'll talk
[2331.4s] more on this in the
[2334.6s] afternoon. Recently, we lost a church
[2339.3s] elder who was
[2342.1s] stabbed with a knife by his son.
[2346.9s] He died here in
[2349.2s] Nairobi. Killed by his
[2352.5s] son. In my
[2355.6s] village, in my
[2358.6s] village, 3 4 kilometers from my
[2362.9s] home, a
[2365.6s] mother
[2367.9s] was stabbed to
[2370.2s] death by a son.
[2374.5s] prior to
[2377.5s] which he had followed the mother in the
[2383.8s] market forcing her to give him money for
[2390.9s] drugs. Even the other elder was killed
[2394.1s] by the son. It was for the same
[2399.0s] reason. Our young people are lost into
[2402.7s] drugs.
[2405.7s] sinful
[2406.8s] nature. We wish we had another continent
[2409.4s] on where to bring up our
[2411.8s] children. Congratulations to you who has
[2415.4s] succeeded in this, but it's not
[2419.2s] easy. Where should we hide our children
[2424.0s] today? No wonder Sister White
[2427.4s] says yes, there is a remedy.
[2430.8s] Adventist
[2432.2s] education should be Adventist schools in
[2435.2s] the last days should be refugee camps
[2439.2s] for the tempted youth. I
[2444.3s] quote, I said young people are marrying,
[2447.4s] they conceive, they get they get
[2449.9s] children. But I want to say the first
[2452.8s] level of education starts in the
[2456.0s] home during expectancy.
[2460.0s] That is the time you need the father.
[2463.8s] Hey Reuben, I hope you're hearing this.
[2466.6s] I'm preparing
[2468.0s] you. When you marry my
[2473.0s] daughter-in-law and you know in our
[2475.2s] family we have never given birth with
[2478.6s] that lady. A
[2483.6s] lady and we are anxiously waiting to
[2487.0s] have our first daughter. And so is Dr.
[2491.3s] Wangai. The day we'll get that girl, I
[2495.4s] think we'll spoil her because that
[2498.0s] happened was
[2499.5s] it. So Reuben, when you marry,
[2504.3s] say
[2508.4s] amen. Please, the moment you see her
[2511.4s] spitting and spitting, that's how your
[2513.5s] mother started. I remember we were we
[2516.2s] were on our way from Kamagambo teachers
[2518.5s] conference and on the way she was
[2522.2s] spitting spitting the moment you see
[2525.2s] that know
[2528.4s] that Shadrachamundi Jr. is
[2532.4s] coming. That's our culture. The
[2534.7s] firstborn son, my name.
[2537.4s] Mhm. That is the time you
[2542.0s] need to bal your wife like an
[2547.0s] egg. Every morning, my dear. Good
[2550.4s] morning. How's our baby?
[2553.2s] Mhm. Two weeks. Two weeks.
[2556.4s] baby
[2558.3s] quatumbo. That is that time a wise man
[2562.2s] should always know how to treat the wife
[2564.9s] like an egg because the initial stages
[2568.2s] of bringing up a children the children
[2571.1s] is during
[2573.2s] expectancy. Let this mama never be
[2576.3s] stressed because by being stressed the
[2580.3s] baby shares the stress
[2583.6s] hormones.
[2585.2s] Born
[2588.1s] stressed
[2590.4s] tomorrow a stressed man, a stressed
[2593.2s] manager, a stress everything, a corrupt
[2596.1s] person. No wonder we are not short of
[2599.6s] corrupt people in this country because
[2602.2s] of the way we bring up our
[2609.7s] children. When she says let's go
[2612.8s] to go ahead of
[2616.0s] her when she says I don't need the cava
[2619.1s] anymore. Understand? Say I also feel
[2622.2s] like vomiting. Mhm.
[2625.7s] She cannot vomit
[2627.6s] alone. Move with her and move with their
[2631.8s] children at all
[2633.6s] levels. Behave
[2636.2s] like by the way we adise as parents we
[2639.2s] need to grow with our children. When the
[2641.8s] child is in form one be in form one
[2644.6s] psychologically. When the child is in
[2647.0s] primary grade one be in grade one. When
[2650.5s] the child is in the university be in the
[2653.0s] university psychologically. currently.
[2655.8s] Where do you think I am now? Where am
[2667.3s] I? It's natural. You have to move with
[2669.8s] your
[2671.2s] children. I saw a lady who sang here.
[2681.6s] I saw her and then I looked this way to
[2684.4s] see whether somebody is seeing like
[2688.0s] me. Move with the life of your
[2691.5s] child. Don't be left
[2706.0s] behind. That's where I am.
[2710.2s] Move with the light. Move with them.
[2713.3s] Homeschool. Homeschool.
[2716.4s] Homeschool. Befriend your child. Dr.
[2719.6s] Wangai when my dad was uh heading Kenya
[2723.3s] coast field. I remember you started
[2725.6s] Kizingua CDA church during that
[2728.5s] crusade. My dad I was teaching in
[2731.0s] Changam school. My dad was a field
[2733.0s] president. In the evening when we meet
[2734.7s] in the house, we used to
[2738.0s] play at a table tennis with my
[2742.0s] dad and this bonded us so
[2745.3s] closely. I loved him. He loved me and we
[2749.0s] were friends. You must befriend your
[2751.6s] child for you to win that child.
[2755.0s] Homeschool. The second level of
[2758.2s] education is the church. New life sda
[2761.0s] church. Let your child be in new life
[2765.5s] throughout. If it comes to adventurer,
[2768.0s] buy uniform. When it comes to whatever
[2770.7s] is required in the church, please commit
[2773.4s] your child of the church
[2775.1s] activities. By so doing, remember you
[2778.6s] are assisting to fight the sinful nature
[2782.1s] which can lead to your death if not
[2785.2s] directed. Psychologists
[2788.1s] say if your child grows with animals, no
[2792.2s] human
[2804.0s] being. level to the age of the pastor.
[2807.5s] The only language your child will know
[2810.6s] is
[2813.3s] bucking. Nothing else despite the
[2818.1s] intellect. When your child grows with
[2821.2s] chicken, the advanced level will be
[2826.7s] coo. That will be your
[2829.2s] child. The way you bring them up is the
[2832.6s] way they'll grow. Train up your child.
[2834.8s] 226 of
[2838.0s] Proverbs. Deuteronomy says 6 verse 6
[2842.8s] to9. Teach them diligently and
[2848.7s] committedly. You must commit yourself
[2851.4s] your life to them. Forget about looking
[2854.0s] for money. You have to come home on
[2856.8s] time. You have to take them through the
[2859.8s] homework. You have to commit time with
[2862.2s] them. You have to befriend your child
[2865.4s] for this child to be somebody
[2869.4s] tomorrow. Somebody
[2872.9s] said, "If you don't know the virginity
[2875.6s] status of your child, you are an enemy
[2878.5s] to your
[2880.4s] child." Can I repeat that,
[2882.8s] pastor? If you don't know the virginity
[2885.5s] status of your daughter, of your
[2888.4s] son, you are an enemy to your child.
[2892.3s] I know my son will ask me do you know
[2894.3s] mine I
[2903.5s] know and you need to keep talking to
[2907.5s] them for warning them reminding them of
[2911.4s] what lays ahead so that when you are
[2915.3s] close very close and they go and see
[2918.6s] what you used to tell them in school and
[2921.0s] I could
[2924.2s] Mom, I shouldn't take care of these
[2926.8s] boys. Exactly what you told me is what a
[2930.0s] boy told me
[2931.9s] today. A a child who does not share a
[2935.7s] feedback with a with a
[2939.3s] parent. There's a very big gap and the
[2942.3s] wider the gap, the more you lose your
[2944.6s] child.
[2947.3s] The third level is Adventist school
[2950.6s] which many of you don't like to
[2953.2s] hear. Adventist
[2955.6s] school. I thank God my parents went
[2958.2s] through Kura
[2959.9s] school. I thank God the grandparents of
[2962.9s] my wife
[2964.8s] grandparents went through Kura school.
[2967.3s] By the way, my wife's grandmother on the
[2970.2s] maternal side was the first Adventist
[2973.8s] Mumeu.
[2975.4s] He brought the church from Changamu to
[2978.6s] Dakanidi the grand the
[2982.1s] grandfather and they studied in Kara
[2984.9s] school and married the grandmother in
[2987.1s] the old sanctuary of
[2990.5s] Kura. You cannot you can't you can't
[2995.2s] miss it by extending the home school to
[2999.3s] the church school to the to the church
[3001.9s] education here in New Life and then
[3005.3s] proceeding the same education to an
[3007.8s] Adventist level of education. You can't
[3010.2s] lose it. Remember all the school system
[3013.4s] that you see in the world
[3015.9s] today have their roots in Eden. That was
[3018.9s] where the first school was. Through the
[3021.5s] schools of the prophets, through
[3024.0s] Kamusinga school, through Rabbi school,
[3028.0s] through the goto Kenya High, not Kenya
[3031.3s] High
[3032.8s] alliance, through
[3034.8s] Kamagambo among many other schools.
[3037.8s] There is no education in Kenya which was
[3040.3s] started by any government.
[3042.9s] All education comes from Eden through
[3045.7s] the schools of the prophets through the
[3048.3s] missionaries for the purpose of as I
[3054.0s] conclude remember in
[3056.6s] Eden there was a curriculum and the aim
[3060.2s] of the curriculum before the fall read
[3063.6s] education to retain the image of God in
[3067.1s] man. That was the purpose of Adventist
[3070.7s] education in Eden. Education to retain
[3074.4s] God's image in man. Immediately after
[3077.3s] the fall, God revealed the curriculum
[3080.6s] and it read and it has read. It has been
[3083.8s] reading and it is today. All education
[3087.0s] that you give to your child should the
[3089.7s] curriculum should read. Aim of the
[3092.3s] curriculum
[3093.8s] education to regain. The other one was
[3097.3s] to
[3098.4s] retain. This is now to regain the lost
[3102.6s] image of
[3104.3s] God in
[3107.6s] man. So wherever you want to take your
[3110.2s] child, take them anywhere. Let them get
[3113.2s] academics. It's upon you as a parent.
[3116.2s] But
[3117.4s] remember Matthew 9:35.
[3121.6s] One of the purposes for this education
[3123.9s] is Jesus went to the cities and
[3126.4s] synagogues and everywhere teaching
[3129.4s] them preaching and healing. You remember
[3132.6s] one of the advantages of Adventist
[3134.5s] education is to
[3136.3s] preach and to
[3138.4s] heal and to educate them. Academics is
[3142.4s] not enough. May I tell you friends,
[3145.6s] academics minus Jesus equals your child
[3148.5s] disturbing you in need of
[3151.2s] drugs. I never finished for you the
[3153.8s] story about the lady in my village back
[3156.2s] in the county 4 kilometers from my home.
[3160.7s] He went looking for the mother and he
[3163.0s] found the mother in the market asked the
[3165.7s] mother to give him money for drugs. The
[3168.6s] mother said, "My son, I have nothing."
[3171.1s] Then the son in the market stripped the
[3175.2s] mother
[3178.0s] naked in search of
[3180.9s] money. Alang
[3183.8s] was then the neighbors the the the those
[3187.0s] who were selling bless came and tied
[3189.4s] more. She was taken he was taken for
[3192.6s] remand
[3194.6s] uh arrested and taken for remand. After
[3197.6s] a few months after a few months listen
[3199.9s] to this. After a few months, the mother
[3202.1s] went and said, "My mother will die. My
[3204.2s] my my son will die in the remand. Please
[3207.4s] I I I I forgive him." You know that is
[3211.6s] foolish foolishness of mothers at the
[3214.6s] highest
[3216.8s] level. Even if you love your child, you
[3219.2s] have to love your child
[3221.2s] reasonably. There there comes a time
[3223.3s] when you as the mother will call the
[3225.0s] police and say, "Let him be arrested.
[3227.2s] let him be imprisoned for 2 three years
[3229.7s] for him to come to his
[3232.0s] senses. After he was taken from the
[3234.2s] remand, he went to the mother and said,
[3235.6s] "Mom, thank you. I really appreciate,
[3239.1s] but 5,000 anytime I need keep
[3242.9s] it. The moment you miss that money, I'll
[3246.4s] kill you." So he went away. One time he
[3249.7s] came home and met the mother alone in at
[3251.8s] home. Asked for the mother money. The
[3254.4s] money was not there. Then he told the
[3256.6s] mother,
[3258.4s] "Today comes the end of your
[3261.9s] life." The mother ran from the house. He
[3264.6s] ran after he ran after her, put her on
[3268.1s] the ground. As she was making noise, he
[3271.7s] cut of the lips, cut off the lips and
[3275.5s] said, "Today is not a
[3277.6s] joke. You must give me the money. I'm
[3280.4s] killing you."
[3282.5s] This young young man chopped off the
[3285.9s] head of the
[3287.1s] mother, separated the body of the mother
[3290.1s] from the head and threw it
[3293.3s] away. The child you are seated with
[3299.7s] now. I'm praying for that
[3303.3s] child. I'm praying for your grandchild.
[3307.4s] I'm praying for your
[3308.9s] daughter that they this should never
[3312.4s] happen to you from your child. The other
[3317.0s] day in one of the neighboring uh one of
[3320.5s] the neighboring counties of
[3322.8s] Nairobi, a young man raped the the
[3325.8s] mother successfully. The father was in
[3329.2s] the farm. On hearing the noise from his
[3332.4s] wife, he ran to rescue the the wife. He
[3334.6s] thought thieves have abandoned the
[3336.0s] house.
[3337.3s] only to run straight to the bedroom and
[3339.9s] met his
[3344.0s] son. The very
[3346.3s] act because of use of these drugs and
[3349.1s] name
[3350.3s] it when he trying to separate the son
[3355.5s] from he had a weapon. He had a metal
[3358.2s] bar. He hid the father on the forehead.
[3362.1s] He fell on the on the pool of blood
[3364.9s] blood and he went back to the mother.
[3367.3s] That's where we've reached
[3373.8s] today. Bringing up a
[3376.7s] child, you must follow the three levels.
[3379.8s] Come home dedicatedly. Teach them as
[3382.2s] they go out. Put on the door posts.
[3385.4s] Teach them all the
[3387.0s] time. Bring them to church.
[3390.2s] Let them not miss any
[3395.1s] find you've washed your
[3398.8s] hands. Then take them for Adventist
[3401.7s] education where the teachers will
[3403.8s] continue from where you left. It is my
[3406.2s] prayer,
[3407.7s] friends, that this education Sabbath
[3411.0s] today marks a difference on the way you
[3414.7s] bring up your
[3418.7s] family. When I talk about taking your
[3421.1s] child to Adventist school, it's not a
[3423.4s] must by the way, but as for me and my
[3425.5s] house will do the
[3428.3s] same. for you. When I married her,
[3432.6s] Kumbuka, our children was study in
[3436.4s] Adventist schools. And when he went to
[3439.4s] Kitoui boarding, SDA boarding primary
[3441.8s] school, he passed well, I thank God. He
[3444.2s] was sent
[3446.8s] to a national school which is not
[3449.8s] Adventist.
[3451.4s] Kar was not performing well, but we
[3454.0s] risked and
[3455.3s] said, "Let let let let let let let let
[3457.2s] let let let let let let let let let let
[3457.2s] let let let let let let let let let let
[3457.6s] let let let let let let let let let let
[3457.6s] let let let let let let let let let let
[3458.0s] let let let let let let let let let let
[3458.0s] let let let let let the Bible
[3460.8s] says let the children come to
[3464.0s] me." And I remember that is the day my
[3466.6s] wife reminded me that she went to Kenya
[3468.7s] High School and I went to Motito
[3472.6s] SDA that we are spoiling the life of
[3475.8s] this young man. But I said if you if you
[3479.4s] must risk with the life of your child
[3481.4s] risking the Lord today is a
[3484.6s] surgeon through Kura through Adventist
[3488.5s] schools. You'll never be
[3490.8s] mistaken by committing your life to your
[3495.2s] child from the stomach. Amen.
[3499.9s] To the infancy. Commit yourself.
[3504.2s] Don't quarrel your wife at all when she
[3506.9s] is expectant. You are destroying this
[3509.2s] child. Remember, you're in the process
[3511.3s] of mentoring and bringing him up. May
[3514.5s] the Lord bless you. How many of you
[3516.7s] pray? Say with me, oh my dear God, I
[3520.6s] commit my family to you. I'll now be
[3523.8s] committed to the bringing up these
[3526.0s] children and the children who are here.
[3529.0s] I will ask my parents, I'll befriend my
[3532.3s] parents so that they can give me the
[3533.9s] very best. When I talk about adventist
[3536.2s] education, it is not at the expense of
[3538.6s] academic performance. Your child must
[3541.1s] perform so that the career can be
[3545.2s] successful. Those who do pray with me
[3548.5s] that God intervene for my children,
[3551.5s] intervene for my family. As I pray, pray
[3555.0s] for them, pray for yourself, pray for
[3557.5s] that wisdom. Heavenly Father, King of
[3560.3s] glory, we thank you so much for this
[3563.1s] church. We thank you for the
[3565.8s] listener, may we have a turn around to
[3568.2s] the behavior of our children, our
[3571.8s] grandchildren. Lord, our father, on that
[3574.2s] day, we would
[3575.6s] wish to hear where are the children that
[3578.3s] I gave you. You say they are not only my
[3580.5s] children, but I bring you even the
[3583.7s] grandchildren. Bless us. Make us
[3586.9s] understand our sinful nature. Make us
[3590.1s] know that you are our remedy through the
[3592.4s] cross and through
[3594.0s] believing. Because the Bible
[3596.7s] says those who believe in you and accept
[3599.6s] you, they will be given the power and
[3601.5s] the right to become your children. We
[3603.6s] claim that right. Lord, bless this
[3606.8s] church even in the afternoon programs.
[3609.6s] Be with us to the end. We pray in Jesus
[3613.0s] name. Amen. God bless you.
