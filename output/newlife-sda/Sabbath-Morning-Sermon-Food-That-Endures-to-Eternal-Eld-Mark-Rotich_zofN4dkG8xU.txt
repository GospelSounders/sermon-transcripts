FULL TRANSCRIPT:
[Music] Thank you. Thank you choir and also thank you children for the sermon and also thank you for choir about Jesus wonderful story. One of the major topics in the Bible is an major occupation that we all are in. And in fact, one of the things that you quickly find when you read the Bible is that the Bibles is written in agricultural setting. And one of the things that you find also in the Bible is that it talks quite a lot about food. I know if I was to do a sermon for 3 hours, some of you will be very very agitated because something will be happening largely because of food. Is that true? So the Bible takes a lot of time to talk about food. In fact, in the first chapter, when you read the Bible, in the book of Genesis, Genesis 1:29 begins to talk about food, which tells us food is very central in our lives. We spend a lot of our money, we spend a lot of our time looking for food. You know we are told that we spend about 20% of our income on food. Some of us spend 30%. If you spend like 10% then you are probably one of the rich people. So it means that um you are rich. So you can calculate how much you spend on food. If you spend about 10% of your income, you should already know that you are in somehow in the upper class. Otherwise you should spend a lot of your time on on food. We are told that from the many organizations that are there and there are very many organization. You can look at the UN as something like WHO World Health Organization. They have FAO food agricultural organization. We have World Food Program. A lot of them deal with food. They deal with food in many ways and in many aspects. Yet we know that about 3.1 million people in the world today still suffer from anger. They don't have enough food. They don't get enough food. Let's come closer. In Kenya, we are told 52% do not have enough food. You know 52% is one in two. So you can look at your neighbor and ask if they had enough food. If it is not the neighbor and then it must be you because 52% means one in every two do not have enough food. And when you do not have enough food, a lot of things happen. A lot of things happen when you do not have enough food. And it's not only food but nutritious food. We spend a lot of time in school learning about different types of food. And when we talking about food, we actually talking about food that nourishes us for the purposes of our health, our repair, our growth. So we need not only food but also need food that has nutrients and that's why we talk about things like balanced diet. So the balanced diet that we talk about is ensuring that you get sufficient nutrients that your body needs. You know the Bible is very interesting because it tells us of some of the experiences that happens when you do not have food. When you do not have food generally we say you are malnourished. You could be malnourished simply because you have not taken the balanced diet. The size of your body may not tell us whether you are actually nourished or not because you might be very big but you are missing micronutrients. And so we are talking about food that is balanced that has carbohydrates, proteins, fats and the other minerals and micronutrients that you need. Otherwise you may be eating food but you are not nourished. So the Bible tells us that in Genesis 1:29 that God gave us food. He gave us food because it is a means of our sustenance. You know, I don't know how many people can stay without food for long. And when you stay without food for long, you actually lose your temper. Not only do you lose your temper, you may also lose your perspective. A friend of mine tells me that there are people when they miss food, you should not be able to talk to them. I come from a culture that I've got different diverse things. Food will also mean relationship. When people invite you for food, they're actually telling you that they have a relationship with you. And in my culture, when you are having serious business, food is the one that seals that serious business. So when you consume food, it tells us that something has been accepted. But I know in some communities of course also here in Kenya that they want to give you food so that you have energy for serious business. So whichever the case is food is so important whether it's for the business that you want to do or for the deal that you have agreed food is very important. And so we come to know that when the Bible talks about food, it talks about something that is about every day everyday life of our undertaking. You know, we know that Jesus is probably the one that we know that stayed longer without food. And we know that from Matthew 4:4 that he had fasted for about how many days? 40 days. I know some of us cannot even fast for half a day. I have somebody who tells me even the normal fast that we do on a monthly basis. It tells me that if I fast, I think I might die because of uh fasting for one meal. But let me just remind us that we lose perspective if we do not eat well. And a case in point is that when you look at Genesis chapter 25 reading from verse 29, we'll not read it just to emphasize the point about how we lose our perspective if we don't get enough nutrition or enough food. We get a very interesting story which we are very familiar of this guy called Iso or Esau. Sometimes it baffles me that for just a meal you can actually sell your birthight. It baffles me that because somebody has offered you a stew of lentils, you decide to give out your birthight. It means that it might be what sometimes people ask, do you live for food or do you eat food to live or you live to eat food? It might be sometimes we live to eat food. And so Esau was very quick to say to his brother Jacob, just give me the stew and take the birthight. Wonder about the effect of food. What have you given up because of food? You might have given up the opportunity to study because of food. You might have given an opportunity even to get a job because of food. Ponder about it. There might be some things that you have given out because of food. We are told also in the book of Exodus chapter 16, you remember the story of the Israelites when they were coming out of Egypt. When they left Egypt, I believe they were very excited leaving slavery of 430 years going to the promised land. But very shortly after leaving, the reality strikes. This m magnitude of people need food. And then they're asking Moses, "Did you bring us into the desert to starve us to death?" The thinking that goes on when you do not have food. You think that it is important to be a slave and eat because that's exactly what he says in Exodus 16:3. It says that did you take us so that you kill us in the desert with starvation? Think about it. Would it have been better for them to remain in Egypt and be slaves or to go out and become free in the land of Israel? It is easy to lose perspective when you have not eaten. There are many signs of malnutrition. One of those is losing perspective. Other signs that you may have if you are losing enough nutrients sometimes you may not even sleep. I don't know how many of you sleep when you're very hungry but a lot of us do not sleep when we do not have enough food. We become selfish. I live a narrow-minded. There are many things that happen when we do not have enough food. But let's think about a more important thing. The food that we eat, the food that we consume is only temporal. Jesus also talks about food. Not only does he talk about food, but he does miracles about food. In our consideration, we will look at John chapter 6. John chapter 6 is one of those books or one of those chapters that is one of the longest in John itself. But there are many things that you find in John chapter 6. You find first of all in John chapter 6. It starts with food is one of these miracles that we always talk about that Jesus fed 5,000 people. And this is the story that you will find in John chapter 6 1-15, the feeding of the 5,000. And is one of those that is actually recorded in all the gospels. The 5,000 is about men and I don't know how many ladies were there and children were there. So this is a big multitude. Jesus fed many people and as you point about that it's also reminds us what happened in the wilderness. the wilderness was that there were 600,000 men and they were all fed by the same God. And then as you progress in John chapter 6, you get John's 16-21. John 16-21 is a very short interlude of what was happening before. And this is Jesus walking on water. So this is the miracle of Jesus of walking in water. And then we go back to John 6 622:59. It's a very long passage. Jesus now talks about food and he talks about him being the bread. You know I was uh saying before that um we are lucky to be in centers because uh we understand the bread very easily. And uh in the rural folks they may not understand bread. When I was growing brought up I didn't understand this text very well because it was talking about bread. And uh when I was growing up bread was not something that was available for us. So when I read the Bible saying Jesus is saying is the bread I was wondering so Jesus is very scarce because we eat bread very rarely. So until I came to understand that the language bread is quite used very frequently in the Bible. In fact it is used 230 times in the Bible. Food is used in the Bible 1,200 times. But when it comes to bread is one of those most significant types of food that is being used and it is used 230 times which is telling us the setting of the Bible when it was written the most prominent food was bread. So for us I would have been saying that this I could replace with I don't know what's prominent in your village or in your home but actually it's the stable food. So Jesus is saying I'm the stable food. So if your bread is your stable food, then you can actually say from what the Bible says is that Jesus is saying I am the stable food. I am what you need to sustain your life. So for us who are not very familiar with bread, we were wondering what does this mean? But the Bible is very clear that bread here refers to the food that we eat on a regular basis that we use to to sustain ourselves. And Jesus come to me with me to John 6:27 the text that was read to us and and I'm reading from the New King James Version. It says, "Do not labor for the food which perishes, but for the food which endures to everlasting life, which the son of man will give you because God the father has set his seal upon him." What what I get from here is that Jesus is saying get your priorities right. Get your priorities right. So the priorities that we have is that we focus on the food that does not give us eternal life. So Jesus is saying in this in this text that we are reading get your priorities right. He's not saying that do not labor for food that you eat on a daily basis but saying order your life in the right priorities. It says that God first is where your focus should be because the Bible tells us that if we seek God all other things will be added to us. In other words, consider your priorities. Consider how you focus. Consider where you put your effort. Consider what you need to do in order of your priorities. We often get the priorities wrong. We focus on the temporal and forget that we can easily become spiritual malnourished. We might be overfed in terms of their physical food. We may not be among the 51% that do not have enough food in Kenya, but we might be among those who are spiritually malnourished. And God is saying or Jesus is telling us in this text, put your priorities right. focus on eternal issues. We may not be able to think about eternal things if we do not know that we have to put God first. Is God first in our lives or are we fast in our lives? Of course, food makes us to be fast in our life because we think about what do I eat today? How do I make sure that I do not become malnourished? But we are forgetting that there is more important things and the more important things is to set your mind above. To set your mind on the things of above. Colossians 3:2 it says, "Set your mind on things above, not on earthly things." If we set our minds on Christ, we will be able to know that we will be able to get the food that we need. If we look Matthew 6:33 which says, "But seek first the kingdom of God and his righteousness and all these things will be added unto you." If we put God first, we are doing the right thing. We are in danger of becoming spiritually malnourished when we focus on the wrong things. Sometimes we focus on the wrong things because we do not ask the right questions. You know the system that we live in ask a lot of questions but they ask and give us the wrong questions and perhaps suggest the wrong things for us. If you need to be spiritually nourished well you need to be able to have the right perspective. Some of the perspectives that we get from the world is that we are not created but we will evolve from some small things into what we are. Which means that if we take that perspective we are losing the focus. We do not ask the right question. We should get the right answers from the Bible. So that means that we get our perspective and our priorities from the Bible. If you do not understand that you are created, you might be asking yourself, why do I need to focus on God? But if you know that the Bible tells us Psalms 139:14, you are wonderfully and fearfully what? Made. Then you know that you are created by God and therefore you set your mind on the things of God. If we do not identify our priorities, in order for us to do priorities, first of all, we have to identify what is our goal in life. So our goal in life is not only about living here because the food that we have will allow us to live on this world only. But if we look at the spiritual food, then we are setting our eyes on things above. Meaning that we are putting our priorities right. And therefore we are saying that we need to have eternal life and eternal life does not come from the food that we eat but from the spiritual food that comes from above. And Jesus says I am the bread of life that came from the father so that he may give us the spiritual food. So what do we need to do then? If we need to be spiritually nourished. So what do we do need to do? We know that from the physical if we are not having enough food we go and look at food with nutrients. We need if you having um quasho or whatever food deficiency you need to eat proteins. Isn't it? If you are stunted, you know, stunting is not growing to the right level because of general lack of food. You could also be or I could be also standed in Christian work and it means I am not nourished enough. So therefore we need to be well nourished spiritually and because our normal food has three main things. I want to suggest three main things that we need to do. The main normal physical food we say that we need to do carbohydrates, proteins and fats. Often we we forget the micronutrients but we normally say balanced diet is three things but generally this three plus. So let me just say three things that we need to do. They are not difficult but it is important that we are reminded. The first one is to know that we have to have a relationship with God. Without relationship with God then we lose focus. We need to have a relationship with God. And we develop the relationship with God by studying the word of God. We have to use the Bible as the basis for us to know the things of above and the things of earth. And we have to make sure that we are always and regularly reading the word of God. First Timothy 4:6, our souls must be nourished on the words of the faith and of the sound doctrine. These are the sound doctrines that we get from the Bible. We have to be able to know that the things that set us apart a apart is not the things that come from the world but things that come from the word of God. We have to study the word of God diligently. Diligently means that we need to be able to be reading on a regular basis and not only reading but to be also doers of the word. According to James 1:22, it tells us to not be only hearers but doers of the word. So first of all, let's have a relationship with God. Let's know that God is the one who created us. It's God who has redeemed us. It's God who is saved us from all our iniquities and it is God who wants to give us eternal life. We do not get eternal life from any other source. You do not get eternal life by eating all types of food. Even if you eat enough soya, you will never become you'll not have eternal life. So eternal life is based on the relationship with God. When you have the relationship with God, then you have a journey that leads to eternal life. Second, we need to spend time in worship. It's not enough to be able to read the Bible. Of course, John tells us in Revelation 1:3 that blessed is the one who reads the word of God and also does what? Hears. So it's not only enough for us to be reading and hearing but also it means that we should also be able to worship God. And worshiping God enables us to put God in his position. If we do not put God in position, it means actually we are dethroning God and putting ourselves in in the position of God. So we need to be able to come to God because Psalms 52:22 says that cast your burdens upon the Lord and he will sustain you. Whatever issues that are in our lives, whatever challenges that we have, whatever things that make us to be anxious, we should present them to the Lord and we should also come to the Lord in singing. Thank you choir for singing. Thank you children for also for singing because Psalms 96 verse1 says sing to the Lord a new song. Come to the house of the Lord with praises. That means we are acknowledging God. So we should praise God. We should sing. We should also hear the word of God and we should come to God in prayer. I know the children talk about prayer. So I'm not talking much about prayer because they already talked about it. Sometimes we think prayer is one street. It's one way. Of course, LG White says prayer is talking to God as to a friend. But often we think prayer is us going to God but not also listening from God. So prayer allows us to also listen to God. Ellen G. White in steps to Christ says in page 101 that um prayer is placing ourself at the opportune place where we can receive rays of light from heaven. So we should also receive rays of light from heaven when we do pray. And finally, when you read and study the word of God and worship, we should be able to serve. The reason why some legs and rivers end up in a lake and some legs being called uh dead sea or uh salty is because they don't have an outlet. If you do not have an outlet then you develop some symptoms. Some of these symptoms is a lot of salt in you. Uh if you go to the red sea or the dead sea there's a lot of uh saltiness in it. Uh and it become dead because nothing lives in there. So one of the things that we need to do is we are not going to be nourished and then sit idle. In fact, one of the things that you read in the book of Ezekiel, we are not going there. It says one of the biggest scenes of Sodom and Comra was they were eating and doing nothing. It was the scene of idleness. When you are satisfied and you do not do anything, you multiply evil. So it is also important in the spiritual realms that when you are spiritually nourished you serve others otherwise you become spiritual obese. We know as we started by saying there are 3.1 million people that do not have enough food. There are also equally a lot of people in the world that are obese. In other words, they have too much that they do not the bodies even do not know what to do with it. Therefore, we can also become spiritually obese. And therefore, the Bible requires us that as we have been fed, we should also feed others. And we do not have to go to the streets, you actually feed where you are. Start from where you are and feed. I pray that we should not become spiritually obese. The Bible tells us in Mark 16:15 that we should go into the wall. You should do not go to the wall if you are you are malnourished. You should be fed and then you can go to the wall and feed the wall. You give what you have. And therefore we need to ensure that when we go out we are going to share. Proverbs 11:25 Proverbs 11:25 says you do yourself a favor. You do yourself a favor by sharing. You know there's things that is known well in education perhaps it's also used in other sectors. The best way of learning is also sharing. Let me repeat that again. The best way of learning is by sharing. The best way of understanding concepts is by explaining. Expressions deepens impression. So in other words, if you want to understand something better, explain it to somebody else. In education, sometimes we actually do put learners together so that they can talk. Why? Because expression depends impression. We know that by writing you also process your thinking. But by expression, you also deepen your impression. Proverbs 11:25 tells us, "You do yourself well by serving others." In other words, we are going to be blessed by serving others. So sometimes we look for blessings and we are looking it at the wrong places. The blessing that you need might be in your neighbor. By serving your neighbor, you actually serving yourself because there is blessing in reaching out to others. So the Bible reminds us that it is we do well if we serve others. So we need to consider that we do well when we serve others. In conclusion, we do well to be spiritually nourished. We need to be spiritually nourished. We have food that we take on a regular basis. But this food that we take on a regular basis does not take us to have eternal life. Eternal life according to John 6:27 is in Christ Jesus. Eternal life is not found in medicine. We know that we can live longer by going to hospital when we are sick. But that only is postponing your death. Eating the normal food postpones your death. But death is an eventuality. Therefore, if we want to have eternal life, we should have Jesus who is the food and the bread of life. And so that's where we start. We start by saying we have a relationship with Jesus Christ. We maintain our spiritual nourishment by studying the word of God. Let's study the word of God on a daily and regular basis so that we know and set things that are right and set our priorities correctly. Second, we should be able to worship God. Worshiing God puts God in his rightful position. We need to be able to pray on a regular basis, but also need to ensure that we are worshiping God in hymns and in other forms of worship. And finally, we also need to ensure that we serve others. By serving others we are acting our faith. Faith without works is what? If we be say that we have been saved and we do not know that God also wants to save others then our faith is misplaced. So we have to do the three things knowing that God is the bread of life. And so I ask that today we may consider this bread of life. Consider the bread of life that is not the world is not what the world gives us but the bread of life that comes from Jesus himself. If we have this bread of life, we have eternal life. If we have Jesus, we have eternal life. I pray that we have Jesus who is the bread of life and therefore have eternal life in Jesus name. Amen.

TIMESTAMPED TRANSCRIPT:
[0.2s] [Music]
[8.8s] Thank you. Thank you choir and also
[11.7s] thank you children for
[14.4s] the
[16.2s] sermon and also thank you for choir
[19.5s] about Jesus wonderful story.
[24.6s] One of the major topics in the
[28.1s] Bible is an major occupation that we all
[32.1s] are in. And in fact, one of the things
[35.4s] that you quickly find when you read the
[37.8s] Bible is that the Bibles is written in
[42.1s] agricultural
[44.1s] setting. And one of the things that you
[46.7s] find also in the Bible is that it talks
[50.4s] quite a lot about food.
[53.4s] I know if I was to do a sermon for 3
[56.6s] hours, some of you will be very very
[58.8s] agitated because something will be
[61.7s] happening largely because of food. Is
[64.4s] that
[65.2s] true? So the Bible takes a lot of time
[69.2s] to talk about food. In fact, in the
[73.2s] first chapter, when you read the Bible,
[76.2s] in the book of
[78.6s] Genesis, Genesis 1:29 begins to talk
[81.8s] about food, which tells us food is very
[85.2s] central in our
[87.5s] lives. We spend a lot of our
[90.2s] money, we spend a lot of our time
[93.3s] looking for food.
[95.5s] You know we are told
[97.6s] that we spend about 20% of our income on
[102.3s] food. Some of us spend 30%. If you spend
[106.3s] like 10% then you are probably one of
[108.7s] the rich people. So it means that um you
[111.5s] are rich. So you can calculate how much
[114.0s] you spend on food. If you spend about
[116.3s] 10% of your income, you should already
[118.6s] know that you are in somehow in the
[120.5s] upper class. Otherwise you should spend
[122.8s] a lot of your time on on food. We are
[126.2s] told that from the many organizations
[129.7s] that are there and there are very many
[131.5s] organization. You can look at the UN as
[135.4s] something like WHO World Health
[137.4s] Organization. They have FAO food
[140.1s] agricultural organization. We have World
[142.6s] Food Program. A lot of them deal with
[146.6s] food. They deal with food in many ways
[149.1s] and in many aspects. Yet we know that
[154.2s] about 3.1 million people in the world
[156.6s] today still suffer from anger. They
[160.5s] don't have enough food. They don't get
[163.3s] enough food. Let's come closer. In
[167.0s] Kenya, we are told
[169.6s] 52% do not have enough food. You know
[172.6s] 52% is one in two. So you can look at
[175.8s] your neighbor and ask if they had enough
[177.9s] food. If it is not the neighbor and then
[180.2s] it must be you because 52% means one in
[183.9s] every two do not have enough food. And
[186.9s] when you do not have enough food, a lot
[189.0s] of things
[190.7s] happen. A lot of things happen when you
[193.0s] do not have enough food. And it's not
[195.6s] only food but nutritious
[199.3s] food. We spend a lot of time in school
[202.0s] learning about different types of food.
[204.6s] And when we talking about food, we
[207.0s] actually talking about food that
[209.5s] nourishes us for the purposes of our
[214.0s] health, our repair, our growth. So we
[217.9s] need not only food but also need food
[221.2s] that has nutrients and that's why we
[223.8s] talk about things like balanced diet. So
[227.1s] the balanced diet that we talk about is
[229.7s] ensuring that you get sufficient
[231.7s] nutrients that your body needs.
[234.6s] You know the Bible is very interesting
[237.1s] because it tells us of some of the
[238.8s] experiences that happens when you do not
[241.5s] have food. When you do not have food
[244.2s] generally we say you are
[246.1s] malnourished. You could be malnourished
[248.8s] simply because you have not taken the
[250.6s] balanced
[252.3s] diet. The size of your body may not tell
[254.9s] us whether you are actually nourished or
[256.7s] not because you might be very big but
[259.1s] you are missing
[260.5s] micronutrients. And so we are talking
[262.8s] about food that is balanced that has
[265.8s] carbohydrates, proteins, fats and the
[269.4s] other minerals and micronutrients that
[272.5s] you need. Otherwise you may be eating
[275.3s] food but you are not nourished. So the
[278.2s] Bible tells us that in Genesis 1:29 that
[283.2s] God gave us
[285.6s] food. He gave us food because it is a
[289.0s] means of our sustenance.
[291.4s] You know, I don't know how many people
[292.8s] can stay without food for
[295.5s] long. And when you stay without food for
[298.4s] long, you actually lose your temper. Not
[301.3s] only do you lose your temper, you may
[303.4s] also lose your
[305.2s] perspective. A friend of mine tells me
[307.7s] that there are people when they miss
[310.9s] food, you should not be able to talk to
[313.0s] them. I come from a culture that I've
[315.8s] got different diverse things. Food will
[318.8s] also mean
[321.4s] relationship. When people invite you for
[323.7s] food, they're actually telling you that
[326.1s] they have a relationship with you. And
[329.1s] in my culture, when you are having
[330.7s] serious
[332.1s] business, food is the one that seals
[334.8s] that serious
[336.8s] business. So when you consume food, it
[339.6s] tells us that something has been
[341.8s] accepted. But I know in some communities
[344.6s] of course also here in Kenya that they
[347.4s] want to give you food so that you have
[348.8s] energy for serious business. So
[351.7s] whichever the case is food is so
[354.5s] important whether it's for the business
[356.6s] that you want to do or for the deal that
[358.8s] you have agreed food is very important.
[362.2s] And so we come to know that when the
[365.1s] Bible talks about food, it talks about
[367.7s] something that is about every day
[369.4s] everyday life of
[370.9s] our
[373.6s] undertaking. You know, we know
[375.9s] that
[378.4s] Jesus is probably the one that we know
[380.9s] that stayed longer without food.
[384.7s] And we know that from Matthew
[387.9s] 4:4 that he had fasted for about how
[391.0s] many days? 40
[393.1s] days. I know some of us cannot even fast
[395.9s] for half a day. I have somebody who
[398.4s] tells me even the
[400.8s] normal fast that we do on a monthly
[403.4s] basis. It tells me that if I fast, I
[406.2s] think I might die because of uh fasting
[408.7s] for one meal.
[410.7s] But let me just remind us that we lose
[413.1s] perspective if we do not eat
[415.2s] well. And a case in point is that when
[418.6s] you look at Genesis chapter
[422.1s] 25 reading from verse 29, we'll not read
[425.2s] it just to emphasize the point about how
[428.1s] we lose our perspective if we don't get
[429.9s] enough nutrition or enough food. We get
[433.3s] a very interesting story which we are
[435.8s] very familiar of this guy called Iso or
[441.0s] Esau. Sometimes it baffles me
[445.4s] that for just a meal you can actually
[449.8s] sell your
[450.8s] birthight. It baffles me that because
[455.2s] somebody has offered you a stew of
[460.4s] lentils, you decide to give out your
[463.2s] birthight. It means that it might be
[467.4s] what sometimes people ask, do you live
[469.6s] for food or do you eat food to live or
[473.0s] you live to eat food? It might be
[475.3s] sometimes we live to eat food. And so
[478.5s] Esau was very quick to say to his
[481.4s] brother
[482.4s] Jacob, just give me the stew and take
[485.4s] the
[487.6s] birthight. Wonder about the effect of
[490.6s] food. What have you given up because of
[494.5s] food? You might have given up the
[496.8s] opportunity to study because of food.
[499.6s] You might have given an opportunity even
[501.4s] to get a job because of food. Ponder
[503.8s] about it. There might be some things
[505.7s] that you have given out because of
[508.7s] food. We are told also in the book of
[512.6s] Exodus chapter 16, you remember the
[515.0s] story of the Israelites when they were
[517.4s] coming out of Egypt.
[521.6s] When they left Egypt, I believe they
[524.4s] were very
[526.5s] excited leaving slavery of 430 years
[531.2s] going to the promised
[533.2s] land. But very shortly after leaving,
[537.0s] the reality
[539.4s] strikes. This m magnitude of people need
[543.6s] food. And then they're asking
[546.4s] Moses, "Did you bring us into the desert
[550.3s] to starve us to
[553.3s] death?" The thinking that goes on when
[555.9s] you do not have food. You think that it
[559.2s] is important to be a slave and eat
[562.1s] because that's exactly what he says
[564.7s] in Exodus 16:3. It says
[568.8s] that did you take us so that you kill us
[571.9s] in the desert with
[575.2s] starvation? Think about it. Would it
[577.9s] have been better for them to remain in
[579.7s] Egypt and be slaves or to go out and
[582.6s] become free in the land of Israel? It is
[586.4s] easy to lose perspective when you have
[589.4s] not
[590.1s] eaten. There are many signs of
[592.5s] malnutrition. One of those is losing
[594.8s] perspective. Other signs that you may
[597.5s] have if you are losing enough nutrients
[602.6s] sometimes you may not even
[604.8s] sleep. I don't know how many of you
[606.9s] sleep when you're very hungry but a lot
[609.4s] of us do not sleep when we do not have
[611.4s] enough
[612.2s] food. We become selfish. I live a
[616.6s] narrow-minded. There are many things
[618.4s] that happen when we do not have enough
[621.5s] food. But let's think
[624.6s] about a more important thing. The food
[628.2s] that we eat, the food that we
[631.5s] consume is only
[633.9s] temporal.
[635.7s] Jesus also talks about food. Not only
[639.2s] does he talk about food, but he does
[641.4s] miracles about
[643.3s] food. In our consideration, we will look
[647.0s] at John chapter 6.
[651.1s] John chapter 6 is one of those
[654.6s] books or one of those chapters that is
[658.6s] one of the longest in John itself. But
[661.0s] there are many things that you find in
[663.1s] John chapter 6.
[666.7s] You find first of all in John chapter
[671.3s] 6. It starts with
[676.0s] food is one of these miracles that we
[678.9s] always talk about that Jesus fed 5,000
[683.0s] people. And this is the story that you
[685.2s] will find in John chapter 6 1-15, the
[689.0s] feeding of the 5,000. And is one of
[691.8s] those that is actually recorded in all
[694.2s] the gospels.
[696.9s] The
[698.7s] 5,000 is about men and I don't know how
[703.0s] many ladies were there and children were
[704.8s] there. So this is a big multitude. Jesus
[708.2s] fed many people and as you point about
[712.3s] that it's also reminds us what happened
[715.9s] in the wilderness. the wilderness was
[718.6s] that there were
[721.1s] 600,000 men and they were all fed by the
[725.0s] same
[726.8s] God. And then as you progress in John
[729.3s] chapter 6, you get John's
[734.1s] 16-21. John
[736.4s] 16-21 is a very short interlude of what
[739.8s] was happening before. And this is Jesus
[742.3s] walking on water. So this is the miracle
[744.9s] of Jesus of walking in
[747.2s] water. And then we go back to John 6
[752.7s] 622:59. It's a very long passage. Jesus
[755.7s] now talks about food and he talks about
[759.0s] him being the
[762.0s] bread. You know I was uh saying before
[765.0s] that um we are lucky to be in centers
[769.0s] because uh we understand the bread very
[771.8s] easily.
[773.4s] And uh in the rural folks they may not
[775.8s] understand bread. When I was growing
[777.4s] brought up I didn't understand this text
[780.1s] very well because it was talking about
[782.7s] bread. And uh when I was growing up
[785.1s] bread was not something that was
[786.8s] available for us. So when I read the
[789.6s] Bible saying Jesus is saying is the
[791.7s] bread I was wondering so Jesus is very
[795.8s] scarce because we eat bread very rarely.
[799.1s] So until I came to understand that the
[801.7s] language bread is quite used very
[806.2s] frequently in the Bible. In fact it is
[808.7s] used 230 times in the
[811.8s] Bible. Food is used in the Bible 1,200
[816.4s] times. But when it comes to bread is one
[819.4s] of those most significant types of food
[821.4s] that is being used and it is used 230
[824.5s] times which is telling us the setting of
[828.7s] the Bible when it was written the most
[831.4s] prominent food was bread. So for us I
[834.6s] would have been saying that this I could
[837.1s] replace with I don't know what's
[839.3s] prominent in your village or in your
[841.5s] home but actually it's the stable food.
[845.3s] So Jesus is saying I'm the stable food.
[848.2s] So if your bread is your stable food,
[850.7s] then you can actually say from what the
[853.0s] Bible says is that Jesus is saying I am
[856.1s] the stable food. I am what you need to
[859.8s] sustain your life. So for us who are not
[862.8s] very familiar with bread, we were
[864.8s] wondering what does this mean? But the
[866.9s] Bible is very clear that bread here
[869.6s] refers to the food that we eat on a
[872.2s] regular basis that we use to to sustain
[875.5s] ourselves. And
[877.6s] Jesus come to me with me to John
[884.6s] 6:27 the text that was read to
[891.6s] us and and I'm reading from the New King
[895.0s] James Version. It says, "Do not labor
[898.9s] for the food which perishes, but for the
[901.4s] food which endures to everlasting life,
[904.6s] which the son of man will give you
[907.6s] because God the father has set his seal
[910.7s] upon
[913.3s] him." What what I get from here is that
[917.2s] Jesus is saying get your priorities
[920.9s] right. Get your priorities right. So the
[924.6s] priorities that we have is that we focus
[928.1s] on the food that does not give us
[931.6s] eternal
[932.6s] life. So Jesus is saying in this in this
[936.0s] text that we are reading get your
[938.0s] priorities right. He's not saying that
[940.6s] do not labor for food that you eat on a
[943.3s] daily basis but saying order your life
[946.2s] in the right priorities.
[949.7s] It says that God first is where your
[952.7s] focus should be because the Bible tells
[955.1s] us that if we seek God all other things
[958.4s] will be added to us. In other words,
[961.7s] consider your priorities. Consider how
[965.3s] you focus. Consider where you put your
[967.8s] effort. Consider what you need to do in
[971.6s] order of your priorities. We often get
[974.7s] the priorities wrong.
[976.7s] We focus on the temporal and forget that
[980.3s] we can easily become spiritual
[984.0s] malnourished. We might be overfed in
[987.3s] terms of their physical food. We may not
[990.0s] be among the 51% that do not have enough
[993.1s] food in Kenya, but we might be among
[996.0s] those who are spiritually malnourished.
[998.8s] And God is saying or Jesus is telling us
[1001.3s] in this text, put your priorities right.
[1005.2s] focus on eternal issues. We may not be
[1008.8s] able to think about eternal things if we
[1012.4s] do not know that we have to put God
[1014.7s] first. Is God first in our lives or are
[1017.8s] we fast in our lives? Of course, food
[1020.5s] makes us to be fast in our life because
[1022.7s] we think about what do I eat today? How
[1025.4s] do I make sure that I do not become
[1027.5s] malnourished? But we are forgetting that
[1031.3s] there is more important things and the
[1033.5s] more important things is to set your
[1035.9s] mind above. To set your mind on the
[1039.0s] things of above. Colossians 3:2 it says,
[1042.0s] "Set your mind on things above, not on
[1045.9s] earthly things." If we set our minds on
[1049.1s] Christ, we will be able to know that we
[1052.3s] will be able to get the food that we
[1054.2s] need.
[1056.3s] If we
[1057.5s] look Matthew 6:33 which says, "But seek
[1061.4s] first the kingdom of God and his
[1063.0s] righteousness and all these things will
[1064.6s] be added unto you." If we put God first,
[1068.6s] we are doing the right thing. We are in
[1071.5s] danger of becoming spiritually
[1075.2s] malnourished when we focus on the wrong
[1078.5s] things. Sometimes we focus on the wrong
[1081.5s] things because we do not ask the right
[1083.7s] questions.
[1087.4s] You know the system that we live in ask
[1090.5s] a lot of questions but they ask and give
[1093.4s] us the wrong questions and perhaps
[1096.1s] suggest the wrong things for
[1097.8s] us. If you need to be spiritually
[1100.8s] nourished well you need to be able to
[1103.4s] have the right perspective.
[1106.3s] Some of the perspectives that we get
[1108.0s] from the world is that we are not
[1111.2s] created but we will evolve from some
[1115.6s] small things into what we are. Which
[1118.3s] means that if we take that perspective
[1121.3s] we are losing the focus. We do not ask
[1123.4s] the right question. We should get the
[1125.8s] right answers from the Bible. So that
[1128.2s] means that we get our perspective and
[1131.5s] our priorities from the Bible. If you do
[1134.2s] not understand that you are created, you
[1137.0s] might be asking yourself, why do I need
[1140.0s] to focus on God? But if you know that
[1144.3s] the Bible tells us Psalms 139:14, you
[1148.5s] are wonderfully
[1151.2s] and fearfully what? Made. Then you know
[1154.2s] that you are created by God and
[1156.8s] therefore you set your mind on the
[1159.4s] things of God.
[1162.4s] If we do not
[1165.1s] identify our priorities, in order for us
[1168.1s] to do priorities, first of all, we have
[1170.3s] to identify what is our goal in life. So
[1174.8s] our goal in life is not only about
[1177.4s] living here because the food that we
[1180.1s] have will allow us to live on this world
[1182.9s] only. But if we look at the spiritual
[1185.5s] food, then we are setting our eyes on
[1188.3s] things above. Meaning that we are
[1191.1s] putting our priorities right. And
[1193.1s] therefore we are saying that we need to
[1195.8s] have eternal life and eternal life does
[1198.6s] not come from the food that we eat but
[1201.5s] from the spiritual food that comes from
[1203.7s] above. And Jesus says I am the bread of
[1207.6s] life that came from the father so that
[1211.3s] he may give us the spiritual food. So
[1214.6s] what do we need to do then?
[1217.4s] If we need to be spiritually nourished.
[1220.4s] So what do we do need to
[1222.5s] do? We know that from the physical if we
[1227.4s] are not having enough food we go and
[1230.6s] look at food with
[1232.9s] nutrients. We need if you having
[1237.2s] um quasho or
[1239.6s] whatever food deficiency you need to eat
[1243.0s] proteins. Isn't
[1244.7s] it? If you are stunted, you know,
[1248.4s] stunting is not growing to the right
[1251.2s] level because of general lack of food.
[1253.9s] You could also be or I could be also
[1257.0s] standed in Christian work and it means I
[1261.0s] am not nourished enough. So therefore we
[1264.7s] need to be well nourished
[1268.1s] spiritually and because our normal food
[1273.2s] has three main things. I want to suggest
[1275.8s] three main things that we need to do.
[1278.6s] The main normal physical food we say
[1281.4s] that we need to do carbohydrates,
[1284.6s] proteins and fats. Often we we forget
[1288.2s] the micronutrients but we normally say
[1290.5s] balanced diet is three things but
[1292.4s] generally this three plus. So let me
[1295.8s] just say three things that we need to
[1298.3s] do. They are not difficult but it is
[1302.8s] important that we are reminded. The
[1305.8s] first one is to know that we have to
[1308.9s] have a relationship with
[1311.5s] God. Without relationship with God then
[1315.4s] we lose focus. We need to have a
[1318.5s] relationship with God. And we develop
[1321.0s] the relationship with God by studying
[1323.5s] the word of God. We have to use the
[1326.2s] Bible as the basis for us to know the
[1330.1s] things of above and the things of earth.
[1332.6s] And we have to make sure that we are
[1335.8s] always and regularly reading the word of
[1339.6s] God. First
[1341.8s] Timothy
[1344.9s] 4:6, our souls must be nourished on the
[1347.8s] words of the faith and of the sound
[1350.2s] doctrine. These are the sound doctrines
[1352.8s] that we get from the Bible. We have to
[1356.1s] be able to know that the things that set
[1360.3s] us apart a apart is not the things that
[1363.9s] come from the world but things that come
[1366.4s] from the word of God. We have to study
[1369.3s] the word of God diligently.
[1372.5s] Diligently means that we need to be able
[1375.3s] to be reading on a regular basis and not
[1378.6s] only reading but to be also doers of the
[1381.3s] word. According to James
[1384.0s] 1:22, it tells us to not be only hearers
[1388.2s] but doers of the
[1390.6s] word. So first of all, let's have a
[1393.8s] relationship with God. Let's know that
[1397.0s] God is the one who created us. It's God
[1400.0s] who has redeemed us. It's God who is
[1403.8s] saved us from all our iniquities and it
[1406.9s] is God who wants to give us eternal
[1409.0s] life. We do not get eternal life from
[1411.5s] any other source. You do not get eternal
[1414.1s] life by eating all types of food. Even
[1417.4s] if you eat enough soya, you will never
[1420.3s] become you'll not have eternal life. So
[1423.4s] eternal life is based on the
[1425.4s] relationship with God. When you have the
[1427.8s] relationship with God, then you have a
[1430.5s] journey that leads to eternal life.
[1434.0s] Second, we need to spend time in
[1437.6s] worship. It's not enough to be able to
[1440.6s] read the Bible. Of course, John tells us
[1444.6s] in Revelation 1:3 that blessed is the
[1447.8s] one who reads the word of God and also
[1450.2s] does what? Hears. So it's not only
[1453.2s] enough for us to be
[1455.0s] reading and hearing but also it means
[1458.8s] that we should also be able to worship
[1461.3s] God. And worshiping God enables us to
[1465.2s] put God in his
[1468.2s] position. If we do not put God in
[1470.6s] position, it means actually we are
[1472.5s] dethroning God and putting ourselves in
[1474.6s] in the position of God.
[1477.0s] So we need to be able to come to God
[1482.0s] because Psalms 52:22 says that cast your
[1486.6s] burdens upon the Lord and he will
[1489.2s] sustain you. Whatever issues that are in
[1491.8s] our lives, whatever challenges that we
[1495.4s] have, whatever things that make us to be
[1498.4s] anxious, we should present them to the
[1500.7s] Lord and we should also come to the Lord
[1504.4s] in singing. Thank you choir for singing.
[1507.4s] Thank you children for also for singing
[1509.6s] because Psalms 96 verse1 says sing to
[1513.4s] the Lord a new song. Come to the house
[1516.4s] of the Lord with praises. That means we
[1519.2s] are acknowledging God. So we should
[1521.6s] praise God. We should sing. We should
[1524.3s] also hear the word of God and we should
[1527.0s] come to God in
[1529.1s] prayer. I know the children talk about
[1531.4s] prayer. So I'm not talking much about
[1533.5s] prayer because they already talked about
[1536.8s] it. Sometimes we think prayer is one
[1540.4s] street. It's one
[1542.3s] way. Of course, LG White says prayer is
[1546.6s] talking to God as to a
[1548.4s] friend. But often we think prayer is us
[1552.2s] going to God but not also listening from
[1555.5s] God. So prayer allows us to also listen
[1559.8s] to God. Ellen G. White in steps to
[1562.7s] Christ says in page
[1565.1s] 101 that um prayer is placing ourself at
[1571.0s] the opportune place where we can receive
[1573.7s] rays of light from heaven. So we should
[1576.2s] also receive rays of light from heaven
[1578.7s] when we do pray. And
[1582.3s] finally, when you
[1584.5s] read and study the word of God and
[1588.0s] worship, we should be able to
[1591.8s] serve. The reason why some legs and
[1596.1s] rivers end up in a lake and some legs
[1600.1s] being called uh dead sea or uh salty is
[1605.0s] because they don't have an outlet. If
[1607.4s] you do not have an outlet then you
[1610.6s] develop some symptoms. Some of these
[1613.0s] symptoms is a lot of salt in you. Uh if
[1617.3s] you go to the red sea or the dead sea
[1619.9s] there's a lot of uh saltiness in it. Uh
[1623.4s] and it become dead because nothing lives
[1625.5s] in there. So one of the things that we
[1628.5s] need to do is we are not going to be
[1632.1s] nourished and then sit idle.
[1635.5s] In fact, one of the things that you read
[1637.2s] in the book of Ezekiel, we are not going
[1639.6s] there. It says one of the biggest scenes
[1643.1s] of Sodom and Comra was they were eating
[1645.9s] and doing
[1648.0s] nothing. It was the scene of
[1650.9s] idleness. When you are satisfied and you
[1654.3s] do not do anything, you multiply evil.
[1659.4s] So it is also important in the spiritual
[1663.0s] realms that when you are spiritually
[1665.9s] nourished you serve
[1668.0s] others otherwise you become spiritual
[1671.4s] obese. We know as we started by saying
[1674.9s] there are 3.1 million
[1676.9s] people that do not have enough food.
[1680.5s] There are also equally a lot of people
[1682.4s] in the world that are obese. In other
[1684.4s] words, they have too much that they do
[1687.1s] not the bodies even do not know what to
[1689.3s] do with
[1690.3s] it. Therefore, we can also become
[1693.2s] spiritually obese. And therefore, the
[1696.0s] Bible requires us that as we have been
[1699.0s] fed, we should also feed others. And we
[1702.7s] do not have to go to the streets, you
[1705.0s] actually feed where you are. Start from
[1708.3s] where you are and feed.
[1711.5s] I pray that we should not become
[1713.4s] spiritually
[1714.7s] obese. The Bible tells us in Mark
[1718.2s] 16:15 that we should go into the
[1721.7s] wall. You should do not go to the wall
[1724.4s] if you are you are malnourished. You
[1727.2s] should be fed and then you can go to the
[1729.4s] wall and feed the
[1730.9s] wall. You give what you have. And
[1734.8s] therefore we need to ensure that when we
[1737.7s] go out we are going to
[1742.3s] share. Proverbs
[1746.8s] 11:25 Proverbs 11:25 says you do
[1750.2s] yourself a
[1753.6s] favor. You do yourself a
[1757.5s] favor by sharing.
[1763.8s] You know there's things that is known
[1765.6s] well in
[1766.9s] education perhaps it's also used in
[1769.6s] other
[1771.2s] sectors. The best way of learning is
[1774.7s] also
[1776.1s] sharing. Let me repeat that again. The
[1779.4s] best way of learning is by
[1782.0s] sharing. The best way of understanding
[1785.2s] concepts is by
[1788.4s] explaining.
[1790.0s] Expressions deepens impression.
[1793.6s] So in other words, if you want to
[1796.3s] understand something
[1798.1s] better, explain it to somebody
[1802.0s] else. In
[1804.1s] education, sometimes we actually do put
[1808.3s] learners together so that they can talk.
[1811.6s] Why? Because expression depends
[1814.1s] impression. We know that by writing you
[1817.9s] also process your thinking. But by
[1821.0s] expression, you also deepen your
[1824.3s] impression. Proverbs 11:25 tells us,
[1827.8s] "You do yourself well by serving
[1832.5s] others." In other words, we are going to
[1836.6s] be blessed by serving
[1840.7s] others. So sometimes we look for
[1843.1s] blessings and we are looking it at the
[1845.5s] wrong places.
[1847.2s] The blessing that you need might be in
[1849.8s] your neighbor. By serving your neighbor,
[1853.5s] you actually serving
[1855.9s] yourself because there is blessing in
[1859.0s] reaching out to
[1860.4s] others. So the Bible reminds us that it
[1863.9s] is we do well if we serve
[1868.6s] others. So we need to consider that we
[1872.7s] do well when we serve others.
[1877.6s] In
[1880.0s] conclusion, we do well to be spiritually
[1886.1s] nourished. We need to be spiritually
[1889.1s] nourished. We have food that we take on
[1892.5s] a regular basis. But this food that we
[1895.0s] take on a regular basis does not take us
[1898.0s] to have eternal life. Eternal life
[1901.4s] according to John
[1904.8s] 6:27 is in Christ
[1907.6s] Jesus. Eternal life is not found in
[1912.8s] medicine. We know that we can live
[1916.2s] longer by going to hospital when we are
[1918.6s] sick. But that only is postponing your
[1922.8s] death. Eating the normal food postpones
[1926.0s] your death. But death is an eventuality.
[1929.8s] Therefore, if we want to have eternal
[1931.9s] life, we should have Jesus who is the
[1934.9s] food and the bread of life. And so
[1937.6s] that's where we start. We start by
[1939.9s] saying we have a relationship with Jesus
[1942.0s] Christ. We maintain our spiritual
[1944.5s] nourishment by studying the word of God.
[1947.5s] Let's study the word of God on a daily
[1949.8s] and regular basis so that we know and
[1952.8s] set things that are right and set our
[1955.5s] priorities correctly. Second, we should
[1958.6s] be able to worship God. Worshiing God
[1961.6s] puts God in his rightful position. We
[1965.2s] need to be able to pray on a regular
[1967.8s] basis, but also need to ensure that we
[1971.7s] are worshiping God in hymns and in other
[1974.9s] forms of
[1976.0s] worship. And finally, we also need to
[1979.5s] ensure that we serve others. By serving
[1983.4s] others we are acting our faith. Faith
[1987.4s] without works is what? If we be say that
[1991.0s] we have been saved and we do not know
[1994.0s] that God also wants to save others then
[1996.3s] our faith is misplaced. So we have to do
[1999.9s] the three things knowing that
[2002.5s] God is the bread of life. And so I ask
[2007.5s] that today we may consider this bread of
[2011.1s] life. Consider the bread of life that is
[2016.3s] not the world is not what the world
[2018.7s] gives us but the bread of life that
[2021.6s] comes from Jesus himself. If we have
[2025.1s] this bread of life, we have eternal
[2028.1s] life. If we have Jesus, we have eternal
[2031.3s] life. I pray that we have Jesus who is
[2034.7s] the bread of life and therefore have
[2036.8s] eternal life in Jesus name. Amen.
