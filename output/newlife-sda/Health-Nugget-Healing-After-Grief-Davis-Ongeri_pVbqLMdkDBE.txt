FULL TRANSCRIPT:
[Music] Good morning and happy Sabbath. I'd like to welcome us all both physically and online to today's uh worship. I'd uh I'd take us through today's health nuggets and before that I'd like to offer a word of prayer. Let's pray. Our kind loving father we come before this time of morning thanking you for the providence and love thus far. Even as we do this health nugget today, help this session to impact someone. It is majesty I pray and believe. Amen. So today's topic is healing after grief. Uh I think this is very relatable to a number of us. So the American Psychological Association defines grief as the anguish experienced after significant loss uh usually the death of beloved person. So generally grief is the deep sorrow, emotional suffering one experiences after losing someone or something significant. So grief can result from death of a loved one which is the most common divorce or relationship breakup, loss of job or any other means of financial security, loss of health due to chronic illness or disability, miscarriage or infertility or other things like loss of a pet etc. For the purpose of this presentation today, I shall largely restrict myself to grief as a consequence of the death of a loved one. So types of grief uh briefly we have normal grief. This is usually the expected and healthy reaction to loss. It manifests as sadness, crying, emotional pain, preoccupation with the deceased for the case of death as a consequence of a grief, short-term sleep or appetite disturbances, uh yearning for the person among other things. This usually eases after a few weeks to months with individuals slowly resuming daily life. Uh secondly, we have anticipatory grief. This is grief that occurs before the actual loss, often due to terminal diagnosis or progressive decline in health of a loved one. It usually manifests as anxiety, sadness, helplessness, emotional distancing from the loved one and sometimes even grief, a guilt for g grieving for the loved one early. Next, we have complicated grief or also known as prolonged grief disorder. This is usually a chronic impairing form of grief that persists beyond 6 months and presents the individual from resuming normal functioning. We also have disenfranchised grief. This is grief that is usually not socially recognized or supported. In this case, the ma may feel isolated or ashamed. This is usually caused uh this usually comes as a result of miscarriages, steel births, death of an expouse, loss of a pet, grief after abortion or infertility, incarceration or addict addiction related losses. Next, we have delayed grief. This is usually a postponed emotional reaction that occurs long after the loss often before because the person was emotionally numb, busy or overwhelmed at the time of their death. For example, we also have cumulative or bereiement overload grief. This results from multiple losses with within a short time overwhelming the emotional coping mechanisms of a said person. Of note is this is usually common among caregivers, healthcare workers and trauma survivors. We also have horrible mentions such as mask grief uh which is grief that is usually not recognized as such and usually instead manifests as physical symptoms uh or maladaptive behaviors and we also have inhibited grief. This uh is the conscious or unconscious refusal to acknowledge or process grief that one has. So stages of grief um we have denial. Uh this is usually a defense mechanism that buffers the im the immediate shock of the loss. It usually helps the individual survive the first wave of pain uh by creating some form of emotional distance from the grief. We also have anger which is usually the second one. This emerges as denial feeds revealing the pain. It may direct be directed at oneself, others, doctors, God or even the deceased. of note is this stage usually allows the uh release of emotion that was suppressed during denial. It is also a sign that the person is starting to process the loss. We also the third one we have is bargainaining. Um this is a mental negotiation uh to undo or postpone the loss. This may involve guilt, self-lame, imagined alternative scenarios among others. Then we then is usually followed by depression which is a deep sense of loss and despair often characterized by sadness, withdrawal or hopelessness. It usually manifests with fatigue, sleep changes, crying spells, loss of interest, loss of motivation, social withdrawal among others. Then finally we have acceptance. This is um coming to terms with the reality of the loss and finding ways to live forward with meaning. This uh is manifested by emotional clarity, renewed hope and purpose and integration of loss into life. Of note, acceptance doesn't mean forgetting. It means adapting to a new reality. It may involve forming continuing bonds with the deceased. Eg maybe keeping me memories of the deceased alive meaningfully. An important critic to note is these stages are nonlinear. They do not follow the sequence as they appear or as I said for all people and may be cyclical and repetitive. Having said that um there are common misconceptions about grief. Um the first one being time heals all wounds. Uh people say people say sometimes that with enough time grief automatically fades and one gets over it. Uh this is not true. As such we should realize that time alone doesn't heal. Rather active processing does. Healing comes from emotional work, expressing feelings, seeking support, engaging spiritually or receiving therapy. Time without processing can lead to complicated or prolonged grief. Another common misconception is you should be over by you should be over it by now. There's in some context there's a socially acceptable time frame. Uh maybe someone could say 3 months, 6 months, a year after which the grieving should have ended. This is not true. uh and g grief as a concept has no fixed expiration date. It varies among different people and people heal at different paces depending on the relationship, personality, support system and mental health of a set person among others. Some may also end up carrying a gentle sadness for a lifetime which is not pathological. Another common misconception is crying is a sign of weakness. Um people say that it is generally agreed that uh showing emotion especially in public or uh among men uh signals that you're weak or unstable. This is not true as such uh because crying is a healthy cathartic response to emotional pain. It truly signals authenticity and helps release emotional pressure. Suppressing tears may actually increase psychological stress and even physical illness. So having known that how should we not cope with grief? We should not cope with grief by avoidance. Uh that is pretending that the loss didn't happen, substance abuse, emotional suppression or impulsive decisions. However, we could cope with grief uh using healthy strategies like like the ones I'm going to mention below. Uh one including talk therapy uh from certified and qualified health care professionals such as psychologists and grief counselors. having support groups, expressive writing, healthy lifestyle or spiritual practices. So when should you seek professional help? You should seek professional help when you realize that you have prolonged grief and sadness uh exceeding 6 months. when you start to have suicidal thoughts as a result of the grief, when you when you experience a prolonged loss of daily function or when you're diagnosed with prolonged grief disorder. And of note, we should realize that we should encourage early intervention for such since grief therapy or even grief counseling can significantly reduce suffering. So the Bible too has pertinent insights on grieving illustrated by texts such as Psalms 147:3 which says he heals the brokenhearted and binds up their wounds. We also reminded in Matthew 5:4 that blessed are those who mourn for they shall be comforted. So this teaches us that mourning opens a door for divine comfort. God's comfort is not just emotional. It is transformative, often bringing peace and purpose. And God has I mean grief has spiritual value. It it should draw us closer to God's heart and the continuity of and the community, sorry, of believers. So, in conclusion, um healing is a journey. Grief, like I said, doesn't mean forgetting. It means learning to live with love in absence. There is no right way to grief. It is only a way. And healing involves permission to feel, to cry, and to hope. Again, as I finish, I'd like us to um have this have this psalm in our hearts uh from the book of Psalms 30:5, which says, "Weeping may endure for a night, but joy comes in the morning." Thank you so much and have a lovely Sabbath ahead.

TIMESTAMPED TRANSCRIPT:
[0.1s] [Music]
[5.4s] Good morning and happy Sabbath.
[9.0s] I'd like to welcome us all both
[11.3s] physically and online to today's uh
[14.1s] worship. I'd uh I'd take us through
[17.0s] today's health nuggets and before that
[19.4s] I'd like to offer a word of prayer.
[21.9s] Let's pray. Our kind loving father we
[24.5s] come before this time of morning
[25.8s] thanking you for the providence and love
[27.5s] thus far. Even as we do this health
[29.8s] nugget today, help this session to
[31.5s] impact someone. It is majesty I pray and
[33.8s] believe. Amen.
[36.2s] So today's topic is healing after grief.
[39.8s] Uh I think this is very relatable to a
[42.4s] number of us. So the American
[45.7s] Psychological Association defines grief
[48.3s] as the anguish experienced after
[50.3s] significant loss uh usually the death of
[53.2s] beloved person. So generally grief is
[56.1s] the deep sorrow, emotional suffering one
[58.8s] experiences after losing someone or
[60.7s] something significant. So grief can
[63.5s] result from death of a loved one which
[65.4s] is the most common divorce or
[67.4s] relationship breakup, loss of job or any
[70.4s] other means of financial security, loss
[72.7s] of health due to chronic illness or
[74.7s] disability, miscarriage or infertility
[77.6s] or other things like loss of a pet etc.
[80.8s] For the purpose of this presentation
[82.3s] today, I shall largely restrict myself
[84.6s] to grief as a consequence of the death
[86.3s] of a loved one. So types of grief uh
[89.8s] briefly we have normal grief. This is
[92.6s] usually the expected and healthy
[94.6s] reaction to loss. It manifests as
[96.7s] sadness, crying, emotional pain,
[99.6s] preoccupation with the deceased for the
[101.6s] case of death as a consequence of a
[103.8s] grief, short-term sleep or appetite
[105.9s] disturbances, uh yearning for the person
[108.9s] among other things. This usually eases
[111.3s] after a few weeks to months with
[113.0s] individuals slowly resuming daily life.
[115.9s] Uh secondly, we have anticipatory grief.
[118.3s] This is grief that occurs before the
[119.8s] actual loss, often due to terminal
[121.8s] diagnosis or progressive decline in
[123.6s] health of a loved one. It usually
[126.0s] manifests as anxiety, sadness,
[128.3s] helplessness, emotional distancing from
[131.0s] the loved one and sometimes even grief,
[133.4s] a guilt for g grieving for the loved one
[136.0s] early. Next, we have complicated grief
[139.0s] or also known as prolonged grief
[140.6s] disorder. This is usually a chronic
[143.0s] impairing form of grief that persists
[145.1s] beyond 6 months and presents the
[146.7s] individual from resuming normal
[148.6s] functioning. We also have
[150.6s] disenfranchised grief. This is grief
[152.8s] that is usually not socially recognized
[154.6s] or supported. In this case, the ma may
[157.1s] feel isolated or ashamed. This is
[159.9s] usually caused uh this usually comes as
[162.3s] a result of miscarriages, steel births,
[165.3s] death of an expouse, loss of a pet,
[168.2s] grief after abortion or infertility,
[170.6s] incarceration or addict addiction
[173.1s] related losses. Next, we have delayed
[175.9s] grief. This is usually a postponed
[177.4s] emotional reaction that occurs long
[179.3s] after the loss often before because the
[181.4s] person was emotionally numb, busy or
[183.5s] overwhelmed at the time of their death.
[186.4s] For example, we also have cumulative or
[188.7s] bereiement overload grief. This results
[191.3s] from multiple losses with within a short
[193.2s] time overwhelming the emotional coping
[195.4s] mechanisms of a said person. Of note is
[198.2s] this is usually common among caregivers,
[200.0s] healthcare workers and trauma survivors.
[203.2s] We also have horrible mentions such as
[205.4s] mask grief uh which is grief that is
[207.8s] usually not recognized as such and
[209.8s] usually instead manifests as physical
[212.3s] symptoms uh or maladaptive behaviors and
[215.1s] we also have inhibited grief. This uh is
[218.4s] the conscious or unconscious refusal to
[220.8s] acknowledge or process grief that one
[222.8s] has. So stages of grief um we have
[228.2s] denial. Uh this is usually a defense
[230.9s] mechanism that buffers the im the
[232.7s] immediate shock of the loss. It usually
[235.0s] helps the individual survive the first
[236.8s] wave of pain uh by creating some form of
[239.3s] emotional distance from the grief. We
[242.4s] also have anger which is usually the
[243.8s] second one. This emerges as denial feeds
[246.8s] revealing the pain. It may direct be
[249.3s] directed at oneself, others, doctors,
[252.5s] God or even the deceased. of note is
[255.0s] this stage usually allows the uh release
[257.1s] of emotion that was suppressed during
[258.9s] denial. It is also a sign that the
[261.5s] person is starting to process the loss.
[264.2s] We also the third one we have is
[265.8s] bargainaining. Um this is a mental
[268.5s] negotiation uh to undo or postpone the
[271.1s] loss. This may involve guilt, self-lame,
[274.7s] imagined alternative scenarios among
[276.7s] others. Then we then is usually followed
[279.4s] by depression which is a deep sense of
[282.0s] loss and despair often characterized by
[284.4s] sadness, withdrawal or hopelessness. It
[287.7s] usually manifests with fatigue, sleep
[289.7s] changes, crying spells, loss of
[292.5s] interest, loss of motivation, social
[295.0s] withdrawal among others. Then finally we
[298.2s] have acceptance. This is um coming to
[301.1s] terms with the reality of the loss and
[303.0s] finding ways to live forward with
[305.1s] meaning. This uh is manifested by
[307.8s] emotional clarity, renewed hope and
[310.2s] purpose and integration of loss into
[312.6s] life. Of note, acceptance doesn't mean
[315.3s] forgetting. It means adapting to a new
[317.3s] reality. It may involve forming
[319.6s] continuing bonds with the deceased. Eg
[322.2s] maybe keeping me memories of the
[324.2s] deceased alive meaningfully.
[327.1s] An important critic to note is these
[329.2s] stages are nonlinear. They do not follow
[331.8s] the sequence as they appear or as I said
[334.1s] for all people and may be cyclical and
[336.6s] repetitive. Having said that um there
[339.7s] are common misconceptions about grief.
[342.2s] Um the first one being time heals all
[344.3s] wounds. Uh people say people say
[347.4s] sometimes that with enough time grief
[349.0s] automatically fades and one gets over
[351.1s] it. Uh this is not true. As such we
[355.1s] should realize that time alone doesn't
[356.6s] heal. Rather active processing does.
[359.7s] Healing comes from emotional work,
[362.0s] expressing feelings, seeking support,
[364.0s] engaging spiritually or receiving
[366.0s] therapy. Time without processing can
[368.2s] lead to complicated or prolonged grief.
[370.4s] Another common misconception is you
[372.5s] should be over by you should be over it
[374.9s] by now. There's in some context there's
[378.1s] a socially acceptable time frame. Uh
[380.5s] maybe someone could say 3 months, 6
[381.9s] months, a year after which the grieving
[384.9s] should have ended. This is not true. uh
[387.5s] and g grief as a concept has no fixed
[390.0s] expiration date. It varies among
[392.2s] different people and people heal at
[394.4s] different paces depending on the
[395.8s] relationship, personality, support
[398.2s] system and mental health of a set person
[400.6s] among others. Some may also end up
[403.0s] carrying a gentle sadness for a lifetime
[404.8s] which is not pathological.
[407.2s] Another common misconception is crying
[409.1s] is a sign of weakness.
[411.1s] Um people say that it is generally
[413.9s] agreed that uh showing emotion
[415.7s] especially in public or uh among men uh
[419.8s] signals that you're weak or unstable.
[422.7s] This is not true as such uh because
[425.2s] crying is a healthy cathartic response
[427.1s] to emotional pain. It truly signals
[429.2s] authenticity and helps release emotional
[431.2s] pressure. Suppressing tears may actually
[433.8s] increase psychological stress and even
[436.2s] physical illness.
[438.4s] So having known that how should we not
[441.7s] cope with grief? We should not cope with
[443.5s] grief by avoidance. Uh that is
[445.8s] pretending that the loss didn't happen,
[447.5s] substance abuse, emotional suppression
[450.3s] or impulsive decisions. However, we
[453.1s] could cope with grief uh using healthy
[455.4s] strategies like like the ones I'm going
[457.4s] to mention below. Uh one including talk
[460.1s] therapy uh from certified and qualified
[463.7s] health care professionals such as
[465.4s] psychologists and grief counselors.
[467.6s] having support groups, expressive
[469.7s] writing, healthy lifestyle or spiritual
[473.0s] practices. So when should you seek
[475.2s] professional help? You should seek
[477.3s] professional help when you realize that
[479.9s] you have prolonged grief and sadness uh
[483.1s] exceeding 6 months. when you start to
[485.3s] have suicidal thoughts as a result of
[487.2s] the grief, when you when you experience
[490.6s] a prolonged loss of daily function or
[493.0s] when you're diagnosed with prolonged
[494.4s] grief disorder.
[496.6s] And of note, we should realize that we
[498.4s] should encourage early intervention for
[500.3s] such since grief therapy or even grief
[502.7s] counseling can significantly reduce
[504.7s] suffering. So the Bible too has
[507.2s] pertinent insights on grieving
[509.0s] illustrated by texts such as Psalms
[511.9s] 147:3 which says he heals the
[514.8s] brokenhearted and binds up their wounds.
[517.2s] We also reminded in Matthew 5:4 that
[520.3s] blessed are those who mourn for they
[522.0s] shall be comforted. So this teaches us
[524.3s] that mourning opens a door for divine
[526.6s] comfort. God's comfort is not just
[528.7s] emotional. It is transformative, often
[531.4s] bringing peace and purpose. And God has
[534.2s] I mean grief has spiritual value. It it
[537.2s] should draw us closer to God's heart and
[539.1s] the continuity of and the community,
[541.4s] sorry, of believers. So, in conclusion,
[544.1s] um healing is a journey. Grief, like I
[546.9s] said, doesn't mean forgetting. It means
[548.7s] learning to live with love in absence.
[551.1s] There is no right way to grief. It is
[553.3s] only a way. And healing involves
[555.8s] permission to feel, to cry, and to hope.
[558.4s] Again, as I finish, I'd like us to
[562.8s] um have this have this psalm in our
[564.9s] hearts uh from the book of Psalms 30:5,
[567.4s] which says, "Weeping may endure for a
[569.8s] night, but joy comes in the morning."
[572.2s] Thank you so much and have a lovely
[573.6s] Sabbath ahead.
