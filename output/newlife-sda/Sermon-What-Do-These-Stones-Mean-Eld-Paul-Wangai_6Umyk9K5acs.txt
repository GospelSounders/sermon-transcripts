things that is good about our new life many people worship online how many of you you've been out of naobi but wherever you are you have logged in to worship the Sabbath how many of you can you see that more than half very good now abok kiru is able to do the same when he's traveling logging in to New Life okay now AB kirui first of all how did you learn how to run uh I think U it's a long story anyway I could say genetically running was there in the legs of our great grandfather the grandfather Yeah who used to CH hand of life and life we have an elder here called mro teach is's one of our elders here that I don't think he runs but you you're able to run okay now AB Kiri what happened to your grandfather uh I I was told he was not happy with a vegetable so much so he used to go and Chase and um and get anope in the bush and Chase and Cates it life so that was the story about my my my real grand I'm cannot Chase an antelop and catch at all you know okay well then you started running yeah then when I went to my primary school in samit the nor the sou B of nandi I I I join my primary school called Samui so I used to be running for Lun and coming back and then I I my my my brother of course was the head boy in the school and he was serious if he of you getting to the school compound he can write your name and you are late come so I think he by trying to overcome him in his steps the guy is Too Tall and I could run like three times in order to catch one stable be so and and that's why I develop running when then there was now running for a IND classes competition and I found myself being number one without knowing it amen now brother kiru is also a senior superintendent of police so he actually came on a tracksuit just for the sake of us here and he's a Bonafide Adventist member okay and brother kirui um a question for you yeah what can you tell this church and you've been here before what can what challenge can you give us uh the challenge is that I need this church to be like a fourth story building I I I see I see a vision that this church will call like three times down for backing and humble children teaching I I have been to Singapore where I finished number three way back 2007 and and I saw under the the big city of Singapore they are like three story high in the city down the the the holes and they are doing amazing things there now that is a prayer for us new life isn't it may that prayer be fulfilled in Jesus name now one other thing what do you do uh one of the things that he does whenever he has any olymp any medal where he's running the the marathon races where he's running they don't do it on a Sabbath because they know he'll not do it how do you spend a Sabbath out there far away in different places and there's no church what do you do uh the the thing is I have been coing outside when the jurge is far my friend has been my Bible all the time in my flight all the 20 years of my run I have been carrying my Bible not the the mobile phone so wherever the the church is far and I'm lucky that the Rises is Sunday I thank God because most of the competitions usually happen on on Sunday and um God has been giving me that protection to keep my Sabbath during the Satur day and then the polling days are around so I think that's been good to me I think Pano and I need to learn to be slender like you P we are stuck standing with him definitely he's very fit what about your children any of them taking up Athletics yeah my my the two children like you know I am a father of three here t love football of course the body is good for running but he say Baba I will not buy you private if I run so I need to to buy you a private through football but my my daughter like food running and my last B who is called Axel is

many to be faithful in their area of career that at the end of the day your name may be glorified I thank you because you do more than what we have asked for because we pray in Jesus name amen amen thank you thank [Music] you what do these Stones mean turn to with me to the Book of Joshua chapter 3 Joshua and chapter 3 and starting from verse one early in the morning Joshua and all the Israelites set out from shittim and went to the Jordan where they come before crossing over after 3 days the officers went throughout the camp communica to the people telling them when you see the Ark of the Lord your God and the priests who are Levites carrying it you to move out from your positions and follow it verse 12 now then choose 12 men from the tribes of Israel one from each tribe verse 13 when you see the priests who carry the Ark of the Lord Lord please take notice of the HS when you see the priest who carry the Ark of the Lord the Lord of all the Earth set foot in the Jordan its Waters flowing Downstream will be cut off and stand up in a hip verse 17 the priest who carry the Ark of the Covenant of the Lord stood firm on dry ground in the middle of the Jordan while all Israel passed until the whole nation had completed the Crossing on dry ground we come before you father this morning may we be able to hear your word on what these Stones mean and we pray there will be a a clear word from heaven for somebody today who is discouraged to give them hope to give them something to look forward to and above all to them to know you're alive we pray these things in Jesus name amen before I start this message I'll ask I want each of you if you have a phone to pick up your phone pick up your phone and I want you to think of somebody who is discouraged maybe a relative a friend a workmate somebody you've been praying for and I want you to just send them a message I'm in life today and have we have prayed for you I like to do that just now give you a minute to do that somebody who is not here it doesn't have to be a even a believer but it's somebody you've been praying about somebody you'd want for them to know the hope that you have just send them a message I'm in New Life today we're praying for you and at the end of the message today I like you to look back and see how many would have responded to you because we have something to say about it give you a minute just send something maybe a cousin an auntie a brother a sister an uncle a friend a classmate a workmate somebody you have a burden for because we must have burdens what we have our faith is not private try it is to be passed on for okay e [Music] [Music] jus [Music] oh I know the of [Music] all heaven [Music] for his blesss lift our hearts in Praise we know that we have and we shall amen and father for every single person that we have texted to in a special way today just deal with them in their circumstance and let them know somebody has prayed for them whatever issues they're going through help them to turn their face towards you this day we pray that along the week as we contact these people and we call them later on it would be the beginning of a discussion about faith and what you're able to do for us in Jesus name amen the Bible says that Joshua was told when you go to the other side now please take note God had already told his people they're going to go across but between them and the place that supposed to go the promised land was the River Jordan but you see our God is able to tell us what to do our problem is rather than looking at the promised land we see the river that is in between and I want you to know the devil and his imps are specialists in discouraging us the devil it is stated concerted mission to discourage us we see the river the Jordan River now in the dry season in summer it's a little Brook that you can cross over but in spring when this takes place as you read in the Book of Joshua it is a huge river that busts the banks the melting snow from Mount Hammon comes down and it crosses it way all the way to the Dead Sea now one scholar says at its widest during spring it is 1.6 kilm wide now that's quite a bit isn't it it's like from here all the way to GPO in Nairobi 1 Point a mile wide and so all they could see was a obstacle ahead of them sometimes you can see our sickness as an obstacle this week our dear friend of ours 31 years of age be diagnosed with staminal cancer and they're asking God what do I do somebody is money where do I get my rent for this month other people it's education how do I make it somebody has a bad boss what do I do the Jordan becomes big I've got good news for you God has said when you get there it doesn't say if you get there because that gives a chance you may not it is not perhaps you'll get there that gives you option that if it doesn't work no he says you get there with God it is only when no wonder the songwriter could say when we all get to heaven what a day of rejoicing that will be because our God says who get there now how you get it hasn't told you but another songwriter who puts it very well that our God is a way maker and our God is a miracle worker our God is a promisee keeper he's light in the darkness my God what a God we have we don't know how to get there but another song says that my Lord knows the way through the Wilderness all you have to do is what is to follow so God had told them you'll get there and the good is that we will get there evil will not last forever evil will be vanquished and the reason why that is so because God has shown us How It Ends in Genesis 3 difficult times with sin and man sinning and being thrown of the Eden but you come to revelation 22 at the end I saw a new Heaven and a new Earth for the first Heaven and the new Earth were passed away and there was no more sea the point is we know how it ends at the end God wins evil is vanquished sin is defeated and there'll be no more pain no more sickness beloved if all we have in this world is what we can see we're most miserable God says there's another place coming and he's reserved that's he to the disciples don't let your heart be troubled believe in me as I believe in God In my Father's house I what many what Mansions if you not should have told you but I go to prepare a place for you and God is saying be encouraged you know how he ends but between them Joshua says Okay I want some spies two spies there are only two people remaining at this time who have who are in Egypt Moses has gone up the mountain never came back it is Joshua and calb all the others had died only two are remaining and now he's telling them just go God I knew you've been with us you promised let me send two spies and you remember the spies go now this is an interesting this is a very wide river when you read in gen in in uh the Book of Joshua chapter 2 it says the spies went through the fs one translate says where it was narrowest now how did the spice cross I know that has bothered me how did they cross that River either they had two things either they take a boat and go across a mile and a half is quite a bit or they swam once scholar suggest were expert swimmers and were able to swim across and they went there you remember to the rahab's house and they heard what God had done we are scared OG the king of sihon and we have had what you have done God was sending those spites to come back and encourage them hear me well on our way to the kingdom God gives you what I call Faith Flags or thumb UPS to encourage you that I'm still with you have you been through life sometimes and you were discouraged and God reminded you something happened long ago to encourage you before we came to where we are when city hall went to poly Technic and I remember when we went rilis grounds we wanted to find to raise money to get here and those of you are older you remember we we didn't know what to do we didn't even have older people all more younger people said what will we do two young people who chose to remain unnamed and we've never revealed the names but those two people came and say you know when our parents died they had a life policy and from that life policy we got money to use for Education we are volunteering our money for our own education to give New Life Church so we can move to where you you're seated today and then when you are able to get the money please refund us because we need the money for our school imagine we took their money that was a seed that started where we are today and guess what God is good when we were able were able to return their money back to them for them to go to school God was sending a faith flag something that you can cling onto on the Promises of God to help you go through Jordan before you get to the other side and my question is what are some of the faith Flags God has used in your life to just encourage you on this journey to the kingdom and so he and so then they take their message back and Joshua tells them when we get to the other side wake up early in the morning pass the message around to everybody and that's what we're supposed to do passing the message around and then go to the River carry the Ark of the Covenant now guess what they did not dive in they didn't jump in the Bible says they went to the edge I can imagine with me you know with the big the toe big toe slightly you know the river is gushing and we told and then as it makes little Stones it [Music] makes can you see the river just gashing by and so they don't jump into they don't even dive in they take a big tool okay Joshua says it's okay go on go the just the the big just touches guess what God does not need big faith on you little faith in the hands of God activates the mightiest miracles to come in your life and touched barely touched now watch the miracle suddenly you know I used to think that it was a wall of fire this side of water another wall this side and people walking between they could see the fish swimming on either side that's what I used to think can see you know in some Mana you know just that's what I used to think but the Bible says it's the rivers were stopped at zaran go and read it do you know how far zaran is zaran from where the crossing where they were was 50 kilm away 30 miles away so it did not stop there somehow there's a communication between where they are with all the various water molecules to the very other side and I can imagine with my little chemistry in mind how do you make water you need two at two molecules of hydrogen and two molecules of oxygen you put them together they make one mole two molecules of water H2O two of hydrogen two of oxygen you get two of H2O and guess what you release a lot of energy did you know NASA when they are making a spacecraft go to the Moon that's what they do they have hydrogen and oxygen they put them together you release enough power we call it exothermic so much power of combustion that's what propels the Rockets into space interestingly the same thing happens in our bodies in our cells to hydrogen to oxygen to make water but somehow and scientists don't are not even know exactly how it happens but somehow when that happens in our body we don't have an explosion instead we've got water God knows how he has done it but the opposite is this way now listen to this water you have those H2O moving around easily that's how water can move it's liquid very Loosely Bound by hydrogen bonds they've got ties and those ties are we are are moving but if you take power out of that then water becomes solid same H2O by the Bon system are tight they're tough and what the molecules of oxygen that are moving up or down now are tied into a a con concentrated form where it is lathered in a ltis format straight and solid now I can imagine in my mind's imagination as soon as a priest touched they carrying the AR of the Covenant representing God's presence the molecues started talking one to the other hey hey hey did you see that what can you see that that is represents the power of God the one who created us can you see and so they all stood up in attention to salute and the saluting process meant all the way down for 50 km all the oxygen molecules are ins solute to their Commander all nature knows his commander and solute the end result stops solid dry ground and so as the people are crossing 2 million of them are crossing listen to this not as a a drop of mud on the shoes not a single drop of water on their robes and above all no not a single fear in their heart and they walk right through in ltis and the God says Ah not a single not a single drop of water needs to be seen so 15 kilom away and this way and the people walked go to the other side they could see Jericho and say now we let's run and overun the CI not yet not yet not yet not yet don't get too excited now take 12 men one from each tribe go back to where the people are standing and the priest are still standing there with the Ark of the Covenant and then he says to them get the stones remember those ston you know where the water was going through take one of those stones now some of them must have carried it this way I think one of them carried it the smaller ones like ders who is small you know could could not carry here you maybe carried here some of them are taller you know shimron carried on the shoulder and G and go on the other side and says put the stones here and when you are asked when your children and grandchildren ask you what do these Stones mean tell them these stones are reminder of the great power over God tell them that God performed a miracle he opened a way he made a way out he performed a miracle he kept his promise because our God is a way maker our God is a miracle worker our God is a promise keeper and he says you tell them and so you tell them what will you tell them number one you tell them a god did this for us number two tell them why he did it and he did it because of whose you are hear me well it is not who you are that counts but whose you are you're a child of God the child of the king of the universe who has never lost a single case and tell them who's you are and so when troubles come your way those stones are reminder God was done in the past would do it again a story is told of a boy the mother had told the boy because you've been naughty go to your room stay in your room and don't get out and keep quiet after a while the boy the mother is hearing from the door the voice saying don't keep quiet keep quiet mother says what's going on here and you know mothers have a fifth sense of some sort and so she went to check her brood to see what is going on and listening and backing the door what's going on here oh sorry Mom see what's happening you told me to come here to stay so I took my reading I was reading this this story book and the beginning of the story book the best person is introduced as I move on into the story a villain the naughty people come along and these naughty guys are bad and they are planning they are plotting how to finish the good guy and I was so sad I said no I can't read this anymore I want good guys doing and so what I did I went to the very end at the very end I noted the good guy has on the bad guys are in prison in fact the good guy is now reigning Supreme I was so happy went back to I had stopped so when I read and I find a place where the guy said let's plan and plot tomorrow evening 4 p.m. we shall doing I I Know How It Ends and he read some more the guys are now saying this time we shall stab him we shall Ambush him in this place I Know How It Ends beloved guess what the reason why those stones remind you and me that we know how it ends it doesn't end with a big bang in a wild full of flame of fire it end the big bang when a king of kings and the Lord of lords Reigns Supreme and at that time we say here is the Lord we have waited for him he has come to save us it ends with a big bang when God comes to rescue his own people and as a result of that when we go through these little Jordans in our life remind yourself I Know How It Ends and I want it ends in Victory it ends in good news 1956 Pan-American games Mexico City the first time a black man had gone to to to to to run before the press his name was Leon Jones Louie as they called him Louie before you have marathons and abble will tell you there have Heats heat one heat two during the third heat first and second heat he was nowhere by the third heit was number three so because you're number three he call you for the finals and so on that day he calls the coach coach he says yes tomorrow we're doing the finals yes and Louie you'll do well coach I want a favor from you tomorrow coach I want you to look for an oxygen mask and I want you to get an oxygen tank and go to the Finish Line at the tape the place where the tape runs and I want you to wait for me there with an oxygen mask an oxygen tank come on Louie why should I do that coach I'm serious I'm asking this of you as my coach please do that for me he didn't believe it but he said it's okay for the sake of just making him happy I'll do it and so on the following day on your marks get set and the pistol bang Louie took off like a bullet within the first 100 m Louie opened a gap of 20 M the second 100 m he kept kept the momentum he opened a gap of 20 M and the people started shouting they said this is an African rabbit an African rabbit he you give up they didn't know the African rabbit had become an African Horse He maintained that same momentum and some had never seen black people running so much making abuses and throwing rotten eggs and popcorn and insulted them but Lou kept on straight looking at the Finishing Line in this game of life the devil specializ in discour discouragements he will throw in things to discourage you news that will bring you down people will talk about you they'll say things and backbite you they they will do things that will discourage you keep your eye on the price don't be disrupted by the rotten eggs being thrown your way don't be dis distracted by people abusing you and what they say I'll do about you keep your eye on the Finishing Line and God has said you will make it he came to the final stretch and during this time nobody knows what happened Louie it's almost as if he had a booster some kind of a rocket booster in his b and suddenly rather than going this way he now increased his side by twice and the African rabbit had truly become a winning African horse when he hit the finishing tape Lou didn't stop he continued for 10 more M then he collapsed and the coach remembered oxygen mask an oxygen tank he rushed there put the mask on Louie and paramedics came ambulance came Louie was 24 hours HED in an ICU when he woke up his pipes all over the place looking up into an ICU seeing pipes and everything from everywhere and say what happened his question was when did I win he didn't say did I win are you hearing me when did I it is not if you go to heaven it is when we get there if you want to get to heaven you better start practicing now I don't do like kirui but when he comes to getting the kingdom of God I will do better than kirui and Laban I'll be in the front line because I want to see the face of my savior and what does the servant of the remant say when we get there what does he say it says that we have crowns what shall we do with that crowns those a red Spirit of Prophecy what we do with that crowns we remove all the crowns and place them at the feet of Jesus and thank him for making possible for you and me to be in God's kingdom and then Louis was told you War yes at this time and all the camera people all the crew that what onou what happened what happened here his answer I really don't know what happened but on that Finishing Line Louie put on the extra step and he passed out but he was going so fast that the momentum kept him going vertically until the end and he collapsed hear me well going to the heaven we shall there fly if you can't fly run if you can't run jog if you can't jog walk if you can't walk craw if you can't craw wiggle but get there because I God has promised we will get there by God's grace therefore those stones mean what God has promised will come true we will get safe to the other side a little child was asked by the teachers were asking the Sabbath in the Sabbath School asking tell us when you get to heaven what's the first thing you like to do one says teacher teacher teacher when I get to heaven I want to to I'll drink Fanta and cake every day and and so they she says why because my mother tells me not to take Fanta and cake every day so when I get there I take Fanta and cake every day my mommy can do nothing now says teacher teacher teacher when I get to heaven I'll go look for my father I'll spank him why you see teacher the other day you asked us to write a a uh uh an answer to a question you asked what things like moving at night and you punished me because I wrote rats move at night bats at night and I also wrote Daddy and you beat me for say because my daddy is nowhere comes at night but so when I get to heaven I'll go to where daddy is I'll spun him if he tries to spun him back I'll run to the feet of Jesus and hide there but one student came from the back and says teacher when I get to heaven first thing I want to do is run to the feet of Jesus fall down his face and thank him for making it possible for me to be in the Kingdom sometimes when the future is scary we need to engage the future sometimes in scary we need to remember the evidence of the past dealings of God that have littered the path and the trail behind us to know that same God will see us through what do the stones mean we shall get there to the heaven one way or the other screaming diving swimming running doesn't matter we shall get there until then we share Fe to other people one of

saluted and went down and picked it and give it to Napoleon the general Napoleon and salute it again and Napoleon looked at the prev and said thank you Captain thank you Captain when that was over the private left where they go and went to the officer's mess says no no no no this only for officers you are a private he says you did not hear what general apolon he said thank you Captain he decided to leave as a captain he went and looked for the captain BD and put it on he says no you're not allowed to do that he says you did not hear what Napoleon said he said thank you Captain it was a matter of days his promotions came through he became a captain this week as you go on along and people are discouraging you tell them God has said thank you Captain you'll make it you're discouraged take

[141.2s] many of you you've been out of naobi but
[145.0s] wherever you are you have logged in to
[147.3s] worship the Sabbath how many of you can
[149.7s] you see that more than half very good
[152.7s] now abok kiru is able to do the same
[155.2s] when he's traveling logging in to New
[157.2s] Life okay now AB kirui first of all how
[160.7s] did you learn how to run uh I think U
[164.6s] it's a long story anyway I could say
[167.5s] genetically running was there in the
[169.1s] legs of our great grandfather the
[171.5s] grandfather Yeah who used to CH hand of
[173.9s] life and life we have an elder here
[176.2s] called mro teach is's one of our elders
[178.4s] here that I don't think he runs but you
[180.1s] you're able to
[181.2s] run okay now AB Kiri what happened to
[183.9s] your grandfather uh I I was told he was
[186.8s] not happy with a vegetable so much so he
[189.1s] used to go and Chase and um and get
[192.1s] anope in the bush and Chase and Cates it
[194.7s] life so that was the story about my my
[197.6s] my real grand I'm cannot Chase an
[200.9s] antelop and catch at all you know okay
[203.6s] well then you started running yeah then
[206.6s] when I went to my primary school in
[208.7s] samit the nor the sou B of nandi I I I
[212.3s] join my primary school called Samui so I
[215.0s] used to be running for Lun and coming
[217.9s] back and then I I my my my brother of
[220.3s] course was the head boy in the school
[221.7s] and he was serious if he of you getting
[224.2s] to the school compound he can write your
[226.0s] name and you are late come so I think he
[229.3s] by trying to overcome him in his steps
[231.8s] the guy is Too Tall and I could run like
[234.3s] three times in order to catch one stable
[236.6s] be so and and that's why I develop
[239.3s] running when then there was now running
[241.8s] for a IND classes competition and I
[245.8s] found myself being number one without
[248.0s] knowing it amen now brother kiru is also
[251.9s] a senior superintendent of police so he
[255.1s] actually came on a tracksuit just for
[257.8s] the sake of us here and he's a Bonafide
[262.4s] Adventist
[263.9s] member okay and brother kirui um a
[268.0s] question for you yeah what can you tell
[272.3s] this church and you've been here before
[274.5s] what can what challenge can you give us
[277.3s] uh the challenge is that I need this
[279.3s] church to be like a fourth story
[281.0s] building I I I see I see a vision that
[284.1s] this church will call like three times
[286.1s] down for backing and humble children
[290.4s] teaching I I have been to Singapore
[292.8s] where I finished number three way back
[294.8s] 2007 and and I saw under the the big
[299.8s] city of Singapore they are like three
[301.9s] story high in the city down the the the
[304.8s] holes and they are doing amazing things
[307.1s] there now that is a prayer for us new
[309.0s] life isn't it may that prayer be
[311.2s] fulfilled in Jesus name now one other
[314.7s] thing what do you do uh one of the
[316.4s] things that he does whenever he has any
[318.6s] olymp any medal where he's running the
[321.5s] the marathon races where he's running
[323.9s] they don't do it on a Sabbath because
[325.4s] they know he'll not do
[326.8s] it how do you spend a Sabbath out there
[329.8s] far away in different places and there's
[332.8s] no church what do you do uh the the
[336.0s] thing is I have been coing outside when
[338.1s] the jurge is far my friend has been my
[340.4s] Bible all the time in my flight all the
[343.2s] 20 years of my run I have been carrying
[345.8s] my Bible not the the mobile phone so
[349.0s] wherever the the church is far and I'm
[350.9s] lucky that the Rises is Sunday I thank
[353.4s] God because most of the competitions
[355.6s] usually happen on on Sunday and um God
[359.0s] has been
[360.2s] giving me that protection to keep my
[362.7s] Sabbath during the Satur day and then
[364.6s] the polling days are around so I think

[1021.1s] them when you see the Ark of the Lord
[1024.4s] your God and the priests who are Levites
[1027.5s] carrying it you to move out from your
[1030.6s] positions and follow
[1032.7s] it verse
[1035.6s] 12 now then choose 12 men from the
[1039.3s] tribes of Israel one from each
[1042.7s] tribe verse
[1045.2s] 13 when you see the priests who carry
[1048.2s] the Ark of the Lord Lord please take
[1050.1s] notice of the HS when you see the priest
[1053.3s] who carry the Ark of the Lord the Lord

[1058.0s] its Waters flowing
[1060.1s] Downstream will be cut off and stand up
[1065.8s] in a
[1069.4s] hip verse
[1071.4s] 17 the priest who carry the Ark of the
[1074.0s] Covenant of the Lord stood firm on dry
[1076.5s] ground in the middle of the Jordan while
[1079.7s] all Israel passed until the whole nation
[1084.9s] had completed the Crossing on dry
[1088.8s] ground we come before you father this
[1092.7s] morning may we be able to hear your word
[1095.9s] on what these Stones
[1100.3s] mean and we pray there will be a a clear
[1103.2s] word from heaven for somebody today who
[1106.0s] is
[1107.1s] discouraged to give them hope
[1109.8s] to give them something to look forward
[1112.4s] to and above all to them to know you're
[1117.8s] alive we pray these things in Jesus name
[1121.2s] amen before I start this message I'll
[1124.0s] ask I want each of you if you have a
[1126.2s] phone to pick up your phone pick up your
[1128.7s] phone and I want you to think of
[1130.5s] somebody who is discouraged maybe a
[1132.2s] relative a friend a workmate somebody
[1134.8s] you've been praying for and I want you
[1137.2s] to just send them a message I'm in life
[1139.2s] today and have we have prayed for you I
[1141.9s] like to do that just now give you a
[1143.2s] minute to do that somebody who is not
[1146.0s] here it doesn't have to be a even a
[1148.4s] believer but it's somebody you've been
[1150.4s] praying about somebody you'd want for
[1153.2s] them to know the hope that you have just
[1156.4s] send them a message I'm in New Life
[1159.2s] today we're praying for you and at the
[1161.8s] end of the message today I like you to

[1167.9s] something to say

[1176.2s] brother a sister an uncle a friend a
[1180.9s] classmate a
[1182.7s] workmate somebody you have a burden for
[1186.6s] because we must have burdens what we
[1189.7s] have our faith is not private try it is
[1193.5s] to be passed
[1197.6s] on for
[1257.6s] okay e
[1281.7s] [Music]
[1301.1s] [Music]
[1317.4s] jus
[1322.6s] [Music]
[1343.0s] oh I know
[1346.7s] the of
[1349.2s] [Music]
[1367.5s] all heaven
[1378.2s] [Music]
[1389.9s] for his
[1394.2s] blesss lift our hearts in
[1399.9s] Praise
[1402.6s] we know that we have
[1409.0s] and we
[1414.0s] shall amen and father for every single
[1417.5s] person that we have texted to in a
[1420.1s] special way today just deal with them in
[1423.9s] their circumstance and let them know
[1426.3s] somebody has prayed for them whatever
[1428.9s] issues they're going through help them
[1431.0s] to turn their face towards
[1433.4s] you this day we pray that along the week
[1437.7s] as we contact these people and we call
[1439.5s] them later on it would be the beginning
[1442.0s] of a
[1443.0s] discussion about faith and what you're
[1445.9s] able to do for us in Jesus name
[1449.8s] amen the Bible says that Joshua was told
[1453.9s] when you go to the other side now please
[1456.8s] take note God had already told his
[1459.6s] people they're going to go across but
[1462.1s] between
[1463.4s] them and the place that supposed to go
[1466.0s] the promised land was the River Jordan
[1468.4s] but you see our God is able to tell us
[1471.6s] what to do our problem is rather than
[1475.1s] looking at the promised land we see the
[1478.1s] river that is in between and I want you
[1480.4s] to know the devil and his imps are
[1483.0s] specialists in discouraging us the devil
[1486.8s] it is stated concerted mission to
[1490.6s] discourage us we see the river the
[1493.8s] Jordan River now in the dry season in
[1498.4s] summer it's a little Brook that you can
[1501.1s] cross over but in spring when this takes
[1504.9s] place as you read in the Book of Joshua
[1507.5s] it is a huge river that busts the banks
[1510.4s] the melting snow from Mount Hammon comes
[1513.1s] down and it crosses it way all the way
[1515.2s] to the Dead Sea now one scholar says at
[1518.5s] its widest during spring it is
[1522.8s] 1.6 kilm wide now that's quite a bit
[1526.7s] isn't it it's like from here all the way
[1529.2s] to GPO in Nairobi 1 Point a mile
[1534.2s] wide and so all they could see was a
[1537.8s] obstacle ahead of them sometimes you can
[1540.3s] see our sickness as an obstacle this
[1543.3s] week our dear friend of ours 31 years of
[1545.4s] age be diagnosed with staminal cancer
[1548.1s] and they're asking God what do I do
[1550.1s] somebody is money where do I get my rent
[1552.6s] for this month other people it's
[1554.6s] education how do I make it somebody has
[1557.3s] a bad boss what do I do the Jordan
[1560.3s] becomes big I've got good news for you
[1562.8s] God has said when you get there it
[1565.8s] doesn't say if you get there because
[1567.3s] that gives a chance you may not it is
[1569.5s] not perhaps you'll get there that gives
[1571.4s] you option that if it doesn't work no he
[1574.3s] says you get there with God it is only
[1576.7s] when no wonder the songwriter could say
[1579.5s] when we all get to heaven what a day of
[1583.6s] rejoicing that will be because our God
[1586.5s] says who get there now how you get it
[1589.4s] hasn't told you but another songwriter
[1591.3s] who puts it very well that our God is a
[1593.6s] way maker and our God is a miracle
[1597.8s] worker our God is a promisee keeper he's
[1602.1s] light in the darkness my God what a God
[1606.4s] we have we don't know how to get there
[1609.0s] but another song says that my Lord knows
[1611.2s] the way through the Wilderness all you
[1613.2s] have to do is what is to follow so God
[1616.2s] had told them you'll get there and the
[1618.6s] good is that we will get there evil will
[1622.2s] not last forever evil will be vanquished
[1625.8s] and the reason why that is so because
[1628.2s] God has shown us How It Ends in Genesis
[1632.5s] 3 difficult times with sin and man
[1635.8s] sinning and being thrown of the Eden but
[1637.8s] you come to revelation 22 at the end I
[1640.8s] saw a new Heaven and a new Earth for the
[1643.0s] first Heaven and the new Earth were
[1644.5s] passed away and there was no more sea
[1646.4s] the point is we know how it ends at the
[1649.2s] end God
[1651.6s] wins evil is vanquished sin is defeated
[1656.2s] and there'll be no more pain no more
[1658.8s] sickness beloved if all we have in this
[1662.0s] world is what we can see we're most
[1664.5s] miserable God says there's another place
[1667.3s] coming and he's reserved that's he to
[1670.0s] the disciples don't let your heart be
[1672.2s] troubled believe in me as I believe in
[1674.2s] God In my Father's house I what many
[1676.0s] what Mansions if you not should have
[1678.2s] told you but I go to prepare a place for
[1681.4s] you and God is saying be encouraged you
[1685.6s] know how he
[1687.0s] ends but between them Joshua says Okay I
[1690.6s] want some spies two spies there are only
[1693.4s] two people remaining at this time who
[1695.9s] have who are in Egypt Moses has gone up
[1698.9s] the mountain never came back it is
[1700.8s] Joshua and calb all the others had died
[1704.1s] only two are remaining and now he's
[1706.4s] telling them just go God I knew you've
[1708.8s] been with us you promised let me send
[1710.6s] two spies and you remember the spies go
[1712.8s] now this is an interesting this is a
[1714.4s] very wide river when you read in gen in
[1717.2s] in uh the Book of Joshua chapter 2 it
[1720.2s] says the spies went through the fs one
[1723.6s] translate says where it was narrowest
[1726.0s] now how did the spice cross I know that
[1728.4s] has bothered me how did they cross that
[1732.0s] River either they had two things either
[1734.2s] they take a boat and go across a mile
[1736.1s] and a half is quite a bit or they swam
[1739.7s] once scholar suggest were expert
[1741.7s] swimmers and were able to swim across
[1745.1s] and they went there you remember to the
[1747.5s] rahab's house and they heard what God
[1750.2s] had done we are scared OG the king of
[1753.1s] sihon and we have had what you have done
[1755.5s] God was sending those spites to come
[1757.5s] back and encourage them hear me well on
[1760.0s] our way to the kingdom God gives you
[1762.1s] what I call Faith Flags or thumb UPS to
[1765.9s] encourage you that I'm still with you
[1768.8s] have you been through life sometimes and
[1770.9s] you were discouraged and God reminded
[1772.6s] you something happened long ago to
[1774.6s] encourage you before we came to where we
[1776.9s] are when city hall went to poly Technic
[1781.3s] and I remember when we went rilis
[1783.5s] grounds we wanted to find to raise money
[1786.3s] to get here and those of you are older
[1788.3s] you remember we we didn't know what to
[1789.8s] do we didn't even have older people all
[1792.2s] more younger people said what will we do
[1795.0s] two young people who chose to remain
[1799.0s] unnamed and we've never revealed the
[1801.1s] names but those two people came and say
[1803.4s] you know when our parents died they had
[1806.0s] a life policy and from that life policy
[1809.8s] we got money to use for
[1812.3s] Education we are volunteering our money
[1815.6s] for our own education to give New Life
[1817.9s] Church so we can move to where you
[1820.8s] you're seated
[1821.9s] today and then when you are able to get
[1824.1s] the money please refund us because we
[1826.2s] need the money for our school imagine we
[1828.9s] took their money that was a seed that
[1830.8s] started where we are today and guess
[1833.2s] what God is good when we were able were
[1836.6s] able to return their money back to them
[1838.0s] for them to go to school God was sending
[1840.2s] a faith flag something that you can
[1842.8s] cling onto on the Promises of God to
[1846.2s] help you go through Jordan before you
[1849.4s] get to the other side and my question is
[1852.3s] what are some of the faith Flags God has
[1854.6s] used in your life to just encourage you
[1857.2s] on this journey to the kingdom and so he
[1860.2s] and so then they take their message back
[1864.6s] and Joshua tells them when we get to the
[1866.4s] other side wake up early in the morning
[1867.7s] pass the message around to everybody and
[1870.0s] that's what we're supposed to do passing
[1871.4s] the message around and then go to the
[1874.5s] River carry the Ark of the Covenant now
[1877.6s] guess what they did not dive in they
[1879.5s] didn't jump in the Bible says they went
[1882.5s] to the edge I can imagine with me you
[1885.5s] know with the big the toe big toe
[1889.5s] slightly you know the river is gushing
[1892.2s] and we
[1895.4s] told and then as it makes little Stones
[1899.2s] it
[1899.8s] [Music]
[1901.0s] makes can you see the river just gashing
[1903.3s] by and so they don't jump into they
[1905.6s] don't even dive in they take a big tool
[1909.3s] okay Joshua says it's okay go on
[1913.8s] go
[1915.6s] the just the the big
[1918.5s] just
[1920.0s] touches guess what God does not need big
[1923.2s] faith on
[1924.2s] you little faith in the hands of God
[1928.1s] activates the mightiest miracles to come
[1930.9s] in your life and touched barely
[1934.4s] touched now watch the
[1937.8s] miracle
[1939.5s] suddenly you know I used to think that
[1942.3s] it was a wall of fire this side of water
[1944.8s] another wall this side and people
[1946.6s] walking between they could see the fish
[1948.5s] swimming on either side that's what I
[1950.2s] used to think can see you know in some
[1953.0s] Mana you know just that's what I used to
[1954.9s] think but the Bible says it's the rivers
[1960.0s] were stopped at zaran go and read it do
[1964.9s] you know how far zaran is zaran from
[1967.3s] where the crossing where they were was
[1970.4s] 50 kilm away 30 miles away so it did not
[1975.2s] stop there somehow
[1978.4s] there's a communication between where
[1980.3s] they are with all the various water
[1982.5s] molecules to the very other side and I
[1984.8s] can imagine with my little chemistry in
[1987.3s] mind how do you make water you need two
[1991.2s] at two molecules of hydrogen and two
[1994.6s] molecules of
[1996.1s] oxygen you put them together they make
[1999.8s] one mole two molecules of water H2O two
[2004.0s] of hydrogen two of oxygen you get two of
[2007.0s] H2O and guess what you release a lot of
[2009.7s] energy did you know NASA when they are
[2012.9s] making a spacecraft go to the Moon
[2015.9s] that's what they do they have hydrogen
[2017.7s] and oxygen they put them together you
[2020.2s] release enough power we call it
[2023.2s] exothermic so much power of combustion
[2027.6s] that's what propels the Rockets into
[2030.2s] space interestingly the same thing
[2032.9s] happens in our bodies in our cells to
[2035.7s] hydrogen to oxygen to make water but
[2038.9s] somehow and scientists don't are not
[2041.8s] even know exactly how it happens but
[2043.5s] somehow when that happens in our body we
[2045.8s] don't have an explosion instead we've
[2048.5s] got water God knows how he has done it
[2051.9s] but the opposite is this way now listen
[2053.5s] to
[2054.2s] this water you have those H2O moving
[2058.0s] around easily that's how water can move
[2059.9s] it's liquid very Loosely Bound by
[2063.3s] hydrogen bonds they've got ties and
[2066.2s] those ties are we are are
[2068.9s] moving but if you
[2071.9s] take power out of
[2075.3s] that then water becomes solid same H2O
[2079.6s] by the Bon system are tight they're
[2081.6s] tough and what the molecules of oxygen
[2084.6s] that are moving up or down now are tied
[2087.0s] into
[2088.7s] a a con concentrated form where it is
[2093.2s] lathered in a ltis format straight and
[2097.0s] solid
[2098.3s] now I can imagine in my mind's
[2100.5s] imagination as soon as a priest
[2104.4s] touched they carrying the AR of the
[2106.5s] Covenant representing God's presence the
[2108.8s] molecues started talking one to the
[2111.0s] other hey hey hey did you see that what
[2113.1s] can you see that that is represents the
[2116.5s] power of God the one who created us can
[2118.7s] you see and so they all stood up in
[2120.5s] attention to
[2122.0s] salute and the saluting process meant
[2126.0s] all the way down for 50 km all the
[2128.4s] oxygen molecules are ins solute to their
[2131.3s] Commander all nature knows his commander
[2135.3s] and solute the end result stops solid
[2140.2s] dry ground and so as the people are
[2142.8s] crossing 2 million of them are crossing
[2144.8s] listen to this
[2146.9s] not as a a drop of
[2150.2s] mud on the shoes not a single drop of
[2154.1s] water on their robes and above all no
[2157.7s] not a single fear in their
[2160.5s] heart and they walk right through in
[2163.2s] ltis and the God says Ah not a single
[2167.8s] not a
[2169.0s] single drop of water needs to be seen so
[2172.2s] 15 kilom away and this way and the
[2176.4s] people walked go to the other side they
[2178.1s] could see Jericho and say now we let's
[2180.3s] run and overun the CI not yet not yet
[2182.7s] not yet not yet don't get too excited
[2185.0s] now take 12 men one from each tribe go
[2187.9s] back to where the people are standing
[2190.0s] and the priest are still standing there
[2193.1s] with the Ark of the Covenant and then he
[2195.9s] says to them get the stones remember
[2198.7s] those
[2200.6s] ston you know where the water was going
[2203.0s] through take one of those stones now
[2204.9s] some of them must have carried it this
[2206.4s] way I think one of them carried it the
[2208.4s] smaller ones like ders who is small you
[2211.1s] know could could not carry here you
[2212.8s] maybe carried here some of them are
[2214.8s] taller you know shimron carried on the
[2216.4s] shoulder and G and go on the other side
[2218.2s] and says put the stones here and when
[2222.3s] you are asked when your children and
[2224.8s] grandchildren ask you what do these
[2228.4s] Stones mean tell them these stones are
[2232.5s] reminder of the great power over God
[2236.0s] tell them that God performed a miracle
[2240.1s] he opened a way he made a way out he
[2244.1s] performed a miracle he kept his promise
[2246.6s] because our God is a way maker our God
[2249.9s] is a miracle worker our God is a promise
[2254.0s] keeper and he says you tell them and so
[2257.6s] you tell them what will you tell them
[2259.0s] number one you tell
[2260.4s] them a god did this for us number two
[2265.0s] tell them why he did it and he did it
[2268.6s] because of whose you are hear me well it
[2273.8s] is not who you are that counts but whose
[2277.7s] you are you're a child of God the child
[2280.7s] of the king of the universe who has
[2282.5s] never lost a single case and tell them
[2285.2s] who's you are and so when troubles come
[2289.4s] your way those stones are reminder God
[2292.4s] was done in the past would do it again a
[2294.9s] story is told of a boy the mother had
[2297.4s] told the boy because you've been naughty
[2299.1s] go to your room stay in your room and
[2300.6s] don't get out and keep
[2302.5s] quiet after a while the boy the mother
[2306.1s] is hearing from the door the voice
[2310.1s] saying don't keep
[2313.1s] quiet keep
[2315.6s] quiet mother says what's going on here
[2319.3s] and you know mothers have a fifth sense
[2320.8s] of some sort and so she went to check
[2322.5s] her brood to see what is going on and
[2325.8s] listening and backing the door what's
[2328.2s] going on here oh sorry Mom see what's
[2332.2s] happening you told me to come here to
[2334.3s] stay so I took my reading I was reading
[2337.3s] this this story book and the beginning
[2339.6s] of the story
[2340.8s] book the best person is introduced as I
[2343.6s] move on into the
[2345.0s] story a villain the naughty people come
[2347.8s] along and these naughty guys are bad and
[2351.4s] they are planning they are plotting how
[2353.7s] to
[2355.5s] finish the good guy and I was so sad I
[2359.1s] said no I can't read this anymore I want
[2360.9s] good guys doing and so what I did I went
[2363.7s] to the very end at the very end I noted
[2366.5s] the good guy has on the bad guys are in
[2368.7s] prison in fact the good guy is now
[2371.2s] reigning Supreme I was so happy went
[2373.3s] back to I had stopped so when I read and
[2375.5s] I find a place where the guy said let's

[2402.9s] doesn't end with a big bang in a wild
[2406.5s] full of flame of fire it end the big
[2408.8s] bang when a king of kings and the Lord
[2410.7s] of lords Reigns Supreme and at that time
[2413.6s] we say here is the Lord we have waited
[2416.1s] for him he has come to save us it ends
[2419.1s] with a big bang when God comes to rescue
[2422.1s] his own people and as a result of that
[2424.3s] when we go through these little Jordans
[2425.8s] in our life remind yourself I Know How
[2429.7s] It Ends and I want it ends in Victory it
[2432.7s] ends in good
[2435.2s] news
[2436.7s] 1956 Pan-American games Mexico City the
[2440.9s] first time a black man had gone to to to
[2445.7s] to to run before the press his name was
[2449.8s] Leon Jones Louie as they called him
[2454.0s] Louie before you have marathons and
[2457.5s] abble will tell you there have Heats
[2459.8s] heat one heat two during the third heat
[2462.4s] first and second heat he was nowhere by
[2464.8s] the third heit was number three so
[2466.4s] because you're number three he call you
[2468.1s] for the
[2469.2s] finals and so on that day he calls the
[2472.7s] coach coach he says yes tomorrow we're
[2475.4s] doing the finals yes and Louie you'll do
[2478.8s] well coach I want a favor from you
[2482.7s] tomorrow coach I want you to look for an
[2486.1s] oxygen mask
[2489.0s] and I want you to get an oxygen
[2493.4s] tank and go to the Finish Line at the
[2496.6s] tape the place where the tape runs and I
[2499.7s] want you to wait for me there with an
[2502.6s] oxygen mask an oxygen tank come on Louie
[2506.6s] why should I do that coach I'm serious
[2509.0s] I'm asking this of you as my coach
[2511.1s] please do that for me he didn't believe
[2513.0s] it but he said it's okay for the sake of
[2515.0s] just making him happy I'll do it
[2519.0s] and so on the following day on your
[2522.6s] marks get set
[2525.3s] and the pistol
[2527.8s] bang Louie took off like a
[2531.2s] bullet within the first 100 m Louie
[2534.5s] opened a gap of 20
[2536.5s] M the second 100 m he kept kept the
[2541.0s] momentum he opened a gap of 20 M and the
[2545.1s] people started shouting they said this
[2547.7s] is an African rabbit an African rabbit
[2551.2s] he you give up they didn't know the
[2553.6s] African rabbit had become an African
[2555.5s] Horse He maintained that same momentum
[2558.5s] and some had never seen black people
[2560.0s] running so much making abuses and
[2562.7s] throwing rotten eggs and popcorn and
[2567.2s] insulted them but Lou kept on straight
[2572.0s] looking at the Finishing Line in this
[2575.5s] game of life the devil
[2577.6s] specializ in discour discouragements he
[2580.8s] will throw in things to discourage you
[2583.1s] news that will bring you down people
[2585.6s] will talk about you they'll say things
[2587.7s] and backbite you they they will do
[2589.6s] things that will discourage you keep
[2591.8s] your eye on the price don't be disrupted
[2595.9s] by the rotten eggs being thrown your way
[2597.8s] don't be dis distracted by people
[2600.5s] abusing you and what they say I'll do
[2602.7s] about you keep your eye on the Finishing
[2606.0s] Line and God has said you will make it
[2611.2s] he came to the final
[2613.0s] stretch and during this time nobody
[2615.6s] knows what happened Louie it's almost as
[2618.3s] if he had a booster some kind of a
[2620.8s] rocket booster in his b and suddenly
[2624.1s] rather than going this way he now
[2626.5s] increased his side by twice and the
[2629.4s] African rabbit had truly become a
[2632.4s] winning African horse when he hit the
[2635.4s] finishing tape Lou didn't stop he
[2638.7s] continued for 10 more M then he
[2641.4s] collapsed and the coach remembered
[2643.9s] oxygen mask an oxygen tank he rushed
[2648.0s] there put the mask on
[2650.3s] Louie and paramedics came ambulance came
[2655.6s] Louie was 24 hours HED in an ICU when he
[2659.0s] woke up his pipes all over the place
[2661.9s] looking up into an ICU seeing pipes and
[2664.7s] everything from everywhere and say what
[2666.3s] happened
[2667.7s] his question
[2669.4s] was when did I win he didn't say did I
[2673.1s] win are you hearing me when did I it is
[2675.6s] not if you go to heaven it is when we
[2678.9s] get there if you want to get to heaven
[2680.9s] you better start practicing now I don't
[2683.3s] do like kirui but when he comes to
[2685.4s] getting the kingdom of God I will do
[2686.9s] better than kirui and Laban I'll be in
[2688.5s] the front line because I want to see the
[2691.4s] face of my savior and what does the
[2693.5s] servant of the remant say when we get
[2695.0s] there what does he say it says that we
[2697.2s] have crowns what shall we do with that
[2698.7s] crowns those a red Spirit of Prophecy
[2700.5s] what we do with that crowns we remove
[2702.0s] all the crowns and place them at the
[2704.0s] feet of Jesus and thank him for making
[2706.7s] possible for you and me to be in God's
[2710.7s] kingdom and then Louis was told you War
[2713.5s] yes at this time and all the camera
[2716.6s] people all the crew that what onou what
[2720.0s] happened what happened here his answer I
[2723.2s] really don't know what happened but on
[2725.5s] that Finishing Line
[2727.5s] Louie put on the extra step and he
[2731.1s] passed
[2732.2s] out but he was going so fast that the
[2735.4s] momentum kept him going vertically until
[2739.4s] the end and he collapsed hear me well
[2743.2s] going to the heaven we shall there fly
[2746.2s] if you can't fly run if you can't run
[2748.8s] jog if you can't jog walk if you can't
[2751.5s] walk craw if you can't craw wiggle but
[2755.0s] get there because I God has promised we
[2758.6s] will get there by God's
[2760.8s] grace
[2763.0s] therefore those stones mean what God has
[2767.0s] promised will come true we will get safe
[2772.5s] to the other
[2774.2s] side a little child was asked by the
[2778.1s] teachers were asking the Sabbath in the
[2780.5s] Sabbath School asking tell us when you
[2784.4s] get to heaven what's the first thing you
[2785.8s] like to do one says teacher teacher
[2788.0s] teacher when I get to heaven I want to
[2790.3s] to I'll drink Fanta and cake every day
[2793.6s] and and so they she says why because my
[2796.3s] mother tells me not to take Fanta and
[2797.6s] cake every day so when I get there I
[2799.0s] take Fanta and cake every day my mommy
[2801.4s] can do nothing now says teacher teacher
[2804.4s] teacher when I get to heaven I'll go
[2806.6s] look for my father I'll spank
[2808.5s] him
[2810.0s] why you see
[2812.2s] teacher the other day you asked us to
[2815.4s] write a a uh uh an answer to a question
[2818.9s] you asked what things like moving at
[2824.1s] night and you punished me because I
[2827.5s] wrote rats move at night bats at night
[2831.8s] and I also wrote
[2833.2s] Daddy and you beat me for say because my
[2836.1s] daddy is nowhere comes at night but so
[2839.2s] when I get to heaven I'll go to where
[2841.4s] daddy is I'll spun him if he tries to
[2843.2s] spun him back I'll run to the feet of
[2844.8s] Jesus and hide there but one student
[2848.2s] came from the back and says teacher when
[2850.5s] I get to
[2852.3s] heaven first thing I want to do is run
[2856.0s] to the feet of Jesus fall down his face
[2859.8s] and thank him for making it possible for
[2862.7s] me to be in the
[2865.4s] Kingdom
[2867.5s] sometimes when the future is
[2870.1s] scary we need to engage the future
[2873.2s] sometimes in
[2874.6s] scary we need to remember
[2877.8s] the
[2879.0s] evidence of the past dealings of God
[2883.6s] that have littered the path and the
[2886.1s] trail behind us to know that same God
[2891.4s] will see us through what do the stones
[2893.8s] mean we shall get there to the heaven
[2896.2s] one way or the other
[2898.0s] screaming diving swimming running
[2901.8s] doesn't
[2903.1s] matter we shall get there until then we
[2907.3s] share Fe to other people one of our one
[2910.8s] of our biggest dreams like brother Moses
