FULL TRANSCRIPT:
I will cling to the Lord and change it someday for [Music] Praise God Church. It's beautiful to see you all here. My name is Kimto Onimu Favor. I'll be taking us through our health nugget where we'll be tackling the topic of blood transfusions. Before that, let us pray. Gracious God, we glorify your name. We thank you for your mercies that are new every morning. Give us wisdom and understanding, dear Lord. In Jesus name, we have prayed and believed. Amen. So, blood transfusion. What is a blood transfusion? I would have asked us how many have ever received blood transfusion but I won't ask that it's basically a procedure a medical procedure where you receive blood or blood products before that it would be important for us to understand what is blood I'm sure the layman understanding is that blood is the red liquid that flows through our body but blood does have different components those of us who've ever been tested something called a full hemogram or a complete blood count you'd understand what I'm going to talk about. So in the blood you have your red cells which help you to transport oxygen. You have your white cells which help you to fight infection. You have something called platelets that assist you when your blood needs to clot well. And we also have the plasma which has everything else the other micronutrients and proteins. So sometimes when you need a transfusion we don't always give you whole blood. We may choose to give you only the red cells, the packed red cells or platelets depending on the indication. So what are some of the reasons why we would need to transfuse you if you came to us in the hospital? The most obvious one would be if you had a major injury, surgery or during child birth when you are giving birth you bled a lot then we would need to replace the blood you have lost. Another indication, some people have wounds in their body either like if you have cervical cancer, a tumor in your colon or if you have a bleeding ulcer. So those small small losses can lead to your blood levels being low. So we would need to transfuse. We commonly use a marker called HB or hemoglobin level. I'm sure most of us have had that of that term. So for men, we recommend a HB level above 13. for women above 12. So if they go to hospital and your level is above 10, I'm sure they'll tell you to be careful. And we transfuse when these values tend to be lower than eight or seven. So another reason why we would transfuse is if you have blood disorders like leukemias uh cle cell crisis hemophilas where you have a bleeding disorders or if you're undergoing chemotherapy radiotherapy or many other problems. So before we transfuse you blood or blood products the first thing we have to do is to figure out what is your blood group. By a show of hands, how many of us know our blood groups in church? Wow, that is commendable. It's very important for us to be aware of what our blood group is cuz it has an implication during an emergency situation. So blood groups we have there are markers on your red cell which help to identify you according to your blood group. So you can be A, B, O or AB. So we usually say that blood group O positive sorry O patients they are universal donors they can donate to any of the other blood groups if you're blood group A B we say you can receive from anyone so apart from that we also classify whether you're recess positive or resus negative that's why you hear someone say I am O positive or I am O negative so that also affects how we give you blood so when you talk about blood transfusion and blood products. Is it free of risks? The answer is no. There's always a risk whenever you receive blood or blood products. Key being infections. Um things like HIV, hepatitis B, syphilis can be transmitted through blood. But nowadays we have very strict uh policies and testing procedures and also limitations. So you I can guarantee you that the blood you're going to receive or blood product will have been screened and it will be safe for you. Another risk is that during the transfusion process you can receive you can get sorry um an allergic reaction. So you can have fever, chest pain, itchiness. Some of these reactions can occur there and then during the procedure or later on. That's why when you're receiving this uh transfusion, there's always a nurse with you who every 15 minutes they're checking on your temperature and on your blood pressure. And as doctors, we have medications to give you should a complication arise. Um apart from that, uh this is a caution to the people who for some reason you tend to require a lot of transfusion like the people who have cle cell, we have to ensure you don't have ion overload. So, we have to be testing your ion levels regularly. Um, you would ask me, are there alternatives? Do I need to always be transfused? I'll say it depends. If your blood level is too low or if you've lost so much blood, transfusion is the way to go. But if your HB is around 8 9 or your white cell counts are slightly low, we can give you supplements, things to assist your body to generate the cells that you need. Um, as I head toward my conclusion, I'm sure we are aware that we do have Christian sects that believe or that prohibit blood transfusion. As Adventist, we don't really we don't ascribe to this uh doctrine. They tend to quote verses in the Bible that prohibit the ingesting of blood. But as Adventists, we don't align with that. This is evidenced by our Adventist hospitals. They do support blood transfusions and even during our global youth day blood donation drives are things that we do. So my conclusion would be to encourage us especially the healthy people amongst us in the population do participate in blood donation drives when they arise cuz this is very important. It helps us to take care of the sick in hospital and also to the rest of us. Let's maintain healthy diets according to the principles that our church advocates for cuz if you're able to eat healthier, you won't have those micronutrient deficiencies and you'll have less need for supplementation. Thank you so much and I hope it has been a blessing.

TIMESTAMPED TRANSCRIPT:
[0.2s] I will
[1.3s] cling to the
[8.4s] Lord and change it
[12.4s] someday for
[14.8s] [Music]
[25.9s] Praise God Church.
[28.0s] It's beautiful to see you all here. My
[30.2s] name is Kimto Onimu Favor. I'll be
[33.0s] taking us through our health nugget
[35.4s] where we'll be tackling the topic of
[37.1s] blood transfusions. Before that, let us
[40.5s] pray. Gracious God, we glorify your
[43.6s] name. We thank you for your mercies that
[45.4s] are new every morning. Give us wisdom
[47.5s] and understanding, dear Lord. In Jesus
[49.8s] name, we have prayed and believed. Amen.
[53.1s] So, blood transfusion. What is a blood
[55.8s] transfusion? I would have asked us how
[57.8s] many have ever received blood
[59.3s] transfusion but I won't ask that it's
[62.1s] basically a procedure a medical
[63.6s] procedure where you receive blood or
[65.9s] blood products before that it would be
[68.6s] important for us to understand what is
[70.6s] blood I'm sure the layman understanding
[73.6s] is that blood is the red liquid that
[75.8s] flows through our body but blood does
[78.4s] have different components those of us
[80.6s] who've ever been tested something called
[82.7s] a full hemogram or a complete blood
[85.4s] count you'd understand what I'm going to
[87.4s] talk about. So in the blood you have
[89.4s] your red cells which help you to
[91.5s] transport oxygen. You have your white
[94.3s] cells which help you to fight infection.
[97.0s] You have something called platelets that
[99.5s] assist you when your blood needs to clot
[102.6s] well. And we also have the plasma which
[105.3s] has everything else the other
[107.0s] micronutrients and proteins. So
[110.9s] sometimes when you need a transfusion we
[113.1s] don't always give you whole blood. We
[115.4s] may choose to give you only the red
[117.4s] cells, the packed red cells or platelets
[119.8s] depending on the indication. So what are
[123.3s] some of the reasons why we would need to
[125.2s] transfuse you if you came to us in the
[128.2s] hospital? The most obvious one would be
[131.0s] if you had a major injury, surgery or
[134.8s] during child birth when you are giving
[136.6s] birth you bled a lot then we would need
[139.4s] to replace the blood you have lost.
[141.6s] Another indication, some people have
[143.8s] wounds in their body either like if you
[146.1s] have cervical cancer, a tumor in your
[149.2s] colon or if you have a bleeding ulcer.
[151.9s] So those small small losses can lead to
[155.0s] your blood levels being low. So we would
[157.2s] need to transfuse. We commonly use a
[159.5s] marker called HB or hemoglobin level.
[163.0s] I'm sure most of us have had that of
[165.1s] that term. So for men, we recommend a HB
[168.4s] level above 13. for women above 12. So
[172.1s] if they go to hospital and your level is
[174.2s] above 10, I'm sure they'll tell you to
[176.6s] be careful. And we transfuse when these
[179.0s] values tend to be lower than eight or
[181.0s] seven. So another reason why we would
[183.0s] transfuse is
[184.7s] if you have blood disorders like
[188.5s] leukemias
[190.2s] uh cle cell crisis hemophilas where you
[193.0s] have a bleeding disorders or if you're
[195.4s] undergoing chemotherapy radiotherapy or
[198.1s] many other
[200.3s] problems. So before we transfuse you
[203.4s] blood or blood products the first thing
[205.4s] we have to do is to figure out what is
[207.4s] your blood group. By a show of hands,
[209.8s] how many of us know our blood groups in
[213.1s] church? Wow, that is commendable. It's
[216.3s] very important for us to be aware of
[218.2s] what our blood group is cuz it has an
[220.6s] implication during an emergency
[223.3s] situation. So blood groups we have there
[226.1s] are markers on your red cell which help
[228.1s] to identify you according to your blood
[230.1s] group. So you can be A, B, O or AB. So
[235.2s] we usually say that blood group O
[237.4s] positive sorry O patients they are
[239.6s] universal donors they can donate to any
[242.2s] of the other blood groups if you're
[244.2s] blood group A B we say you can receive
[247.6s] from anyone so apart from that we also
[250.3s] classify whether you're recess positive
[252.8s] or resus negative that's why you hear
[255.2s] someone say I am O positive or I am O
[257.6s] negative so that also affects how we
[261.0s] give you blood so when you talk about
[263.5s] blood transfusion and blood products. Is
[266.3s] it free of risks? The answer is no.
[269.9s] There's always a risk whenever you
[271.6s] receive blood or blood products. Key
[273.7s] being infections. Um things like HIV,
[277.9s] hepatitis B, syphilis can be transmitted
[281.2s] through blood. But nowadays we have very
[283.7s] strict uh policies and testing
[287.4s] procedures and also limitations. So you
[290.3s] I can guarantee you that the blood
[292.1s] you're going to receive or blood product
[293.8s] will have been screened and it will be
[295.8s] safe for you. Another risk is that
[298.2s] during the transfusion process you can
[300.4s] receive you can get sorry um an allergic
[302.9s] reaction. So you can have fever, chest
[305.5s] pain, itchiness. Some of these reactions
[308.2s] can occur there and then during the
[310.0s] procedure or later on. That's why when
[312.4s] you're receiving this uh transfusion,
[314.8s] there's always a nurse with you who
[316.6s] every 15 minutes they're checking on
[318.2s] your temperature and on your blood
[319.7s] pressure. And as doctors, we have
[321.8s] medications to give you should a
[323.7s] complication arise.
[326.3s] Um apart from that, uh this is a caution
[329.8s] to the people who for some reason you
[331.7s] tend to require a lot of transfusion
[333.8s] like the people who have cle cell, we
[336.1s] have to ensure you don't have ion
[338.0s] overload. So, we have to be testing your
[340.0s] ion levels regularly. Um, you would ask
[343.0s] me, are there alternatives? Do I need to
[345.6s] always be transfused? I'll say it
[348.0s] depends. If your blood level is too low
[350.3s] or if you've lost so much blood,
[352.2s] transfusion is the way to go. But if
[354.2s] your HB is around 8 9 or your white cell
[357.6s] counts are slightly low, we can give you
[359.5s] supplements, things to assist your body
[362.6s] to generate the cells that you need. Um,
[365.9s] as I head toward my conclusion, I'm sure
[368.2s] we are aware that we do have Christian
[370.5s] sects that believe or that prohibit
[374.4s] blood transfusion. As Adventist, we
[377.2s] don't really we don't ascribe to this uh
[380.3s] doctrine. They tend to quote verses in
[382.8s] the Bible that prohibit the ingesting of
[386.6s] blood. But as Adventists, we don't align
[389.2s] with that. This is evidenced by our
[391.7s] Adventist hospitals. They do support
[393.4s] blood transfusions and even during our
[395.8s] global youth day blood donation drives
[398.2s] are things that we do. So my conclusion
[401.5s] would be to encourage us especially the
[404.0s] healthy people amongst us in the
[405.9s] population do participate in blood
[408.2s] donation drives when they arise cuz this
[411.2s] is very important. It helps us to take
[413.4s] care of the sick in hospital and also to
[416.6s] the rest of us. Let's maintain healthy
[418.6s] diets according to the principles that
[420.6s] our church advocates for cuz if you're
[423.5s] able to eat healthier, you won't have
[425.4s] those micronutrient deficiencies and
[428.0s] you'll have less need for
[430.5s] supplementation. Thank you so much and I
[432.6s] hope it has been a blessing.
