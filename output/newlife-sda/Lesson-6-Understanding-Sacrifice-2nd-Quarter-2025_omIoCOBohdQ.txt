FULL TRANSCRIPT:
Praise God and happy Sabbath. Thank you so much for joining us today at New Life 7th Day Adventist Church for the Sabbath School lesson study. This quarter we are studying illusions, images and symbols and how we can use them to study and understand Bible prophecy and especially as it relates to God's people in these last days. I'm excited today to particularly study lesson number six, understanding the sacrifice. We are joined by my brother and my husband. I would like them to introduce themselves even as we begin. My name is Enongo Rafael. It's a pleasure to be here. Amen. Thank you. My name is Jafet Rono. I'm happy to be here. Thank you. And my name is Jess Rono. Brother Rafael, kindly pray with us even as we begin this lesson. Let's believe and pray. Our father in heaven, we humbly come before you through Christ our Lord and our savior, asking dear Lord for the wonderful gift of your holy spirit who inspired men of old to write the scriptures. Now, as we study these scriptures, may you may he enlighten our minds and guide our conversation that we might truly understand your sacrifice and the sacrifice that you call us to do. I pray in Jesus name. Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. Understanding the sacrifice. You know the book of Daniel and the book of Revelation being prophetic books, they are filled with references to the sanctuary service. In the book of um Daniel, one of the key prophecies we know of in Daniel chapter 8 verse uh 13 is until 2,300 days then shall the sanctuary be cleansed. And then in the book of revelation over and over again we are being introduced to articles of the sanctuary. Whether it is the golden candlestick in the book of revelation chapter uh chapter 1 and two when Christ is walking amidst the golden candlestick or whether it is speaking about the throne room of heaven and we are seeing alarm or when it is speaking about the altar of incense and over and over again we are seeing not just references to the sanctuary service but we are seeing references particularly to the lamb and the lamb is being introduced to us in these books as the center of those prophetic visions that we are seeing. And that's why I'm excited to be jumping into this. And as you can see, it is impossible for you to fully understand these prophetic books without understanding the sanctuary service. And that's one of the unique truths about the 7th Day Adventist Church. And actually, if you go back to our history, our our pioneers really never understood prophecy very well until they understood the sanctuary service. Amen. And as we go into this week's study, kindly read for us um um Jaffet the key text for this uh week. Thank you. The key text is in Revelation 5:9. And they sung a new song, saying, "You are worthy to take the scroll to open its seals. For you were slain and have redeemed us to God by your blood out of every tribe and tongue and people and nation." Amen. Amen. You know this I love this scene in the book of um um Revelation 5:E9. Revelation chapter 5 actually basically um and we talked about this. I think it was in week two when we talked about this lamb that everyone asked about. He was like where is the lamb? When Isaac asked about this, where is that lamb that we need to sacrifice? And in the book of um John um John John I mean John the Baptist points out it for us that lamb in John chapter 1 verse 29. But in John chapter five revelation chapter 5 we see John the revelator again very sad and very depressed wondering where is this lamb? And he finally he's pointed out to this lamb. He sees this lamb in the midst of that throne room um as that lamb that was slain from the foundation of the of the world. And we are told that that lamb is worthy. Why? Because that lamb has died to redeem the children of God. I want us to just dive back to the sacrificial system to understand these sacrifices that the children of Israel used to bring uh time and time again. What was the point of these sacrifices and and what was the disposition that they were supposed to possess? Thank you. uh uh in fact uh even as I'm continuing with this uh discussion the Sunday part futile sacrifices I think we must note that this is by far the most important topic that we will possibly have discussed amen discussion of the cross and of the sacrifice it is truly first of all it is almost the heart is not quite the heart it's almost somewhere at the center of this lesson but it is at the heart of the sanctuary it is it is at the heart of prophecy and it is at the heart of of the plan that Christ God had in store for his people from the very very beginning. But now the question is um fetal sacrifices. It is strange that there were actually times when sacrifices were rejected. You would think that the sacrifice is like um is like soap, you know, it's like how can you reject soap? Soap is there for washing. How can you reject how can somebody um say that this soap is ineffective? What does that even mean? Or that God maybe was excited and super happy to see the sacrifice. Yeah. Or something. Yeah. you know like there those two strange contrasts and we can see their instances in fact one very unique instance um one of the most interesting it's very uh uh in an easy because it's the very first chapter of Isaiah it's one of the most important chapters of Isaiah because it sets the tone of the whole of that prophecy that God gives through his prophet Isaiah and through the prophet Isaiah God gives a true vision of the true state of the of the children of Israel we are told uh verse three and verse four The ox knoweth his owner. I'm reading from King James. And the and the donkey his master's crib, but Israel does not know. My people do not consider. And then in verse four onwards, he he he he describes in incredible detail the precise state of Israel. We are told in verse six, from the sole of the foot even to the head, there is no soundness in it, but wounds and bruises and putrifying souls. And then it says that even as a nation that they are desolate. We are told in verse 10 that they have become like Sodom and Gomorrah. And what exactly is the issue? We are told that even the sacrifices that you think would be there to solve those problems. You know uh the reason why the sacrifices are there you'd think is to is to bring cleansing and atonement removal of sin. We are told verse 11 what is the purpose of the multitude of your sacrifices to me? He God says, "I am full. I am done. I am full of the offerings of rams and the fat of fed beasts." Verse 12, it says, "When you come to appear before me, who has required it as a a a at your hand to tread my courts?" Very strange question because God actually required of them. God gave those very specific instructions in the books in in the first five books. Very specific. He said, "You must appear three times uh before me. First of all, all males. Secondly, whenever you sin, you bring the sin offering and then morning and evening there's the burnt offering. But then the question is how like is God reneging on his word? What's going on? The issue is that these people were doing it with a in an in an unworthy way almost to check a box. It's like they're engaging in sin and they're doing evil things and then they're bringing the sacrifice but not a a a because of contrition to bring an end to that state they're in but just almost to check a box to just continue. It's almost like a mirror or or um of what you find in the book of Matthew 23 when Jesus Christ is describing the Pharisees that the Pharisees were many things that they were doing and and and it was just to check a box but they had disregarded the weightier matters of the law. The weightier matters of the law and they were just doing small things that God insists okay in Deuteronomy chapter 6 we are told that you're supposed to put bind this law between your foreheads. Okay, then it means you literally take a scroll and then you write the law inside it. Then you put it in a box in your forehead called the felactory. We are told elsewhere you you must expand the borders of um you put a ribbon of blue on on your garment. Oh, I guess you put a like on the edge of the garment you put a ribbon of blue and then that's exactly what they did. But Christ said that that was just hypocrisy. And that's exactly what we find in Isaiah chapter one. On the other hand, we do find sacrifices that God has accepted. very quickly Isaiah chapter 56 reading verse 6 and verse 7 we find um uh even them uh the son of the stranger that joins themselves the Lord to serve him and to love the name of the Lord to be his servant everyone that does what that keepeth the Sabbath from polluting it and taketh hold of my covenant even them will I bring to my holy mountain make them joyful in my house of prayer their burnt offerings and their sacrifice shall be what shall be accepted upon on my altar. So we find that uh uh contrast that the unworthy sacrifices being done by as a means to check a box, God rejects. But those that come from a heart of contrition, Psalm 51:17, that come from a true heart of contrition, that is when in the same verse 17 of the of of of that Psalm 51, that's when even David says, "Then you shall accept our burnt offerings and our sacrifices." Verse 17, if we come with a heart of cont. Heart of cont. My brother Rafael, um are you able to give us the um an example of this especially maybe as depicted um with Cain and Abel? What was the difference between the conditions of their hearts? Indeed. um one comes to God with the um it's an interesting um um an interesting story that one when we're told we see for example the story is found in the book of Genesis chapter 4 and verse uh three Bible records and says and in the process of time it came to pass that Cain brought of the fruit of the ground an offering unto the Lord and Abel he also brought of the firstlings of his flock and the fat thereof. And the Lord had respect unto Abel and to his offering. We see um at the beginning there we are told uh their professions. In verse two, Abel was a keeper of sheep and Cain was a tiller of the ground. Cain was a both of both were in agriculture. One kept animals, the other one uh was uh was a vegetarian in practice in in vocation. And so, uh, we see he decides they're going to offer an offering to God. But then before we continue, I'd like us to consider Hebrews 9 and verse 22. Hebrews 9 and vers2 says, "And almost all things are by the law purged with what?" Blood. Blood. And without the shedding of blood, there is no remission of sin. And so, sin had entered into the world. Adam and Eve have been chest away from the garden of Eden. And now the sacrificial system has been instituted all uh in in almost a remembrance of Genesis 3:15 of the promise of Christ, that seed that would come and redeem humanity. And so with this in mind, we see now Cain coming and offering vegetables. You know in John 1 and verse 29 as well as verse 36 when John the Baptist sees Christ coming he says behold the lamb of God not the vegetable of God you know the broccoli of God no no no the lamb of God Christ is depicted as a lamb who sheds his blood and so for this reason Cain's sacrifice is rejected but Cain persists Cain persists to such an extent that eventually God himself comes to him you know the Bible says uh Cain was very wrought and his countenance hands fell. He was very he felt like why is God not accepting my sacrifice and accepting the sacrifice of my brother? He felt wronged, you know. And it says the following in verse six, and the Lord said unto Cain, why thou wroth and why is thy countenance fallen? If thou doest well, shall thou shalt not be accepted? If you had done well, if you had followed the system that God has put in that the sacrifice should point to Christ, not to our own works, not our own self-sufficiency. Are there things today um um Jaffith that we still do like the children of Israel to tick the box as you said? Yeah. Because sometimes even like we can come to church on Sabbath to tick a box, you know. Sometimes we can even pray. Sometimes God forbid you can even read the Bible to take a box and you don't even gain anything from it except to to uh just say you know I have studied for the day you know uh and obviously that is not acceptable because you're not going there to seek after meat in due season. You're there doing something that is a religious thing that needs to be done. You know sometimes you can even accept offices and then engage in office activities even chat office activities just to tick a box and it is it is manifest that the Holy Spirit is absent in one's demeanor when it is clear that somebody is doing things not from the heart not because they're doing a calling that God has called not because they are obedient to the will of God but because there is some external thing that they're trying to manifest that the world can see very I must also add um it may have been going back to the story of Cain that he brought his best vegetables. You know, he may have brought his best, but sometimes when it comes to our life and our relationship with God, it's not about us, but it's more about him. That worship is focused on him. You know, we may be honest and sincere, but we may be honestly lost and sincerely lost. Ours is simply not to rely in and of ourselves, not to to to desist from that ticking of boxes. Because it's possible that we live very bad lives, but then we come here in church and we give donations. We give of our best. You know, we're singing our best. But it calls for us to sort of um examine our lives, each and every single one of us to examine our lives in the light of scripture. not in the light of what we feel is right, in the light of what how we feel we are giving our best, but to examine ourselves in the light of scripture and see whether indeed we are walking in obedience. Amen. Amen. Um the Bible says in the book of Psalms 51 verse 6, "Behold, thou desireest truth not outwardly but in the inward parts and in the hidden part that thou shalt make me to know wisdom that God wants you to have the truth in the inward parts." It is very sad in Isaiah that he says these people, you even multiply your prayers. You know, you come for prayer nights, you pray over and over again. You pray screaming, you pray shouting. I'm not saying there's anything wrong with prayer nights or praying with loud voices. But I'm just saying if we are doing this relying on ourselves and our own self-sufficiency and the rounds of ceremonies that we have to do that, oh friends, we are not relying on the lamb of God. If we are relying on the processes and the systems we put in place rather than the p uh the lamb of god alone to save us then god says I will not hear you. You will multiply them. These are not the things that I desire for obedience with god is better than sacrifice. And I want to ask you my brother, if God, if all these sacrifices um pointed to Christ and God says, "I do not delight in the blood of bulocks," as we read in Isaiah, then what was the point of us offering this uh uh blood of bulls and goats? Why the blood of bulls and goats? Indeed, Hebrews chapter 10 verse3 um the Bible records and says, "But in those sacrifices there is a remembrance again made of sins every year." Continuing in verse four, Paul writes and says, "For it is not possible that the blood of bulls and of gods should take away sins." But these were simply types. They were simply types. They were sort of to give the worshipper to impress upon him the the the the message of a messiah who would now truly come the antitype who will eventually now do away with sin once and for all. Indeed, it says in verse 5, wherefore when he cometh into the world, he said, sacrifice and offering, thou willest not, but a body hast thou prepared for me. in burnt offerings and in sacrifices for sin thou has no pleasure. And then he's speaking now about Christ and he says then said I lo I come in the volume of the book it is written of me in scripture even indeed in Genesis to do thy will oh God above when he said sacrifice and offering and burnt offerings and offerings for sin thou wouldest not neither hath pleasure therein which are offered by the law then said he lo I am come to do thy will oh God he taketh away the first that he may establish the second you see it's speaking talking to us about the importance of these sacrifices. They were important in that they were holding place to sort of put in memory to etch in the memories and in the daily activities in the daily worship services that indeed a savior is going to come. These are a type. But then eventually we see Christ comes into the picture and he dies there on the cross. And the Bible records in Mark 15:38, "Then the veil of the temple was torn in two from what?" From top to bottom, signifying that indeed as as Paul says, he is he did what? He takes away the first that he may establish the second. The blood of bulls, the blood of uh of goats can never really truly take away those sins. They were just simply sort of installments by faith that when Christ comes, he will truly away do what? Wipe away by his own blood. By his own blood, amen uh the sins of the world. And so these were simply types. I maybe um brother Duffet just talk to us about why if it had to take Christ God himself to die a man to die for us to be redeemed from from this sinful world. What does this tell us about sin? It tells us the exceeding sinfulness of sin that if it costs me uh so much to uh to buy a car or something, it it it it at least describes the value or at least the rarity of the material, you know, the the um the extreme nature um you know, the the high level of design needed to develop that material and that vehicle. It's it's how much more in in in the fact that God himself had to die that we might be saved. It it tells us that sin was so like otherwise God would just have said fine and just wiped you know and said don't do that next time you know which is sometimes a joke that is carried on around there um even in social media but the very fact that Christ had to die indicates how exceeding sinful sin sin was um how how great of um like how deep of a pit that we had uh been thrown into as humanity uh for Christ to try to to to have sacrificed There's so much to bring us out of it. Amen. You know, my brother, my sister, I I hope you can see. There's um there's a song that my husband recently introduced me to in Swahili. It is called Nundo. It translation in English means hammer. And it's about this young person who's standing in the crowd and they are looking at someone being crucified on the cross and they are so angry and they're turning to everyone. Why are you crucifying such an innocent person? And who put the person there? Who put and then they busy asking who put the person there? You let me see that person so that I can contend with him. I want to see that person who who accused this person and put him on the cross. And then everyone in the crowd starts laughing and they they're wondering why are you laughing at me? I'm serious. Bring me the person. I want to contend with the person. And they laugh. And so um she turns around and looks at herself and behold she's holding the hammer. The hammer that put the person right there on that cross. It is your sin and mine that crucifies Christ every day. And the Bible tells us that the more you sin, the more you take him back to the cross. Oh, how I pray that the enmity against sin that God promised within our hearts, you will pray to God to put it within your heart. That you will see the exceeding sinfulness of sin and you will hate sin and flee from it. And that was the desire that God had when he gave the Passover lamb. I mean when he gave the Passover system to the children of Israel, you know, he commanded them that every time in a um for a for a year at the beginning of the year that they will sacrifice that which we called the Passover lamb. And what was the reason for this? God told them so that when your children shall ask you why do we continually do this Passover uh sacrifice? Why do we continually do this every year and celebrate the Passover? You will turn back to your children and you will tell them this is how God did what? Rescued us from Egypt. And how did God do that? The children of Israel who believed in the power of God to save them, they had to um uh put blood, apply blood on their lentils so that when the u the the angel that would come to slaughter the children of Egypt, those who did not put their trust in God, the houses of the children of Israel will be spared to remind them of how they were rescued from Egypt, how they were rescued from idolatry, how God brought them up from that land of slavery to give them the freedom to be able to worship them. When God instituted the Passover lamb, I just want uh us to break down how Christ is the representation of that Passover lamb. How how is Christ the representation of the Passover lamb? Brother Raphael, indeed. Um we see Christ himself is uh talked about as being the lamb uh as a lamb generally without blemish. M indeed uh in John 1 and verse 29 is that uh reference where John the Baptist when he's first seeing Christ you know outside of family I think maybe get togethers as he as he started his ministry he says behold the lamb of God who takes away the sins of the world and Peter writes in first Peter 1 verse 18- 19 uh and he says that we were redeemed with the precious blood of Christ as a lamb without blemish or defect. And so we see the same way during the Passover the the children of Israel slaughtered a lamb and they put the door uh they put the blood on the doorposts. Similarly those who uh believe in Christ, those who believe in Christ uh find salvation. They find uh the angel of death, the condemnation or that this that the wages of sin is death. Then they find that sin is no longer with them and therefore they the wages have been paid by Christ because he died. And similarly even Christ's crucifixion something significant is that it it happened during what? During the Passover almost Christ himself embodying even by virtue of that veil in the temple splitting into two. It was almost Christ saying this whole Passover system this whole thing has been finished. Amen. He is the lamb and he has died. And what we need to do is simply depend on the merits of his blood. Christ our Passover. Christ our Passover. You know, in the Bible, um, it tells us, I I found this interesting when it was pointed out in the lesson that we know that the Passover lamb was required to be without spot and without blemish just like our savior who was a man holy and who was a man holy because he had not sin. He was sinless and he carried with him the divinity. So, we had God dying on behalf of man. in the book of First Peter. Allow me to turn there to just point out something that is very powerful and has been an encouragement for me over the years. And I I hope it will um encourage you as well about how powerful was the blood of Christ versus that of bulls and goats or rams that they brought to the sacrifice every year. First Peter chapter 1 verse 18. Um 1 Peter chapter 1 verse8 the Bible says please read first Peter 1:18 says for as much as ye know that you are not redeemed with corruptible things as silver and gold from your vain conversation are received by tradition from your fathers but with the precious blood of Christ as of a lamb without blemish and without spot. You see the Bible says that we have not been redeemed not by the blood of bulls, not the by the blood of goats, not by that the things that perish but by something very precious. And then he says we have been redeemed from our evil conversation, our evil habits, our evil characters. You know there are some people who imagine, oh my goodness, maybe I have inherited things from my forefathers. Maybe that it says even those sins you have reduced from this generational curses as you know there are people who believe that oh there are generational cares that run in my family. It says even those things that are carried over from your forefathers I have redeemed you from them not by the blood of bulls not by the blood of goats by the by the precious blood of Christ Jesus. Actually, it is high time that we stopped um saying that we need to go somewhere and break a generational curse. We need to go somewhere and have someone pray for us or offer a sacrifice. The sacrifice in Christ Jesus has already been offered for us. And it is sufficient. It is sufficient. You don't have to believe this. If you believe it, you give the devil power over your life. You give the devil power over your life. and and and Christ as the Passover lamb. Um my um husband kindly just take us through this uh how Jesus interaction with the temple. Jesus interaction with the temple. Thank you. The Wednesday part actually takes us through Jesus interaction with the temple. But even before we go to Christ um in the temple, we can go to the old temple. You know, there was first the small tabernacle, the tent that Moses had built in the book of Exodus 25. um all the way to verse 31, Exodus 25-31 and then Exodus chapter 36 onwards, you find a very detailed description of a tent, you know, it's called the tabernacle and then later on you find Solomon takes that and then he rebuilds a much more grand temple, right? And what happened to Solomon's temple? We know that um in the book of uh 2 Chronicles chapter 36, the very last chapter of 2 Chronicles, you find a description of God sending the judgment of who? The Babylonians because of the sin of Israel. And as a result, the temple itself is utterly destroyed. Very very unfortunate. And once the 70 years are up almost the second last the last verse of 2 Chronicles 36, Israel goes back to rebuild the temple. Now once they're rebuilding the temple in Hagi 2:7 to verse 9, you actually find a description of some of the individuals who it's like this is like a response to some of the comments that would have arisen right around that time. Hag 2:7:9 we are told I will shake all nations and the desire of nations will come and I will fill this house with glory said the Lord. The silver is mine and the gold is mine said the Lord. The glory of this latter house shall be greater than the former um said the Lord of hosts. And in this place will I give peace say the Lord of hosts. Now why did God need to say that? Now um what happened is that there used to actually be a true glorious presence of God. In the f the book of first kings chapter 8 verse 10 to1 11 you actually find a description of this thing that is called the shikina glory that used to manifest itself as a very glorious and bright light um h e actually like a cloud that would overwhelm everyone who was even present within that chamber. First Kings chapter 8 reading verse 10 and verse 11 and we find it says here and it came to pass when the priests were come out of the holy place that the cloud filled the house of the Lord so that the priest could not stand to minister because of the cloud for the glory of the Lord had filled the house of the Lord. So there was actually like almost a physical manifestation of the presence of the Lord. Yeah. Yes. Like it was so glorious, you know. It's like you take your back, you know. It's something that is physic. It's so palpable. It's it's it's like right now in in pitch dark, you just find like a shining bright light from somewhere in the sky. You know, it would even like it has a way of even capturing the attention of the individuals. But then what happened once the temple as I saw as was destroyed when the new temple was being rebuilt, the people who were rebuilding the temple, once they saw how the temple was being rebuilt, they began to weep. the book of Ezra chapter 3 reading verse 10 to verse 13 it says when the builders had laid the foundation of the temple of the Lord and they set the priests um uh in the apparel with trumpets and Levites to begin to praise verse 11 um and praising God because they had established the temple verse 12 we we are told many of the priests and the Levites and the chiefs of the fathers who are old men ancient men that had seen the first house when they saw the foundation of this house that was laid before their eyes. What did they do? They wept. They wept with a loud voice and while others shouted for joy, who are the young ones? They were confused. Why are you crying? Because this is our magnificent people are coming back from the captivity of Babylon, you know, from being slaves. They're coming back and they're saying, "This is a nice thing that we have." But then the old men who had seen the old temple, they were like, "Hey, what is this? This is such lower lower quality." But then what does the book of Hag promise us that the glory of this latter temple the temple that they were building right there because Hagi was one of the prophets that was sent uh to oversee the rebuilding of that temple. It was a commend it was an encouragement. The glory of this temple shall far exceed that Lara temple which was Solomon's temple which which is even considered one of the ancient like one of the most glorious ancient buildings. And how would the um was the latter temple glorious when when the very desire of all nations when God himself came to manifest and walk up and down in the precincts of that temple in in in the corridors of those halls even even just around the temple that's something that had never happened in the old temple in the old temple the shikina those were manifestations those were like almost typifying that God was present with Israel you know it was like a token a token of Christ's presence of of um of God's presence right now go Christ himself was present in the temple walking up and down teaching giving um some form of ministry that was so much more glorious in fact it was the true fulfillment of God's initial desire of the true temple the book of Exodus 25 verse 89 we are told what that God tells Moses let them make me a sanctuary why that I might dwell among them that I might dwell among And that's precisely what that's actually one of Christ's name. Matthew chapter 1 vers 23. Yes, Emmanuel. It means what? God with us. God with us. So it was like Christ in the temple is not just a fulfillment of the temple's original design, but was the the truest representation of of God among his people and the truest representation of God's true desire to actually be with his people. Amen. Amen. God with us. My brother, um, how can we relate this to the Christian experience as an individual myself to seeing the glory of the latter temple maybe of the of the of the old temple and the glory of the latter temple. How can I relate it if I look at my Christian experience in the past and now as well? I think it speaks to us of the almighty power of God. There's a song that says, "I sing the mighty power of God that created, you know, and and and and he can do wonderful things." It simply speaks to us and tells us that sometimes it's not the externals, it's not the structure, but it's he who dwells in the structure. You see for example uh as they began with the tabernacle of Moses and eventually it was destroyed then they built uh they built Solomon's temple which was very magnificent and uh and and and and wonderful gold uh shitty wood all that all that but then it was destroyed under Nebuchadnezzar and then eventually now when they were rebuilding and there some people were crying but yet it is in that same temple that Christ walked and taught and so similarly my to us in our lives. We may have started off very nicely. Maybe as pathfinders in the church, we were very we were very good people and then somewhere along the line as we've interacted with people and with society, we may have fallen away. Maybe earthliness or worldliness has affected us in one way or another. Maybe we have veered off from uh from our from chastity and from purity. But nonetheless, sometimes it is a trick of the devil to tell us that our former selves is our former glory. The pick is the past. Yes. You've picked at that particular point and having fallen off, you cannot make your way back. The beautiful thing, the beautiful story of the gospel is indeed like that arm that is broken when it heals in the in the gospel story, the arm becomes even stronger than it was without it having been broken. In fact, the path of the just. Yes. in in in fact so white writon says that man's connection with God you know man's connection with God is now closer than it would have been if man had never fallen that's a mystery to me as another thing she writes and says that in the new heaven and the new earth guess the ones who will be closest to Christ the ones who had fallen the most the ones who were the biggest of worst of sinners those will be the ones sit closest to him almost there were people who sit close to the king are usually like we call in the kitchen cabinet, the ones who know things before others know them. Imagine, behold what manner of love. Amen. Amen. Amen. And I think this is a very good segue to move on to the Thursday part. You know, having looked at the sanctuary uh service where God met with man, moving on to Solomon's temple and then we have now seen Herod's temple. Talk to us about the temple we have not yet seen. only descriptions or even more glory that we are yet to see. Indeed. Indeed. Um the Bible speaks about instances in which certain prophets were given a glimpse of the government of God and and of his temple. As understanding the sanctuary service helps us to to to sort of um visually visualize how God's kingdom is and and uh and how and how things are arranged, you know. And then we also understand the plan of salvation. But beyond that to be in the very physical presence of God must be something and it must be significant. We have the example of Ezekiel in Ezekiel chapter 1 and verse 26. He's able to see the will within a will you know. Then we have Isaiah. Isaiah also uh is taken in holy vision and he sees the Lord and and we notice there's certain fundamental elements um of of of of how how it is uh and how it will be to literally be there in person. Amen. to be there in person. And we see one of the fundamental things that we notice, the first thing that happens when they eventually in the presence of the holy one is all of them in Isaiah's vision, the temple is filled with smoke, you know, and and and the saraphim uh the angels there, they proclaim what? They proclaim the holiness of God. The first things, the first thing that we notice in all these people and the first thing that we will also notice in the visions of revelation is indeed all of heaven is singing holy, holy, holy. We speaks about the glory of God which is his holiness. The second thing we see for example um uh is the next thing Isaiah these people see uh that they talk about um they cry out about the their condition the human condition how they are unfit man's unfit nature Bible records and says he cries out uh that he is a man of what unclean lips unclean lips he's a man of unclean lips in Isaiah chapter 6 and verse 5 and John weeps and uh and and in the vision of revelation chapter 5 John and verse4 he says indeed there was no man who was found who was worthy in the presence of God mankind feels his deficiency mankind feels his his his his unworthiness and we feel and we acknowledge that we are utterly unworthy and we need Christ as our redeemer I think now now that you have mentioned that. Let me just ask my uh brother if in the presence of God men feel their unworthiness and feel that they cannot stand and we can we have seen the disposition of very many um uh prophets when Christ appears to them or even sometimes an angel appears to them. How does that inform our worship styles before God? Yes, it actually tells us that if we become and feel puffed up and you know like we are so full of ourselves then either we are chasing away God or God is not present with us. That almost one of the chief parts of worship or being in the presence of God is appreciating our utter almost our closest to nothing like how like how we are before God. And the closer we are to Christ, the closer we are to God, the more likely we are to appreciate just how magnificent and wonderful and glorious and loving God is and how and our uncleanness, how unworthy we really are. And are there worship styles we see today, contemporary churches or even in our churches as Seventh Day Adventist that do not show this disposition? I would say anything um uh h that would exalt man in the presence of God during worship especially when God is supposed to be the center that one is is an unfortunate red flag. It is not that we are to take away from people the natural gifts God has given them. It is that God should be the the ultimate and fundamental center of especially worship especially when we are coming before God for the singular purpose of exalting his name and glorifying him. That is especially the time when God should be glorified. When the glory of man should be laid to the dust and any form of worship that exalts man, we should be suspect and we should keep away from it and embrace that which glorifies God. Amen. Amen. Brother Rafael, you can continue about this heavenly temple and what makes it glorious. Indeed. And in the vision of Revelation chapter 5, I believe it's uh in the setting of the seals. Yeah. And they asking who can open to a certain extent. Uh I would liken this to who can truly manifest and who can truly defend the character of God. There is nobody. It is only Christ. It is only in the light of the cross that we see the love of God. And two we also see the exceedingly sinful and hurtful nature of sin and how we as human beings have fallen to the extent that there is nothing in and of ourselves. You know, no man can defend God. It is only Christ who can truly stand up and say uh and show us the father. He can describe to us the character of God. It is only Christ who is worthy. We are utterly unworthy because uh of our sin. All have fallen short of glor of the glory of God. Even those people who complain, even those people who whine, Bible records when eventually Christ shall come. It says all heads shall bow and all knees shall also do what? Shall bend before God. You know all knees shall bend and all beings the most proud of pontiffs, the most proud, proudest of kings before the presence of God. Everybody feels their utter unworthiness and only Christ can stand and even we can stand only as we are hidden in the cross and its shadow. Amen. Amen. you know the sanctuary temple we had the shakina glory um in the um in the Solomon's temple we also had the shakina glory in the in Herod's temple we had Christ himself walking there and and and and and and interacting with people every day there tells us that that temple was left desolate he departed from it the glory of that temple indeed disappeared Why? Because we are told Christ moved now from that temple to the heavenly temple and now not just to interact with men merely but now to minister there as a high priest. I want to point you to the work that Christ is doing in the heavenly sanctuary. and my um my brother Rafael actually speak to speak to us about that and the importance of us now looking forward to even a more glorious temple especially because of the work that Christ is doing there. Indeed as you see the sanctuary system is a fundamental truth and an understanding of it is something that we should all pursue beyond this lesson. And so we saw uh the sacrifice Christ as the lamb being sacrificed where here on earth here on earth which tells us that the earth is the outer court and then there's the tabernacle wherein is host the holy place and the most holy place and so when Christ himself uh is um is living in uh is preparing his disciples for his death and resurrection he tells his disciples in John 14 verse 1-6 he tells them let not your hearts be troubled troubled he believe in God believe believe also in me and then he says in my father's house that's significant it's one house but then this house has many mansions it's an interesting uh concept is it a gated community what is it but he says in his father's house are many mansions a house with mansions but I digress then he says if it were not so I would have told you but then he says I'm going to prepare a place for you and if I go and prepare a place for you I will come again. So it tells us that Christ is not going there building. They're not building, you know, they're not uh measuring rooms and saying, "Oh, this and that." The mansions were there, but Christ is has said he has gone there to prepare a place. Christ is interceding on our behalf. Christ is ministering. There's a special work that he's doing. And this special work is to prepare a place for us. Christ is there in and he moved at his resurrection. He moved into the holy place. Then in the times of the end when that book was opened as we referred we referred to uh in uh in in in Daniel chapter 12 and in revelation chapter 10 in the previous lesson in the in the times of from 1844 a study which uh you all of us can can look at. We see uh in prophetic vision we understand that Christ moved where from the holy place into the most holy place where now he's doing the it is we are in the antityypical day of atonement one of the sanctuary services and there Christ is once again still doing what interceding interceding for us preparing a place cleansing the books of records cleansing and and finalizing that final role uh that will be called up yonder when the trumpet of the lord shall sound. Amen. You know the bible tells us that that temple where Christ is ministering today one day it shall come down. We are told that the temple of God will be among men and God himself will dwell with them. Familiarize yourself. Make yourself acquaint yourself with the work of Christ in the heavenly sanctuary. Appoint yourself with that work because that is the final work that is going to determine your destiny. It is what is going to determine who are gods and who are not gods. With that I want my brothers to um summarize this lesson and give us the main key takeaways from this lesson that we have gone through. I'll start with you uh my brother. Uh thank you so much. So I think for me uh the most important um lesson I think I began saying that the sacrifice and the cross the most important lesson um that the the Bible gives us it is it's almost like a it's like a scarlet thread that that is woven all throughout the scriptures all throughout the story that God is giving us of how he wants to save his people. I want us to meditate upon this idea of the sanctuary of the cross of Jesus Christ of the character of the individual upon um who was set upon that cross that was none other than God himself. God who was manifest in the flesh. Jesus Christ who loved us so dearly that he um would would would sacrifice his own life that we might be saved and that we might um live a fresh and new in and um in everlasting joy. I pray that we can appreciate and and and and accept and receive this gift and hold on to it and cherish it greatly. Meditate on the idea of the cross of Jesus Christ. Amen. Amen. Meditate on the idea of the cross of Christ Jesus. Amen. In the prophetic vision, both Ezekiel, Isaiah as well as John say in heaven, they just cry holy, holy, holy. And so when it comes to our salvation, similarly, it's only holiness. The standard is still holiness, a lamb without blemish. Christ, a priest who is incorruptible. We live in a time in which even judges can be convicted. You see, even the ones who sit in powers giving are equally corrupted. But we find in Christ as our minister, as our high priest, one who is equally holy. We find holiness as a as a required as a requirement throughout. Holy, holy, holy. And Christ fulfills it. And so in coming to Christ, then we find uh ourselves in the arms of one who can truly save to the uttermost. Amen. He's the lamb. Then he also becomes a priest. Then he also becomes the judge and our intercessor, our lawyer and also our judge. Such a wonderful such a wonderful picture, such a wonderful and an encouraging um encouraging message to each and every single one of us. It's my prayer and my desire that beyond this lesson we will study the sanctuary and there indeed we'll see that thy way oh Lord is in the sanctuary. Amen. Amen. You know last week we studied about nations part two and we were looking at how these nations degraded over time that one the nation that came after the other was weaker than the previous nation. But when we've looked at the temples they they grow in glory. The the following temple is more glorious than the former. The latter is more glorious until we culminate at the glorious temple in heaven. It is my desire that you will have an opportunity to see that temple. The descriptions we have been given here are not even adequate to describe it. The Bible says, "No, I had indeed seen nor ear had nor the nor not even um a fit description been given of those things which the Lord has prepared for us. God has prepared u mighty and glorious things for you. My desire is that you will be there. But how will you be there? By acquainting yourself with God. Make God your friend. You know um the Bible the Bible does say that we are in a time of judgment today. We are being judged. But our friend as my brother Raphael says he is judging us. Acquaint yourself with that judge. The last takeaway I want to give to you is that you know the question we began with in the book of Revelation chapter 5. It started by saying, "Who is worthy? Who is worthy to open the scroll?" My brother spoke about it, but this is also how I see it. It's as though they asked, "Who has the right to stand on behalf of men?" And they do not represent a harsh king. They do not represent someone who has fought battles, even though indeed he has. They do not represent um um someone who who who wants to um show his his authority and his power. They say the person worthy to stand on behalf of men of sinful men and judge them is a lamb. A little meek, quiet, innocent lamb is the only one that has the right to judge you. How amazing is that that the one who died for you today stands to judge you? Acquaint yourself with him. Would you kindly um pray with us as we as we close today? Okay, let's pray. Heavenly Father, we thank you so much uh that you have carried us through this study, this um exceedingly important study of uh the sacrifice. We have seen many facets, many angles of this discussion, but the most important thing uh I pray that you may impress upon our hearts is Jesus Christ who upon the cross um died for our sins. I pray that you may help us meditate upon this idea that you may impress it most strongly upon our hearts and our minds that we receiving this truth might be saved in Jesus name I pray. Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. Thank you.

TIMESTAMPED TRANSCRIPT:
[7.8s] Praise God and happy Sabbath. Thank you
[10.2s] so much for joining us today at New Life
[12.6s] 7th Day Adventist Church for the Sabbath
[15.2s] School lesson study. This quarter we are
[18.2s] studying illusions, images and symbols
[21.9s] and how we can use them to study and
[24.6s] understand Bible prophecy and especially
[27.3s] as it relates to God's people in these
[30.4s] last days. I'm excited today to
[33.1s] particularly study lesson number six,
[36.7s] understanding the sacrifice. We are
[39.8s] joined by my brother and my husband. I
[42.8s] would like them to introduce themselves
[44.4s] even as we begin. My name is Enongo
[46.7s] Rafael. It's a pleasure to be here.
[48.7s] Amen. Thank you. My name is Jafet Rono.
[51.0s] I'm happy to be here. Thank you. And my
[53.4s] name is Jess Rono. Brother Rafael,
[56.4s] kindly pray with us even as we begin
[58.4s] this lesson. Let's believe and pray. Our
[61.5s] father in heaven, we humbly come before
[63.4s] you through Christ our Lord and our
[64.7s] savior, asking dear Lord for the
[66.6s] wonderful gift of your holy spirit who
[68.2s] inspired men of old to write the
[70.6s] scriptures. Now, as we study these
[72.2s] scriptures, may you may he enlighten our
[74.5s] minds and guide our conversation that we
[77.2s] might truly understand your sacrifice
[80.0s] and the sacrifice that you call us to
[81.8s] do. I pray in Jesus name. Amen. Amen.
[84.2s] Amen. Amen. Understanding the sacrifice.
[88.3s] You know the book of Daniel and the book
[90.7s] of Revelation being prophetic books,
[93.6s] they are filled with references to the
[96.6s] sanctuary service. In the book of um
[99.2s] Daniel, one of the key prophecies we
[100.7s] know of in Daniel chapter 8 verse uh 13
[103.8s] is until 2,300 days then shall the
[107.0s] sanctuary be cleansed. And then in the
[109.5s] book of revelation over and over again
[112.5s] we are being introduced to articles of
[115.2s] the sanctuary. Whether it is the golden
[117.4s] candlestick in the book of revelation
[119.2s] chapter uh chapter 1 and two when Christ
[121.8s] is walking amidst the golden candlestick
[124.0s] or whether it is speaking about the
[125.8s] throne room of heaven and we are seeing
[127.8s] alarm or when it is speaking about the
[130.1s] altar of incense and over and over again
[133.1s] we are seeing not just references to the
[135.3s] sanctuary service but we are seeing
[137.4s] references particularly to the lamb and
[140.5s] the lamb is being introduced to us in
[142.9s] these books as the center of those
[145.4s] prophetic visions that we are seeing.
[147.5s] And that's why I'm excited to be jumping
[149.4s] into this. And as you can see, it is
[152.2s] impossible for you to fully understand
[154.6s] these prophetic books without
[156.7s] understanding the sanctuary service. And
[159.3s] that's one of the unique truths about
[160.6s] the 7th Day Adventist Church. And
[162.5s] actually, if you go back to our history,
[164.7s] our our pioneers really never understood
[168.2s] prophecy very well until they understood
[171.8s] the sanctuary service. Amen. And as we
[174.6s] go into this week's study, kindly read
[177.4s] for us um um Jaffet the key text for
[180.3s] this uh week. Thank you. The key text is
[183.0s] in Revelation 5:9. And they sung a new
[186.4s] song, saying, "You are worthy to take
[188.7s] the scroll to open its seals. For you
[191.4s] were slain and have redeemed us to God
[194.1s] by your blood out of every tribe and
[196.2s] tongue and people and nation." Amen.
[199.2s] Amen. You know this I love this scene in
[202.3s] the book of um um Revelation
[205.2s] 5:E9. Revelation chapter 5 actually
[207.6s] basically um and we talked about this. I
[210.4s] think it was in week two when we talked
[212.6s] about this lamb that everyone asked
[214.7s] about. He was like where is the lamb?
[216.3s] When Isaac asked about this, where is
[218.6s] that lamb that we need to sacrifice? And
[221.5s] in the book of um John um John John I
[225.0s] mean John the Baptist points out it for
[227.0s] us that lamb in John chapter 1 verse 29.
[229.9s] But in John chapter five revelation
[232.1s] chapter 5 we see John the revelator
[234.6s] again very sad and very depressed
[237.4s] wondering where is this lamb? And he
[239.6s] finally he's pointed out to this lamb.
[242.1s] He sees this lamb in the midst of that
[244.2s] throne room um as that lamb that was
[246.9s] slain from the foundation of the of the
[249.6s] world. And we are told that that lamb is
[251.8s] worthy. Why? Because that lamb has died
[255.4s] to redeem the children of God. I want us
[259.0s] to just dive back to the sacrificial
[262.0s] system to understand these sacrifices
[264.8s] that the children of Israel used to
[266.6s] bring uh time and time again. What was
[269.3s] the point of these sacrifices and and
[271.4s] what was the disposition that they were
[273.8s] supposed to possess? Thank you. uh uh in
[277.0s] fact uh even as I'm continuing with this
[279.1s] uh discussion the Sunday part futile
[281.0s] sacrifices I think we must note that
[283.3s] this is by far the most important topic
[286.0s] that we will possibly have discussed
[287.8s] amen discussion of the cross and of the
[290.1s] sacrifice it is truly first of all it is
[292.5s] almost the heart is not quite the heart
[293.9s] it's almost somewhere at the center of
[295.4s] this lesson but it is at the heart of
[297.5s] the sanctuary it is it is at the heart
[299.4s] of prophecy and it is at the heart of of
[302.2s] the plan that Christ God had in store
[304.6s] for his people from the very very
[306.6s] beginning. But now the question is um
[309.4s] fetal sacrifices. It is strange that
[312.0s] there were actually times when
[313.8s] sacrifices were rejected. You would
[315.4s] think that the sacrifice is like um is
[318.6s] like soap, you know, it's like how can
[320.4s] you reject soap? Soap is there for
[321.8s] washing. How can you reject how can
[323.5s] somebody um say that this soap is
[325.7s] ineffective? What does that even mean?
[327.5s] Or that God maybe was excited and super
[330.1s] happy to see the sacrifice. Yeah. Or
[332.0s] something. Yeah. you know like there
[333.4s] those two strange contrasts and we can
[335.8s] see their instances in fact one very
[337.9s] unique instance um one of the most
[340.3s] interesting it's very uh uh in an easy
[342.8s] because it's the very first chapter of
[344.1s] Isaiah it's one of the most important
[346.0s] chapters of Isaiah because it sets the
[348.1s] tone of the whole of that prophecy that
[351.0s] God gives through his prophet Isaiah and
[353.7s] through the prophet Isaiah God gives a
[356.0s] true vision of the true state of the of
[358.3s] the children of Israel we are told uh
[361.0s] verse three and verse four The ox
[363.0s] knoweth his owner. I'm reading from King
[364.9s] James. And the and the donkey his
[367.5s] master's crib, but Israel does not know.
[370.7s] My people do not consider. And then in
[373.4s] verse four onwards, he he he he
[376.2s] describes in incredible detail the
[378.3s] precise state of Israel. We are told in
[380.8s] verse six, from the sole of the foot
[382.9s] even to the head, there is no soundness
[385.1s] in it, but wounds and bruises and
[387.8s] putrifying souls. And then it says that
[390.4s] even as a nation that they are desolate.
[392.9s] We are told in verse 10 that they have
[394.7s] become like Sodom and Gomorrah. And what
[398.5s] exactly is the issue? We are told that
[401.2s] even the sacrifices that you think would
[403.4s] be there to solve those problems. You
[405.1s] know uh the reason why the sacrifices
[407.5s] are there you'd think is to is to bring
[409.4s] cleansing and atonement removal of sin.
[412.1s] We are told verse 11 what is the purpose
[414.6s] of the multitude of your sacrifices to
[417.0s] me? He God says, "I am full. I am done.
[420.6s] I am full of the offerings of rams and
[422.9s] the fat of fed beasts." Verse 12, it
[425.2s] says, "When you come to appear before
[427.0s] me, who has required it as a a a at your
[431.2s] hand to tread my courts?" Very strange
[433.5s] question because God actually required
[435.9s] of them. God gave those very specific
[438.4s] instructions in the books in in the
[440.2s] first five books. Very specific. He
[441.9s] said, "You must appear three times uh
[444.0s] before me. First of all, all males.
[445.5s] Secondly, whenever you sin, you bring
[447.5s] the sin offering and then morning and
[449.2s] evening there's the burnt offering. But
[451.3s] then the question is how like is God
[453.2s] reneging on his word? What's going on?
[455.0s] The issue is that these people were
[457.5s] doing it with a in an in an unworthy way
[460.0s] almost to check a box. It's like they're
[462.2s] engaging in sin and they're doing evil
[464.4s] things and then they're bringing the
[465.9s] sacrifice but not a a a because of
[469.6s] contrition to bring an end to that state
[472.2s] they're in but just almost to check a
[473.8s] box to just continue. It's almost like a
[476.1s] mirror or or um of what you find in the
[479.1s] book of Matthew 23 when Jesus Christ is
[481.5s] describing the Pharisees that the
[483.0s] Pharisees were many things that they
[484.6s] were doing and and and it was just to
[486.6s] check a box but they had disregarded the
[488.8s] weightier matters of the law. The
[490.4s] weightier matters of the law and they
[492.2s] were just doing small things that God
[493.8s] insists okay in Deuteronomy chapter 6 we
[496.2s] are told that you're supposed to put
[497.9s] bind this law between your foreheads.
[500.3s] Okay, then it means you literally take a
[502.2s] scroll and then you write the law inside
[504.0s] it. Then you put it in a box in your
[505.3s] forehead called the felactory. We are
[507.0s] told elsewhere you you must expand the
[509.0s] borders of um you put a ribbon of blue
[511.6s] on on your garment. Oh, I guess you put
[513.4s] a like on the edge of the garment you
[515.2s] put a ribbon of blue and then that's
[516.9s] exactly what they did. But Christ said
[518.7s] that that was just hypocrisy. And that's
[520.7s] exactly what we find in Isaiah chapter
[522.6s] one. On the other hand, we do find
[525.1s] sacrifices that God has accepted. very
[527.9s] quickly Isaiah chapter 56 reading verse
[530.5s] 6 and verse 7 we find um uh even them uh
[534.7s] the son of the stranger that joins
[537.2s] themselves the Lord to serve him and to
[539.4s] love the name of the Lord to be his
[541.3s] servant everyone that does what that
[543.4s] keepeth the Sabbath from polluting it
[545.4s] and taketh hold of my covenant even them
[548.1s] will I bring to my holy mountain make
[550.2s] them joyful in my house of prayer their
[552.3s] burnt offerings and their sacrifice
[554.2s] shall be what shall be accepted upon on
[557.8s] my altar. So we find that uh uh contrast
[561.1s] that the unworthy sacrifices being done
[563.6s] by as a means to check a box, God
[565.9s] rejects. But those that come from a
[567.7s] heart of contrition, Psalm 51:17, that
[571.0s] come from a true heart of contrition,
[573.0s] that is when in the same verse 17 of the
[576.3s] of of of that Psalm 51, that's when even
[578.9s] David says, "Then you shall accept our
[581.0s] burnt offerings and our sacrifices."
[582.9s] Verse 17, if we come with a heart of
[585.8s] cont. Heart of cont. My brother Rafael,
[588.7s] um are you able to give us the um an
[591.6s] example of this especially maybe as
[593.4s] depicted um with Cain and Abel? What was
[596.2s] the difference between the conditions of
[598.1s] their hearts? Indeed. um one comes to
[601.9s] God with the um it's an interesting um
[607.4s] um an interesting story that one when
[610.7s] we're told we see for example the story
[613.1s] is found in the book of Genesis chapter
[615.5s] 4 and verse uh three Bible records and
[619.8s] says and in the process of time it came
[621.3s] to pass that Cain brought of the fruit
[623.1s] of the ground an offering unto the Lord
[625.4s] and Abel he also brought of the
[627.4s] firstlings of his flock and the fat
[629.7s] thereof. And the Lord had respect unto
[632.0s] Abel and to his offering. We see
[636.0s] um at the beginning there we are told uh
[638.8s] their professions. In verse two, Abel
[641.5s] was a keeper of sheep and Cain was a
[643.7s] tiller of the ground. Cain was a both of
[646.2s] both were in agriculture. One kept
[648.1s] animals, the other one uh was uh was a
[652.0s] vegetarian in practice in in vocation.
[655.0s] And so, uh, we see he decides they're
[659.3s] going to offer an offering to God. But
[661.8s] then before we continue, I'd like us to
[663.8s] consider Hebrews 9 and verse 22. Hebrews
[666.1s] 9 and vers2 says, "And almost all things
[669.0s] are by the law purged with what?" Blood.
[671.8s] Blood. And without the shedding of
[673.1s] blood, there is no remission of sin. And
[675.8s] so, sin had entered into the world. Adam
[677.6s] and Eve have been chest away from the
[679.0s] garden of Eden. And now the sacrificial
[681.0s] system has been
[682.5s] instituted all uh
[685.0s] in in almost a remembrance of Genesis
[688.9s] 3:15 of the promise of Christ, that seed
[692.1s] that would come and redeem humanity. And
[694.5s] so with this in mind, we see now Cain
[698.4s] coming and
[700.5s] offering vegetables. You know in John 1
[703.9s] and verse 29 as well as verse 36 when
[706.2s] John the Baptist sees Christ coming he
[708.0s] says behold the lamb of God not the
[710.6s] vegetable of God you know the broccoli
[712.6s] of God no no no the lamb of God Christ
[715.9s] is depicted as a lamb who sheds his
[718.4s] blood and so for this reason Cain's
[720.8s] sacrifice is rejected but Cain persists
[724.3s] Cain persists to such an extent that
[725.8s] eventually God himself comes to him you
[728.3s] know the Bible says uh Cain was very
[730.8s] wrought and his countenance hands fell.
[732.8s] He was very he felt like why is God not
[736.2s] accepting my sacrifice and accepting the
[738.2s] sacrifice of my brother? He felt
[739.9s] wronged, you know. And it says the
[741.8s] following in verse six, and the Lord
[743.2s] said unto Cain, why thou wroth and why
[746.0s] is thy countenance fallen? If thou doest
[748.6s] well, shall thou shalt not be accepted?
[751.2s] If you had done well, if you had
[754.7s] followed the system that God has put in
[757.8s] that the sacrifice should point to
[759.7s] Christ, not to our own works, not our
[762.7s] own self-sufficiency. Are there things
[765.2s] today um um Jaffith that we still do
[768.7s] like the children of Israel to tick the
[771.0s] box as you said? Yeah. Because sometimes
[773.7s] even like we can come to church on
[775.8s] Sabbath to tick a box, you know.
[778.2s] Sometimes we can even pray. Sometimes
[780.2s] God forbid you can even read the Bible
[782.3s] to take a box and you don't even gain
[784.6s] anything from it except to to uh just
[788.2s] say you know I have studied for the day
[790.1s] you know uh and obviously that is not
[792.5s] acceptable because you're not going
[794.2s] there to seek after meat in due season.
[796.6s] You're there doing something that is a
[798.9s] religious thing that needs to be done.
[800.8s] You know sometimes you can even accept
[802.8s] offices and then engage in office
[804.5s] activities even chat office activities
[806.5s] just to tick a box and it is it is
[808.6s] manifest that the Holy Spirit is absent
[810.9s] in one's demeanor when it is clear that
[812.9s] somebody is doing things not from the
[814.5s] heart not because they're doing a
[816.2s] calling that God has called not because
[818.0s] they are obedient to the will of God but
[820.1s] because there is some external thing
[822.1s] that they're trying to manifest that the
[823.9s] world can see very I must also add um it
[828.1s] may have been going back to the story of
[829.8s] Cain that he brought his best
[831.4s] vegetables. You know, he may have
[833.5s] brought his best, but sometimes when it
[836.3s] comes to our life and our relationship
[839.4s] with God, it's not about us, but it's
[841.8s] more about him. That worship is focused
[844.1s] on him. You know, we may be honest and
[846.2s] sincere, but we may be honestly lost and
[848.5s] sincerely lost. Ours is simply not to
[851.6s] rely in and of ourselves, not to to to
[854.2s] desist from that ticking of boxes.
[855.8s] Because it's possible that we live very
[857.8s] bad lives, but then we come here in
[859.4s] church and we give donations. We give of
[861.4s] our best. You know, we're singing our
[863.3s] best. But it calls for us to sort of um
[867.1s] examine our lives, each and every single
[869.0s] one of us to examine our lives in the
[870.9s] light of scripture. not in the light of
[872.8s] what we feel is right, in the light of
[874.6s] what how we feel we are giving our best,
[876.9s] but to examine ourselves in the light of
[879.4s] scripture and see whether indeed we are
[881.8s] walking in obedience. Amen. Amen. Um the
[885.4s] Bible says in the book of Psalms 51
[888.8s] verse 6, "Behold, thou desireest truth
[893.4s] not outwardly but in the inward parts
[897.1s] and in the hidden part that thou shalt
[900.3s] make me to know wisdom that God wants
[902.9s] you to have the truth in the inward
[905.2s] parts." It is very sad in Isaiah that he
[907.0s] says these people, you even multiply
[908.9s] your prayers. You know, you come for
[910.3s] prayer nights, you pray over and over
[911.9s] again. You pray screaming, you pray
[914.2s] shouting. I'm not saying there's
[915.7s] anything wrong with prayer nights or
[917.1s] praying with loud voices. But I'm just
[919.1s] saying if we are doing this relying on
[921.8s] ourselves and our own self-sufficiency
[924.2s] and the rounds of ceremonies that we
[926.4s] have to do that, oh friends, we are not
[928.9s] relying on the lamb of God. If we are
[931.3s] relying on the processes and the systems
[933.3s] we put in place rather than the p uh the
[936.4s] lamb of god alone to save us then god
[939.0s] says I will not hear you. You will
[941.0s] multiply them. These are not the things
[942.6s] that I desire for obedience with god is
[946.2s] better than sacrifice. And I want to ask
[949.4s] you my brother, if God, if all these
[952.1s] sacrifices um pointed to Christ and God
[955.5s] says, "I do not delight in the blood of
[958.0s] bulocks," as we read in Isaiah, then
[960.3s] what was the point of us offering this
[962.6s] uh uh blood of bulls and goats? Why the
[965.8s] blood of bulls and goats?
[968.2s] Indeed, Hebrews chapter 10 verse3 um the
[972.7s] Bible records and says, "But in those
[974.6s] sacrifices there is a remembrance again
[977.1s] made of sins every year." Continuing in
[979.8s] verse four, Paul writes and says, "For
[981.6s] it is not possible that the blood of
[983.8s] bulls and of gods should take away
[986.4s] sins." But these were simply
[988.9s] types. They were simply types. They were
[991.7s] sort of to give the worshipper to
[995.0s] impress upon him the the the the message
[999.8s] of a messiah who would now truly come
[1002.2s] the antitype who will eventually now do
[1005.4s] away with sin once and for all. Indeed,
[1007.8s] it says in verse 5, wherefore when he
[1010.0s] cometh into the world, he said,
[1011.5s] sacrifice and offering, thou willest
[1013.7s] not, but a body hast thou prepared for
[1017.1s] me. in burnt offerings and in sacrifices
[1019.8s] for sin thou has no pleasure. And then
[1023.4s] he's speaking now about Christ and he
[1025.2s] says then said I lo I come in the volume
[1027.8s] of the book it is written of me in
[1029.4s] scripture even indeed in Genesis to do
[1032.3s] thy will oh God above when he said
[1035.5s] sacrifice and offering and burnt
[1036.8s] offerings and offerings for sin thou
[1038.7s] wouldest not neither hath pleasure
[1040.6s] therein which are offered by the law
[1043.0s] then said he lo I am come to do thy will
[1046.2s] oh God he taketh away the first that he
[1048.8s] may establish the second you see it's
[1052.2s] speaking talking to us about the
[1053.9s] importance of these sacrifices. They
[1057.2s] were important in that they were holding
[1059.1s] place to sort of put in memory to etch
[1063.4s] in the memories and in the daily
[1065.0s] activities in the daily worship services
[1067.6s] that indeed a savior is going to come.
[1070.7s] These are a type. But then eventually we
[1073.0s] see Christ comes into the picture and he
[1075.6s] dies there on the cross. And the Bible
[1077.2s] records in Mark
[1079.0s] 15:38, "Then the veil of the temple was
[1081.6s] torn in two from what?" From top to
[1084.3s] bottom, signifying that indeed as as
[1088.1s] Paul says, he is he did what? He takes
[1091.2s] away the first that he may establish the
[1093.5s] second. The blood of bulls, the blood of
[1096.3s] uh of goats can never really truly take
[1099.3s] away those sins. They were just simply
[1102.1s] sort of installments by faith that when
[1105.0s] Christ comes, he will truly away do
[1107.5s] what? Wipe away by his own blood. By his
[1110.6s] own blood, amen uh the sins of the
[1112.5s] world. And so these were simply types.
[1115.8s] I maybe um brother Duffet just talk to
[1119.3s] us
[1120.2s] about why if it had to take Christ God
[1126.5s] himself to die a man to die for us to be
[1129.9s] redeemed from from this sinful world.
[1133.5s] What does this tell us about sin? It
[1136.9s] tells us the exceeding sinfulness of sin
[1139.4s] that if it costs me uh so much to uh to
[1144.3s] buy a car or something, it it it it at
[1146.6s] least describes the value or at least
[1149.3s] the rarity of the material, you know,
[1151.8s] the the um the extreme nature um you
[1155.4s] know, the the high level of design
[1157.5s] needed to develop that material and that
[1160.1s] vehicle. It's it's how much more in in
[1163.3s] in the fact that God himself had to die
[1167.0s] that we might be saved. It it tells us
[1169.7s] that sin was so like otherwise God would
[1172.6s] just have said fine and just wiped you
[1174.4s] know and said don't do that next time
[1176.6s] you know which is sometimes a joke that
[1178.3s] is carried on around there um even in
[1180.7s] social media but the very fact that
[1183.0s] Christ had to die indicates how
[1185.0s] exceeding sinful sin sin was um how how
[1189.3s] great of um like how deep of a pit that
[1192.9s] we had uh been thrown into as humanity
[1195.5s] uh for Christ to try to to to have
[1198.0s] sacrificed There's so much to bring us
[1199.9s] out of it. Amen. You know, my brother,
[1203.0s] my sister, I I hope you can see. There's
[1206.4s] um there's a song that my husband
[1208.7s] recently introduced me to in Swahili. It
[1211.7s] is called Nundo. It translation in
[1214.7s] English means hammer. And it's about
[1217.0s] this young person who's standing in the
[1219.4s] crowd and they are looking at someone
[1222.4s] being crucified on the cross and they
[1224.3s] are so angry and they're turning to
[1226.0s] everyone. Why are you crucifying such an
[1228.9s] innocent person? And who put the person
[1230.6s] there? Who put and then they busy asking
[1232.6s] who put the person there? You let me see
[1234.9s] that person so that I can contend with
[1236.7s] him. I want to see that person who who
[1238.9s] accused this person and put him on the
[1241.4s] cross. And then everyone in the crowd
[1243.8s] starts laughing and they they're
[1245.9s] wondering why are you laughing at me?
[1247.4s] I'm serious. Bring me the person. I want
[1249.3s] to contend with the person. And they
[1251.2s] laugh. And so um she turns around and
[1253.5s] looks at herself and behold she's
[1256.0s] holding the hammer. The hammer that put
[1259.0s] the person right there on that cross. It
[1261.8s] is your sin and mine that crucifies
[1264.5s] Christ every day. And the Bible tells us
[1267.1s] that the more you sin, the more you take
[1269.4s] him back to the cross. Oh, how I pray
[1272.0s] that the enmity against sin that God
[1274.7s] promised within our hearts, you will
[1276.9s] pray to God to put it within your heart.
[1279.2s] That you will see the exceeding
[1280.8s] sinfulness of sin and you will hate sin
[1285.0s] and flee from it. And that was the
[1288.0s] desire that God had when he gave the
[1290.6s] Passover lamb. I mean when he gave the
[1292.6s] Passover system to the children of
[1294.8s] Israel, you know, he commanded them that
[1297.2s] every time in a um for a for a year at
[1301.0s] the beginning of the year that they will
[1303.4s] sacrifice that which we called the
[1305.9s] Passover lamb. And what was the reason
[1308.6s] for this? God told them so that when
[1311.2s] your children shall ask you why do we
[1314.2s] continually do this Passover uh
[1316.8s] sacrifice? Why do we continually do this
[1319.0s] every year and celebrate the Passover?
[1321.9s] You will turn back to your children and
[1323.8s] you will tell them this is how God did
[1327.4s] what? Rescued us from Egypt. And how did
[1331.0s] God do that? The children of Israel who
[1334.4s] believed in the power of God to save
[1336.7s] them, they had to um uh put blood, apply
[1340.5s] blood on their lentils so that when the
[1343.6s] u the the angel that would come to
[1346.2s] slaughter the children of Egypt, those
[1348.2s] who did not put their trust in God, the
[1350.7s] houses of the children of Israel will be
[1352.6s] spared to remind them of how they were
[1354.6s] rescued from Egypt, how they were
[1356.6s] rescued from idolatry, how God brought
[1359.4s] them up from that land of slavery to
[1361.9s] give them the freedom to be able to
[1364.2s] worship them. When God instituted the
[1366.7s] Passover lamb, I just want uh us to
[1369.4s] break down how Christ is the
[1371.4s] representation of that Passover lamb.
[1373.7s] How how is Christ the representation of
[1376.2s] the Passover lamb? Brother Raphael,
[1378.5s] indeed. Um we see Christ himself is uh
[1382.9s] talked about as being the lamb uh as a
[1386.3s] lamb generally without blemish. M indeed
[1389.9s] uh in John 1 and verse 29 is that uh
[1393.1s] reference where John the Baptist when
[1395.0s] he's first seeing Christ you know
[1397.4s] outside of family I think maybe get
[1399.6s] togethers as he as he started his
[1401.9s] ministry he says behold the lamb of God
[1404.9s] who takes away the sins of the world and
[1407.7s] Peter writes in first Peter 1 verse 18-
[1411.8s] 19 uh and he says that we were redeemed
[1416.0s] with the precious blood of Christ as a
[1418.6s] lamb without blemish or defect. And so
[1421.5s] we see the same way during the Passover
[1424.5s] the the children of Israel slaughtered a
[1426.6s] lamb and they put the door uh they put
[1428.8s] the blood on the doorposts. Similarly
[1431.7s] those who uh believe in Christ, those
[1435.2s] who believe in Christ uh find salvation.
[1439.0s] They find uh the angel of death, the
[1441.3s] condemnation or that this that the wages
[1443.7s] of sin is death. Then they find that sin
[1446.5s] is no longer with them and therefore
[1447.6s] they the wages have been paid by Christ
[1449.9s] because he died. And similarly even
[1452.0s] Christ's crucifixion something
[1453.9s] significant is that it it happened
[1455.4s] during what? During the Passover almost
[1457.7s] Christ himself embodying even by virtue
[1460.1s] of that veil in the temple splitting
[1461.9s] into two. It was almost Christ saying
[1463.9s] this whole Passover system this whole
[1465.7s] thing has been finished. Amen. He is the
[1468.5s] lamb and he has died. And what we need
[1471.0s] to do is simply depend on the merits of
[1474.1s] his blood. Christ our Passover. Christ
[1477.4s] our Passover. You know, in the Bible,
[1480.4s] um, it tells us, I I found this
[1482.4s] interesting when it was pointed out in
[1484.2s] the lesson that we know that the
[1486.3s] Passover lamb was required to be without
[1489.3s] spot and without blemish just like our
[1492.2s] savior who was a man holy and who was a
[1496.1s] man holy because he had not sin. He was
[1498.8s] sinless and he carried with him the
[1501.4s] divinity. So, we had God dying on behalf
[1505.1s] of man. in the book of First Peter.
[1507.6s] Allow me to turn there to just point out
[1510.1s] something that is very powerful and has
[1512.8s] been an encouragement for me over the
[1515.2s] years. And I I hope it will um encourage
[1517.8s] you as well about how powerful was the
[1522.0s] blood of Christ versus that of bulls and
[1526.2s] goats or rams that they brought to the
[1529.5s] sacrifice every year. First Peter
[1532.2s] chapter 1 verse 18. Um 1 Peter chapter 1
[1535.7s] verse8 the Bible says please read first
[1538.6s] Peter 1:18 says for as much as ye know
[1540.9s] that you are not redeemed with
[1542.9s] corruptible things as silver and gold
[1545.1s] from your vain conversation are received
[1547.6s] by tradition from your fathers but with
[1549.7s] the precious blood of Christ as of a
[1551.8s] lamb without blemish and without spot.
[1553.8s] You see the Bible says that we have not
[1556.1s] been redeemed not by the blood of bulls,
[1558.7s] not the by the blood of goats, not by
[1560.7s] that the things that perish but by
[1562.7s] something very precious. And then he
[1564.9s] says we have been redeemed from our evil
[1567.4s] conversation, our evil habits, our evil
[1570.2s] characters. You know there are some
[1571.4s] people who imagine, oh my goodness,
[1573.5s] maybe I have inherited things from my
[1575.8s] forefathers. Maybe that it says even
[1578.2s] those sins you have reduced from this
[1581.0s] generational curses as you know there
[1583.1s] are people who believe that oh there are
[1584.7s] generational cares that run in my
[1587.2s] family. It says even those things that
[1589.9s] are carried over from your forefathers I
[1593.0s] have redeemed you from them not by the
[1595.2s] blood of bulls not by the blood of goats
[1597.8s] by the by the precious blood of Christ
[1600.4s] Jesus. Actually, it is high time that we
[1602.8s] stopped um saying that we need to go
[1604.8s] somewhere and break a generational
[1606.9s] curse. We need to go somewhere and have
[1608.8s] someone pray for us or offer a
[1610.7s] sacrifice. The sacrifice in Christ Jesus
[1614.3s] has already been offered for us. And it
[1617.4s] is sufficient. It is sufficient. You
[1619.7s] don't have to believe this. If you
[1621.4s] believe it, you give the devil power
[1623.6s] over your life. You give the devil power
[1626.3s] over your life. and and and Christ as
[1629.2s] the Passover lamb. Um my um husband
[1632.6s] kindly just take us through this uh how
[1635.7s] Jesus interaction with the temple. Jesus
[1639.3s] interaction with the temple. Thank you.
[1641.5s] The Wednesday part actually takes us
[1643.0s] through Jesus interaction with the
[1644.8s] temple. But even before we go to Christ
[1647.6s] um in the temple, we can go to the old
[1650.2s] temple. You know, there was first the
[1652.3s] small tabernacle, the tent that Moses
[1654.4s] had built in the book of Exodus 25. um
[1657.3s] all the way to verse 31, Exodus 25-31
[1660.7s] and then Exodus chapter 36 onwards, you
[1663.8s] find a very detailed description of a
[1665.7s] tent, you know, it's called the
[1667.1s] tabernacle and then later on you find
[1669.9s] Solomon takes that and then he rebuilds
[1672.7s] a much more grand temple, right? And
[1675.8s] what happened to Solomon's temple? We
[1678.2s] know that um in the book of uh 2
[1680.7s] Chronicles chapter 36, the very last
[1683.3s] chapter of 2 Chronicles, you find a
[1685.4s] description of God sending the judgment
[1687.8s] of who? The Babylonians because of the
[1689.8s] sin of Israel. And as a result, the
[1692.0s] temple itself is utterly destroyed. Very
[1694.8s] very unfortunate. And once the 70 years
[1698.0s] are up almost the second last the last
[1699.9s] verse of 2 Chronicles 36, Israel goes
[1703.1s] back to rebuild the temple. Now once
[1706.8s] they're rebuilding the temple in Hagi
[1709.2s] 2:7 to verse 9, you actually find a
[1712.2s] description of some of the individuals
[1714.6s] who it's like this is like a response to
[1717.0s] some of the comments that would have
[1718.6s] arisen right around that time. Hag 2:7:9
[1723.0s] we are told I will shake all nations and
[1726.9s] the desire of nations will come and I
[1729.5s] will fill this house with glory said the
[1731.5s] Lord. The silver is mine and the gold is
[1733.6s] mine said the Lord. The glory of this
[1735.7s] latter house shall be greater than the
[1737.4s] former um said the Lord of hosts. And in
[1740.9s] this place will I give peace say the
[1743.4s] Lord of hosts. Now why did God need to
[1745.6s] say that? Now um what happened is that
[1749.1s] there used to actually be a true
[1751.3s] glorious presence of God. In the f the
[1753.8s] book of first kings chapter 8 verse 10
[1756.1s] to1 11 you actually find a description
[1758.0s] of this thing that is called the shikina
[1760.2s] glory that used to manifest itself as a
[1762.5s] very glorious and bright light um h e
[1766.7s] actually like a cloud that would
[1768.4s] overwhelm everyone who was even present
[1770.5s] within that chamber. First Kings chapter
[1773.0s] 8 reading verse 10 and verse 11 and we
[1777.0s] find it says here and it came to pass
[1779.1s] when the priests were come out of the
[1780.7s] holy place that the cloud filled the
[1783.1s] house of the Lord so that the priest
[1784.8s] could not stand to minister because of
[1786.8s] the cloud for the glory of the Lord had
[1789.4s] filled the house of the Lord. So there
[1791.7s] was actually like almost a physical
[1793.8s] manifestation of the presence of the
[1795.8s] Lord. Yeah. Yes. Like it was so
[1797.5s] glorious, you know. It's like you take
[1798.8s] your back, you know. It's something that
[1800.6s] is physic. It's so palpable. It's it's
[1802.6s] it's like right now in in pitch dark,
[1805.4s] you just find like a shining bright
[1807.1s] light from somewhere in the sky. You
[1808.5s] know, it would even like it has a way of
[1810.4s] even capturing the attention of the
[1812.7s] individuals. But then what happened once
[1815.0s] the temple as I saw as was destroyed
[1817.4s] when the new temple was being rebuilt,
[1819.4s] the people who were rebuilding the
[1820.8s] temple, once they saw how the temple was
[1823.1s] being rebuilt, they began to weep. the
[1824.7s] book of Ezra chapter 3 reading verse 10
[1827.4s] to verse 13 it says when the builders
[1829.7s] had laid the foundation of the temple of
[1831.4s] the Lord and they set the priests um uh
[1834.4s] in the apparel with trumpets and Levites
[1836.6s] to begin to praise verse 11 um and
[1839.6s] praising God because they had
[1841.0s] established the temple verse 12 we we
[1843.8s] are told many of the priests and the
[1846.1s] Levites and the chiefs of the fathers
[1848.1s] who are old men ancient men that had
[1850.8s] seen the first house when they saw the
[1852.9s] foundation of this house that was laid
[1854.4s] before their eyes. What did they do?
[1856.2s] They wept. They wept with a loud voice
[1858.3s] and while others shouted for joy, who
[1860.6s] are the young ones? They were confused.
[1862.3s] Why are you crying? Because this is our
[1864.5s] magnificent
[1866.0s] people are coming back from the
[1867.8s] captivity of Babylon, you know, from
[1869.4s] being slaves. They're coming back and
[1871.2s] they're saying, "This is a nice thing
[1872.3s] that we have." But then the old men who
[1874.6s] had seen the old temple, they were like,
[1876.1s] "Hey, what is this? This is such lower
[1878.6s] lower quality." But then what does the
[1882.0s] book of Hag promise us that the glory of
[1884.6s] this latter temple the temple that they
[1886.2s] were building right there because Hagi
[1887.5s] was one of the prophets that was sent uh
[1890.0s] to oversee the rebuilding of that
[1891.4s] temple. It was a commend it was an
[1893.7s] encouragement. The glory of this temple
[1895.8s] shall far exceed that Lara temple which
[1898.6s] was Solomon's temple which which is even
[1901.0s] considered one of the ancient like one
[1902.8s] of the most glorious ancient buildings.
[1905.0s] And how would the um was the latter
[1907.1s] temple glorious when when the very
[1910.1s] desire of all nations when God himself
[1913.5s] came to manifest and walk up and down in
[1915.9s] the precincts of that temple in in in
[1918.4s] the corridors of those halls even even
[1920.9s] just around the temple that's something
[1922.7s] that had never happened in the old
[1924.3s] temple in the old temple the shikina
[1926.8s] those were manifestations those were
[1928.2s] like almost typifying that God was
[1931.0s] present with Israel you know it was like
[1933.1s] a token a token of Christ's presence of
[1935.9s] of um of God's presence right now go
[1939.0s] Christ himself was present in the temple
[1941.8s] walking up and down teaching giving um
[1944.7s] some form of ministry that was so much
[1947.0s] more glorious in fact it was the true
[1949.1s] fulfillment of God's initial desire of
[1952.4s] the true temple the book of Exodus 25
[1955.4s] verse 89 we are told what that God tells
[1958.6s] Moses let them make me a sanctuary why
[1961.4s] that I might dwell among them that I
[1963.2s] might dwell among And that's precisely
[1965.7s] what that's actually one of Christ's
[1967.5s] name. Matthew chapter 1 vers 23. Yes,
[1970.5s] Emmanuel. It means what? God with us.
[1972.3s] God with us. So it was like Christ in
[1974.5s] the temple is not just a fulfillment of
[1976.7s] the temple's original design, but was
[1979.3s] the the truest representation of of God
[1982.8s] among his people and the truest
[1984.7s] representation of God's true desire to
[1986.7s] actually be with his people. Amen. Amen.
[1989.6s] God with us. My brother, um, how can we
[1992.4s] relate this to the Christian experience
[1994.1s] as an individual myself to seeing the
[1996.6s] glory of the latter temple maybe of the
[1999.1s] of the of the old temple and the glory
[2002.0s] of the latter temple. How can I relate
[2004.1s] it if I look at my Christian experience
[2006.1s] in the past and now as well? I think it
[2009.5s] speaks to us of the almighty power of
[2013.7s] God. There's a song that says, "I sing
[2015.4s] the mighty power of God that created,
[2018.8s] you know, and and and and he can do
[2020.8s] wonderful things." It simply speaks to
[2023.6s] us and tells us that sometimes it's not
[2025.3s] the externals, it's not the structure,
[2028.2s] but it's he who dwells in the structure.
[2031.3s] You see for example uh as they began
[2034.1s] with the tabernacle of Moses and
[2036.0s] eventually it was destroyed then they
[2038.6s] built uh they built Solomon's temple
[2041.1s] which was very magnificent and uh and
[2043.2s] and and and wonderful gold uh shitty
[2046.7s] wood all that all that but then it was
[2048.6s] destroyed under Nebuchadnezzar and then
[2051.3s] eventually now when they were rebuilding
[2052.8s] and there some people were crying but
[2054.8s] yet it is in that same temple that
[2056.8s] Christ walked and taught and so
[2059.0s] similarly my to us in our lives. We may
[2062.2s] have started off very nicely. Maybe as
[2064.1s] pathfinders in the church, we were very
[2066.0s] we were very good people and then
[2067.1s] somewhere along the line as we've
[2068.3s] interacted with people and with society,
[2069.9s] we may have fallen away. Maybe
[2072.1s] earthliness or worldliness has affected
[2074.2s] us in one way or another. Maybe we have
[2076.9s] veered off from uh from our from
[2079.8s] chastity and from purity. But
[2081.8s] nonetheless, sometimes it is a trick of
[2083.9s] the devil to tell us that our former
[2086.5s] selves is our former glory. The pick is
[2089.4s] the past. Yes. You've picked at that
[2091.8s] particular point and having fallen off,
[2094.8s] you cannot make your way back. The
[2097.0s] beautiful thing, the beautiful story of
[2099.6s] the gospel is indeed like that arm that
[2103.7s] is broken when it heals in the in the
[2106.5s] gospel story, the arm becomes even
[2108.2s] stronger than it was without it having
[2110.6s] been broken. In fact, the path of the
[2112.2s] just. Yes. in in in fact so white writon
[2115.0s] says that man's connection with God you
[2118.5s] know man's connection with God is now
[2121.4s] closer than it would have been if man
[2123.8s] had never fallen that's a mystery to me
[2126.1s] as another thing she writes and says
[2127.8s] that in the new heaven and the new earth
[2129.2s] guess the ones who will be closest to
[2130.7s] Christ the ones who had fallen the most
[2134.0s] the ones who were the biggest of worst
[2136.1s] of sinners those will be the ones sit
[2138.3s] closest to him almost there were people
[2140.3s] who sit close to the king are usually
[2141.9s] like we call in the kitchen cabinet, the
[2143.6s] ones who know things before others know
[2145.5s] them. Imagine, behold what manner of
[2148.5s] love. Amen. Amen. Amen. And I think this
[2151.1s] is a very good segue to move on to the
[2153.1s] Thursday part. You know, having looked
[2154.8s] at the sanctuary uh service where God
[2157.8s] met with man, moving on to Solomon's
[2160.3s] temple and then we have now seen Herod's
[2163.7s] temple. Talk to us about the temple we
[2166.9s] have not yet seen. only descriptions or
[2169.7s] even more glory that we are yet to see.
[2173.0s] Indeed. Indeed. Um the Bible speaks
[2176.7s] about instances in which certain
[2178.9s] prophets were given a glimpse of the
[2181.0s] government of God and and of his temple.
[2184.0s] As understanding the sanctuary service
[2186.2s] helps us to to to sort of um visually
[2191.3s] visualize how God's kingdom is and and
[2194.2s] uh and how and how things are arranged,
[2196.6s] you know. And then we also understand
[2198.5s] the plan of salvation. But beyond that
[2201.2s] to be in the very physical presence of
[2204.1s] God must be something and it must be
[2206.0s] significant. We have the example of
[2207.5s] Ezekiel in Ezekiel chapter 1 and verse
[2209.3s] 26. He's able to see the will within a
[2211.4s] will you know. Then we have Isaiah.
[2213.4s] Isaiah also uh is taken in holy vision
[2216.2s] and he sees the Lord and and we notice
[2219.0s] there's certain fundamental elements um
[2222.0s] of of of of how how it is uh and how it
[2227.0s] will be to literally be there in person.
[2229.8s] Amen. to be there in person. And we see
[2232.1s] one of the fundamental things that we
[2233.8s] notice, the first thing that happens
[2236.4s] when they eventually in the presence of
[2238.3s] the holy one is all of them in Isaiah's
[2242.6s] vision, the temple is filled with smoke,
[2245.1s] you know, and and and the saraphim uh
[2248.0s] the angels there, they proclaim what?
[2250.7s] They proclaim the holiness of God. The
[2253.4s] first things, the first thing that we
[2255.4s] notice in all these people and the first
[2257.2s] thing that we will also notice in the
[2258.7s] visions of revelation is indeed all of
[2262.2s] heaven is singing holy, holy, holy. We
[2266.3s] speaks about the glory of God which is
[2268.6s] his holiness. The second thing we see
[2271.8s] for example um uh is the next thing
[2276.9s] Isaiah these people see uh that they
[2280.6s] talk about um they cry out about the
[2286.9s] their condition the human condition how
[2289.1s] they are unfit man's unfit nature Bible
[2292.2s] records and says he cries out uh that he
[2295.0s] is a man of what unclean lips unclean
[2298.0s] lips he's a man of unclean lips in
[2300.1s] Isaiah chapter 6 and verse 5 and John
[2302.1s] weeps and uh and and in the vision of
[2304.8s] revelation chapter 5 John and verse4 he
[2307.8s] says indeed there was no man who was
[2310.2s] found who was worthy in the presence of
[2313.0s] God mankind feels his deficiency mankind
[2316.6s] feels his his his his unworthiness and
[2321.1s] we feel and we acknowledge that we are
[2323.8s] utterly unworthy and we need Christ as
[2326.5s] our redeemer I think now now that you
[2328.9s] have mentioned that. Let me just ask my
[2331.5s] uh brother if in the presence of God men
[2335.0s] feel their unworthiness and feel that
[2338.0s] they cannot stand and we can we have
[2340.0s] seen the disposition of very many um uh
[2344.1s] prophets when Christ appears to them or
[2346.4s] even sometimes an angel appears to them.
[2348.9s] How does that inform our worship styles
[2351.9s] before God? Yes, it actually tells us
[2354.6s] that if we become and feel puffed up and
[2357.8s] you know like we are so full of
[2359.1s] ourselves then either we are chasing
[2361.6s] away God or God is not present with us.
[2364.2s] That almost one of the chief parts of
[2366.3s] worship or being in the presence of God
[2368.6s] is appreciating our utter almost our
[2372.2s] closest to nothing like how like how we
[2375.0s] are before God. And the closer we are to
[2377.2s] Christ, the closer we are to God, the
[2379.2s] more likely we are to appreciate just
[2382.0s] how magnificent and wonderful and
[2384.3s] glorious and loving God is and how and
[2387.8s] our uncleanness, how unworthy we really
[2390.3s] are. And are there worship styles we see
[2392.7s] today, contemporary churches or even in
[2395.5s] our churches as Seventh Day Adventist
[2397.6s] that do not show this disposition? I
[2399.9s] would say anything um uh h that would
[2403.2s] exalt man in the presence of God during
[2405.7s] worship especially when God is supposed
[2407.8s] to be the center that one is is an
[2410.6s] unfortunate red flag. It is not that we
[2413.0s] are to take away from people the natural
[2414.9s] gifts God has given them. It is that God
[2417.7s] should be the the ultimate and
[2419.7s] fundamental center of especially worship
[2422.4s] especially when we are coming before God
[2424.0s] for the singular purpose of exalting his
[2426.2s] name and glorifying him. That is
[2428.3s] especially the time when God should be
[2431.2s] glorified. When the glory of man should
[2433.1s] be laid to the dust and any form of
[2435.2s] worship that exalts man, we should be
[2437.1s] suspect and we should keep away from it
[2439.1s] and embrace that which glorifies God.
[2441.0s] Amen. Amen. Brother Rafael, you can
[2442.7s] continue about this heavenly temple and
[2444.8s] what makes it glorious. Indeed. And in
[2447.5s] the vision of Revelation chapter 5, I
[2450.7s] believe it's uh in the setting of the
[2452.2s] seals. Yeah. And they asking who can
[2454.5s] open to a certain extent. Uh I would
[2457.6s] liken this to who can truly manifest and
[2461.4s] who can truly defend the character of
[2464.1s] God. There is nobody. It is only Christ.
[2467.8s] It is only in the light of the cross
[2470.1s] that we see the love of God. And two we
[2473.8s] also see the exceedingly sinful and
[2477.5s] hurtful nature of sin and how we as
[2480.6s] human beings have fallen to the extent
[2483.0s] that there is nothing in and of
[2484.6s] ourselves. You know, no man can defend
[2487.0s] God. It is only Christ who can truly
[2489.7s] stand up and say uh and show us the
[2493.6s] father. He can describe to us the
[2495.9s] character of God. It is only Christ who
[2498.5s] is worthy. We are utterly unworthy
[2501.3s] because uh of our sin. All have fallen
[2505.1s] short of glor of the glory of God. Even
[2507.1s] those people who complain, even those
[2509.8s] people who whine, Bible records when
[2512.3s] eventually Christ shall come. It says
[2514.8s] all heads shall bow and all knees shall
[2518.2s] also do what? Shall bend before God. You
[2520.9s] know all knees shall bend and all beings
[2523.8s] the most proud of pontiffs, the most
[2525.9s] proud, proudest of kings before the
[2528.6s] presence of God. Everybody feels their
[2531.2s] utter unworthiness and only Christ can
[2533.9s] stand and even we can stand only as we
[2537.4s] are hidden in the cross and its shadow.
[2540.8s] Amen. Amen. you know the sanctuary
[2543.2s] temple we had the shakina glory um in
[2547.1s] the um in the Solomon's temple we also
[2550.6s] had the shakina glory in the in Herod's
[2553.8s] temple we had Christ himself walking
[2557.2s] there and and and and and and
[2559.6s] interacting with people every day
[2562.3s] there tells us that that temple was left
[2566.8s] desolate he departed from it the glory
[2569.4s] of that temple indeed disappeared Why?
[2572.5s] Because we are told Christ moved now
[2575.0s] from that temple to the heavenly temple
[2579.0s] and now not just to interact with men
[2581.1s] merely but now to minister there as a
[2585.5s] high priest. I want to point you to the
[2587.4s] work that Christ is doing in the
[2589.4s] heavenly sanctuary. and my um my brother
[2592.3s] Rafael actually speak to speak to us
[2594.7s] about that and the importance of us now
[2597.4s] looking forward to even a more glorious
[2599.8s] temple especially because of the work
[2602.1s] that Christ is doing there. Indeed as
[2604.1s] you see the sanctuary system is a
[2606.2s] fundamental truth and an understanding
[2607.6s] of it is something that we should all
[2608.8s] pursue beyond this lesson. And so we saw
[2612.5s] uh the sacrifice Christ as the lamb
[2614.9s] being sacrificed where here on earth
[2617.1s] here on earth which tells us that the
[2619.1s] earth is the outer court and then
[2621.4s] there's the tabernacle wherein is host
[2623.7s] the holy place and the most holy place
[2627.0s] and so when Christ himself uh is um is
[2630.8s] living in uh is preparing his disciples
[2633.1s] for his death and resurrection he tells
[2635.6s] his disciples in John 14 verse 1-6 he
[2638.9s] tells them let not your hearts be
[2640.2s] troubled troubled he believe in God
[2642.6s] believe believe also in me and then he
[2644.4s] says in my father's house that's
[2647.0s] significant it's one house but then this
[2649.5s] house has many mansions it's an
[2651.2s] interesting uh concept is it a gated
[2654.4s] community what is it but he says in his
[2657.1s] father's house are many mansions a house
[2659.2s] with mansions but I digress then he says
[2662.0s] if it were not so I would have told you
[2664.2s] but then he says I'm going to prepare a
[2667.2s] place for you and if I go and prepare a
[2669.3s] place for you I will come again. So it
[2671.8s] tells us that Christ is not going there
[2673.9s] building. They're not building, you
[2675.5s] know, they're not uh measuring rooms and
[2677.7s] saying, "Oh, this and that." The
[2679.0s] mansions were there, but Christ is has
[2681.5s] said he has gone there to prepare a
[2683.8s] place. Christ is interceding on our
[2686.7s] behalf. Christ is ministering. There's a
[2689.2s] special work that he's doing. And this
[2691.0s] special work is to prepare a place for
[2694.1s] us. Christ is there in and he moved at
[2698.6s] his resurrection. He moved into the holy
[2701.0s] place. Then in the times of the end when
[2704.2s] that book was opened as we referred we
[2706.2s] referred to uh in uh in in in Daniel
[2708.8s] chapter 12 and in revelation chapter 10
[2711.0s] in the previous lesson in the in the
[2713.0s] times of from 1844 a study which uh you
[2717.2s] all of us can can look at. We see uh in
[2721.0s] prophetic vision we understand that
[2723.2s] Christ moved where from the holy place
[2726.2s] into the most holy place where now he's
[2729.2s] doing the it is we are in the
[2731.2s] antityypical day of atonement one of the
[2733.4s] sanctuary services and there Christ is
[2736.0s] once again still doing what interceding
[2738.8s] interceding for us preparing a place
[2741.6s] cleansing the books of records cleansing
[2744.7s] and and finalizing that final role uh
[2748.2s] that will be called up yonder when the
[2750.2s] trumpet of the lord shall sound. Amen.
[2752.2s] You know the bible tells us that that
[2754.2s] temple where Christ is ministering today
[2757.6s] one day it shall come down. We are told
[2760.3s] that the temple of God will be among men
[2763.2s] and God himself will dwell with them.
[2767.0s] Familiarize yourself. Make yourself
[2769.7s] acquaint yourself with the work of
[2771.8s] Christ in the heavenly sanctuary.
[2773.6s] Appoint yourself with that work because
[2775.7s] that is the final work that is going to
[2778.3s] determine your destiny. It is what is
[2781.1s] going to determine who are gods and who
[2783.9s] are not gods. With that I want my
[2787.0s] brothers to um summarize this lesson and
[2790.8s] give us the main key takeaways from this
[2793.8s] lesson that we have gone through. I'll
[2795.8s] start with you uh my brother. Uh thank
[2797.9s] you so much. So I think for me uh the
[2800.8s] most important um lesson I think I began
[2803.6s] saying that the sacrifice and the cross
[2806.1s] the most important lesson um that the
[2808.9s] the Bible gives us it is it's almost
[2810.8s] like a it's like a scarlet thread that
[2813.4s] that is woven all throughout the
[2815.4s] scriptures all throughout the story that
[2817.8s] God is giving us of how he wants to save
[2820.2s] his people. I want us to meditate upon
[2823.2s] this idea of the sanctuary of the cross
[2825.4s] of Jesus Christ of the character of the
[2827.4s] individual upon um who was set upon that
[2830.6s] cross that was none other than God
[2832.7s] himself. God who was manifest in the
[2835.5s] flesh. Jesus Christ who loved us so
[2837.8s] dearly that he um would would would
[2841.5s] sacrifice his own life that we might be
[2844.1s] saved and that we might um live a fresh
[2846.3s] and new in and um in everlasting joy. I
[2849.7s] pray that we can appreciate and and and
[2852.1s] and accept and receive this gift and
[2854.8s] hold on to it and cherish it greatly.
[2857.0s] Meditate on the idea of the cross of
[2859.2s] Jesus Christ. Amen. Amen. Meditate on
[2862.2s] the idea of the cross of Christ Jesus.
[2864.8s] Amen. In the prophetic vision, both
[2868.8s] Ezekiel, Isaiah as well as John say in
[2873.5s] heaven, they just cry holy, holy, holy.
[2876.6s] And so when it comes to our salvation,
[2879.7s] similarly, it's
[2881.4s] only holiness. The standard is still
[2884.7s] holiness, a lamb without blemish.
[2888.2s] Christ, a priest who is incorruptible.
[2891.0s] We live in a time in which even judges
[2893.8s] can be convicted. You see, even the ones
[2896.3s] who sit in powers giving are equally
[2900.0s] corrupted. But we find in Christ as our
[2903.4s] minister, as our high priest, one who is
[2906.9s] equally holy. We find holiness as a as a
[2911.0s] required as a requirement throughout.
[2913.1s] Holy, holy, holy. And Christ fulfills
[2914.9s] it. And so in coming to Christ, then we
[2918.6s] find uh ourselves in the arms of one who
[2922.6s] can truly save to the uttermost. Amen.
[2925.6s] He's the lamb. Then he also becomes a
[2928.6s] priest. Then he also becomes the judge
[2931.5s] and our intercessor, our lawyer and also
[2935.0s] our judge. Such a wonderful such a
[2937.7s] wonderful picture, such a wonderful and
[2939.9s] an encouraging um encouraging message to
[2942.7s] each and every single one of us. It's my
[2944.6s] prayer and my desire that beyond this
[2946.9s] lesson we will study the sanctuary and
[2949.1s] there indeed we'll see that thy way oh
[2951.3s] Lord is in the sanctuary. Amen. Amen.
[2954.6s] You know last week we studied about
[2956.6s] nations part two and we were looking at
[2959.1s] how these nations degraded over time
[2962.8s] that one the nation that came after the
[2965.2s] other was weaker than the previous
[2967.0s] nation. But when we've looked at the
[2969.2s] temples they they grow in glory. The the
[2973.1s] following temple is more glorious than
[2975.8s] the former. The latter is more glorious
[2978.1s] until we culminate at the glorious
[2981.5s] temple in heaven. It is my desire that
[2984.4s] you will have an opportunity to see that
[2986.6s] temple. The descriptions we have been
[2988.3s] given here are not even adequate to
[2991.2s] describe it. The Bible says, "No, I had
[2994.1s] indeed seen nor ear had nor the nor not
[2998.0s] even um a fit description been given of
[3001.8s] those things which the Lord has prepared
[3004.4s] for us. God has prepared u mighty and
[3008.2s] glorious things for you. My desire is
[3010.4s] that you will be there. But how will you
[3012.1s] be there? By acquainting yourself with
[3014.8s] God. Make God your friend. You know um
[3019.5s] the Bible the Bible does say that we are
[3022.6s] in a time of judgment today. We are
[3025.6s] being judged. But our friend as my
[3027.9s] brother Raphael says he is judging us.
[3030.6s] Acquaint yourself with that judge. The
[3033.2s] last takeaway I want to give to you is
[3035.3s] that you know the question we began with
[3038.4s] in the book of Revelation chapter 5. It
[3040.7s] started by saying, "Who is worthy? Who
[3043.7s] is worthy to open the scroll?" My
[3046.1s] brother spoke about it, but this is also
[3048.2s] how I see it. It's as though they asked,
[3050.4s] "Who has the right to stand on behalf of
[3054.6s] men?" And they do not represent a harsh
[3057.4s] king. They do not represent someone who
[3060.3s] has fought battles, even though indeed
[3062.7s] he has. They do not represent um um
[3066.2s] someone who who who wants to um show his
[3069.8s] his authority and his power. They say
[3072.5s] the person worthy to stand on behalf of
[3075.0s] men of sinful men and judge them is a
[3078.8s] lamb. A little meek, quiet, innocent
[3084.0s] lamb is the only one that has the right
[3086.8s] to judge you. How amazing is that that
[3089.2s] the one who died for you today stands to
[3092.2s] judge you? Acquaint yourself with him.
[3095.3s] Would you kindly um pray with us as we
[3098.1s] as we close today? Okay, let's pray.
[3101.6s] Heavenly Father, we thank you so much uh
[3103.8s] that you have carried us through this
[3105.3s] study, this um exceedingly important
[3107.8s] study of uh the sacrifice. We have seen
[3111.1s] many facets, many angles of this
[3113.9s] discussion, but the most important thing
[3116.8s] uh I pray that you may impress upon our
[3118.5s] hearts is Jesus Christ who upon the
[3120.8s] cross um died for our sins. I pray that
[3123.8s] you may help us meditate upon this idea
[3126.3s] that you may impress it most strongly
[3128.0s] upon our hearts and our minds that we
[3130.3s] receiving this truth might be saved in
[3133.0s] Jesus name I pray. Amen. Amen. Amen.
[3135.0s] Amen. Thank you.
