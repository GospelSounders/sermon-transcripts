FULL TRANSCRIPT:
Happy Sabbath. We are glad that you're joining us this Sabbath morning. Today we are having the holy communion and so we welcome you to participate in it. It is a a remembrance of what our Lord did for us on the cross. Now this morning before we begin our lesson study, I would like for us to offer a prayer and then delve into it. Let's pray. Our father and our God who lives in heaven. Father, we thank you for this morning. Thank you for giving us this opportunity and chance to study your word and to have this interaction. We are praying for the power of the Holy Spirit that he may be our guide to guide us as we start and give us understanding of your world to build our faith in you. For we have prayed in Jesus name. Amen. So this morning I'm joined by my brothers. Uh I would like for each one of you to introduce yourself. We're starting from the left. My name is Enongo Rafa Jamis. It's a pleasure to be here. Yes. Happy Sabbath. My name is Daniel Ketur. I am very glad to be with you this morning. Praise the Lord. My name is Chris Paulen Begera. I'm glad to be here. Thank you. Uh and I am Christianu. I am glad that you joined us. Now we are into this uh journey Exodus the journey to the promised land. This is the lesson that we are studying for this quarter. We just want to see the story of the Israelites through the lenses of Moses. And as we had said that this is the gospel actually the gospel of Jesus Christ through the lenses of Moses and the story of the Israelites. Now uh last week we were looking at oppression, the background and the birth of Moses and we discovered several uh interesting facts there that will carry us through as we continue this very important study. Now for this uh week we are looking at the burning bush. I know this is u it's an interesting story. There are people who actually don't believe that it happened but the Bible as we believe it's true. there was a burning bush. And so this is what we want to uh have a discussion on this morning. And we welcome you to join in with us. Uh let's read uh our memory text. That's the book of Exodus 3. Exodus 3:7 and 8. Then the Lord said, "I have observed the misery of my people in Egypt, and I've heard them crying out because of their oppressors, and I know about their sufferings. I have come down to rescue them from the power of the Egyptians and to bring them from that land to a good and specious land, a land flowing with milk and honey, the territory of the Canaanites, the Hittites, the Amorites, the Perizzites, and the Heivites and the Jebusites. This it's a powerful um these are powerful verses. It is the Lord saying, "I have surely seen and now I have come. I have known their sorrow." The Lord can relate to how these people are feeling and he's saying now I've come to sort it out. The right time to sort it out is now. And so as we delve into the burning bush, Moses is approaching. He's in the in the wilderness and and he's approaching and he's seeing, oh, this is a very interesting phenomenon. I haven't seen this before. There's this bush that is burning, but it is not being consumed. And so he comes closer to look at it to find out why is it like that. And so the writer of this week's lesson has written important words here that I would like to read a word for word. It says God's God's call to us will often change the direction of our lives. However, if we follow that call, then we discover that God's path is always the best route for us. Sometimes at first it is not easy to accept God's call. Uh this is a fact. Sometimes you're not very sure. However, in that such is the case with Moses. When he approached the bush, he was like, "Is it true? Let me see what's happening." In the case of Moses and his call by God, which specifically began at the encounter with the Lord at the burning bush. Although Moses may or may not have known about the laws of combustion, he knew that what he was seeing was a miracle and it certainly caught his attention. It was interesting. And so he moves forward to find out what is happening. So I want to to to to allow the panelists to put in put in your input. The burning bush. What interesting phenomenon are we picking from it? We can start from uh my right side. Thank you so much. Um as you see here, Moses has been we started with the history of Moses where he comes from. He is uh his uh his uh his parents the fact that he was thrown into uh the river Jordan due to the the what the pharaoh had given as as a as a law when they wanted to destroy all the males the male children of the Hebrews and then now he is he has gone into the king's courtyard he has uh fled after killing one of with the Egyptians and now he is he has been in the desert for another 40 years. The the second phase of the 40 years is coming to an end. Now we find Moses as basically a shepherd. He is he is at the point where his life is not where he as he comes into the desert. He he was not the same person he is at this point. And interesting enough, it is it seems that God has taught him lessons that can only be taught in that context of of being of the especially the work he's doing as a shepherd. And I think that's where I want to bring out the the the the attitude Moses comes with and where God meets him at this point. It seems like God has understood that my servant Moses is finally ready to do the work as I would have it do. He's a shepherd. That's the same way David was a shepherd. The same way Christ himself when he comes into the earth, he he he comes forth as as a shepherd. And this is very very important that God depicts himself to him in the form of a burning bush. uh as as so that he can and Moses interestingly enough uh as you have as you have read in the introduction he did not maybe un understand what exist what was happening in the fullest context but he approaches the area I'm I'm thinking like if it was Moses the Egyptian who had been under the Egyptian mindset when he first came into the into into if he had come into this context he would have not had a similar approach it seems like it is with almost awe that he's coming into this his heart is not the same I think for me one of the pick the points I'm picking here is that Moses as the shepherd in Exodus chapter 3 is not Moses who comes out of Egypt he has been completely transformed and God is now ready to use his servant as he approaches uh him in the burning bush. Thank you. I I think um the the burning bush is an interesting um way the Lord uses this burning bush to catch the attention of Moses. So you can imagine Moses is in the highlands of Si and then he's his attention is caught by a bush of flame. It is burning but it is not consumed. So he says you know what I will go and investigate. I I want to find a reason uh an explanation as to why this bush is burning but it is not consumed. But as he goes to investigate, he not only finds the reason why, but he meets his caller. He meets God and actually he finds his calling. So this is an interesting um you know lesson in that uh there may be a burning bush in your life right now. There may be a a something that calls your attention. You know, how often do we look for reasons and often we find people uh you know, I I wanted this drama in my life to end but I found God or all I ever wanted was a was a spouse but I found God. So God does not play favorites in his dealing with people. He will often use the burning bushes in our lives to call our attention. And uh we will discover uh not only reasons but the one who calls us and he will give us uh our calling. You know that that that burning bush uh still burns today. Actually uh it is it is it is the bush that needed the fire in order to attract attention. It is not the fire that needed the bush. So the bush still burns. God is still in the business of drawing his children in and then g investing them with purpose and calling in their lives. Amen. I think it's important to um understand as Chris has mentioned to us that Moses has been in the wilderness for 40 years. He now has a wife and two children. He's developing and to certain extent I think Moses was um becoming comfortable. He was now in a comfort zone. And so the burning bush uh sort of uh uh sets him a fire brings purpose and renewed purp and and and Kur and the burning bush also is is is is typifi uh almost um it shows us that God uses the things that are in our environment. A bush is something that you can come across in the wilderness. And in the wilderness, a bush is something that is significant that you that will attract your attention. More so, a burning bush. Perhaps in the heat of the desert, a shepherd will look for even even even animals will look for a bush to shelter, you know. But then lo and behold, here is one that is burning. Here is one that is burning. And so it speaks to us also those of us who have hit uh deadlocks, those of us who perhaps have hit um um a sort of a crisis and and we are in we're in a comfort zone or we don't really know what next. Then it calls upon us to go forth to go forth and indeed have God set our bushes on fire. You see, and the beauty of this fire is that it doesn't it doesn't consume the bush. Even uh like Israel being under persecution, yet God still preserving them. And so even in our in our in our situations, in our instances where we are confused, ours is simply to to to seek the Lord and he truly can be able to set our bushes on fire. Another lesson that we also learn about Moses during this 40 years is that Moses was in as much as he was comfortable, Moses was still the child of God. Moses was still receiving an education from God. It is during this time that inspiration tells us from the wonderful book Patriarchs and Prophets page 251 that Moses now writes to us these wonderful books that tell us about the great controversy, the book of Genesis and the book of Job. Moses was already in a relationship with God. It was already It's simply telling us that sometimes even if you may be a Christian and relationship with God, but there's a a time comes in which God wants to set you on fire. You can still be in a comfort zone even in service. Moses now when God wants him to take it up a notch now to go for mission for a purpose not simply to write books not simply to tell of of of of the fall but rather to to write the to write the to write the future now he's he's he's written about the past but now it's time to go forward and to bring God's people home to write the next chapter and therefore God meets him there at the burning bush to sort of give him that fire that fuel that energy that will be able to help him to go to the next chapter to the next phase in life. Thank you uh my brother. So then it took Moses 80 years you can imagine 80 years before God deemed him ready and then he presents himself in a burning bush so that he gets his attention. And so you could be wondering why are my things not going. Maybe you are yet to meet the burning bush so that you can come to that realization. uh Kur um the angel of the Lord. Yeah. Um you know when um when now Moses approaches uh the bush, there is a voice that calls out Moses, Moses. And by the way, uh this voice would later on be very familiar in the history of God's children. There was a voice perhaps in the New Testament. I don't know if you remember Martha Martha or there was another voice um um in in in in in the Bible calling people to various tasks and mission. And the voice that speaks out of this burning v bush is the voice of the angel of the Lord. Um the book of Genesis chapter uh 22 verse 11 also speaks with this specific phrase the angel of the Lord. Okay. Uh uh Genesis 22 11. But the angel of the Lord called to him from heaven and said Abraham Abraham. So it's it's like a a pattern. Moses, Moses, Abraham, Abraham. It is as if to implant the seed that this is a very specific character in the Bible. So this angel of the Lord is a title and it depicts none other than the person Jesus Christ. So actually before he was incarnate, he appeared to uh many you know on many occasions as the angel of the Lord. We've just seen in Genesis 22 he appears to uh Abraham. He appears to Gideon. Uh and actually the the the term angel simply means messenger. All right? So uh it's it's and and the person who appears now to speak to Moses is Jesus who actually is God's messenger and he communicates the father's word to us. So the voice that speaks out of the bush is the voice of our Lord and Savior Jesus before he is incarnate. And he speaks with an an acquaintance or rather he speaks in a way that shows that he understands and he has heard the groaning cry of his children and he speaks to Moses in a very intimate way. He actually goes ahead to introduce himself as something or someone that I think Chrisal would want to talk about. Sure. Uh Chris, tell us tell us this one. Yes. Um God introduces himself now to Moses and uh he says in uh Exodus chapter 3 verse 12 13-22 we see and Moses said unto God behold I have I when I come to the children of Israel and say to them the God of their fathers has sent me unto them and they shall say to me what is his name. What shall I say unto them? Um, this is the first of the I don't want to preempt but the first of the reasons Moses gives in in in in trying to bring himself out of this situation out of the calling that God has given to him. But God God first of all introduces himself as the God of Jacob, the God of Abraham, Jacob and um Isaac and he is endearing himself. And then he says that and God said unto Moses verse 14, I am that I am has said thus shall thou say unto the children of Israel, I am hath sent me unto you. And God goes on first of all the first thing that comes onto onto my mind is God presents himself as he is the selfexistence God. I am whom I am. The lesson rather says that that literally means I will be who I will be. God is God is selfexistence as it were. It means that God is eternal. He is transcendent. He is he is ex his existence is great and beyond our imaginations. But the proper English name we find there is the name Yahweh which is quite an endearing name for God. And and and it's interesting that God introduces himself in with this term the Yahweh. I am Yahweh. And there are four points that I found I I see as God is having this conversation with Moses. The first thing that is that he is Yahweh depicts God as being very relational. He understands I I have first of all when in the memory text you go comes forth and he says that I have heard their cries. I have seen and now I have come. It seems that God is very intimately connected with the situations of his people. In fact, was one of the key the key lines I saw there was that he knows their suffering. verse 7. He knows. He knows. And this was not simply God saying that I theoretically know it. Because last week when we were discussing the lesson, we saw that God in Isaiah 63:9 says that in all their afflictions, he was afflicted. God personally felt the pain because he was one with his people. He's a relational God. So in verse seven when God says I know the suffering he is speaking as Yahweh. He understands what his people are going through. First the second point we the the the other aspect that I saw that depict God's uh God's identity as Yahweh his title as Yahweh he in which is actually a very compassionate and empathetic a very compassionate term is in verse 8 of uh Exodus chapter 3 where we see God depicts himself to Moses and he says that I have and I am come down to deliver. God does not simply know but he wants to get involved. He's compassionate and he's now empathetic. He's not just sympathetic about the situation of his people. He's empathetic. He wants to be involved in this situation. He wants to do something about the situation. And that's that's who Yahweh is. And lastly, the other point I saw is that we have already touched on it is that that shows him as a personal God is that he speaks personally about the experience of Abraham, Jacob and Isaac. And the relation he had with each of these individual was unique in their own ways in how they approached and how they related to God. Remember, it is this same relation that the children of Israel could never shake off of their identity as a corporate nation. In John chapter 8, when Christ is having a confrontation with the Pharisees, actually this is brought up as an argument against against Christ. When Christ tells him that um when they tell them that we are the children of Abraham, we are not born of fornication. and Abra uh and Christ tells them that before Abraham was I am like this idea of the God of Abraham was a very fundamental um argument in the hearts of the children of Israel. It was a it was a relationship they valued dearly. And that's where God comes to them and says, "I'm the God of Abraham. I'm the God of Isaac. I'm the God of Jacob. And it was this same argument in if you read Exodus 32, chapter 32, when the children of Israel have messed up the one of the arguments Moses himself uses in his prayer to appeal to God to stay the hand of destruction so that he could not destroy the children of Israel. Says that I'm the God of God. You are the God of Jacob. You are the God of Abraham. How can you destroy your children whom you have brought out of the land of Egypt? An endearing name, Yahweh. That is what God calls himself and that is who he is to us. God is personal. Though God create God created all of us corporately, but God knows us individually in our unique situations. God understands your situation. Our brothers and sisters online, God understands our situation. He understands your personal situation. Even though you are together in a family, God knows you individually what you are going through. And he as in verse 8, we're saying he has compassion. He wants to come and address that situation. Lastly, in and and and as as as as we read also through that, God also proclaims that name as a foundation for salvation. In Joel chapter 2:32, we say that everyone who calls upon the name of the Lord, upon the name Yahweh will, it's not if, it is will be saved. And I think that is that is comforting. If you call on the name of Yahweh, you will be saved. Salvation is in there's no other name given among men whereby we may be saved. Yahweh. Amen. Amen. Indeed, the name of the Lord is a strong tower. The Russia run to it and is safe. Now, the challenge that I'm posing to you is in what ways have you in your own life experienced that closeness and intimacy? Can you per chance say the god of Christine or the god of kitur can he be your god? It is a a choice that you can make. Now Rafael there are certain excuses that we are seeing. Can we talk about these excuses and uh share them with our brothers? Indeed. I think it's a it's a powerful um it's a powerful um powerful lesson that we are looking at the burning bush. A lot of things are happening at this at this bush. I'd like us to just reflect even on our our memory text, even as we're looking at the excuses that Moses is making. Uh verses 3 and seven, verses 7 and 8 of chapter 3, the Lord says, "I have surely seen the affliction of my people which are in Egypt. I have heard their cry by reason of their task masters. I know their sorrows." There are three words which are which are powerful to me. He says he they are seen they are heard and they are known. I think if ever there's something that men desire even in any relationship whether whatever nature whether romantic or otherwise it is to be seen to be heard and to be known fully seen fully heard fully known. So God is coming to Moses and he's telling him I have seen these people. I have heard them. I know their issues and lo and behold, I want you I want you to go and speak for me. I want you to go and speak for me and speak to the highest office in the land to Pharaoh himself. You know, it's akin to speaking to the to the to the to the leader of what is known as the free world or the superpower or the superpowers of this world in our day and our age. You uh who is a fugitive. you who perhaps has been living in your comfort zone and then God comes with a message that sets you on fire and then he says go forth in a world in which many of us uh have dreams some of us are some dreams have consumed people to the extent that they have killed them people have died but here comes a fire that God sets in in our souls to the extent that he says this fire consumes but the bush the bush is not consumed the fire. It has all all all the attributes of fire, all the positives of fire. In fact, the reason why we hate fire, we say fire is a good what? He's a good servant but a bad master is because what? The fire consumes. But here comes God with a fire that provides warmth, a fire that provides all the benefits, the light and everything, but doesn't consume the bush. But like many of us, Moses is um is comfortable in his uh in his comfort zone. And he presents four excuses. The first one is found in Exodus 3 and verse 11. In Exodus 3 and:1, Moses speaks and says what? Who am I that I should go unto Pharaoh and that I should bring forth the children of Israel out of Egypt? Moses feels unworthy and incapable of such a huge task. I think the the the the the the experience of Moses is not new to all of us. Most of us have this this in our day and age we would call it what imposter syndrome. I don't know whether any of us have ever had imposter syndrome. you know uh suddenly you are the one who is in charge in a particular area whether in the past it has always been your father or somebody there's always be people people have always there's always been somebody to refer to there's always been somebody to look up to but then suddenly you look up and you hear God saying you you're the one to lead now it's it's your time to pick up and in fact even the way God begins he says as I was with Abraham you know he's he's telling you now it's your time your name is going to be mentioned together with those greats, those those children, those those men and women, those patriarchs of faith. And God is telling him, "Now is your time." But then he makes an excuse and he says, "What? I am not worthy. Who am I? Who am I? Just a a fugitive, you know. I'm just trying to raise my boys and my family. I'm just I want a I'm just an author. I'm just written Genesis and and Job, you know. I'm just a I'm not qualified for this." We see a Moses who has changed from who he was initially when he was presumptuous. God has taken him through that school of humility and to the extent now Moses is afraid. Moses is afraid. But what is God's response? God comes in verse 12 and he says what? Certainly I will do what? I will be with you. I will be with you. In the same way in which he says he he has seen he has heard and he knows. Similarly, he has seen Moses. He has heard him and he knows him and therefore he's giving him this task. Even for us today, I think the lesson for us today when God opens up opportunities, divine appointments, let us not be afraid. Let us simply trust in this same God who has given us this opportunities, who has opened for us these windows, these doors that he will maintain us in those rooms. He will maintain us through those opportunities. Let us indeed know and claim that promise that he says certainly he will be with us as as Chris has also told us that everyone who calls on the name of the lord will be what will be saved let us call upon him even when the door of opportunity knocks the second time now Moses now comes he doesn't run out of excuses you know uh when you don't want to do something you can I can personally I can give you a list uh Moses just made for me I can make for you I can make for you some longer ones including having a flu or uh or or this or that or the other. He asks now in chapter 3 and verse 13 now he says what shall I say unto them? You know what shall I say unto them? Moses is is is is lacking words. In fact the Bible later on records that if somebody who is recorded as being the meakest of men, it is who? It is Moses through this education, this time that he has had. And so he fears that the people won't believe or accept his message without what as being authoritative and as being and as being uh divinely appointed and anointed. So he says, "What shall I say to these people? I have nothing to say to these people, you know, uh what shall I say when I come to them? The God of your fathers has sent me unto you and they shall say to me, what is his name? And what shall I say unto them? I'm not educated. You know I lack knowledge. But then what does God say? God says to him, go and tell them as Chris has highlighted to us, I am that I am. Say unto them that I am has sent you. Just go and tell them I don't know a lot. You know, I don't know the nitty-g gritties, but God has said it because there is power in the name of the Lord. There is power in the word of the Lord. And so Moses decides that he's going, God simply says, "You don't really need to know a lot. Just know the great I am has sent you. Tell them I have sent you." You know, sometimes when you when somebody asks you questions and you've been sent by a higher power, you tell them don't question me. I'm just don't shoot the messenger. That's why you say don't shoot the messenger. We say uh refer refer you know I'm just a messenger. The boss has said this and and it it needs it needs to it needs to happen. And thirdly, now he comes once again. That's not enough. Now he says in Exodus 4:1, "Behold, but behold, they will not believe me, nor hearken unto my voice." These people, I know them. Even uh even when I was coming in my power as Pharaoh's as Pharaoh's son to liberate them, they refused. They said, "Who who has made you a prince or a judge amongst us?" They will not believe me, nor will they listen to my voice. He doubts that God that the people will believe um that he was sent by God. He doubts the results. And the lesson for all of us here is sometimes when God has given us a task, leave the results to him. I think you just go and execute to your level best. The results are up to him. But God is so merciful and God is so tender. You know, somebody else would have looked for somebody else at this particular point say this guy is not ready. These people are not serious. you know, let's call the next candidate, you know, if if in an interview and you don't you're not answering very well, they're saying perhaps this is not the right fit for this job, you know, and but in this particular case, the employer said you're the man for the job now. You're the one who's who wants to to wiggle out of this appointment. And so eventually God gives him what? From the book of Exodus 4:2-9, God gives Moses three miraculous signs to present not only before before the children of Israel, but also before Pharaoh. One, his staff will turn into a serpent. Two, his hand will become lepous and then he will become healed. And thirdly, that he will be able to do have the ability to do what? To turn water into blood. God when there's when there's one author who writes a poem the hound of heaven that when God is after a man God will will corner you we make this excuse he has got a counter he makes this excuse he's got a counter eventually now he gives him not only three not only one miracle but three a snake a staff turning into a snake a hand that becomes lepous and then gets healed and ultimately water turning into blood and then eventually Actually now Moses says he realizes okay it seems like all these things can happen but this one thing I can say I am not eloquent you know I don't have the voice for this now this one I have gotten him I am not eloquent I am not eloquent in this matter in verse 10 he says I am slow of speech and of a slow tongue you know if God is looking for a mouthpiece you'd wonder you you you'd think that he'd look for the greatest orator you know uh the one the most wonderful uh and authoritative voice and and and powerful the ones that command uh attention. But Moses says, "I am neither of this. I am slow of speech." Perhaps he he he was is kind to look for words for appropriate words. He was slow maybe trying to trying to to to get that tongue. And then even says that even his tongue is slow. So he's saying he has a he has both a mental and a physical disability. You know, my tongue is also heavy. It's a bit slow, but also mentally I also am having difficulty processing speech. You know, the area on my brain that that processes speech is not firing uh optimally. And so Moses feels for a fact here now I've gotten the Lord. But what does God say in verses 11 and 12 of chapter um chapter um chapter 4? And the Lord said unto him, "Who hath made man's mouth? Or who maketh the dumb or the deaf, the seeing or the blind? Have I not the Lord?" Verse 12, he says, "Now therefore, go and I will be with your mouth and teach you what you shall say." God is simply telling Moses, you go what to say there, what to do there. I will I will I will be able to to do it for you. you know, I'll be able to do it for you. And uh eventually uh we see all the excuses that we can ever present before God for us not to do the work of God. Uh eventually we'll find we'll find no place no place. One one somebody else said those whom God appoints he does what he empowers. If God is the one who's called you he will qualify you for that. You know, you may be the most unqualified person, but God qualifies the called. Ultimately, he makes another excuse, which is a fifth excuse some some would say in which in which he says in verse 13, eventually he says, "Oh Lord, my lord, send I pray thee by the hand of him whom thou wilt will send." Says, "Please choose somebody else." You know, I agree with you. This is an important matter, but choose somebody else. you know um but eventually God gets angry. We find God get angry in verse 14 and the anger of the Lord and eventually even in his anger God shows mercy. God shows consideration and says okay go I've prepared your brother Aaron and he will help you to speak uh on on uh to be your mouthpiece on his behalf. But God wanted to deal with Moses. And so these excuses simply simply show us u um the mindset of Moses. A man uh who is running away from his mission. A man that is who is comfortable in his comfort zone and a God who wants to set his life on fire literally but his life will not be consumed. In fact, it will become even more richer and his life will equally also bless others. And he is mentioned as one of the greatest of the prophets. So in essence, there is no excuse that you will give. As long as the Lord's hand is on you and you're the chosen one, God will find ways to empower you. I like that statement. I normally refer to it especially when I'm chickening out of my responsibility. If God calls you, he will qualify you. Um we are looking at the circumcision. There's the element of circumcision. Now Moses has been told your brother is going to meet you. But there is this element of circumcision that is cropping up from uh Exodus chapter 4. Uh who wants to go first and talk about it? Um probably uh it's an interesting um uh account here. Um this is Exodus chapter 4. Uh I will read uh from verse um 20 m um all the way through to verse 24. This is now Moses returning to to Egypt. And uh the first thing that he does is to ask for permission from his father-in-law. And then he begins the journey. But on the journey, something surprising uh happens along the way. God wants to kill Moses. And uh this is one of those strange things. Yeah. The Bible says um this I'll read from verse uh 22. Then you shall say to Pharaoh, uh, thus saith the Lord, Israel is my firstborn, and I say to you, let my son go that he may serve me. If you refuse to let him go, behold, I will kill your firstborn son. At a lodging place on the way, the Lord met him and sought to put him to death. Wow, this is interesting. The Lord meets Moses and wants to put him to death. Then Zippora took a flint and cut off the son's foreskin and touched Moses's feet with it and said, "Surely you are a bridegroom of blood to me." So he let him alone. And it was then that she said, "A bridegroom of blood because of the circumcision." Now this is uh something that uh is interesting. There was a command that was given uh to the children of Israel by uh to to Abraham that the children of the circumcision I mean the children of Israel need to be circumci circumcised. The males must be circumcised. This was a covenant relationship that they were entering into with God. And it was required that they should obey. But Moses had failed in this respect. And he was going to become a leader. he was going to and so then how was he going to be a leader of a people leading them after God but not model in his own life the obedience that God requires. And so um God meets him and uh the wife Zippora acts very speedily uh circumcises the boy and Moses is able to uh find safety in that. So he God was trying to say to Moses, you know, um you're going to be placed in a position of great peril. You are going to require the protection of holy angels. But these angels will not protect you. I cannot cover you if you're living in neglect of a known duty which you should have performed. So it is dangerous to live a life of disobedience and willful disobedience and expect the favor and the protection of God. So God calls Moses to obedience and actually that obedience um was a condition of his salvation and it is similar also to us. Uh obedience is not the cause of our salvation but certainly it is a condition to our salvation. I can also jump in there and I think where my brother Kur has just uh say that obedience is uh is is is has to come out in this process of God saving us. It has to be made manifest. It is not indeed we are not saved because we are obedient. But as we are saved, we must demonstrate obedience. And the other idea I want to show there also is that salvation is a process. God does not it seems like God doesn't want to leave anything hanging. He could have simply closed his eyes and said, "Okay, Moses can can still go into Egypt and and and and lead the children of circumcision is a very small matter. We can just go and you know sometimes we can have the very best intentions and neglect some very uh small things that really to God's eyes are very major. You remember when the children of Israel think in the book of 2 Samuel they were bringing the ark of the covenant and they were it was being carried on a cut by dang was it by kaduni oxen by oxen and then Usuza puts forth his hand when it had shaken and and he is instantly killed. A very very interesting time that these men were celebrating that the covenant they were bringing they were doing the right thing the with the very best intentions. But you see sometimes even our best intentions if process if the requirements of God are not met. Sometimes we from the lesson we can see that God requires what he has said to be done as he has said that exact obedience. It it seems like God is very methodical in the work of salvation. He never ever ever wants to leave the divine picture he wants um to paint for us. The last lesson I I I just want to go back to where we came from in the call of Moses. And one of the things that I've learned there was that uh God also when he is calling uh Moses and he has now brought him to this point where he is just about to meet with Aaron and the what we're discussing now happens is that as Moses is giving the excuses you know first of all we saw that he's coming from a point of humility he's been 80 years in the wilderness and he's being modest as it was a very modest man. But as you as he increases on giving the the the the the excuses, it seems like he has come now to the point of willful resistance of the will of God and actually making reluctance, open reluctance that I I I I don't I'm unwilling to do this. And that angers God and God rebukes him for that. He he that he had shown unbelief and he had shown reluctance to obey. You know sometimes when we start out in our Christian journey, we can sometimes play around with being reluctant. Sometimes reluctance to obey is actually disobedience. is actual disobedience. There's a parable where two sons, is it two sons who were called in the in the New Testament where the elder son, they said they will do something but they never went. The young the second son who was told to go to the to to the to to work, he at first refused but went ahead and did it. And God commanded the the in the parable the second son is commanded. Sometimes we can be so reluctant. We can we can at first be exited but reluctant to enter into the work and then that then paralyzes us. We had the right intentions. We had we wanted to be used of God but we dy until Satan overwhelms us and we become disobedient. We need to be wary that when God calls a man, he wants us to act on what he has called us to do. Amen. Amen. Um I don't know if you have anything to say on circumcision or we are good but uh this in essence there was nothing on the circumcision per se. It was just a sign that you know what you need to do and do it. So it's a call to you and me uh my brother and sister that when God calls you, you indeed answer yes and then act on your yes. Um the lesson is coming to an end, but it's an interesting and it has been an interesting journey. The dramatic burning bush call was probably the most transformative uh experience in Moses' life. Um okay all the excuses he was giving were uh in my eyes of the common human being were justified. Those people they don't know me anymore. I left there when I was 40. So in 40 years people have come new people. So he had the correct excuses and in the eyes of a human being you'd give yeah very good excuses like Rafael was saying that you have a flu and yeah indeed you have a flu you're coughing and even I think in this era 40 years is almost what what you'd call a generation you'd say I can't speak to them you know this is a it's a different generation I can't reach them Lord I'm an old guy you know in fact what what the Bible records it's interesting it says in verse 19 it says and the Lord said unto Moses in Midian go return into Egypt for all the men are dead which sought thy life. This is God is telling them that generation has gone away. These are new people you know even to the extent that to a certain extent when when when when go Moses even says if I go and tell them who who am I exactly and who has sent me then God God is saying because these people clearly it's a new generation they they've forgotten some of these things then God says tell them I am who I am has sent you. M yeah it's also possible you know people hear stories like people will be hearing stories about Rafael in the next 40 years and yeah there will be the real aspect of the story and some aspect of it which are not true here and there. Uh I'm seeing I don't know if you have something to say because we making our conclusion on this particular lesson. I think um it was a a mistake uh that uh in the face of the promises that God had given for Moses to steal um pitch camp in his or rather on his unworthiness and uh actually that was implying that uh he didn't fully trust that God was able to qualify him uh or also saw that God had made a mistake. So actually he was he was referencing back and actually the one who was refusing to go was telling God to send someone else. So it is interesting but still uh when Moses obeyed God blessed his ready obedience. He became eloquent. He became hopeful. He became self-possessed. And actually he was fitted by God to do one of the greatest uh works that man has ever been able to to do to lead a generation and generations out of slavery into the uh very borders of the promised land. Sure. Um I don't know Chris you have a remark or we can just finish. Uh okay fine. Um everything in our lives depend on our picture of God. Who is God for you? Then there is who is God to you? If you can answer those questions by just reflecting on your experiences, the past experiences and how God has come through for you. Remember the children of Israel, Israelites, they were oppressed. They were in a land and they were feeling the pressure. If you can relate to who God is to you, then you can make the conscious decision to be as obedient as Kura said, and to take up the call. It's the essence of obeying that call and acting out on it. So that as you move to the promised land where we are headed to your moving with God. Uh dear brother and sister who is with us up to this end. We just want to encourage you to walk this journey with us. We started with the operation. We are seeing the bushes burning and and the next week we are going to look at a rough start. I'm looking forward to that experience so that we can see what God can do and then you will understand this phrase that says what God can do does not exist. Um I'm calling upon uh Raphael you can offer the closing prayer as we finish this session. Thank you for being with us. Let's believe and pray. Our kind loving father and master who art in heaven, we thank you and praise your name that even in an age in which men and women have forgotten you, men and women are well nigh eras your presence and your law from the land. You still come to us and say that you have seen us dear Lord that you have heard us and dear Lord that you know our situation and our circumstances in a special way. I pray dear Lord like that bush may you set us on fire. May you give us a purpose. May you give us a mission. May you give us may we find meaning in life dear Lord help us to embrace and to step up dear Lord to those positions and to those places that you're calling us to occupy. And dear Lord I pray may we may you utterly throw down and and refuse to accept our excuses. And dear Lord, set up our appointments for therein we shall see you and your power. And dear Jesus, we know we shall be the better for it. Be with us. Make this our experience as we continue our pray in Jesus name. Amen. Amen.

TIMESTAMPED TRANSCRIPT:
[7.0s] Happy Sabbath. We are glad that you're
[9.1s] joining us this Sabbath morning. Today
[11.4s] we are having the holy communion and so
[13.8s] we welcome you to participate in it. It
[17.0s] is a a remembrance of what our Lord did
[19.9s] for us on the cross. Now this morning
[23.4s] before we begin our lesson study, I
[25.6s] would like for us to offer a prayer and
[28.2s] then delve into it. Let's pray. Our
[31.5s] father and our God who lives in heaven.
[33.2s] Father, we thank you for this morning.
[35.0s] Thank you for giving us this opportunity
[37.1s] and chance to study your word and to
[39.6s] have this interaction. We are praying
[41.6s] for the power of the Holy Spirit that he
[43.4s] may be our guide to guide us as we start
[45.9s] and give us understanding of your world
[47.5s] to build our faith in you. For we have
[49.6s] prayed in Jesus name. Amen. So this
[53.6s] morning I'm joined by my brothers. Uh I
[56.6s] would like for each one of you to
[58.1s] introduce yourself. We're starting from
[59.9s] the left.
[61.5s] My name is Enongo Rafa Jamis. It's a
[63.6s] pleasure to be here.
[65.0s] Yes. Happy Sabbath. My name is Daniel
[67.1s] Ketur. I am very glad to be with you
[69.7s] this morning.
[71.0s] Praise the Lord. My name is Chris Paulen
[73.4s] Begera. I'm glad to be here. Thank you.
[76.4s] Uh and I am Christianu. I am glad that
[79.4s] you joined us. Now we are into this uh
[81.8s] journey Exodus the journey to the
[84.0s] promised land. This is the lesson that
[86.0s] we are studying for this quarter. We
[88.2s] just want to see the story of the
[89.9s] Israelites through the lenses of Moses.
[91.9s] And as we had said that this is the
[94.2s] gospel actually the gospel of Jesus
[96.5s] Christ through the lenses of Moses and
[98.7s] the story of the Israelites. Now uh last
[101.8s] week we were looking at oppression, the
[104.4s] background and the birth of Moses and we
[107.4s] discovered several uh interesting facts
[110.7s] there that will carry us through as we
[112.9s] continue this very important study. Now
[115.7s] for this uh week we are looking at the
[118.0s] burning bush. I know this is u it's an
[122.6s] interesting story. There are people who
[124.2s] actually don't believe that it happened
[126.4s] but the Bible as we believe it's true.
[130.0s] there was a burning bush. And so this is
[132.2s] what we want to uh have a discussion on
[134.6s] this morning. And we welcome you to join
[137.3s] in with us. Uh let's read uh our memory
[140.6s] text. That's the book of Exodus 3.
[143.9s] Exodus 3:7 and 8. Then the Lord said, "I
[149.0s] have observed the misery of my people in
[151.2s] Egypt, and I've heard them crying out
[153.5s] because of their oppressors, and I know
[155.8s] about their sufferings. I have come down
[158.8s] to rescue them from the power of the
[160.5s] Egyptians and to bring them from that
[163.1s] land to a good and specious land, a land
[166.9s] flowing with milk and honey, the
[169.0s] territory of the Canaanites, the
[170.5s] Hittites, the Amorites, the Perizzites,
[172.6s] and the Heivites and the Jebusites. This
[176.2s] it's a powerful um these are powerful
[178.9s] verses. It is the Lord saying, "I have
[181.1s] surely seen and now I have come. I have
[184.8s] known their sorrow." The Lord can relate
[187.7s] to how these people are feeling and he's
[189.5s] saying now I've come to sort it out. The
[191.8s] right time to sort it out is now. And so
[195.4s] as we delve into the burning bush, Moses
[199.0s] is approaching. He's in the in the
[201.1s] wilderness and and he's approaching and
[203.3s] he's seeing, oh, this is a very
[204.7s] interesting phenomenon. I haven't seen
[206.4s] this before. There's this bush that is
[208.6s] burning, but it is not being consumed.
[211.2s] And so he comes closer to look at it to
[214.5s] find out why is it like that. And so the
[217.6s] writer of this week's lesson has written
[220.0s] important words here that I would like
[221.6s] to read a word for word. It says God's
[224.5s] God's call to us will often change the
[226.7s] direction of our lives. However, if we
[229.5s] follow that call, then we discover that
[231.5s] God's path is always the best route for
[233.4s] us. Sometimes at first it is not easy to
[236.6s] accept God's call. Uh this is a fact.
[239.3s] Sometimes you're not very sure. However,
[242.0s] in that such is the case with Moses.
[244.6s] When he approached the bush, he was
[246.1s] like, "Is it true? Let me see what's
[248.3s] happening." In the case of Moses and his
[251.5s] call by God, which specifically began at
[254.0s] the encounter with the Lord at the
[255.7s] burning bush. Although Moses may or may
[258.2s] not have known about the laws of
[259.6s] combustion, he knew that what he was
[261.8s] seeing was a miracle and it certainly
[264.2s] caught his attention. It was
[266.2s] interesting. And so he moves forward to
[268.4s] find out what is happening. So I want to
[271.9s] to to to allow the panelists to put in
[275.5s] put in your input. The burning bush.
[278.5s] What interesting phenomenon are we
[280.2s] picking from it? We can start from uh my
[283.4s] right side.
[285.4s] Thank you so much. Um as you see here,
[288.4s] Moses has been we started with the
[291.0s] history of Moses where he comes from. He
[294.7s] is uh his uh his uh his parents the fact
[300.9s] that he was thrown into uh the river
[303.8s] Jordan due to the the what the pharaoh
[308.5s] had given as as a as a law when they
[311.4s] wanted to destroy all the males the male
[314.2s] children of the Hebrews and then now he
[317.3s] is he has gone into the king's courtyard
[320.2s] he has uh fled after killing one of with
[324.1s] the Egyptians and now he is he has been
[327.0s] in the desert for another 40 years. The
[329.8s] the second phase of the 40 years is
[332.9s] coming to an end. Now we find Moses
[337.2s] as basically a shepherd.
[339.8s] He is he is at the point where his life
[344.2s] is not where he as he comes into the
[347.8s] desert. He he was not the same person he
[350.6s] is at this point. And interesting
[353.0s] enough, it is it seems that God has
[357.9s] taught him lessons that
[361.4s] can only be taught in that context of of
[364.7s] being of the especially the work he's
[366.6s] doing as a shepherd. And I think that's
[368.7s] where I want to bring out the the the
[370.5s] the attitude Moses comes with and where
[373.6s] God meets him at this point. It seems
[376.6s] like God has understood that my servant
[381.1s] Moses is finally ready
[384.5s] to do the work as I would have it do.
[387.3s] He's a shepherd. That's the same way
[389.5s] David was a shepherd. The same way
[391.7s] Christ himself when he comes into the
[393.4s] earth, he he he comes forth as as a
[397.0s] shepherd. And this is very very
[399.4s] important that God depicts himself to
[402.8s] him in the form of a burning bush. uh as
[406.6s] as so that he can and Moses
[410.1s] interestingly enough uh as you have as
[412.8s] you have read in the introduction he did
[414.9s] not maybe un understand what
[418.6s] exist what was happening in the fullest
[421.3s] context but he approaches the area
[427.3s] I'm I'm thinking like if it was Moses
[429.3s] the Egyptian who had been under the
[431.2s] Egyptian
[432.8s] mindset when he first came into the into
[436.2s] into if he had come into this context he
[439.8s] would have not had a similar approach it
[442.4s] seems like it is with almost awe that
[444.8s] he's coming into this his heart is not
[447.3s] the same I think for me one of the pick
[450.5s] the points I'm picking here is that
[452.7s] Moses as the shepherd in
[456.7s] Exodus chapter 3 is not Moses who comes
[460.6s] out of Egypt he has been completely
[463.3s] transformed and God is now ready to use
[465.9s] his servant as he approaches
[469.0s] uh him in the burning bush.
[471.4s] Thank you.
[472.8s] I I think um the the burning bush is an
[477.8s] interesting
[479.7s] um way the Lord uses this burning bush
[483.8s] to catch the attention of Moses. So you
[487.7s] can imagine Moses is in the highlands of
[490.2s] Si and then he's his attention is caught
[494.2s] by a bush of flame.
[496.2s] It is burning but it is not consumed. So
[498.8s] he says you know what I will go and
[501.9s] investigate. I I want to find a reason
[506.7s] uh an explanation as to why this bush is
[510.7s] burning but it is not consumed. But as
[515.5s] he goes to investigate, he not only
[518.6s] finds the reason why, but he meets his
[523.2s] caller. He meets God and actually he
[526.6s] finds his calling.
[529.2s] So this is an interesting um you know
[532.4s] lesson in that uh there may be a burning
[535.4s] bush in your life right now. There may
[538.1s] be a a something that calls your
[540.5s] attention. You know, how often do we
[543.5s] look for reasons and often we find
[545.7s] people uh you know, I I wanted this
[549.4s] drama in my life to end but I found God
[552.2s] or all I ever wanted was a was a spouse
[554.6s] but I found God. So God does not play
[558.0s] favorites in his dealing with people. He
[561.0s] will often use the burning bushes in our
[563.2s] lives to call our attention. And uh we
[567.0s] will discover
[568.8s] uh not only reasons but the one who
[573.2s] calls us and he will give us uh our
[576.6s] calling. You know that that that burning
[579.3s] bush uh still burns today. Actually uh
[583.0s] it is it is it is the bush that needed
[585.9s] the fire in order to attract attention.
[589.4s] It is not the fire that needed the bush.
[592.6s] So the bush still burns. God is still in
[596.2s] the business of drawing his children in
[599.4s] and then g investing them with purpose
[604.3s] and calling in their lives.
[606.1s] Amen.
[608.0s] I think it's important to um understand
[612.1s] as Chris has mentioned to us that Moses
[614.5s] has been in the wilderness for 40 years.
[617.0s] He now has a wife and two children. He's
[619.5s] developing and to certain extent I think
[621.9s] Moses was um becoming comfortable. He
[625.4s] was now in a comfort zone. And so the
[627.6s] burning bush uh sort of uh uh sets him a
[632.2s] fire brings purpose and renewed purp
[637.2s] and and and Kur and the burning bush
[639.5s] also is is is is typifi uh almost um
[645.2s] it shows us that God uses the things
[648.1s] that are in our environment. A bush is
[651.1s] something that you can come across in
[652.8s] the wilderness. And in the wilderness, a
[654.7s] bush is something that is significant
[655.9s] that you that will attract your
[657.4s] attention. More so, a burning bush.
[660.2s] Perhaps in the heat of the desert, a
[663.5s] shepherd will look for even even even
[666.0s] animals will look for a bush to shelter,
[669.5s] you know. But then lo and behold, here
[671.8s] is one that is burning. Here is one that
[674.2s] is burning. And so it speaks to us also
[676.2s] those of us who have hit uh deadlocks,
[679.0s] those of us who perhaps have hit
[682.6s] um um a sort of a crisis and and we are
[686.2s] in we're in a comfort zone or we don't
[688.2s] really know what next. Then it calls
[691.2s] upon us to go forth to go forth and
[694.6s] indeed
[696.4s] have God set our bushes on fire. You
[699.4s] see, and the beauty of this fire is that
[701.0s] it doesn't it doesn't consume the bush.
[704.2s] Even uh like Israel
[707.1s] being under persecution, yet God still
[709.5s] preserving them. And so even in our in
[712.1s] our in our situations, in our instances
[713.8s] where we are confused, ours is simply to
[716.5s] to to seek the Lord and he truly can be
[719.4s] able to set our bushes on fire. Another
[721.6s] lesson that we also learn about Moses
[723.9s] during this 40 years is that Moses was
[726.2s] in as much as he was comfortable, Moses
[728.6s] was still the child of God. Moses was
[732.0s] still receiving an education from God.
[734.7s] It is during this time that inspiration
[736.7s] tells us from the wonderful book
[738.0s] Patriarchs and Prophets page 251 that
[741.0s] Moses now writes to us these wonderful
[742.9s] books that tell us about the great
[744.3s] controversy, the book of Genesis and the
[746.6s] book of Job. Moses was already in a
[749.4s] relationship with God. It was already
[753.0s] It's simply telling us that sometimes
[754.4s] even if you may be a Christian and
[756.2s] relationship with God, but there's a a
[758.6s] time comes in which God wants to set you
[761.2s] on fire. You can still be in a comfort
[763.7s] zone even in service. Moses now when God
[766.8s] wants him to take it up a notch now to
[769.4s] go for mission for a purpose not simply
[772.5s] to write books not simply to tell of of
[774.5s] of of the fall but rather to to write
[777.0s] the to write the to write the future now
[779.4s] he's he's he's written about the past
[781.4s] but now it's time to go forward and to
[783.7s] bring God's people home to write the
[785.6s] next chapter and therefore God meets him
[788.5s] there at the burning bush to sort of
[790.6s] give him that fire that fuel that energy
[793.6s] that will be able to help him to go to
[797.0s] the next chapter to the next phase in
[799.0s] life.
[800.0s] Thank you uh my brother. So then it took
[802.9s] Moses 80 years you can imagine 80 years
[806.2s] before God deemed him ready and then he
[809.2s] presents himself in a burning bush so
[811.4s] that he gets his attention. And so you
[814.9s] could be wondering why are my things not
[816.7s] going. Maybe you are yet to meet the
[819.1s] burning bush so that you can come to
[821.1s] that realization.
[822.9s] uh Kur um the angel of the Lord.
[826.5s] Yeah. Um you know when um when now Moses
[830.3s] approaches
[832.2s] uh the bush, there is a voice that calls
[835.5s] out Moses, Moses. And by the way, uh
[838.8s] this voice would later on be very
[841.2s] familiar in the history of God's
[844.1s] children. There was a voice perhaps in
[846.9s] the New Testament. I don't know if you
[848.4s] remember Martha Martha or there was
[851.4s] another voice um um in in in in in the
[855.8s] Bible calling people to various tasks
[859.8s] and mission. And the voice that speaks
[863.5s] out of this burning v bush is the voice
[866.8s] of the angel of the Lord. Um the book of
[870.6s] Genesis chapter uh 22 verse 11 also
[876.2s] speaks with this specific phrase the
[879.3s] angel of the Lord. Okay. Uh uh Genesis
[884.0s] 22 11. But the angel of the Lord called
[887.7s] to him from heaven and said Abraham
[890.6s] Abraham. So it's it's like a a pattern.
[895.8s] Moses, Moses, Abraham, Abraham. It is as
[899.7s] if to implant the seed that this is a
[903.3s] very specific character in the Bible. So
[908.2s] this angel of the Lord is a title and it
[913.0s] depicts none other than the person Jesus
[917.3s] Christ. So actually before he was
[919.4s] incarnate, he appeared to uh many
[925.6s] you know on many occasions as the angel
[929.3s] of the Lord. We've just seen in Genesis
[931.2s] 22 he appears to uh Abraham. He appears
[935.4s] to Gideon. Uh and actually the the the
[940.3s] term angel simply means messenger.
[944.8s] All right? So uh it's it's and and the
[950.1s] person who appears now to speak to Moses
[953.4s] is Jesus who actually is God's messenger
[958.6s] and he communicates the father's word to
[962.8s] us. So the voice that speaks out of the
[966.1s] bush is the voice of our Lord and Savior
[970.7s] Jesus before he is incarnate. And he
[974.7s] speaks with an an acquaintance
[979.8s] or rather he speaks in a way that shows
[983.0s] that he understands
[985.4s] and he has heard the groaning cry of his
[989.9s] children
[991.1s] and he speaks to Moses in a very
[995.1s] intimate way. He actually goes ahead to
[998.0s] introduce himself as something or
[1001.2s] someone that I think Chrisal would want
[1004.2s] to talk about.
[1006.4s] Sure. Uh Chris,
[1009.0s] tell us tell us this one.
[1010.9s] Yes. Um
[1013.3s] God introduces himself now to Moses and
[1016.8s] uh he says in uh Exodus chapter 3 verse
[1022.0s] 12 13-22 we see and Moses said unto God
[1026.1s] behold I have I when I come to the
[1030.5s] children of Israel and say to them the
[1033.0s] God of their fathers has sent me unto
[1035.8s] them and they shall say to me what is
[1039.0s] his name.
[1041.0s] What shall I say unto them? Um,
[1047.1s] this is the first of the I don't want to
[1050.8s] preempt but the first of the reasons
[1053.4s] Moses gives in in in in trying to
[1060.0s] bring himself out of this situation
[1064.1s] out of the calling that God has given to
[1066.2s] him. But God God first of all introduces
[1068.5s] himself as the God of Jacob, the God of
[1071.9s] Abraham, Jacob and um Isaac and he is
[1079.0s] endearing himself. And then he says that
[1081.8s] and God said unto Moses verse 14, I am
[1085.0s] that I am has said thus shall thou say
[1089.0s] unto the children of Israel, I am hath
[1092.4s] sent me unto you.
[1095.4s] And God goes on first of all the first
[1098.9s] thing that comes onto onto my mind is
[1101.6s] God presents himself as he is the
[1106.0s] selfexistence God. I am whom I am. The
[1109.4s] lesson rather says that that literally
[1111.4s] means I will be who I will be. God is
[1117.0s] God is selfexistence as it were. It
[1119.8s] means that God is eternal. He is
[1122.6s] transcendent. He is he is ex his
[1126.3s] existence is
[1129.5s] great and beyond our imaginations. But
[1132.2s] the proper English name we find there is
[1134.2s] the name Yahweh which is quite an
[1137.2s] endearing name for God. And and and it's
[1140.3s] interesting that God introduces himself
[1143.1s] in with this term the Yahweh. I am
[1145.4s] Yahweh.
[1147.2s] And there are four points that I found I
[1149.7s] I see as God is having this conversation
[1152.2s] with Moses. The first thing that is that
[1155.0s] he is Yahweh depicts God as being very
[1158.6s] relational. He understands I I have
[1161.4s] first of all when in the memory text you
[1164.2s] go comes forth and he says that I have
[1168.9s] heard their cries. I have seen and now I
[1173.2s] have come. It seems that God is very
[1176.5s] intimately connected with the situations
[1178.6s] of his people. In fact, was one of the
[1180.7s] key the key lines I saw there was that
[1183.5s] he knows their suffering. verse 7. He
[1187.8s] knows. He knows. And this was not simply
[1191.4s] God saying that I theoretically know it.
[1195.4s] Because last week when we were
[1197.8s] discussing the lesson, we saw that God
[1200.8s] in Isaiah 63:9 says that in all their
[1205.8s] afflictions, he was afflicted. God
[1211.0s] personally felt the pain because he was
[1214.9s] one with his people. He's a relational
[1217.4s] God. So in verse seven when God says I
[1219.9s] know the suffering he is speaking as
[1222.5s] Yahweh. He understands what his people
[1226.0s] are going through. First the second
[1228.5s] point we the the the other aspect that I
[1231.0s] saw that depict God's
[1235.0s] uh God's identity as Yahweh his title as
[1238.8s] Yahweh he in which is actually a very
[1242.0s] compassionate and empathetic a very
[1245.4s] compassionate term is in verse 8 of uh
[1248.4s] Exodus chapter 3 where
[1251.7s] we see God depicts himself to Moses and
[1255.9s] he says that I have and I am come down
[1261.0s] to deliver. God does not simply know but
[1265.7s] he wants to get involved. He's
[1267.9s] compassionate and he's now empathetic.
[1270.2s] He's not just sympathetic about the
[1272.1s] situation of his people. He's
[1273.7s] empathetic. He wants to be involved in
[1276.2s] this situation. He wants to do something
[1279.0s] about the situation. And that's that's
[1280.8s] who Yahweh is. And lastly, the other
[1283.5s] point I saw is that we have already
[1286.4s] touched on it is that that shows him as
[1289.6s] a personal God is that he speaks
[1291.7s] personally about the experience of
[1293.4s] Abraham,
[1295.5s] Jacob and Isaac. And the relation he had
[1299.7s] with each of these individual was unique
[1304.3s] in their own ways in how they approached
[1309.5s] and how they related to God. Remember,
[1312.4s] it is this same relation that the
[1315.5s] children of Israel could never shake off
[1318.2s] of their identity as a corporate nation.
[1320.7s] In John chapter 8,
[1323.4s] when Christ is having a confrontation
[1326.4s] with the Pharisees,
[1328.7s] actually this is brought up as an
[1331.6s] argument against against Christ. When
[1334.9s] Christ tells him that um when they tell
[1338.1s] them that we are the children of
[1339.8s] Abraham, we are not born of fornication.
[1343.4s] and Abra uh and Christ tells them that
[1346.5s] before Abraham was I am like this idea
[1351.3s] of the God of Abraham was a very
[1354.5s] fundamental
[1356.6s] um
[1358.9s] argument in the hearts of the children
[1361.5s] of Israel. It was a it was a
[1364.1s] relationship they valued dearly. And
[1367.9s] that's where God comes to them and says,
[1369.5s] "I'm the God of Abraham. I'm the God of
[1372.2s] Isaac. I'm the God of Jacob. And it was
[1376.1s] this same argument in if you read Exodus
[1380.1s] 32, chapter 32, when the children of
[1382.5s] Israel have messed up
[1387.0s] the one of the arguments Moses himself
[1389.6s] uses in his prayer to appeal to God to
[1393.2s] stay the hand of destruction so that he
[1396.7s] could not destroy the children of
[1397.9s] Israel. Says that I'm the God of God.
[1400.9s] You are the God of Jacob. You are the
[1403.0s] God of Abraham. How can you destroy your
[1406.2s] children whom you have brought out of
[1407.8s] the land of Egypt?
[1411.0s] An endearing name, Yahweh. That is what
[1414.4s] God calls himself and that is who he is
[1417.0s] to us. God is personal. Though God
[1421.0s] create God created all of us
[1423.6s] corporately, but God knows us
[1426.2s] individually in our unique situations.
[1429.1s] God understands your situation. Our
[1432.4s] brothers and sisters online, God
[1434.6s] understands our situation. He
[1436.9s] understands your personal situation.
[1440.2s] Even though you are together in a
[1443.3s] family, God knows you individually what
[1445.4s] you are going through. And he as in
[1448.1s] verse 8, we're saying he has compassion.
[1450.7s] He wants to come and address that
[1452.3s] situation. Lastly, in and and and as as
[1455.0s] as as we read also through that,
[1458.9s] God also
[1462.3s] proclaims that name as a foundation for
[1466.9s] salvation. In Joel chapter 2:32, we say
[1470.0s] that everyone who calls upon the name of
[1472.6s] the Lord, upon the name Yahweh
[1476.2s] will, it's not if, it is will be saved.
[1481.9s] And I think that is that is comforting.
[1484.7s] If you call on the name of Yahweh, you
[1487.8s] will be saved. Salvation is in there's
[1490.9s] no other name given among men whereby we
[1493.7s] may be saved. Yahweh. Amen.
[1496.8s] Amen. Indeed, the name of the Lord is a
[1499.2s] strong tower. The Russia run to it and
[1501.2s] is safe. Now, the challenge that I'm
[1503.6s] posing to you is in what ways have you
[1507.4s] in your own life experienced that
[1509.3s] closeness and intimacy? Can you per
[1512.0s] chance say the god of Christine or the
[1514.7s] god of kitur can he be your god? It is a
[1518.7s] a choice that you can make. Now Rafael
[1521.1s] there are certain excuses that we are
[1523.7s] seeing. Can we talk about these excuses
[1526.2s] and uh share them with our brothers?
[1530.4s] Indeed. I think it's a it's a powerful
[1533.1s] um it's a powerful um powerful lesson
[1536.6s] that we are looking at the burning bush.
[1539.7s] A lot of things are happening at this at
[1541.5s] this bush. I'd like us to just reflect
[1544.6s] even on our our memory text, even as
[1547.2s] we're looking at the excuses that Moses
[1549.0s] is making.
[1550.2s] Uh verses 3 and seven, verses 7 and 8 of
[1553.8s] chapter 3, the Lord says, "I have surely
[1557.1s] seen the affliction of my people which
[1559.8s] are in Egypt. I have heard their cry by
[1562.2s] reason of their task masters. I know
[1564.2s] their sorrows." There are three words
[1566.2s] which are which are powerful to me. He
[1569.0s] says he they are seen they are heard and
[1572.6s] they are known. I think if ever there's
[1574.9s] something that men desire even in any
[1576.9s] relationship whether
[1580.3s] whatever nature whether romantic or
[1583.0s] otherwise it is to be seen to be heard
[1586.6s] and to be known
[1588.1s] fully seen fully heard fully known.
[1591.8s] So God is coming to Moses and he's
[1593.5s] telling him I have seen these people. I
[1597.0s] have heard them. I know their issues and
[1599.8s] lo and behold, I want you I want you to
[1604.2s] go and speak for me. I want you to go
[1608.2s] and speak for me and speak to the
[1610.4s] highest office in the land to Pharaoh
[1612.6s] himself. You know, it's akin to speaking
[1615.1s] to the to the to the to the leader of
[1617.7s] what is known as the free world or the
[1619.2s] superpower or the superpowers of this
[1621.3s] world in our day and our age. You uh who
[1625.2s] is a fugitive. you who perhaps has been
[1627.3s] living in your comfort zone and then God
[1630.5s] comes with a message that sets you on
[1632.9s] fire and then he says go forth in a
[1636.3s] world in which many of us uh have dreams
[1639.5s] some of us are some dreams have consumed
[1642.5s] people to the extent that they have
[1644.4s] killed them people have died but here
[1646.8s] comes a fire that God sets in in our
[1649.1s] souls to the extent that he says this
[1651.5s] fire consumes but the bush the bush is
[1654.8s] not consumed the fire. It has all all
[1656.9s] all the attributes of fire, all the
[1660.1s] positives of fire. In fact, the reason
[1661.8s] why we hate fire, we say fire is a good
[1663.8s] what? He's a good servant but a bad
[1665.8s] master is because what? The fire
[1668.0s] consumes. But here comes God with a fire
[1671.1s] that provides warmth, a fire that
[1672.9s] provides all the benefits, the light and
[1674.9s] everything, but doesn't consume the
[1676.7s] bush. But like many of us, Moses is um
[1682.3s] is comfortable in his uh in his comfort
[1685.0s] zone. And he presents four excuses. The
[1687.9s] first one is found in Exodus 3 and verse
[1690.6s] 11. In Exodus 3 and:1, Moses speaks and
[1694.8s] says what? Who am I that I should go
[1697.8s] unto Pharaoh and that I should bring
[1699.7s] forth the children of Israel out of
[1702.1s] Egypt? Moses feels unworthy and
[1705.0s] incapable of such a huge task. I think
[1708.2s] the the the the the the
[1713.6s] experience of Moses is not new to all of
[1715.8s] us. Most of us have this this in our day
[1718.7s] and age we would call it what imposter
[1721.0s] syndrome. I don't know whether any of us
[1723.1s] have ever had imposter syndrome. you
[1724.8s] know uh suddenly you are the one who is
[1728.6s] in charge in a particular area whether
[1730.7s] in the past it has always been your
[1732.4s] father or somebody there's always be
[1733.8s] people people have always there's always
[1735.1s] been somebody to refer to there's always
[1736.7s] been somebody to look up to but then
[1738.3s] suddenly you look up and you hear God
[1740.4s] saying you you're the one to lead now
[1743.3s] it's it's your time to pick up and in
[1745.9s] fact even the way God begins he says as
[1748.1s] I was with Abraham you know he's he's
[1750.9s] telling you now it's your time your name
[1753.0s] is going to be mentioned together with
[1754.6s] those greats, those those children,
[1757.1s] those those men and women, those
[1758.7s] patriarchs of faith. And God is telling
[1761.3s] him, "Now is your time." But then he
[1764.8s] makes an excuse and he says, "What? I am
[1767.5s] not worthy. Who am I? Who am I? Just a a
[1771.0s] fugitive, you know. I'm just trying to
[1773.0s] raise my boys and my family. I'm just I
[1775.6s] want a I'm just an author. I'm just
[1778.2s] written Genesis and and Job, you know.
[1780.2s] I'm just a I'm not qualified for this."
[1783.0s] We see a Moses who has changed from who
[1785.9s] he was initially when he was
[1788.1s] presumptuous. God has taken him through
[1790.4s] that school of humility and to the
[1792.2s] extent now Moses is afraid. Moses is
[1794.8s] afraid. But what is God's response? God
[1797.4s] comes in verse 12 and he says what?
[1799.7s] Certainly I will do what? I will be with
[1802.6s] you. I will be with you. In the same way
[1806.2s] in which he says he he has seen he has
[1808.6s] heard and he knows. Similarly, he has
[1811.6s] seen Moses. He has heard him and he
[1814.4s] knows him and therefore he's giving him
[1816.7s] this task. Even for us today, I think
[1819.1s] the lesson for us today when God opens
[1821.1s] up opportunities, divine appointments,
[1824.6s] let us not be afraid. Let us simply
[1827.9s] trust in this same God who has given us
[1829.9s] this opportunities, who has opened for
[1831.7s] us these windows, these doors that he
[1834.2s] will maintain us in those rooms. He will
[1836.9s] maintain us through those opportunities.
[1839.4s] Let us indeed know and claim that
[1842.4s] promise that he says certainly he will
[1844.5s] be with us as as Chris has also told us
[1847.5s] that everyone who calls on the name of
[1849.0s] the lord will be what will be saved let
[1851.3s] us call upon him even when the door of
[1853.7s] opportunity knocks the second time now
[1857.6s] Moses now comes he doesn't run out of
[1859.5s] excuses you know uh when you don't want
[1861.9s] to do something you can I can personally
[1864.0s] I can give you a list uh Moses just made
[1866.6s] for me I can make for you I can make for
[1868.6s] you some longer ones including having a
[1870.8s] flu or uh or or this or that or the
[1873.7s] other. He asks now in chapter 3 and
[1876.7s] verse 13 now he says
[1879.9s] what shall I say unto them? You know
[1883.5s] what shall I say unto them? Moses is is
[1886.2s] is is lacking words. In fact the Bible
[1888.9s] later on records that if somebody who is
[1891.8s] recorded as being the meakest of men, it
[1893.6s] is who?
[1894.4s] It is Moses through this education, this
[1897.0s] time that he has had. And so he fears
[1899.4s] that the people won't believe or accept
[1901.0s] his message without what as being
[1904.3s] authoritative and as being and as being
[1907.4s] uh divinely appointed and anointed. So
[1910.6s] he says, "What shall I say to these
[1912.2s] people? I have nothing to say to these
[1913.7s] people, you know, uh what shall I say
[1916.4s] when I come to them? The God of your
[1918.7s] fathers has sent me unto you and they
[1920.6s] shall say to me, what is his name? And
[1922.7s] what shall I say unto them? I'm not
[1925.2s] educated. You know I lack knowledge. But
[1928.7s] then what does God say? God says to him,
[1931.8s] go and tell them as Chris has
[1933.6s] highlighted to us, I am that I am. Say
[1936.8s] unto them that I am has sent you. Just
[1939.8s] go and tell them I don't know a lot. You
[1943.5s] know, I don't know the nitty-g gritties,
[1945.2s] but God has said it because there is
[1947.5s] power in the name of the Lord. There is
[1949.8s] power in the word of the Lord. And so
[1952.0s] Moses decides that he's going, God
[1955.0s] simply says, "You don't really need to
[1956.4s] know a lot. Just know
[1958.7s] the great I am has sent you. Tell them I
[1961.3s] have sent you." You know, sometimes when
[1962.5s] you when somebody asks you questions and
[1964.6s] you've been sent by a higher power, you
[1966.4s] tell them don't question me. I'm just
[1967.8s] don't shoot the messenger. That's why
[1969.1s] you say don't shoot the messenger. We
[1970.9s] say
[1972.6s] uh refer refer you know I'm just a
[1974.9s] messenger. The boss has said this and
[1977.2s] and it it needs it needs to it needs to
[1979.4s] happen. And thirdly, now he comes once
[1982.3s] again. That's not enough. Now he says in
[1985.0s] Exodus 4:1, "Behold, but behold, they
[1989.4s] will not believe me, nor hearken unto my
[1991.9s] voice." These people, I know them. Even
[1994.7s] uh even when I was coming in my power as
[1996.8s] Pharaoh's as Pharaoh's son to liberate
[1999.1s] them, they refused. They said, "Who who
[2001.0s] has made you a prince or a judge amongst
[2003.8s] us?" They will not believe me, nor will
[2006.2s] they listen to my voice. He doubts that
[2008.7s] God that the people will believe um that
[2012.2s] he was sent by God. He doubts the
[2014.5s] results. And the lesson for all of us
[2016.8s] here is sometimes when God has given us
[2020.6s] a task, leave the results to him. I
[2024.0s] think you just go and execute to your
[2026.6s] level best. The results are up to him.
[2029.8s] But God is so merciful and God is so
[2031.6s] tender. You know, somebody else would
[2033.2s] have looked for somebody else at this
[2034.4s] particular point say this guy is not
[2035.6s] ready. These people are not serious. you
[2037.8s] know, let's call the next candidate, you
[2039.8s] know, if if in an interview and you
[2042.2s] don't you're not answering very well,
[2044.0s] they're saying perhaps this is not the
[2045.8s] right fit for this job, you know, and
[2048.2s] but in this particular case, the
[2049.6s] employer said you're the man for the job
[2051.8s] now. You're the one who's who wants to
[2053.5s] to wiggle out of this appointment. And
[2056.5s] so eventually God gives him what? From
[2058.9s] the book of Exodus 4:2-9, God gives
[2061.9s] Moses three miraculous signs to present
[2064.8s] not only before before the children of
[2066.6s] Israel, but also before Pharaoh. One,
[2069.1s] his staff will turn into a serpent. Two,
[2072.1s] his hand will become lepous and then he
[2074.6s] will become healed. And thirdly, that he
[2077.4s] will be able to do have the ability to
[2078.6s] do what? To turn water into blood. God
[2083.8s] when there's when there's one author who
[2086.3s] writes a poem the hound of heaven that
[2088.8s] when God is after a man God will will
[2092.2s] corner you we make this excuse he has
[2095.4s] got a counter he makes this excuse he's
[2097.4s] got a counter eventually now he gives
[2098.8s] him not only three not only one miracle
[2101.3s] but three a snake a staff turning into a
[2104.6s] snake a hand that becomes lepous and
[2107.1s] then gets healed and ultimately water
[2109.6s] turning into blood and then eventually
[2111.8s] Actually now Moses says he realizes okay
[2115.1s] it seems like all these things can
[2116.7s] happen
[2118.2s] but this one thing I can say I am not
[2120.8s] eloquent you know I don't have the voice
[2122.7s] for this now this one I have gotten him
[2124.9s] I am not eloquent I am not eloquent in
[2126.9s] this matter in verse 10 he says I am
[2128.6s] slow of speech and of a slow tongue
[2133.0s] you know if God is looking for a
[2134.2s] mouthpiece you'd wonder you you you'd
[2136.2s] think that he'd look for the greatest
[2137.8s] orator
[2138.7s] you know uh the one the most wonderful
[2141.8s] uh and authoritative voice and and and
[2144.6s] powerful the ones that command uh
[2146.8s] attention. But Moses says, "I am neither
[2149.2s] of this. I am slow of speech." Perhaps
[2152.0s] he he he was is kind to look for words
[2156.2s] for appropriate words. He was slow maybe
[2158.4s] trying to trying to to to get that
[2160.3s] tongue. And then even says that even his
[2162.5s] tongue is slow. So he's saying he has a
[2164.9s] he has both a mental and a physical
[2168.2s] disability. You know, my tongue is also
[2171.0s] heavy. It's a bit slow, but also
[2172.7s] mentally I also am having difficulty
[2175.1s] processing speech. You know, the area on
[2177.4s] my brain that that processes speech is
[2179.1s] not firing uh optimally. And so Moses
[2182.4s] feels for a fact here now I've gotten
[2184.5s] the Lord. But what does God say in
[2187.6s] verses 11 and 12 of chapter um chapter
[2192.5s] um chapter 4? And the Lord said unto
[2194.9s] him, "Who hath made man's mouth? Or who
[2198.2s] maketh the dumb or the deaf, the seeing
[2200.6s] or the blind? Have I not the Lord?"
[2203.3s] Verse 12, he says, "Now therefore, go
[2206.6s] and I will be with your mouth and teach
[2209.2s] you what you shall say." God is simply
[2213.2s] telling Moses, you go what to say there,
[2216.8s] what to do there. I will I will I will
[2219.5s] be able to to do it for you. you know,
[2223.3s] I'll be able to do it for you. And uh
[2226.7s] eventually uh we see all the excuses
[2230.3s] that we can ever present before God for
[2233.0s] us not to do the work of God. Uh
[2236.2s] eventually we'll find we'll find no
[2238.8s] place no place. One one somebody else
[2241.8s] said those whom God appoints he does
[2244.8s] what he empowers. If God is the one
[2247.4s] who's called you he will qualify you for
[2249.6s] that. You know, you may be the most
[2251.0s] unqualified person, but God qualifies
[2253.4s] the called. Ultimately, he makes another
[2255.8s] excuse, which is a fifth excuse some
[2257.7s] some would say in which in which he says
[2260.1s] in verse 13,
[2263.6s] eventually he says, "Oh Lord, my lord,
[2266.2s] send I pray thee by the hand of him whom
[2268.6s] thou wilt will send." Says, "Please
[2271.8s] choose somebody else." You know, I agree
[2274.8s] with you. This is an important matter,
[2276.1s] but choose somebody else. you know um
[2278.3s] but eventually God gets angry. We find
[2280.4s] God get angry in verse 14 and the anger
[2283.4s] of the Lord and eventually even in his
[2285.5s] anger God shows mercy. God shows
[2288.1s] consideration and says okay go I've
[2291.4s] prepared your brother Aaron and he will
[2293.8s] help you to speak uh on on uh to be your
[2297.7s] mouthpiece on his behalf. But God wanted
[2299.5s] to deal with Moses. And so these excuses
[2303.4s] simply simply show us u um the mindset
[2307.2s] of Moses. A man uh who is running away
[2310.8s] from his mission. A man that is who is
[2312.7s] comfortable in his comfort zone and a
[2315.2s] God who wants to set his life on fire
[2317.7s] literally but his life will not be
[2319.8s] consumed. In fact, it will become even
[2321.6s] more richer and his life will equally
[2324.2s] also bless others. And he is mentioned
[2326.6s] as one of the greatest of the prophets.
[2329.3s] So in essence, there is no excuse that
[2332.3s] you will give. As long as the Lord's
[2334.2s] hand is on you and you're the chosen
[2335.8s] one, God will find ways to empower you.
[2339.5s] I like that statement. I normally refer
[2341.6s] to it especially when I'm chickening out
[2343.4s] of my responsibility. If God calls you,
[2345.6s] he will qualify you. Um we are looking
[2349.0s] at the circumcision. There's the element
[2351.2s] of circumcision. Now Moses has been told
[2353.4s] your brother is going to meet you. But
[2355.0s] there is this element of circumcision
[2356.7s] that is cropping up from uh Exodus
[2359.0s] chapter 4. Uh who wants to go first and
[2361.8s] talk about it?
[2363.8s] Um probably uh it's an interesting um uh
[2369.2s] account here.
[2371.0s] Um this is Exodus chapter 4. Uh I will
[2374.5s] read uh from verse
[2378.2s] um
[2380.1s] 20
[2381.0s] m
[2382.1s] um all the way through to verse 24. This
[2386.0s] is now Moses returning to to Egypt.
[2390.2s] And uh the first thing that he does is
[2392.7s] to ask for permission from his
[2395.4s] father-in-law.
[2397.4s] And then he begins the journey. But on
[2401.1s] the journey, something surprising uh
[2404.4s] happens along the way. God wants to kill
[2409.3s] Moses.
[2410.9s] And uh this is one of those strange
[2415.0s] things. Yeah. The Bible says um this
[2419.5s] I'll read from verse uh 22. Then you
[2422.3s] shall say to Pharaoh, uh, thus
[2426.0s] saith the Lord, Israel is my firstborn,
[2429.2s] and I say to you, let my son go that he
[2431.9s] may serve me. If you refuse to let him
[2434.9s] go, behold, I will kill your firstborn
[2437.6s] son. At a lodging place on the way, the
[2441.9s] Lord met him and sought to put him to
[2445.2s] death. Wow, this is interesting.
[2449.4s] The Lord meets Moses and wants to put
[2452.6s] him to death. Then Zippora took a flint
[2456.2s] and cut off the son's foreskin and
[2459.1s] touched Moses's feet with it and said,
[2461.8s] "Surely
[2463.4s] you are a bridegroom of blood to me." So
[2468.0s] he let him alone. And it was then that
[2470.6s] she said, "A bridegroom of blood because
[2474.0s] of the circumcision." Now this is uh
[2477.7s] something that uh is interesting. There
[2480.9s] was a command that was given
[2484.0s] uh to the children of Israel by uh to to
[2488.8s] Abraham that the children of the
[2491.5s] circumcision I mean the children of
[2493.3s] Israel need to be circumci circumcised.
[2496.1s] The males must be circumcised. This was
[2501.1s] a covenant
[2503.1s] relationship that they were entering
[2505.9s] into with God. And it was required that
[2511.8s] they should obey. But Moses had failed
[2515.5s] in this respect.
[2518.2s] And he was going to become a leader. he
[2521.4s] was going to and so then how was he
[2524.5s] going to be a leader of a people leading
[2527.8s] them after God but not model in his own
[2531.4s] life the obedience that God requires.
[2536.4s] And so
[2538.2s] um God meets him and uh the wife Zippora
[2543.4s] acts very speedily uh circumcises the
[2547.0s] boy and Moses is able to uh find safety
[2552.2s] in that. So he God was trying to say to
[2556.4s] Moses, you know, um you're going to be
[2558.8s] placed in a position of great peril.
[2562.6s] You are going to require the protection
[2564.5s] of holy angels. But these angels will
[2568.6s] not protect you. I cannot cover you if
[2572.1s] you're living in neglect of a known duty
[2577.0s] which you should have performed. So it
[2579.1s] is dangerous
[2581.0s] to
[2583.0s] live a life of disobedience and willful
[2587.0s] disobedience and expect the favor and
[2590.6s] the protection of God. So God calls
[2596.4s] Moses to obedience and actually that
[2600.2s] obedience
[2602.0s] um was a condition of his salvation and
[2607.5s] it is similar also to us. Uh obedience
[2611.9s] is not the cause of our salvation but
[2615.2s] certainly it is a condition to our
[2618.5s] salvation.
[2620.2s] I can also jump in there and I think
[2623.0s] where my brother Kur has just uh say
[2628.2s] that obedience
[2630.7s] is
[2632.3s] uh
[2634.0s] is is is
[2636.4s] has to come out in this process of God
[2640.8s] saving us. It has to be made manifest.
[2644.5s] It is not indeed we are not saved
[2647.8s] because we are obedient.
[2650.2s] But as we are saved, we must demonstrate
[2654.8s] obedience.
[2656.4s] And the other idea I want to show there
[2659.9s] also is that salvation is a process. God
[2663.4s] does not it seems like God doesn't want
[2665.3s] to leave anything hanging. He could have
[2667.9s] simply closed his eyes and said, "Okay,
[2670.2s] Moses can can still go into Egypt and
[2673.8s] and and and lead the children of
[2676.6s] circumcision is a very small matter. We
[2679.1s] can just go and you know sometimes we
[2681.8s] can have the very best intentions and
[2684.3s] neglect some very uh small things that
[2689.7s] really to God's eyes are very major. You
[2691.9s] remember when the children of Israel
[2694.1s] think in the book of 2 Samuel they were
[2696.4s] bringing the ark of the covenant
[2699.4s] and they were it was being carried on a
[2702.2s] cut by dang was it by kaduni oxen by
[2706.2s] oxen
[2707.3s] and
[2708.9s] then Usuza puts forth his hand when it
[2712.0s] had shaken and and he is instantly
[2714.9s] killed. A very very interesting
[2719.8s] time that these men were celebrating
[2724.5s] that the covenant they were bringing
[2726.4s] they were doing the right thing the with
[2728.8s] the very best intentions. But you see
[2731.7s] sometimes even our best intentions
[2735.0s] if process if the requirements of God
[2738.2s] are not met. Sometimes we from the
[2741.4s] lesson we can see that God requires
[2746.2s] what he has said to be done as he has
[2749.2s] said
[2750.4s] that exact obedience. It it seems like
[2753.6s] God is very methodical in the work of
[2756.6s] salvation. He never ever ever wants to
[2760.8s] leave
[2762.6s] the divine picture he wants um to paint
[2766.0s] for us. The last lesson I I I just want
[2768.9s] to go back to where we came from in the
[2771.4s] call of Moses. And one of the things
[2774.4s] that I've learned there was that uh God
[2777.6s] also when he is calling uh Moses and he
[2781.6s] has now brought him to this point where
[2783.7s] he is just about to meet with Aaron and
[2787.0s] the what we're discussing now happens is
[2789.7s] that as Moses is giving the excuses you
[2793.0s] know first of all we saw that he's
[2794.6s] coming from a point of humility he's
[2797.4s] been 80 years in the wilderness and he's
[2800.7s] being modest as it was a very modest
[2803.2s] man. But as you as he increases on
[2808.0s] giving the the the the the
[2812.0s] excuses,
[2813.6s] it seems like he has come now to the
[2815.4s] point of willful resistance of the will
[2818.6s] of God and
[2821.5s] actually making reluctance, open
[2824.4s] reluctance that I I I I don't I'm
[2827.8s] unwilling to do this. And that angers
[2831.0s] God and God rebukes him for that. He he
[2836.4s] that he had shown unbelief and he had
[2839.5s] shown reluctance to obey. You know
[2842.1s] sometimes when we start out in our
[2843.9s] Christian journey, we can sometimes play
[2847.5s] around with being reluctant. Sometimes
[2850.6s] reluctance to obey is actually
[2853.9s] disobedience.
[2856.8s] is actual disobedience.
[2859.4s] There's a parable where two sons, is it
[2863.0s] two sons who were called in the in the
[2865.1s] New Testament where the elder son,
[2869.0s] they said they will do something but
[2870.7s] they never went. The young the second
[2873.9s] son who was told to go to the to to the
[2878.9s] to to work, he at first refused but went
[2883.4s] ahead and did it. And God commanded the
[2886.5s] the in the parable the second son is
[2889.0s] commanded. Sometimes we can be so
[2892.2s] reluctant. We can we can at first be
[2894.2s] exited but reluctant to enter into the
[2896.9s] work and then that then paralyzes us. We
[2901.6s] had the right intentions. We had we
[2903.8s] wanted to be used of God but we dy until
[2908.9s] Satan overwhelms us and we become
[2911.3s] disobedient. We need to be wary that
[2913.6s] when God calls a man, he wants us to act
[2917.9s] on what he has called us to do.
[2920.3s] Amen.
[2921.0s] Amen. Um I don't know if you have
[2923.4s] anything to say on circumcision or we
[2926.2s] are good but uh this in essence there
[2929.3s] was nothing on the circumcision per se.
[2932.3s] It was just a sign that you know what
[2935.3s] you need to do and do it. So it's a call
[2938.8s] to you and me uh my brother and sister
[2941.4s] that when God calls you, you indeed
[2944.0s] answer yes and then act on your yes. Um
[2948.3s] the lesson is coming to an end, but it's
[2951.8s] an interesting and it has been an
[2953.4s] interesting journey. The dramatic
[2955.7s] burning bush call was probably the most
[2957.8s] transformative uh experience in Moses'
[2960.0s] life. Um okay all the excuses he was
[2963.3s] giving were uh in my eyes of the common
[2966.8s] human being were justified. Those people
[2969.4s] they don't know me anymore. I left there
[2971.2s] when I was 40. So in 40 years people
[2973.7s] have come new people. So he had the
[2975.8s] correct excuses and in the eyes of a
[2979.0s] human being you'd give yeah very good
[2981.2s] excuses like Rafael was saying that you
[2983.1s] have a flu and yeah indeed you have a
[2985.0s] flu you're coughing
[2985.8s] and even I think in this era 40 years is
[2988.5s] almost what what you'd call a generation
[2990.3s] you'd say I can't speak to them you know
[2992.7s] this is a it's a different generation I
[2994.6s] can't reach them Lord I'm an old guy you
[2997.1s] know in fact what what the Bible records
[2999.1s] it's interesting it says in verse 19
[3002.4s] it says and the Lord said unto Moses in
[3004.8s] Midian go return into Egypt for all the
[3007.7s] men are dead which sought thy life.
[3010.5s] This is God is telling them that
[3012.2s] generation has gone away.
[3013.8s] These are new people you know even to
[3015.6s] the extent that to a certain extent when
[3017.1s] when when when go Moses even says if I
[3019.7s] go and tell them
[3021.1s] who who am I exactly and who has sent me
[3024.3s] then God God is saying because these
[3026.2s] people clearly it's a new generation
[3027.8s] they they've forgotten some of these
[3029.3s] things then God says tell them I am who
[3031.8s] I am has sent you. M yeah it's also
[3035.1s] possible you know people hear stories
[3037.2s] like people will be hearing stories
[3039.3s] about Rafael in the next 40 years and
[3041.2s] yeah there will be the real aspect of
[3043.1s] the story and some aspect of it which
[3045.8s] are not true here and there. Uh I'm
[3048.2s] seeing I don't know if you have
[3049.6s] something to say because we making our
[3051.3s] conclusion on this particular lesson. I
[3053.8s] think um it was a a mistake uh that uh
[3059.3s] in the face of the promises that God had
[3061.8s] given
[3062.7s] for Moses to steal um pitch camp in his
[3068.4s] or rather on his unworthiness
[3070.8s] and uh actually that was implying that
[3075.8s] uh
[3077.3s] he didn't fully trust that God was able
[3079.8s] to qualify him
[3081.7s] uh or also saw that God had made a
[3084.2s] mistake. So actually he was he was
[3086.6s] referencing back and actually the one
[3089.0s] who was refusing to go was telling God
[3091.7s] to send someone else.
[3093.7s] So it is interesting but still
[3097.6s] uh when Moses obeyed God blessed his
[3102.2s] ready obedience. He became eloquent. He
[3105.5s] became hopeful. He became
[3107.6s] self-possessed. And actually he was
[3110.4s] fitted by God to do one of the greatest
[3113.8s] uh works that man has ever been able to
[3117.7s] to do to lead a generation and
[3120.4s] generations out of slavery into the uh
[3124.2s] very borders of the promised land.
[3126.6s] Sure. Um I don't know Chris you have a
[3129.7s] remark or we can just finish. Uh okay
[3133.0s] fine. Um everything in our lives depend
[3135.6s] on our picture of God. Who is God for
[3138.3s] you? Then there is who is God to you? If
[3142.1s] you can answer those questions by just
[3144.2s] reflecting on your experiences, the past
[3146.6s] experiences and how God has come through
[3148.4s] for you. Remember the children of
[3150.1s] Israel, Israelites, they were oppressed.
[3152.0s] They were in a land and they were
[3153.4s] feeling the pressure. If you can relate
[3155.4s] to who God is to you, then you can make
[3157.6s] the conscious decision to be as obedient
[3160.0s] as Kura said, and to take up the call.
[3162.7s] It's the essence of obeying that call
[3164.7s] and acting out on it. So that as you
[3167.3s] move to the promised land where we are
[3169.8s] headed to your moving with God. Uh dear
[3173.4s] brother and sister who is with us up to
[3176.2s] this end. We just want to encourage you
[3178.5s] to walk this journey with us. We started
[3180.3s] with the operation. We are seeing the
[3181.7s] bushes burning and and the next week we
[3184.2s] are going to look at a rough start. I'm
[3186.6s] looking forward to that experience so
[3188.6s] that we can see what God can do and then
[3191.4s] you will understand this phrase that
[3193.0s] says what God can do does not exist. Um
[3197.5s] I'm calling upon uh Raphael you can
[3200.0s] offer the closing prayer as we finish
[3202.2s] this session. Thank you for being with
[3203.9s] us.
[3204.5s] Let's believe and pray. Our kind loving
[3207.2s] father and master who art in heaven, we
[3208.8s] thank you and praise your name that even
[3210.7s] in an age in which men and women have
[3214.3s] forgotten you, men and women are well
[3216.8s] nigh eras your presence and your law
[3219.9s] from the land. You still come to us and
[3224.1s] say that you have seen us dear Lord that
[3226.7s] you have heard us and dear Lord that you
[3229.0s] know our situation and our circumstances
[3232.1s] in a special way. I pray dear Lord like
[3234.7s] that bush may you set us on fire. May
[3237.8s] you give us a purpose. May you give us a
[3239.7s] mission. May you give us may we find
[3242.9s] meaning in life dear Lord help us to
[3245.9s] embrace and to step up dear Lord to
[3248.4s] those positions and to those places that
[3250.6s] you're calling us to occupy. And dear
[3253.0s] Lord I pray may we may you utterly throw
[3257.0s] down and and refuse to accept our
[3260.6s] excuses. And dear Lord, set up our
[3263.6s] appointments for therein we shall see
[3266.6s] you and your power. And dear Jesus, we
[3269.3s] know we shall be the better for it. Be
[3271.2s] with us. Make this our experience as we
[3273.0s] continue our pray in Jesus name.
[3274.6s] Amen.
[3275.4s] Amen.
