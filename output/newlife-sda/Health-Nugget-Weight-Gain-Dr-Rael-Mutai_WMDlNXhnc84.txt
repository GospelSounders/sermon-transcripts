TIMESTAMPED TRANSCRIPT:
[11.0s] uh good morning and happy
[13.2s] Sabbath yes so um this is another
[16.4s] opportunity that we're going to have the
[18.4s] he nugget for the week and I just want
[21.6s] us to pray as we start let's pray Our
[24.8s] Father in heaven we thank you for this
[27.0s] blessed Sabbath that you've given us how
[29.1s] I pray that in these Health nuggets that
[31.5s] somebody will get something that they
[33.0s] can practice and Implement in their life
[35.2s] so that they can enhance their health
[36.8s] and well-being for the good of your
[38.8s] service and for the good of humanity
[40.6s] because we are pray trusting and
[42.0s] believing in jesus' name
[44.8s] amen uh today we just want to say a few
[48.2s] words about uh weights and obesity and
[52.5s] especially for those uh women in the age
[55.2s] bracket 45 to 50 years and we are saying
[58.8s] this because this issue is becoming
[61.2s] important because many uh the lifespan
[64.0s] for people has increased as time goes by
[66.6s] we know that our lives expectancy here
[68.8s] in Kenya is about 68 years meaning that
[71.8s] many people live beyond their menopausal
[74.6s] period and are likely to experience
[76.8s] certain changes so the reality is that
[79.6s] between 40 and 50 years for most women
[82.0s] there will be a change in their
[83.3s] structure and in their weight weight
[84.8s] gain becomes a reality that we face and
[88.5s] this is because of the hormonal changes
[90.8s] that happen just because we are aging so
[93.5s] it is a normal physiological process it
[95.8s] is not an illness but still um because
[100.0s] of these changes you are not able to
[102.0s] manage your weight and yet we know that
[104.0s] when you have excess weight which is
[106.3s] described as uh it becomes obesity when
[108.8s] it is more than 20% of your of your
[111.8s] ideal weight then you are at risk of
[114.0s] many diseases and therefore it becomes
[116.0s] important to watch what happens to your
[118.4s] weight especially at this point in time
[120.8s] the explanation is already given it's
[122.7s] because of the hormonal changes the
[124.4s] hormones that used to protect us before
[126.8s] we reached menopause most of that has
[129.3s] become less and we know it is mainly the
[131.4s] estrogen hormone so that protection has
[133.8s] been lost you are basically exposed so
[135.9s] what happens is that because of those
[138.0s] changes you gain weight the there is fat
[140.9s] that you gain uh some fat distribution
[143.3s] that is more on your abdomen as opposed
[145.4s] to your hips and the thighs your
[147.3s] cholesterol levels tend to be higher
[149.1s] than normal and therefore you naturally
[151.2s] become a candidate for diabetes for COV
[153.9s] vascular diseases and all the
[155.4s] complications that come with that so
[157.7s] what then are you supposed to do as we
[159.8s] go into that age group because I know
[161.8s] even in this church we are many in that
[164.0s] age group dealing with many other
[165.5s] symptoms that come with menopause and
[167.3s] per menopause weight management becomes
[169.8s] one of those things that we must uh be
[173.4s] uh intentional about what we do about it
[176.2s] and there is no really treatment you
[177.9s] cannot tell you that this is what you
[179.4s] are going to take so that your weight
[181.6s] remains within reasonable margin it it
[184.1s] it involves doing many different things
[186.4s] one thing you must remember is that at
[188.3s] this point in time uh the calories that
[191.2s] you normally Ed to require to maintain
[193.1s] your weight has declined by 20 to 30% so
[196.6s] what it means is that for the food that
[198.4s] you have been eating before 45 you need
[201.0s] to reduce the calorie content by up to
[203.1s] 20 or 30% so if you used to eat two
[205.4s] chapatis per meal it basically says you
[208.0s] have to come down to about one and
[210.0s] probably you may need to cut down some
[211.6s] of those so it's about the quality of
[213.8s] food and the quantity because you do not
[215.9s] need all those calories any extra
[217.6s] calorie that you take in will be
[219.3s] converted into fat and that fat will be
[221.4s] manifested around your abdominal area
[223.8s] you know that normally it's the men who
[225.8s] who store fat in the abdominal areas
[227.8s] women store it in the hips and the
[229.7s] thighs but now at this age we just you
[232.6s] know move on to that other group of
[234.7s] people who are storing excess fat around
[236.9s] their abdomen so what you need to do is
[239.4s] to exercise modify your diet and of
[242.7s] course in extreme cases other drugs may
[245.1s] be prescribed for those who may need but
[247.5s] in most setups
[254.4s] people hello you don't need to take any
[257.1s] drugs but you just exercise and modify
[259.6s] your diet and it should be fine so in
[262.1s] conclusion what we are saying is that
[264.2s] gaining weight in per menopause
[266.4s] menopause is a normal physiological
[268.8s] process and therefore we need to be
[271.1s] intentional about how we manage our
[273.2s] weight and specifically what we eat and
[276.1s] become more active so that we do not
[278.6s] gain the excess weight which can
[280.0s] predispose us to serious illnesses that
[283.2s] tends are being very expensive and
[285.0s] costly so thank you and may God bless
[287.4s] you even as we celebrate the Sabbath
[289.7s] thank you
