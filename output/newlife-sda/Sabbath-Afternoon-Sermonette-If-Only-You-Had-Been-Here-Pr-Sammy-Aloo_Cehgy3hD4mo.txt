FULL TRANSCRIPT:
What do you say to elder? What do you say to elder? Uh thank you so much my elder for the wonderful introduction. I want to thank you so much for finding time uh to come and to sit at the feet of Jesus. Uh the Lord indeed has been powerful and wonderful to us from morning. The first sermon that I did in this church was on the third Sabbath of June 2021 when I came to this church as a pastor. Today on the third Sabbath of the month of June, I'm doing my farewell sermon. What do you say? So, thank you so much, New Life. Uh you've nurtured me for four years. Our young children have grown. They came here when they were so little. Now we'll be leaving when they have grown. They can run and they're very up. I want to thank the church, the entire church, the pastors, the elders for making this possible that the former pastors may come back to be able to say as much. uh my colleague pastor Ezra preached in the morning on the value of gratitude and that was powerful. So we praise God for his ministry as well. I want to recognize the presence of professor. Professor should stand up and wave. We thank you so much uh for coming. Professor is my friend. Some of you are not waving. I'm giving you time to wake uh up. Uh thank you so much for finding time to come. What do you say to the redemption uh singers? I'm just taking time to introduce myself and to relax. Yeah, it is not good to just come and start preaching. So, you have to actually relax and then you begin the session. Our topic this afternoon, this evening is from the book of John. And this is a powerful text. John 1 34:21 11 21 or 34. That will be my sharing. But the sharing simply says, if only you had been here. If only you had been what? Here. I can't see you. I can't hear you. If only you had been what? Here. If only you had been here. Uh, this is not a statement of regret. It is a statement of legacy. If only you had been here. If only you had been here. I really want to appreciate the choristers for singing so well. That is coming soon. Is coming what? Again. When Christ comes again, there will be no more death, sorrow, no more crying. Everything will be a new in Jesus name. Hey, you are because you are not with me. Let me say it again. When Christ shall come again, there'll be no tired legs and tired eyes. Hey, let me look at the choir. Hallelujah. When Christ shall come again, there will be no graves for the graves will be forced to cast out the dead in Jesus' name. When he comes for the second time, I love it because when Jesus shall come, there will be no young man having lost his heir like me. All of us will be equipped. Hey, so I'm giving you time to smile. You are not smiling. Hallelujah. When Christ is going to come again, there will be nothing like divorce. There'll be nothing like court cases. When Christ shall come, everything will be a new in Jesus name. So that song is powerful. When he comes, it's coming again. Glory ah to his name. If only you had been here. If only you had been here. Turn with me to the book of John. John 11. John 11. John 11. I'm very far. I don't know if Elder you allow me to move. I'm very far. Uh thank you so much. If only you had been here. If only you had been here. That's a powerful statement. Yeah. It's a statement of someone missing someone and he says that I wish daddy was here. Things are not making sense. You've lost your husband. Now they're taking your land. And so when you are crying, you say, "If only my husband was here." Hey. Hallelujah. It's a powerful statement. If you are an orphan, they have frustrated you. They have taken everything your parents left to you. They have taken everything. They are even threatening to kick you out of the homes that you are in. Sometimes you cry in the night and you say, "If only my parents were here." And some people go through so much. They go through so much. They cry every time. Sometimes they struggle with school fee and then they cry. You don't see the tears, but in their heart they say, "Only if daddy was here. You are the one still asleep. Are you with me? If someone is missing a wife, you say, "If only my wife was here." Because God is always faithful. If only you had been here. Eternal Father, speak to us in Jesus name. Amen. John 11 John 11:28 28 to 34. 34 And when she had come, are you with me? If you're with me, say amen. And then it says, "And when she said she had said these things, she went away and secretly called Mary her sister, saying, "The teacher has come and is calling for you." I love the introduction because Mary is been crying because Lazarus is dead. It has been 4 days since they buried Lazarus and things are not making sense. The background says they had sent to Jesus to come when Lazarus started showing signs of weakness. And so they sent to him saying, "Master, him that thou love so much is sick." Are you with me Adventist? Because Lazarus is dead and the Bible says that God love Jesus loved Lazarus, Martha and Mary. All of the three were loved by Jesus. And so one who become sick who is Lazarus and the Bible says that Lazarus is sick but his sickness is unto death. For why is his sickness unto death? His organs are collapsing. His eyesight had grown deep. No one was making sense. He could not talk. He could not eat. Lazarus was dying and so they sent saying master him that loveth is what is sick. Thank you. But I was enjoying myself like this. Are you with me? Lazarus is sick. And I'm saying that Lazarus was a close friend to Jesus. What do you do then when you have been in church and you become so sick? What do you do when they told you that Jesus loves you and now you have lost your job? Him that you lovest has lost his job. And the Bible says Jesus delays and he comes back 4 days when Lazarus is dead. And so Mary first go to Jesus. Martha Martha is so much in her hand because 21 says, "Mother saws Jesus coming and she runs to Jesus and she says, "Master, I wish you were here. My brother wouldn't have died. If only you are here." Hey, and the Bible says Jesus stood where Martha met him. And so Martha run to the house. She calls Mary. She says, "Mary, come. The master has arrived." Hey, let me put this thing down first. The master is come and the master is in need of you. Are you with me? I'm beginning to enjoy this thing. First he says that she says that Mary you are crying master is come. You see Jesus was so powerful that he walked with the power. The blinds were healing being having their sights restored. The lame could walk. He could utter a word and the sick will be healed. So they didn't ask Jesus say a word and my brother will be healed. He said please come because Lazarus is sick. And Jesus delays because the master is so powerful that even when you are sick the master will say John arise and walk Jesus the master has come. Are you with me? The master has come. So if you are sick my friend the master has come. If your children in church wip your tears my friend the master has come and is in need of you. I love Jesus because he's so powerful that even when you have given up the master is here. Are you with me? Christ is powerful that when you have lost your relatives, you are left alone in the home. Don't think that he's far. The master is here. He's here. When you don't have food, no, everyone you trusted has turned their back on you. Don't give up. The master is here and is in need of you. Hey, are you with me? I'm in the background. Lazarus simply means God as help. The name Lazarus in Hebrew, L for Elohim, and then Zaras mean God as help. Hey, so the name Lazarus is a testimony that don't just look at me. I'm a man, the master as help. Hey, let me look at this cho. Are you with me? He said that when you think I'm tired, when you think I'm I've grown, when you think I've increased in power, my friend, there's a power behind me. The master has helped me. So, she goes, she says, "Ah, Mary, Mary." And Mary is crying and weeping. Let me tell you, if you are weeping because things are bad, the master is here. This row is sleeping. Let me try this one. Hallelujah. When things are bad, things are bad. You know what I don't like about this country? When the European in European and America, people are talking of Lamborghini and all of these clothes. When you are broken up with your wife, you ask them, "Bring back my phraser." But in Kenya, they are saying, "Bring back my tooth." You see, I don't understand all these thing. All small things small things that when you break instead of asking up for good thing but I'm saying my friend that when the devil has threatened your marriage to break up don't worry the master is here hey hallelujah and the master is in need of you Jesus is powerful that he's not walking alone people with testimonies are following him are you with You see he's not alone. He's walking in power and behind him is a magnitude of people who are following Jesus. Behind Jesus is a mother who has been bleeding for 12 years. And God was able to shut the bleeding. Hallelujah. So he says there's a master here. There's a master here. And then she's also walking with those who are blind like Batamas following him. But is a testimony my friend that I was once blind but the master restored my sight. Ah these guys are not with me. This sermon is difficult for you. No it is very simple. Behind Jesus are testimonies of people women who are crying Mary Magdalene who was caught in adultery is following Christ. The master is here. So they are following up with Jesus. And Jesus stood and the Bible says, "Mother runs to Mary and she says, Mary the master is here and is in need of you." Are you with me? So let me talk to someone here. You are discouraged. Things are not making sense. You have lost your job. The person you trusted has turned your back on you. You are empty. I'm simply saying don't give up. The master is here and today the master is answering your prayers. Hallelujah. Don't give up. The master is here and she is in need of you. If that was me, I would have said God. Hey God. But let me tell you, God has been faithful to me. Hey, hallelujah. This God that we serve is a powerful God. Those who know my testimony, you understand that if God picked me from being a caretaker for two years and brought me to Nairobi as a security guard and brought me to New Life to preach as a pastor, the master is here. If that Jesus who picked me up in the village, took me to Kio and became a caretaker at Kio Central for 2 years, brought me to Nairobi the first time to train as a security guard and that Jesus brought me here in a suit, the master is here. Hey, and you talk to someone who is wondering, is the master there? If the master picked me up having left school in class 6 went and became a a as a a a cameraman for my uncle for two years took me back to class 8 direct the master is here. Are you with me? Some of us give up so easily and when you say my friend the master is here they give they get discouraged. My friend if you are an orphan you are left alone. The master is here and is in need of you. The testimony cuz someone is saying pastor I want to commit suicide. I want to commit suicide. And so you're saying why do you want to commit suicide? Because they I left home. They kicked me away. My parents died. My sister also died. I'm left alone. Pastor, I want to die. I want to die. I said, why do you want to die? Why do you want to die? Because pastor, I've been looking for a job for 10 years. No job. No job. Pastor, I have struggle. I want to die now. As simply rolling, my friend, keep on pushing. The master is here. So he says, Mary, don't cry. The master is here and is in need, is calling for you. You understand that? That Mary, Mary simply mean one who cries, who weeps or the blessed one. Are you with me? So she runs, she calls Mary. Let me read this further because I also want to be brief and disappear from this pulpit. And when she had said these things, she went away and secretly called Mary her sister, saying, "The teacher has come and is calling for you." Vers 29. As soon as she heard that, she arose quickly and came to him. She knew that all the problems the master will answer. You see, when you have lost everything, only Jesus can set you free. There are people who think that their connections will help them. My friend, a time will come when connections can all help you. Only the master can come through for you. Let me try this one. There are people who trust their bank account so much. You have millions in the account. So you think that life is so smooth. No, no, no, no. There's a time which is going to come that only Jesus can help you. Money cannot help you. Only Jesus can. And there are people with the children in America. In America, some are in Australia. Some are in Canada. They trust those children so much that even in the village where we are just supposed to listen to the word of God, someone take 20 minutes in conveying the the greetings of their children in America. That even in Jerry who is in Canada has sent you a a greeting. What do you say? You think she's over again? Even John who is in Australia sent a greeting and you have these mothers in the village. Tell them to shut up. A time is going to come that only Jesus will matter. The master is here and is calling for you. And this woman, the Bible says she rose up quickly and followed Martha. Do you think she's crying? Are you with me? She was crying at the Jews. The Bible said the Jews had gathered about her. They came from Bethany everywhere to build them, to grieve with them. So the entire family the compound is filled up. They have come for death rituals. No the Jews they they are doing something called death rituals. So they have come with all manner of stuff for death rituals. They are be able to clean him up and put him to put him bur him. But for 4 days the master arrives. Let me tell you Jesus is never late. He's always on time. Are you with me? There are people worry, I'm 45, I'm not married. My friend, your time will come. You can get married at 60 and produce children, four children at once. I'm looking at men. So, let me look at women because these men are wondering what is this now? Because Jesus is so powerful that he's never late. It is only humans that look at you saying, "Oh, you are 47. The husband has not come. My friend to God you are is never late is always on time. I'm looking at my elders here. I'm simply saying elder elder that when you have god that is all that matters. So let me read that. Now Jesus had not yet come into the town but was in the place where Martha met him. Then the Jews who were with her in the house and comforting her when they saw that Mary rose up quickly and went out followed her saying she is going to the tomb to weave there. I don't like these people, Elder. I don't like these people because there are people who who pretend to weep with you, yet they are pushing you to even weep and continue weeping. Are you with me? Mary has been grieving the the death of the brother and then she left. They're simply saying she's going to the tomb to weep more. So why are they following her to weave more? No, the master is here. Are you with me? Because Jesus is everything that you need. I keep telling people that the way I came to Nairobi is very strange because I had not set foot in Nairobi. I was coming for the first time. I was very busy as a kateka at Kioento serving serving. So I prayed and then I said, "God, I'm tired. the people who are with me in primary are in in at university now. How long do you want me to keep cleaning this church? I was cleaning the church. How long do you want me to keep cleaning this church? So I sat down on a Thursday, sat down just praying, just praying because I knew that God answers prayers. Are you with me? So at K central I've cleaned the house and I sat somewhere because G is very muddy and rainy. So when you clean, you have done your cleaning. On Thursday, Friday you leave the podium because the choir will come to practice. So you are waiting for them to then disappear and then you clean. So on Thursday I pray I say God I know you are there. Hey, for how long do you want me to keep cleaning this toilet and the church? I'm tired. Do something. So God use an elder. When I'm seated there, God uses one elder and the elder calls me and say, "Sammy, Sammy, but then I'm a caretaker. Sammy, how are you? There's a company employing people, employing people." So I'm saying, "Which company is this?" So go home, bring your certificate. I go to Assumi, I bring my certificate, arrive in the middle of the night on Friday. I'm there waiting for elder to come and pick me. He does not come. So I call him elder. My certificates are here. Where are you? He says, my friend, I'm very far. You go to Tail. That company is in tot. The field is the compound is filled up with young people looking for job. I'm also there. I'm also there. God wanted me to come to Nairobi for the first time. My enemies are silent. But let me look at this one now. For the first time and so they took me. So we have four people 100 of people who are running because I didn't know people are running. I'm wondering why are these people running? So they told us run. So we we are running. When you came back where are your certificates? What is your so out of the hundreds of young people only four of us were picked. My enemies are silent. Let me look at this one. Picked and then they tell us on Monday you are in Nairobi. The first time I'm here in Nairobi the first I don't have anyone in Nairobi. So the four of us I'm at Lu the three are challenges. So we compare notes. What do you do? Do you have a brother? Yes, I have a brother. So one says I have a brother in Comarox. So he says okay now we are friends let us go. So we come so on they saying Monday you are in Nairobi that means we have to travel on Sunday we are in Nairobi the first time you see I was used to the buildings in Kerjo Kjo is so green but when I came to Westlands I could see tall buildings the master is here are you with me and I've stayed in Nairobi from that time to now to cut the story short the lord that we serve is a master planner He's never late. He's always on time. So don't cry thinking that God is is not with you. The God that we serve is a powerful God. He can change your story. He can change your testimony. He can change your history. He can change your family. The master is here. And the Bible says Mary followed mother. But this people says she's going to the tomb to cry more. I'm almost through. follows through. And then vers 30 says, John, we are in John 11:30 says, "Now Jesus and 31 says, John 11:31, yeah, Jesus, then the Jews who who were with her, I've read that one house and comforting her. When they saw that Mary rose up quickly and went out followed her, saying she is going to the tomb to weep there." Then when Mary came where Jesus Hey, are you with me? I'm in verses what? 30 30 32 no 33. Therefore, when Jesus saw uh uh No, I mean 32 32. Then when Mary came where Jesus was and saw him, she fell down at his feet saying to him, "Lord, if if you had been here, my brother wouldn't have died." Are you with me? He says, "If you are here, master, I wish you were here. I wish that Jesus was here." See, this is not a statement of regret. It is a statement of legacy. Are you with me? If you're with me, say amen. If you had been here, you see in a generation where things are not making sense, sometimes you can kneel and say, "If only so and so were here, things would would have been different." I come I came to that point severally where I say if only my father was here with me sometimes I I look at things how they run and I say if only my father was here is this thing working are you getting me if only my father was here these things I'm seeing I wouldn't have seen them there are things these people are saying that if only Christ had come, Lazarus wouldn't have died. If Christ was with us every time, if so and so was here, things will be different. Let me ask you a question. Who will cry when you die? In Kalu they have a say a saying which says that uh pretend you are dead to know those who love you. This one let me look at this one. It says that sometimes just pretend you are dying. Yeah. Just pretend. Go to your room and pretend you and you see how many people will cry. Who will mourn when you are gone? In other word, when your seat will be empty, who will say I wish Elco was here? These things wouldn't have opened this way. Hallelujah. I remember that all of us, God has given us opportunity and the power to touch lives when you are still alive. Because when you are gone the people who we touch their lives will say I wish that pastor Sammy was here because you serve here today tomorrow you are a former like me now I'm a former so the question is how many people can testify and say in this pastor's farewell if only he was Here you see authority is not permanent. Are we together? Even the best singers in the world, a time is going to come when the best singers will be tired and they will not have the stage. If only you are here. Are you with me? I love this statement. A day is going to come when the strong now will become so weak. With those with the eyes seeing like this, one day the eyes will not see anymore. There will be no retreats. There will be no flying to preach. A day is going to come who will say that I wish so and so was here. Let me tell you my friend, let us touch lives when God gives us opportunity because a day is going to come when our legs will be so tired to climb up the stairs. Hey. Yeah. They don't want to listen to that. Let me go down this way. You know, some people have buildings and your bedroom is on in on on fifth floor. That is where you sleep because your your legs are still tired. My friend, begin to create a room downstairs. Because when your legs are tired, bring your bed down now to prepare you for the time to come. Who will cry when you die? This story tells us that if Jesus is in the equation, then nothing is impossible. Amen. If Christ is living in your heart, pray more. Pray more. But even as you pray, always connect yourself with God. We are praying for you that God will guide this church continually in Jesus' name. And we know that if only the master is allowed to guide, the church will stand. So don't weep cuz the master is here. Are you with me? Don't give up. The master is here. And the Bible says Christ, I mean 33, if only you are here, my brother, my wound have died. 33 Therefore, when Jesus saw a weeping and the Jews who were with her also weeping, he was grow he groaned in uh in the spirit and was trouble. So your your trouble, your sorrows touches the heart of God. I have an uncle now dead and this uncle with his wife he had a wife who is also dead. So when you are young this wife the rest of the day she was okay but when it is almost raining she calls me she says they used to call me Otis come comet is for born in the night come so I go to her and then she says I want you to go to the market to buy me kit when it is almost raining almost raining. I saw because her husband was so fierce. Her husband husband had something called boa yo. No, let me try to translate this in in something called naun. Are you getting me? You know, I don't know how to mention that in English. So husband had this thing that when you mess up, your husband will deal with you thoroughly. So when she's it is almost raining, she says go and buy Mickey. So you go by the time you buy kibiti you are on your way coming back it is drizzling and raining suddenly so you have to actually try to make the kibiti you know kiriti do you know what I'm talking about you have to know make kiriti uh dry so you keep the kiriti in on on in your armpit you put it down there but you see some water are very notorious that even when you have tried so much they find a way of accessing the kibit So by the time you come home she refused to cook. Say now you brought you brought wet kibit. So when the husband arrives the husband arrives you are on the table like this. She begins saying oh so and so I sent you to go and get kiriti. You decided to go when it was raining and you come back. You see some women, some women, I do not know what's wrong with them. So the husband, he say go out. So uh he take you outside the the house, you lie on the on the wet grass and he works on you seriously. I think some of the back pain that I have now is because of this man. May his soul rest in peace. Are you with me? What am I trying to say? Which legacy are you leaving when you are gone? Will someone say like mother and Mary, master, I wish you are here. If only you are here, my brother would have died. Hallelujah. Have Jesus in your heart. May God walk with you. May the Lord hold you. Hallelujah. May the Lord who has journeyed with us, may that Lord keep you moving. If only the master was here. And I'm praying that if your family is going through difficulties, don't give up. Let the master reign supreme. Let me look at this one. Hallelujah. You know I'm saying that even if you are a student, things are not making sense. Always and it's gone. Always ask Jesus to hold your hands. Let the master guide you. I want to pray with all of us that God will hold our hands. But I want to say and to leave you with this question. If you are not seated there, your seat is empty. Will someone say, "I wish Elder so and so, brother so and so was here." This is not a statement of regret. It is a statement of legacy. That live well to the extent that when you are gone, someone will say I wish so and so was here. But you see how you touch lives is what is important with me. I want to thank those who have held my hands from the time I joined the ministry to this point. I want to thank New Life for the platform to serve here for four four years. I want to thank God for the wisdom that I've acquired here because one day I will say only if I was there. Hey, hallelujah. Things would have changed. Hallelujah. If only you are here. Who will cry when you gone? Who will weep when you are dead? Who will visit you when you cannot walk? who will cry with you when you have lost a relatives. If only the master was here. I'm praying that God will walk with you. God will all your aunts. I will always cherish beautiful memories. The wisdom I've acquired here is enough. No, being in new life is being at the university. So the wisdom I've acquired here is enough to journey with me throughout my life. Amen. Amen. I want to pray with someone here who is going through hell and you are saying God I just want you to be the master in my art. Hallelujah. So if you're there let me see you raise your hand. Raise your hand. Raise your hand. Stand up on your feet. I want to pray with you. Uh if only you are here. But I want to pray that uh as we begin also the PCM week, our pastor is here. I I want him to come and pray with us. I want to extend the invitation to someone who is going through hell and you want God to guide you and to walk with you. Let him be your master. Just join me here. We pray together as I invite pastor Mensah to come to pray with us. Pastor Mensah are sharing after this. If you have prayer, just come. I want to pray with you. Pastor is going to pray with us. If only Jesus was here. Let this be our experience that Jesus is powerful and is mighty. He answers prayers. Our senior pastor is here. Pastor, you can join. Uh Pastor Jared is here. You can come. I want to pray with you that even as we pray, just come, just walk and come. If the master was here, uh, let God guide you. Jesus is with you. You never alone. He's powerful. He's mighty. And I know that is going to answer your prayers. The master is here and is calling for you. He's in need of you. Just walk and come. Walk and come. We want to pray that God will hold our hands after this. I think the chesters will do a song and then pastor Mensa will pick up uh from there. So we want to pray that uh as we start the PCM week of prayer, may this week be a blessing. I'll try to sneak in also some of the days, but I know that the God that we serve is powerful and is mighty. May the Lord bless us as we come. Please come. We want to pray with you. I want to pray with you. Yeah. that God will watch over you. The master is here and he's not far is here. Is here walking with you and guiding you continually. Some of you are very far. Move closer fast. Move closer so that we we pray together. May the Lord bless you. May the Lord keep you in Jesus name. So you want to pray. You want to pray. My pastor here will pray. Pastor Mesa will pray for all of us. I think I'll pray and then pastor will come after me. Do you have another mic or there's another mic there? Thank you. Thank you. We want to pray. Let us bow our heads even as we pray together. Eternal Father, some of us have gone through hell. Some of us have had dark nights. Some of us tears have become their bread day and night. But father today we are encouraged because the master is here. And father we are praying that we may wipe these tears in Jesus name. That those who have sought for jobs that those who have cried overnight that those who are going through relationship difficulties that those who have sought for jobs no job is coming. Father, answer their prayers in Jesus name. Lord, you are a faithful God. Bless New Life Church. We can only say thank you for the number of years we've been here. Lord, we are praying that you'll take charge, continue guiding this church as we've done in the past. Use the pastors, the new pastors who are here that Lord, this church will continue to grow in Jesus name. Father, we thank you for pastor Gerad. We thank you for pastor Nangaw. We thank you for pastor Elvis. Father, I'm praying that you use these pastors continually. Bless them, Father. And Lord, I'm praying for the wisdom from above that Lord, as they discharge their mandate, Father, may they leave a legacy that one day someone will say, "I wish this pastor was here." Father, bless Pastor Mensah. We'll be starting the PCM week of prayer shortly. I'm praying that you bless him and his entire family. Bless the wonderful men and women who are standing here. Some have gone through difficulties. Bless the wonderful elders of this church. Those who have served with us, the head elders who served with us, Elder, Elder Mura, Elder Rotic and Elder Yo, and their families. And Lord, I'm praying that you bless the pastors who serve together with us. Indeed, our stay here was wonderful. As we leave Jesus, we are praying that your grace will abound in their marriages, in their families, in their businesses, and in the work that they do. Let them discharge their mandates without fear or favor knowing very well that the master is here. Walk with us continually as you all are. And some have cried for job answer jobs. Some have prayed for spouses. Bring spouses. Some are praying that Lord you may be able to occupy the spaces that their loved ones vacated. And Lord we know that the master is here and is calling for all of us. Keep blessing us. Let your name be magnified for we ple it in Jesus name. Amen.

[39.1s] of June, I'm doing my farewell sermon.
[44.2s] What do you say? So, thank you so much,
[47.2s] New Life. Uh you've nurtured me for four
[49.8s] years. Our young children have grown.
[52.6s] They came here when they were so little.
[54.6s] Now we'll be leaving when they have
[56.8s] grown. They can run and they're very up.
[59.8s] I want to thank the church, the entire
[62.5s] church, the pastors, the elders for
[66.6s] making this possible that the former
[68.7s] pastors may come back to be able to say
[72.5s] as much. uh my colleague pastor Ezra
[75.9s] preached in the morning on the value of
[79.2s] gratitude
[80.7s] and that was powerful. So we praise God
[83.2s] for his ministry as well. I want to
[85.8s] recognize the presence of professor.
[88.9s] Professor should stand up and wave. We
[91.1s] thank you so much uh for coming.
[94.4s] Professor is my friend. Some of you are
[96.1s] not waving. I'm giving you time to wake
[98.9s] uh up. Uh thank you so much for finding
[102.0s] time to come. What do you say to the
[103.4s] redemption uh singers? I'm just taking
[106.5s] time to introduce myself and to relax.
[108.9s] Yeah, it is not good to just come and
[111.0s] start preaching. So, you have to
[112.4s] actually relax and then you begin the
[115.4s] session.
[117.0s] Our topic this afternoon, this evening
[121.2s] is from the book of John. And this is a
[124.2s] powerful text. John
[126.9s] 1 34:21
[129.2s] 11 21 or 34. That will be my sharing.
[133.6s] But the sharing simply says, if only you
[137.7s] had been here.
[140.9s] If only you had been what? Here. I can't
[144.7s] see you. I can't hear you. If only you
[147.7s] had been what? Here. If only you had
[151.3s] been here. Uh, this is not a statement
[155.4s] of regret. It is a statement of legacy.
[159.0s] If only you had been here. If only you
[162.9s] had been here. I really want to
[164.1s] appreciate the choristers for singing so
[166.6s] well. That is coming soon. Is coming
[169.5s] what? Again. When Christ comes again,
[173.1s] there will be no more death, sorrow, no
[175.8s] more crying. Everything will be a new in
[178.8s] Jesus name. Hey, you are because you are
[181.8s] not with me. Let me say it again. When
[184.4s] Christ shall come again, there'll be no
[186.8s] tired legs and tired eyes.
[191.9s] Hey, let me look at the choir.
[193.4s] Hallelujah. When Christ shall come
[196.1s] again, there will be no graves for the
[198.6s] graves will be forced to cast out the
[201.1s] dead in Jesus' name. When he comes for
[203.9s] the second time, I love it because when
[206.4s] Jesus shall come, there will be no young
[208.9s] man having lost his heir like me. All of
[212.6s] us will be equipped. Hey,
[215.8s] so I'm giving you time to smile. You are
[217.4s] not smiling. Hallelujah. When Christ is
[220.2s] going to come again, there will be
[222.0s] nothing like divorce. There'll be
[223.8s] nothing like court cases. When Christ
[226.0s] shall come, everything will be a new in
[228.6s] Jesus name.
[231.4s] So that song is powerful. When he comes,
[233.9s] it's coming again. Glory ah to his name.
[238.2s] If only you had been here.
[242.8s] If only you had been here. Turn with me
[245.8s] to the book of John. John 11. John 11.
[253.0s] John 11. I'm very far. I don't know if
[256.3s] Elder you allow me to move.
[258.8s] I'm very far. Uh thank you so much. If
[263.0s] only you had been here.
[267.0s] If only you had been here. That's a
[270.5s] powerful statement. Yeah. It's a
[272.8s] statement of someone missing someone and
[275.6s] he says that I wish daddy was here.
[279.0s] Things are not making sense. You've lost
[282.2s] your husband. Now they're taking your
[284.0s] land. And so when you are crying, you
[286.2s] say, "If only my husband was here."
[290.9s] Hey. Hallelujah. It's a powerful
[294.3s] statement. If you are an orphan, they
[296.5s] have frustrated you. They have taken
[298.2s] everything your parents left to you.
[300.6s] They have taken everything. They are
[302.0s] even threatening to kick you out of the
[304.0s] homes that you are in. Sometimes you cry
[306.2s] in the night and you say, "If only my
[308.7s] parents were here."
[312.0s] And some people go through so much. They
[313.9s] go through so much. They cry every time.
[316.2s] Sometimes they struggle with school fee
[318.2s] and then they cry. You don't see the
[319.7s] tears, but in their heart they say,
[321.7s] "Only if daddy was here.
[325.9s] You are the one still asleep. Are you
[328.4s] with me? If someone is missing a wife,
[330.9s] you say, "If only my wife was here."
[334.3s] Because God is always faithful. If only
[337.3s] you had been here. Eternal Father, speak
[341.0s] to us in Jesus name. Amen. John 11 John
[346.1s] 11:28
[348.2s] 28
[350.2s] to 34.
[354.2s] 34
[356.4s] And when she had come, are you with me?
[360.2s] If you're with me, say amen.
[363.1s] And then it says, "And when she said she
[365.7s] had said these things, she went away and
[369.9s] secretly called Mary her sister, saying,
[373.8s] "The teacher has come and is calling for
[376.9s] you."
[378.8s] I love the introduction because Mary is
[382.3s] been crying because Lazarus is dead. It
[385.7s] has been 4 days since they buried
[387.9s] Lazarus and things are not making sense.
[391.0s] The background says they had sent to
[393.0s] Jesus to come when Lazarus started
[395.9s] showing signs of weakness. And so they
[399.1s] sent to him saying, "Master, him that
[401.8s] thou love so much is sick." Are you with
[405.3s] me Adventist? Because Lazarus is dead
[408.8s] and the Bible says that God love Jesus
[411.5s] loved Lazarus, Martha and Mary. All of
[414.8s] the three were loved by Jesus. And so
[417.5s] one who become sick who is Lazarus and
[420.1s] the Bible says that Lazarus is sick but
[422.9s] his sickness is unto death. For why is
[425.6s] his sickness unto death? His organs are
[428.6s] collapsing. His eyesight had grown deep.
[431.6s] No one was making sense. He could not
[433.8s] talk. He could not eat. Lazarus was
[436.4s] dying and so they sent saying master him
[439.8s] that loveth is what is sick.
[443.7s] Thank you. But I was enjoying myself
[445.5s] like this. Are you with me? Lazarus is
[449.4s] sick. And I'm saying that Lazarus was a
[451.9s] close friend to Jesus. What do you do
[454.2s] then when you have been in church and
[456.0s] you become so sick? What do you do when
[458.2s] they told you that Jesus loves you and
[460.1s] now you have lost your job? Him that you
[462.3s] lovest has lost his job.
[465.4s] And the Bible says Jesus delays and he
[469.0s] comes back 4 days when Lazarus is dead.
[472.5s] And so Mary first go to Jesus. Martha
[475.0s] Martha is so much in her hand because 21
[477.4s] says, "Mother saws Jesus coming and she
[480.2s] runs to Jesus and she says, "Master, I
[483.4s] wish you were here. My brother wouldn't
[486.2s] have died. If only you are here." Hey,
[491.0s] and the Bible says Jesus stood where
[493.5s] Martha met him. And so Martha run to the
[496.6s] house. She calls Mary. She says, "Mary,
[500.0s] come. The master has arrived." Hey, let
[503.3s] me put this thing down first.
[506.2s] The master is come and the master is in
[509.6s] need of you.
[513.0s] Are you with me? I'm beginning to enjoy
[515.4s] this thing. First he says that she says
[517.8s] that Mary you are crying
[521.7s] master is come. You see Jesus was so
[524.7s] powerful that he walked with the power.
[526.8s] The blinds were healing being having
[529.3s] their sights restored. The lame could
[531.6s] walk. He could utter a word and the sick
[534.1s] will be healed. So they didn't ask Jesus
[536.2s] say a word and my brother will be
[538.1s] healed. He said please come because
[540.6s] Lazarus is sick. And Jesus delays
[544.1s] because the master is so powerful that
[546.3s] even when you are sick the master will
[548.2s] say John arise and walk Jesus the master
[552.6s] has come.
[556.2s] Are you with me? The master has come. So
[559.3s] if you are sick my friend the master has
[562.4s] come.
[564.6s] If your children in church wip your
[566.8s] tears my friend the master has come and
[569.6s] is in need of you.
[573.0s] I love Jesus because he's so powerful
[575.5s] that even when you have given up the
[578.2s] master is here.
[581.1s] Are you with me? Christ is powerful that
[583.6s] when you have lost your relatives, you
[585.5s] are left alone in the home. Don't think
[588.0s] that he's far. The master is here.
[592.1s] He's here. When you don't have food, no,
[595.0s] everyone you trusted has turned their
[596.7s] back on you. Don't give up. The master
[599.5s] is here and is in need of you. Hey,
[604.6s] are you with me? I'm in the background.
[607.8s] Lazarus simply means God as help. The
[612.0s] name Lazarus in Hebrew, L for Elohim,
[615.1s] and then Zaras mean God as help. Hey, so
[619.4s] the name Lazarus is a testimony that
[621.8s] don't just look at me. I'm a man, the
[624.1s] master as help. Hey,
[627.9s] let me look at this cho. Are you with
[629.8s] me? He said that when you think I'm
[631.8s] tired, when you think I'm I've grown,
[635.0s] when you think I've increased in power,
[637.1s] my friend, there's a power behind me.
[639.3s] The master has helped me. So, she goes,
[642.6s] she says, "Ah, Mary, Mary." And Mary is
[646.3s] crying and weeping. Let me tell you, if
[649.5s] you are weeping because things are bad,
[652.8s] the master is here.
[655.8s] This row is sleeping. Let me try this
[658.0s] one. Hallelujah.
[659.9s] When things are bad, things are bad. You
[663.0s] know what I don't like about this
[664.5s] country? When the European in European
[666.8s] and America, people are talking of
[668.5s] Lamborghini and all of these clothes.
[670.7s] When you are broken up with your wife,
[672.3s] you ask them, "Bring back my phraser."
[675.1s] But in Kenya, they are saying, "Bring
[677.0s] back my tooth." You see, I don't
[678.4s] understand all these thing. All small
[681.0s] things small things that when you break
[683.4s] instead of asking up for good thing but
[685.4s] I'm saying my friend that when the devil
[688.0s] has threatened your marriage to break up
[690.6s] don't worry the master is here
[694.2s] hey hallelujah and the master is in need
[697.9s] of you Jesus is powerful that he's not
[702.0s] walking alone people with testimonies
[705.5s] are following him
[708.5s] are you with
[709.9s] You see he's not alone. He's walking in
[712.6s] power and behind him is a magnitude of
[716.3s] people who are following Jesus. Behind
[719.7s] Jesus is a mother who has been bleeding
[722.2s] for 12 years. And God was able to shut
[725.9s] the bleeding. Hallelujah. So he says
[728.3s] there's a master here. There's a master
[730.0s] here. And then she's also walking with
[731.9s] those who are blind like Batamas
[734.1s] following him. But is a testimony my
[737.0s] friend that I was once blind but the
[739.3s] master restored my sight.
[742.5s] Ah these guys are not with me. This
[744.5s] sermon is difficult for you. No it is
[746.3s] very simple. Behind Jesus
[749.8s] are testimonies of people women who are
[753.0s] crying Mary Magdalene who was caught in
[755.8s] adultery is following Christ. The master
[758.3s] is here. So they are following up with
[761.4s] Jesus. And Jesus stood and the Bible
[764.1s] says, "Mother runs to Mary and she says,
[767.9s] Mary the master is here and is in need
[771.5s] of you."
[775.5s] Are you with me? So let me talk to
[777.8s] someone here. You are discouraged.
[781.0s] Things are not making sense. You have
[783.4s] lost your job. The person you trusted
[786.2s] has turned your back on you. You are
[787.9s] empty. I'm simply saying don't give up.
[790.6s] The master is here and today the master
[793.4s] is answering your prayers. Hallelujah.
[795.6s] Don't give up. The master is here and
[798.2s] she is in need of you. If that was me, I
[802.8s] would have said God.
[805.7s] Hey God. But let me tell you, God has
[809.3s] been faithful to me. Hey, hallelujah.
[812.3s] This God that we serve is a powerful
[814.4s] God. Those who know my testimony, you
[817.4s] understand that if God picked me from
[820.7s] being a caretaker for two years and
[823.2s] brought me to Nairobi as a security
[825.8s] guard and brought me to New Life to
[827.8s] preach as a pastor, the master is here.
[832.8s] If that Jesus
[835.0s] who picked me up in the village, took me
[838.8s] to Kio and became a caretaker at Kio
[841.4s] Central for 2 years, brought me to
[843.4s] Nairobi the first time to train as a
[846.0s] security guard and that Jesus brought me
[849.0s] here in a suit, the master is here.
[853.6s] Hey, and you talk to someone who is
[857.0s] wondering, is the master there? If the
[860.2s] master picked me up having left school
[863.2s] in class 6 went and became a a as a a a
[866.9s] cameraman for my uncle for two years
[869.7s] took me back to class 8 direct the
[872.8s] master is here.
[875.7s] Are you with me? Some of us give up so
[878.3s] easily and when you say my friend the
[880.6s] master is here they give they get
[882.5s] discouraged. My friend if you are an
[884.2s] orphan you are left alone. The master is
[887.4s] here and is in need of you.
[890.9s] The testimony cuz someone is saying
[892.7s] pastor I want to commit suicide. I want
[895.1s] to commit suicide. And so you're saying
[896.6s] why do you want to commit suicide?
[898.0s] Because they I left home. They kicked me
[900.5s] away. My parents died. My sister also
[903.1s] died. I'm left alone. Pastor, I want to
[905.8s] die. I want to die. I said, why do you
[907.7s] want to die? Why do you want to die?
[909.6s] Because pastor, I've been looking for a
[911.3s] job for 10 years. No job. No job.
[914.7s] Pastor, I have struggle. I want to die
[917.0s] now. As simply rolling, my friend, keep
[919.7s] on pushing. The master is here.
[925.0s] So he says, Mary, don't cry. The master
[929.4s] is here and is in need, is calling for
[933.4s] you. You understand that? That Mary,
[937.1s] Mary simply mean one who cries, who
[939.6s] weeps or the blessed one.
[943.5s] Are you with me? So she runs, she calls
[947.1s] Mary. Let me read this further because I
[950.3s] also want to be brief and disappear from
[952.6s] this pulpit.
[954.5s] And when she had said these things, she
[957.4s] went away and secretly called Mary her
[961.0s] sister, saying, "The teacher has come
[964.0s] and is calling for you." Vers 29. As
[967.8s] soon as she heard that, she arose
[971.1s] quickly and came to him. She knew that
[974.8s] all the problems the master will answer.
[978.7s] You see, when you have lost everything,
[981.6s] only Jesus can set you free. There are
[984.6s] people who think that their connections
[986.0s] will help them. My friend, a time will
[988.6s] come when connections can all help you.
[991.6s] Only the master can come through for
[993.8s] you.
[996.9s] Let me try this one. There are people
[1000.6s] who trust their bank account so much.
[1003.6s] You have millions in the account. So you
[1005.4s] think that life is so smooth. No, no,
[1007.0s] no, no. There's a time which is going to
[1009.4s] come that only Jesus can help you. Money
[1012.9s] cannot help you. Only Jesus can.
[1018.4s] And there are people with the children
[1020.1s] in America. In America, some are in
[1023.0s] Australia. Some are in Canada. They
[1025.4s] trust those children so much that even
[1028.0s] in the village where we are just
[1029.8s] supposed to listen to the word of God,
[1031.7s] someone take 20 minutes in conveying the
[1034.5s] the greetings of their children in
[1036.5s] America. That even in Jerry who is in
[1039.1s] Canada has sent you a a greeting. What
[1041.1s] do you say? You think she's over again?
[1043.8s] Even John who is in Australia sent a
[1046.3s] greeting and you have these mothers in
[1047.8s] the village. Tell them to shut up. A
[1050.1s] time is going to come that only Jesus
[1052.4s] will matter.
[1055.6s] The master is here and is calling for
[1059.8s] you. And this woman, the Bible says she
[1062.5s] rose up quickly and followed
[1067.1s] Martha. Do you think she's crying?
[1071.7s] Are you with me? She was crying at the
[1074.0s] Jews. The Bible said the Jews had
[1075.7s] gathered about her. They came from
[1078.8s] Bethany everywhere to build them, to
[1082.3s] grieve with them. So the entire family
[1085.0s] the compound is filled up. They have
[1087.4s] come for death rituals. No the Jews they
[1089.8s] they are doing something called death
[1091.4s] rituals. So they have come with all
[1093.8s] manner of stuff for death rituals. They
[1096.5s] are be able to clean him up and put him
[1098.9s] to put him bur him. But for 4 days the
[1102.5s] master arrives. Let me tell you Jesus is
[1107.8s] never late. He's always on time.
[1112.4s] Are you with me? There are people worry,
[1115.0s] I'm 45, I'm not married. My friend, your
[1118.1s] time will come. You can get married at
[1120.3s] 60 and produce children, four children
[1123.4s] at once.
[1125.6s] I'm looking at men. So, let me look at
[1127.4s] women because these men are wondering
[1128.7s] what is this now?
[1131.4s] Because Jesus is so powerful
[1134.6s] that he's never late. It is only humans
[1137.9s] that look at you saying, "Oh, you are
[1139.8s] 47. The husband has not come. My friend
[1143.3s] to God you are is never late is always
[1147.0s] on time. I'm looking at my elders here.
[1150.7s] I'm simply saying elder elder that when
[1154.8s] you have god
[1157.0s] that is all that matters.
[1161.0s] So let me read
[1163.3s] that. Now Jesus had not yet come into
[1167.4s] the town but was in the place where
[1170.2s] Martha met him. Then the Jews who were
[1173.2s] with her in the house and comforting her
[1177.2s] when they saw that Mary rose up quickly
[1181.3s] and went out followed her saying she is
[1185.0s] going to the tomb to weave there. I
[1188.4s] don't like these people,
[1190.8s] Elder. I don't like these people because
[1195.4s] there are people who who pretend to weep
[1198.4s] with you, yet they are pushing you to
[1201.0s] even weep and continue weeping.
[1204.6s] Are you with me? Mary has been grieving
[1208.5s] the the death of the brother and then
[1211.0s] she left. They're simply saying she's
[1213.8s] going to the tomb to weep more. So why
[1217.2s] are they following her to weave more?
[1219.6s] No, the master is here. Are you with me?
[1224.6s] Because Jesus is everything that you
[1226.7s] need. I keep telling people that the way
[1230.2s] I came to Nairobi is very strange
[1232.1s] because I had not set foot in Nairobi. I
[1235.0s] was coming for the first time. I was
[1237.6s] very busy as a kateka at Kioento serving
[1241.1s] serving. So I prayed and then I said,
[1244.3s] "God, I'm tired.
[1246.2s] the people who are with me in primary
[1248.3s] are in in at university now. How long do
[1251.2s] you want me to keep cleaning this
[1253.2s] church? I was cleaning the church. How
[1255.4s] long do you want me to keep cleaning
[1257.3s] this church? So I sat down on a
[1259.3s] Thursday, sat down just praying, just
[1262.0s] praying because I knew that God answers
[1264.7s] prayers. Are you with me? So at K
[1267.9s] central I've cleaned the house and I sat
[1271.1s] somewhere because G is very muddy and
[1275.4s] rainy. So when you clean, you have done
[1277.6s] your cleaning. On Thursday, Friday you
[1280.6s] leave the podium because the choir will
[1282.3s] come to practice. So you are waiting for
[1284.2s] them to then disappear and then you
[1286.6s] clean. So on Thursday I pray I say God
[1290.2s] I know you are there. Hey, for how long
[1294.4s] do you want me to keep cleaning this
[1296.2s] toilet and the church? I'm tired. Do
[1299.1s] something.
[1300.9s] So God use an elder. When I'm seated
[1303.9s] there, God uses one elder and the elder
[1305.8s] calls me and say, "Sammy, Sammy, but
[1308.5s] then I'm a caretaker. Sammy, how are
[1310.6s] you? There's a company employing people,
[1312.9s] employing people." So I'm saying, "Which
[1314.8s] company is this?" So go home, bring your
[1317.0s] certificate. I go to Assumi, I bring my
[1319.0s] certificate, arrive in the middle of the
[1320.5s] night on Friday. I'm there waiting for
[1323.2s] elder to come and pick me. He does not
[1325.1s] come. So I call him elder. My
[1327.8s] certificates are here. Where are you? He
[1330.0s] says, my friend, I'm very far. You go to
[1332.0s] Tail. That company is in tot.
[1339.2s] The field is the compound is filled up
[1341.4s] with young people looking for job. I'm
[1344.2s] also there. I'm also there. God wanted
[1347.8s] me to come to Nairobi for the first
[1349.9s] time.
[1351.6s] My enemies are silent. But let me look
[1353.4s] at this one now. For the first time and
[1356.8s] so they took me. So we have four people
[1359.8s] 100 of people who are running because I
[1361.8s] didn't know people are running. I'm
[1363.1s] wondering why are these people running?
[1364.6s] So they told us run. So we we are
[1366.6s] running. When you came back where are
[1368.1s] your certificates? What is your so out
[1370.7s] of the hundreds of young people only
[1373.0s] four of us were picked.
[1375.8s] My enemies are silent. Let me look at
[1377.8s] this one. Picked and then they tell us
[1381.8s] on Monday you are in Nairobi.
[1384.8s] The first time I'm here in Nairobi the
[1387.4s] first I don't have anyone in Nairobi. So
[1389.4s] the four of us I'm at Lu the three are
[1393.9s] challenges. So we compare notes. What do
[1397.4s] you do? Do you have a brother? Yes, I
[1399.2s] have a brother. So one says I have a
[1400.9s] brother in Comarox. So he says okay now
[1403.2s] we are friends let us go. So we come so
[1407.4s] on they saying Monday you are in Nairobi
[1409.6s] that means we have to travel on Sunday
[1412.1s] we are in Nairobi the first time you see
[1414.6s] I was used to the buildings in Kerjo Kjo
[1417.4s] is so green but when I came to Westlands
[1420.1s] I could see tall buildings
[1422.7s] the master is here
[1425.6s] are you with me and I've stayed in
[1428.0s] Nairobi from that time to now to cut the
[1430.8s] story short the lord that we serve is a
[1433.5s] master planner He's never late. He's
[1435.8s] always on time.
[1438.5s] So don't cry thinking that God is is not
[1441.8s] with you. The God that we serve is a
[1445.1s] powerful God. He can change your story.
[1447.7s] He can change your testimony. He can
[1449.5s] change your history. He can change your
[1451.6s] family. The master is here. And the
[1453.5s] Bible says Mary followed mother. But
[1456.5s] this people says she's going to the tomb
[1458.6s] to cry more.
[1461.0s] I'm almost through. follows through. And
[1464.6s] then vers 30 says, John, we are in John
[1468.6s] 11:30 says, "Now Jesus and 31 says, John
[1473.0s] 11:31, yeah, Jesus, then the Jews who
[1476.7s] who were with her, I've read that one
[1478.9s] house and comforting her. When they saw
[1481.1s] that Mary rose up quickly and went out
[1484.0s] followed her, saying she is going to the
[1486.4s] tomb to weep there." Then when Mary came
[1490.6s] where Jesus
[1492.6s] Hey, are you with me? I'm in verses
[1494.6s] what?
[1496.2s] 30 30 32 no 33. Therefore, when Jesus
[1500.8s] saw uh uh No, I mean 32 32. Then when
[1505.4s] Mary came where Jesus was and saw him,
[1509.3s] she fell down at his feet saying to him,
[1512.8s] "Lord, if if you had been here, my
[1517.7s] brother wouldn't have died."
[1521.0s] Are you with me? He says, "If you are
[1523.6s] here, master,
[1526.1s] I wish you were here.
[1529.3s] I wish that Jesus was here." See, this
[1532.0s] is not a statement of regret.
[1534.6s] It is a statement of legacy.
[1538.6s] Are you with me? If you're with me, say
[1540.8s] amen.
[1545.8s] If you had been here,
[1548.6s] you see in a generation where things are
[1551.8s] not making sense, sometimes you can
[1554.7s] kneel and say, "If only so and so were
[1558.3s] here, things would would have been
[1561.2s] different."
[1563.0s] I come I came to that point severally
[1565.1s] where I say if only my father was here
[1571.3s] with me sometimes I I look at things how
[1574.5s] they run and I say if only my father was
[1577.4s] here is this thing working are you
[1580.2s] getting me
[1582.3s] if only my father was here these things
[1585.5s] I'm seeing
[1588.1s] I wouldn't have seen them there are
[1590.2s] things these people are saying that if
[1592.5s] only Christ had come, Lazarus wouldn't
[1595.8s] have died. If Christ was with us every
[1599.0s] time, if so and so was here, things will
[1602.6s] be different.
[1607.4s] Let me ask you a question.
[1610.4s] Who will cry when you die?
[1617.0s] In Kalu they have a say a saying which
[1620.6s] says that uh pretend you are dead to
[1624.0s] know those who love you. This one let me
[1627.1s] look at this one. It says that sometimes
[1629.9s] just pretend you are dying. Yeah. Just
[1633.2s] pretend. Go to your room and pretend you
[1638.8s] and you see how many people will cry.
[1644.1s] Who will mourn when you are gone? In
[1647.0s] other word, when your seat will be
[1649.7s] empty, who will say I wish Elco was
[1653.2s] here?
[1654.8s] These things wouldn't have opened this
[1656.6s] way. Hallelujah. I remember that all of
[1660.1s] us, God has given us opportunity and the
[1663.7s] power to touch lives when you are still
[1666.1s] alive. Because when you are gone the
[1669.3s] people who we touch their lives will say
[1672.6s] I wish that pastor Sammy was here
[1677.4s] because you serve here today tomorrow
[1680.6s] you are a former like me now I'm a
[1682.7s] former
[1685.3s] so the question is
[1687.9s] how many people can testify and say in
[1691.9s] this pastor's farewell
[1694.9s] if only he was Here
[1698.0s] you see authority is not permanent. Are
[1700.3s] we together? Even the best singers in
[1702.6s] the world, a time is going to come when
[1705.0s] the best singers will be tired and they
[1707.6s] will not have the stage. If only you are
[1711.0s] here.
[1713.4s] Are you with me? I love this statement.
[1716.2s] A day is going to come when the strong
[1719.5s] now will become so weak.
[1722.3s] With those with the eyes seeing like
[1724.0s] this, one day the eyes will not see
[1725.9s] anymore. There will be no retreats.
[1728.6s] There will be no flying to preach. A day
[1730.8s] is going to come who will say that I
[1733.4s] wish so and so was here. Let me tell you
[1736.6s] my friend, let us touch lives
[1739.8s] when God gives us opportunity
[1743.5s] because a day is going to come
[1746.1s] when our legs will be so tired to climb
[1749.0s] up the stairs.
[1751.2s] Hey. Yeah. They don't want to listen to
[1752.8s] that. Let me go down this way. You know,
[1755.9s] some people have buildings and your
[1758.2s] bedroom is on in on on fifth floor. That
[1761.0s] is where you sleep because your your
[1763.3s] legs are still tired. My friend, begin
[1766.2s] to create a room downstairs. Because
[1768.6s] when your legs are tired, bring your bed
[1771.3s] down now to prepare you for the time to
[1774.6s] come. Who will cry when you die?
[1779.0s] This story tells us that
[1782.7s] if Jesus is in the equation, then
[1785.8s] nothing is impossible. Amen.
[1789.0s] If Christ is living in your heart, pray
[1792.2s] more. Pray more. But even as you pray,
[1795.3s] always connect yourself with God. We are
[1797.4s] praying for you that God will guide this
[1799.9s] church continually in Jesus' name. And
[1802.5s] we know that if only the master is
[1805.5s] allowed to guide, the church will stand.
[1809.7s] So don't weep cuz the master is here.
[1814.2s] Are you with me? Don't give up. The
[1817.4s] master is here. And the Bible says
[1821.4s] Christ, I mean 33, if only you are here,
[1826.4s] my brother, my wound have died. 33
[1829.2s] Therefore, when Jesus saw a weeping and
[1833.0s] the Jews who were with her also weeping,
[1836.9s] he was grow he groaned in uh in the
[1840.3s] spirit and was trouble. So your your
[1843.6s] trouble, your sorrows touches the heart
[1847.0s] of God.
[1850.3s] I have an uncle
[1852.8s] now dead and this uncle with his wife he
[1858.6s] had a wife who is also dead.
[1861.6s] So when you are young this wife
[1865.7s] the rest of the day she was okay but
[1868.3s] when it is almost raining
[1871.6s] she calls me she says they used to call
[1874.8s] me Otis come comet is for born in the
[1879.5s] night come so I go to her and then she
[1883.5s] says I want you to go to the market to
[1886.5s] buy me kit
[1889.0s] when it is almost raining almost
[1891.6s] raining. I saw because her husband was
[1895.0s] so fierce. Her husband husband
[1898.2s] had something called boa yo. No, let me
[1901.3s] try to translate this in in something
[1904.6s] called naun. Are you getting me? You
[1906.5s] know, I don't know how to mention that
[1908.7s] in English. So husband had this thing
[1912.2s] that when you mess up, your husband will
[1914.9s] deal with you thoroughly.
[1917.2s] So when she's it is almost raining, she
[1919.0s] says go and buy Mickey. So you go by the
[1922.0s] time you buy kibiti you are on your way
[1923.8s] coming back it is drizzling and raining
[1926.2s] suddenly so you have to actually try to
[1928.6s] make the kibiti you know kiriti do you
[1931.0s] know what I'm talking about you have to
[1932.5s] know make kiriti uh dry so you keep the
[1935.8s] kiriti in on on in your armpit you put
[1940.6s] it down there but you see some water are
[1943.8s] very notorious that even when you have
[1945.5s] tried so much they find a way of
[1947.9s] accessing the kibit
[1951.2s] So by the time you come home
[1954.7s] she refused to cook. Say now you brought
[1957.4s] you brought wet kibit.
[1961.1s] So when the husband arrives the husband
[1963.5s] arrives
[1965.2s] you are on the table like this. She
[1967.2s] begins saying oh so and so I sent you to
[1970.6s] go and get kiriti. You decided to go
[1972.9s] when it was raining and you come back.
[1975.0s] You see some women, some women, I do not
[1978.2s] know what's wrong with them. So the
[1979.8s] husband, he say go out. So uh he take
[1983.1s] you outside the the house, you lie on
[1985.4s] the on the wet grass and he works on you
[1988.2s] seriously. I think some of the back pain
[1990.8s] that I have now is because of this man.
[1993.3s] May his soul rest in peace.
[1997.7s] Are you with me?
[2000.2s] What am I trying to say?
[2002.8s] Which legacy are you leaving when you
[2005.8s] are gone? Will someone say like mother
[2009.0s] and Mary, master, I wish you are here.
[2013.4s] If only you are here,
[2016.2s] my brother would have died. Hallelujah.
[2019.5s] Have Jesus in your heart. May God walk
[2023.0s] with you. May the Lord hold you.
[2025.4s] Hallelujah. May the Lord who has
[2027.5s] journeyed with us, may that Lord keep
[2029.8s] you moving. If only the master was here.
[2034.8s] And I'm praying that if your family is
[2038.4s] going through difficulties, don't give
[2040.8s] up. Let the master reign supreme.
[2045.3s] Let me look at this one. Hallelujah. You
[2048.1s] know I'm saying that even if you are a
[2050.6s] student, things are not making sense.
[2054.6s] Always
[2056.9s] and it's gone. Always ask Jesus to hold
[2061.0s] your hands. Let the master
[2064.2s] guide you. I want to pray with all of us
[2069.5s] that God will hold our hands. But I want
[2073.0s] to say and to leave you with this
[2075.0s] question. If you are not seated there,
[2078.7s] your seat is empty. Will someone say, "I
[2082.5s] wish Elder so and so, brother so and so
[2085.7s] was here." This is not a statement of
[2089.2s] regret. It is a statement of legacy.
[2092.6s] That live well to the extent that when
[2094.9s] you are gone, someone will say I wish so
[2099.2s] and so was here.
[2101.9s] But you see
[2104.2s] how you touch lives is what is important
[2107.0s] with me. I want to thank those who have
[2108.5s] held my hands from the time I joined the
[2111.1s] ministry to this point. I want to thank
[2113.9s] New Life for the platform to serve here
[2116.1s] for four four years. I want to thank God
[2118.3s] for the wisdom that I've acquired here
[2120.9s] because one day I will say only if I was
[2124.6s] there. Hey, hallelujah. Things would
[2128.0s] have changed. Hallelujah. If only you
[2131.0s] are here. Who will cry when you gone?
[2134.8s] Who will weep when you are dead? Who
[2137.7s] will visit you when you cannot walk? who
[2140.5s] will cry with you when you have lost a
[2142.6s] relatives. If only the master was here.
[2147.8s] I'm praying that God will walk with you.
[2151.4s] God will all your aunts. I will always
[2154.0s] cherish beautiful memories. The wisdom
[2156.4s] I've acquired here is enough. No, being
[2159.4s] in new life is being at the university.
[2162.2s] So the wisdom I've acquired here is
[2164.2s] enough to journey with me throughout my
[2167.8s] life. Amen. Amen. I want to pray with
[2170.0s] someone here who is going through hell
[2173.7s] and you are saying God I just want you
[2176.2s] to be the master in my art. Hallelujah.
[2179.0s] So if you're there let me see you raise
[2181.8s] your hand. Raise your hand. Raise your
[2184.6s] hand. Stand up on your feet. I want to
[2186.5s] pray with you. Uh if only you are here.
[2191.0s] But I want to pray that uh
[2194.1s] as we begin also the PCM week, our
[2196.6s] pastor is here. I I want him to come and
[2200.0s] pray with us. I want to extend the
[2203.4s] invitation to someone who is going
[2205.5s] through hell and you want God to guide
[2208.2s] you and to walk with you. Let him be
[2211.0s] your master. Just join me here. We pray
[2213.7s] together as I invite pastor Mensah to
[2215.8s] come to pray with us. Pastor Mensah are
[2219.0s] sharing after this. If you have prayer,
[2221.3s] just come. I want to pray with you.
[2222.9s] Pastor is going to pray with us. If only
[2225.8s] Jesus was here. Let this be our
[2229.8s] experience that Jesus is powerful and is
[2233.0s] mighty. He answers prayers. Our senior
[2235.3s] pastor is here. Pastor, you can join. Uh
[2237.5s] Pastor Jared is here. You can come. I
[2240.5s] want to pray with you that even as we
[2243.3s] pray, just come, just walk and come. If
[2247.5s] the master was here,
[2250.6s] uh, let God guide you. Jesus is with
[2252.7s] you.
[2254.5s] You never alone. He's powerful. He's
[2257.7s] mighty. And I know that is going to
[2262.0s] answer your prayers. The master is here
[2265.8s] and is calling for you. He's in need of
[2269.3s] you. Just walk and come. Walk and come.
[2272.3s] We want to pray that God will hold our
[2275.3s] hands after this. I think the chesters
[2277.3s] will do a song and then pastor Mensa
[2279.5s] will pick up uh from there. So we want
[2282.5s] to pray that uh as we start the PCM week
[2285.9s] of prayer, may this week be a blessing.
[2289.3s] I'll try to sneak in also some of the
[2291.5s] days, but I know that the God that we
[2293.9s] serve is powerful and is mighty. May the
[2297.6s] Lord bless us as we come. Please come.
[2299.9s] We want to pray with you. I want to pray
[2302.2s] with you. Yeah. that God will watch over
[2305.9s] you. The master is here and he's not far
[2312.0s] is here. Is here walking with you and
[2316.6s] guiding you continually. Some of you are
[2320.1s] very far. Move closer fast. Move closer
[2322.5s] so that we we pray together.
[2325.6s] May the Lord bless you. May the Lord
[2327.7s] keep you in Jesus name. So you want to
[2330.5s] pray. You want to pray. My pastor here
[2333.3s] will pray. Pastor Mesa will pray for all
[2336.6s] of us. I think I'll pray and then pastor
[2339.4s] will come after me. Do you have another
[2342.2s] mic or there's another mic there?
[2346.2s] Thank you.
[2348.9s] Thank you. We want to pray. Let us bow
[2351.6s] our heads even as we pray together.
[2354.1s] Eternal Father, some of us have gone
[2357.4s] through hell. Some of us have had dark
[2361.4s] nights. Some of us tears have become
[2364.3s] their bread day and night. But father
[2367.2s] today we are encouraged because the
[2369.0s] master is here. And father we are
[2371.8s] praying that we may wipe these tears in
[2374.0s] Jesus name. That those who have sought
[2376.1s] for jobs that those who have cried
[2377.8s] overnight that those who are going
[2379.7s] through relationship difficulties that
[2382.1s] those who have sought for jobs no job is
[2384.3s] coming. Father, answer their prayers in
[2387.2s] Jesus name. Lord, you are a faithful
[2389.4s] God. Bless New Life Church. We can only
[2392.2s] say thank you for the number of years
[2393.9s] we've been here. Lord, we are praying
[2396.1s] that you'll take charge, continue
[2398.4s] guiding this church as we've done in the
[2400.1s] past. Use the pastors, the new pastors
[2402.4s] who are here that Lord, this church will
[2404.7s] continue to grow in Jesus name. Father,
[2407.1s] we thank you for pastor Gerad. We thank
[2410.0s] you for pastor Nangaw. We thank you for
[2412.0s] pastor Elvis. Father, I'm praying that
[2413.8s] you use these pastors continually. Bless
[2416.6s] them, Father. And Lord, I'm praying for
[2418.6s] the wisdom from above that Lord, as they
[2420.8s] discharge their mandate, Father, may
[2423.4s] they leave a legacy that one day someone
[2426.1s] will say, "I wish this pastor was here."
[2429.6s] Father, bless Pastor Mensah. We'll be
[2432.1s] starting the PCM week of prayer shortly.
[2435.6s] I'm praying that you bless him and his
[2437.4s] entire family. Bless the wonderful men
[2439.8s] and women who are standing here. Some
[2442.6s] have gone through difficulties. Bless
[2444.6s] the wonderful elders of this church.
[2447.0s] Those who have served with us, the head
[2448.8s] elders who served with us, Elder, Elder
[2451.8s] Mura, Elder Rotic and Elder Yo, and
[2454.2s] their families. And Lord, I'm praying
[2456.0s] that you bless the pastors who serve
[2457.8s] together with us. Indeed, our stay here
[2460.9s] was wonderful. As we leave Jesus, we are
[2463.6s] praying that your grace will abound in
[2465.8s] their marriages, in their families, in
[2468.1s] their businesses, and in the work that
[2469.8s] they do. Let them discharge their
