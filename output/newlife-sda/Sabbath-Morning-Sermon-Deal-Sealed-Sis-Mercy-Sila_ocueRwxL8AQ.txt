FULL TRANSCRIPT:
Speak to the children of God. Happy Sabbath church. Happy day. Uh I would like to start by acknowledging the effort of the teachers that have been working with the children all through from Monday Tuesday. I'm sure the parents are happy. I'm sure you felt relieved. And what a a better place to be than at Jesus' feet. Let's give the teachers a good amen. Amen. Thank you so much. Teachers, please feel appreciated and believe this a star in your crown. Just fight and strive for that day that the crown will have its honor so that you can enjoy the stars. I'm not ignorant of the fact that us as parents will still make some very mean statements about you, how you managed our children within the week, but that should not break your spirit. Hang on there. That's what our Christ did for all the time that he was here. He taught us. He fed us. He performed great miracles. But we still f found faults on him. So please hang in there such that if you are called upon next year, you're not hanging your boots. You are ready to serve these little children. I want to tell you, dealing with these people is not easy. The person who was dealing with the teens, that was amazing. That group is not easy to handle. They're not even sure of their voices. You try the soprano, they switch to alto. You try the young men to do tenner, they switch to bass. You ask them now, let's do the bass, they tell you, teacher, we are gone. And they walk out of the gate. The person who was managing the teens, may God sincerely bless you. The high schoolers, that was awesome. Your friend just mentioned that that was a lastm minute arrangement. Is that so? Wow, that was so so amazing. Believe me, God will bless you church. Uh without taking much of your time, I'd like us to begin the word of the day, the children have learned about Elijah. They were taught how he visited a widow and the supplies never ran out. They were fed day in day out until the drought was gone. They were taught of a fire that came from heaven and poured down. And I like what the Bible records it leaked everything from the burnt offering to the water that was poured around the trenches. They thought of Elijah even after being with God for all that time got scared at some point and he ran away. He ran away. He didn't want to meet the people that he was still prophesying to them about this great God. I believe they learned about a man who was all flesh and blood but managed to remain faithful until he was hixed away through the whale wind by the chariot. I believe these children are wellfed and as we are crowning we're going to share something small. It might be slightly different but it is perfectly in tune with what the children were learning because it's still under the mountain of miracles. Let us pray so that we begin. Dear God who lives in heaven, it has pleased you that we share this moment together with my brothers at New Life. Oh God who reigns forever, this is our prayer. What do you have for us today? What do you want us to learn about you today? Will it help us grow spiritually, dear God? Will it draw us closer to your feet? Will it strengthen our faith? Will it let us know more about you? Oh father who reigns forever, we are waiting. Speak. your children are listening and all glory and honor will be upon your name. Our humble plea in Jesus' name. Amen. Like what our apostle said, what was captured is that the deal is sealed. I said, "We're going to address another man, another great giant of faith, and then walk with him all through the mountains, and within a very short time, we will be done." You don't keep children waiting for long. We're going to look at a wonderful gentleman who is called by the name of Moses. Moses and Elijah, as much as they appeared at Jesus transfiguration, they share similar characteristics. And that is why I want us partly to pick on Elijah, dwell more on Moses, and then we wrap up and we'll have something to carry us throughout the week. Elijah came at a time when they had already settled in the land of Canaan. Moses happened centuries before Elijah came to being and Moses had a physical journey to deliver these children to the promised land. The deal was sealed. God had had their plea from the land of Egypt. And by hearing their plea, he did his map work very well. The layout was complete. I will pick Moses. I will walk with him to the palace and then we will bring out these children and I'll take them to Canaan. There was a very important meeting by the burning bush. A very important God was there and Moses and they had a wonderful conversation and the conversation was complete and then the journey began. I want us to walk with Moses through all this and then by the time we getting to Deuteronomy 34, we will be done and I pray that the lesson will be home. Moses received all the instructions and he participated in several phases. The journey from Egypt had um I would call them three phases. I don't know how you'd like to interpret them, but they were split into several of them. The first one was the um exchange between him and the king. Let my people go today. Okay, you'll go tomorrow. Something happens. He's not yet convinced. Something else happened until they counted up to 10 and they had to leave. Friends, you'll quickly agree with me at that point that was enough to convince Moses that God is almighty. God is all knowing and God is able to do that which man cannot do. And that was enough to convince you and me we need to rely on this God fully. But what happened to our brother? It was not that easy. And the journey began. So we get into phase two. Along the way these people would get hungry. Our dear Moses would go to God and he would pray. You know, like the way you go to fast food joints and you place your order and cross over the window and you pick your stuff. This is what would happen. Food would be made from heaven and it would come down and it was given a name. They call it mana. When I get to heaven, I would like to test that because every time I read the Bible, they say it was so nice, but there was something about it. You store more than what you needed for the day, it will all get spoiled. That is besides the point. They would get thirsty and then that is where the story began. I don't know it was the tone that they used to approach Moses. I don't know the prevailing circumstances that made Moses so irritated that he forgot who he was dealing with for a moment. I really don't understand what triggered the anger that Moses had. This is so common to most of us, especially when we are dealing with these little angels. Our anger is packed up so easily and we hit them for no reason. Every time you're dealing with these people, please be as gentle as you can. We say this that between zero and 12 like what they have learned the whole of this week will form part of their core memories. This is the absorbent stage. So, how you deal with them, how you respond to their mistakes, count 1 to 10. And by the time you get to number 10, if you still feel that you need to slap them, if you still feel that you need to hit them, please go ahead. You're beyond repair. But by the time you're counting 1 to 10, I want to believe your anger will go low. And you will not repeat what our dear brother did. You will not repeat what he did because that costed him what we're going to see at the tail end of all this story. He hit the rock and that angered his friend, his God, his maker, his creator, his sustainer. How many times does our anger draw us away from our God? A moment of range, you're so furious you cannot even contain your anger. You haul unprintable words. You make some moves that you live to regret. Friends, I want to add you this morning, let us contain our anger. We will see how much it costed our dear brother. When you look at uh the book of Numbers chapter 23:1 19, my Bible record numbers 23:1 19. God is not a man that he should lie. He had promised the land of Canaan. And all along Moses is getting upset and at some point he's getting confused. Is this word real? Will it come to pass? I am leading a bunch of At some point he hurled some insults to them and God was not pleased. When you study that verse, it is a reminder of what they agreed. If there was no canon, he would have said it. If it was something that he was not sure of, I believe my God would have told him, "Let us start the journey. We'll figure it out on the way." But the deal was completely sealed. And Moses did not want to walk this talk. When we move swiftly to the book of John 14:E3, we're going back to the New Testament again. Give me John 14:13. John 14:13. All right, I'm here. My Bible records this. John chapter 14 verse 1-3 sorry John chapter 14 verse 1 to 3. Let not your heart be troubled. You believe in God, believe also in me. In my father's house are many mansions. If it were not so, I would have told you. I go to prepare a place for you. And if I go and prepare a place for you, I will come again and receive you unto myself that where I am, there you may be also. Jesus made this solemn promise to you and to me just like he did with our brother, just like God did with our brother back in the days. He says that he's going to prepare a place for us. Go with me to the book of Deuteronomy 34:1 and 2. Go with me to the book of Deuteronomy 14 verse 1 and 2. It's the last chapter of Deuteronomy. This is the most interesting bit about this whole story. And Moses went up from the plains of Moab and all that and all that. I like the latter part. And the Lord showed him all the land of Gilead and Tudan. He showed him the promised land. They braced the mountain. Getting up a mountain is not easy. But when they got up there, the Lord told him, "Come here, Moses, my friend. You see down there, I told you there's a land flowing with honey and milk. That is the promised land. But sadly, my friend, you will not get there because of your disobedience." He walked the long journey. He did all that appeared right. He did that which was right. He led the children. He spoke with God. He interceded on their behalf. He anointed. He put order in the children of Israel. But here goes the catch. You will not enter because you were disobedient to me. When I asked you to speak to the rock, friends, I'm saying this with a very heavy heart. In our journey of salvation, we pray, we perform miracles, we intercede for the sick, we visit the poor, we go to crusades, we do everything that pertains the work of faith, but something about us tells us that God may get to some point and say, "Mercy, you can only come this far." What does Revelation say 1:7? Revelation 1:7 so that we can compare these two and wind up tells me this and every eye. The little English that I know tells me this every is all inclusive. I don't know why they picked on the people who pierced Jesus cuz they are added. They are given a separate statement. Maybe it was too painful. Maybe the crucification was so humiliating. I don't know why they are given a special sentence by themselves. But when you study that verse, it goes like this. Every eye, your eye, my eye, our friend's eye, the enemy's eye will see Jesus as he's coming down in his cloud. Then what happens after that? It is to your discretion. Moses was brought to Mount Pisgah, but he was told by God, "You can only come this far." Friends, heaven is real. The deal is sealed. He died for us on the cross that we may get eternal life. And his promises are yes and amen. The Bible repeats that time and again. We've seen it in the Old Testament. We saw it in the New Testament out of the key verse. 2 Corinthians chapter 1 verse 20. It is very clear that his promises are yes and amen. He promised to come and take us home. He has promised a heaven. At this point, we have not seen it. Just like our brothers who were following Moses, they had not seen the cannon that they were promised. No, they had not seen it. They had not seen it. But Moses saw it but he did not enter. I don't want this to be the same story about us especially the family of new life SDA. This should not be our story. We will not only see him but we will join him in the heavenly kingdom. We will rejoice with him because we will choose to be obedient. Happy Sabbath. We will follow Jesus when he comes. Our story will not be cut short like our brother Moses. No, you see, we are doing all that which is right. We taking care of these children. They were advised to write the commandments at the doorpost so that they can read when they're going and when they're coming back. We have done exactly that to these children and shock on you. These children will get the lessons that they've been taught and they will follow God to the latter. And just like our two friends that are recorded in Numbers 32:12, they will enter the heavenly kingdom because they will choose to wholly follow God. It will be so sad that our children will make it up there and then us will have what I like calling the Mount Pisgar experience. We will see but we will not enter. That will be so sad. All the hours that we've spent in this ministry, all the efforts, all the energy, the zeal that we've had, how we testify to everyone, we are Adventists. I like it. Even in the corporate world when they're running programs, you'll hear, "Ah, please excuse so and so. He's an Adventist. He'll not be available on Saturday. Let's have it run on Thursday or Monday." We stand firm and we tell the world we're Adventist. But it would be so sad when that time comes and we have a Mount Pisga experience because believe me and I'll repeat and I'll keep repeating it until I leave this pullpit. The deal is sealed. Heaven is real. Christ pronounced this with his own mouth. He said he's only going for a while and he's coming. And when we move swiftly to Revelation, we find the confirmation that he will come and every eye. But then let's read Revelation. Let us read Revelation 1 verse 7. Revelation 1 verse 7. Correct. Behold, he comes with clouds and every eye shall see him. Every eye. I repeat I don't know why the people who pierced him maybe pastor will teach us some other day why they are given their own sentence and all tribes of earth shall wail because of him even so amen that is beautiful but I'm interested in the bit of every eye no exception everybody will see Christ just like Moses who saw the promised land and never got to it is not recorded anywhere he made it of course there's a story of him dying, being buried up there and God coming and all that, but he never stepped in the promised land whereby he was the first person to know of this great secret. The story at the burning bush, we don't have a crowd. We only have the bush burning and God's voice and Moses even his wife was not there. Maybe the witnesses were animals. But in the human race, the person who got the secret that there's a promised land somewhere was Moses. Just like you in your household, the person who got the message of the promised land is you probably introduced your wife or you introduced your husband and then the flock that came after that. But it would be so interesting that this flock that is learning follows the lessons to the latter like what we read in numbers 32:12. Let's see. Let's see numbers 32:12 I quote stuff that is not there. Numbers 32:12. And if you project you just let me know so that I don't take a lot of time flipping through my Bible. 32:12. Correct. My Bible records all that Calb and Joshua I like the latter part for they wholly followed God. That brings us to today's lesson. There is call for total obedience to our God. The opposite of that, the contrary of that is that we will see the Bible will never contradict itself. Yes, we will see him, but we will not go with him. It will be a repeat of history. I like what Solomon keeps on reminding us in the book of Ecclesiastes. There is nothing new under the sun. But it would be so sad to have a repeat of you missing the heavenly kingdom just because of something very small called disobedience. You are called to enjoy a active daily relationship with Christ. How often do we do this? When we were small, when we were in their age, we committed to keeping the morning watch. How active are we doing this? You're called to choose obedience. How many times do we defy what God advises us to do, what he asks us to do? How many times do we make our own statements? How many times do we find stories that are similar to what God wants us to do, but we are so sure that they are drifting from what he wants us to do. Friends, I want to say this at this hour. God will never lower his standards to please man. Mm- He will never lower his standards no matter what. He's never moved by numbers. The numbers that left Egypt, they were big numbers. Simple math will tell you it was like our whole country of Kenya moving in one large group because the numbers that were there. You give them wives, you give the wives children, you give each household servants and the livestock and crown it with a mixed multitude. It was a large number that was moving. But when you study the Bible keenly, you realize that a small insignificant percentage made it to the promised land. Even Captain Major General Buana Moses was not there just because of disobedience. God made sure that he showed him. I was not telling you of a cannon that does not exist. Uh-uh. I am God and I do not lie. I am not a son of man that I will tell a lie. I am God and I speak the truth. Come, Moses, let me show you the promised land. Look down there. It's there. Have you seen it? But you will not taste it. And the Bible records the people who saw were children who were actually born in the journey. They were not there when the journey started. But when they were born like these precious children here, like the teens here, they were taught of a God who lives, of a God who feeds them from heaven, of a God who can take care of them, of a God who will raise a snake when they're beaten. they can when they faced of a great God and they followed this God in all and true to his word he delivered them to the promised land but the major generals and the captains and the other leaders they were missing in this story he calls us to endure trials like our brother Elijah he did all that but at some point he got so lonely and he felt aband abandoned. He felt neglected. But then God revealed himself and showed him that there were others that were in store somewhere that were still ready to serve him. Friends, keep the oils in our lamps just like we are advised in the book of Matthew chapter 25. Matthew chapter 25. It's a very interesting story. All these stories are known to us especially us Adventists who are very very good Bible scholars is the story of the oils and the lambs and the virgins and we know what happened around that time we are asked to keep oil in our lamps. How long are we going to doubt God and how long are we going to doubt his promises? For how long are we going to toy around with the fact that he promised to come and to take us home to his heavenly kingdom? For how long are we going to falter? We're not even sure. Yes, we are doing all that which is right. Because if you study the story of Moses, it's a very interesting one. Even after doing all that, he still had another meeting with God. He was given the he still had another meeting with God. He would meet him face to face. I'm sure if I am to pass this microphone to the adults, they would give me stories confessing of how much God has walked with them. They would tell me, you know, sister Marci, at this point I prayed and heavens came down and this and this came to pass. You have similar stories to tell just like our brother. But are you convinced there's heaven? And if you are convinced there's heaven, what are you doing in readiness for the second coming of Christ? Because believe you me he is coming. The story of redemption does not end at him dying on the cross and disappearing. It will end when he comes like what is recorded in Revelations 1:7. It is sure Jesus will come to take us home. Shall we all gather and have a Mount Pisgah moment watching him come down in clouds? our eyes confirming that yes that is Jesus and then our story ends at that point or will our story continue by inheriting the heavenly kingdom which is our take where do we stand where exactly do we stand and what is our desire because you see like I mentioned God will never lower his standards to please man no matter what we do he will never do that we can disobey all we want. We can sugarcoat the statements as much as we want, but he will never change. When you look at the math, uh we've just done the math of Moses and the Egyptians. Look at the Gideonites. There were 10,000 of them. And God worked with a very small number. A very very small number. And such similar stories are recorded clearly in the scriptures. Now what makes us feel a bit unique that when that time comes he will think about us he will consider our effort he will uh bat one eye but you know he calls for total obedience read with me the book of numbers again we are going to our numbers chapter 23 verse 19 where we started. This verse gives us the concept that God is faithful. God is not a man that he should lie. Neither the son of man that he should repent. Has he said, "Shall he not do it? Or has he spoken and shall he not make it good? God is faithful. He's not only faithful, but he's reliable. I don't know how you view him. I don't know how you analyze him, but friends, I'm here to remind you this. I'm telling you because I know you know, but I'm here to remind you this that God is faithful. I don't know what you've petitioned to him. I don't know what item you've brought to him. Our brother would bring very big prayer requests being pushed by the multitude that he was leading and not a single one of them did not come to pass. Even the moment they asked him, "We want to see that God. We want to see that God. That God you keep telling us you're going to meet him. We want to see him." Then he went to God and he told him, "Dear God, your people, they are no longer his now. Your people want to see you." That was a bit clear. That was a bit weird. But what did he say? Go and tell them to prepare. I'll come. Not interested in the details of their preparation and all. I'm interested in the bit that they asked to see him and he still obliged. Forget about the food, the crossing of the Red Sea. They asked to see him eye to eye. He did not refuse. He said, "I'll come." What have we taken to God in prayer? What faith do we have that he'll bring it to pass? He has brought it to pass. Are we still obedient enough? Are we hanging on his word that he will come and take us home like the song that we did? The promises are very sweet, but are we willing to walk the talk? Are we willing to hang in there until he comes and takes us home? or we will walk and then at some point he'll say, "Dear friend, my dear one, you can only come this far. Ha, Peter, this one is beyond you. This is for the heavenly bodies. This is for them that obeyed me fully. This is for them that are ready for the heavenly kingdom." What is your take? When we look at Elijah, we're winding up. Elijah just chose to follow God. He was a coward. He used to get scared over small things. But not a single moment did he doubt that God was there with him. He would question him. Then he would listen and take all the instructions with him. Still like Moses, he never saw the full conversion of the Israelites back to their God. He did all that he did, but his successor delivered the mission. Now, as we wind up, friends, I'm still asking this. You want to stop at Mount Pisgah after doing all this, after nurturing the small ones, after coming here, after going to missions, after doing all that which pertains the journey of salvation, after denying yourself, after even denouncing your friends because you are an Adventist, you're going to have a Mount Pisga moment whereby just like Moses, you will see, but You will not enjoy the heavenly kingdom because I repeat, heaven is real. He promised us and he will deliver. He promised. His promises are yes and amen. We're moving to 2 Corinthians 1:20. 2 Corinthians 1:20. Our givers. It's a replica of what we've just read in Numbers 23:19, where we find a faithful God and a reliable God. For all the promises of God in him are yes. I don't know what he's promised you. I don't know what your terms of engagement were. All the men we have in the scriptures, they had terms of engagement. Yes, I'm coming. I'll be a fisher of men. You're going to teach me? Yes. There were terms of engagement, but I will not go back. Even Elisha when he was summoned, he said, um, I have my oxen. Um, and I have my mother. Let me go kiss my mother goodbye. But when you went, he dealt even with the oxen. And he came and he fully served God. Don't know what your terms of engagement were, but believe you me, the promises that he made to you are yes and amen. He will bring them to pass one after the other. The question is, are you patient enough? Or he'll walk with you until you come, mercy? Look, just see the much I had promised you. Just see how much I had planned to bring it to pass. But because of your disobedience, you're not going to get it. There's not a single promise that I made to you that I did not intend to bring it to pass. But your disobedience has denied you all this. Or it will be a sweet song of redemption. It will be a sweet song of deliverance. It will be a sweet song of me joining the heavenly kingdom for eternal life. It is a conversation and a solo one that you need to have and be honest to yourself and see God bring it to pass. 2 Corinthians 1 20. For all the promises of God in him are yes and in him amen and to the glory of God. God's love is eternal. God's love is sufficient for you and for me. It is enough. There is enough for every one of us in God's love. The children throughout the week learn about God's love is rock solid. How I pray that after this VBS, you project the same love back at home. You don't go and bring confusion to these young minds. They've learned they have been taught. They are fully packed. They know of a God who loves them. They know of a God who can deliver. They know of a God who can provide. Please don't bring confusion to the children. Please spread the same message back home. They know of a God who is patient. Started by saying let us tame our anger. It is anger that costed Moses cannon. Nothing else. The Bible records that. The Bible records that uh let me confirm before I say on this microphone what costed Moses Mhm. Uh there's a bit on the Deuteronomy 34:4 where he's confirming that this is the land that I promised Abraham that I'll give him to to I'll give it to his descendants. I've caused you to see it with your eyes, but you shall not go over there. I'm looking for the verse which records because he was disobedient. If you find it, you can signal me. It's always a learning process. It's a continuous process. It is disobedience that cost Moses the promised land. He did everything else as God would have willed, but his disobedience costed him the great promise. as much as he was the first person to hear of this great story. My plea this afternoon, let us not stop at Mount Pisgar. I'm pleading with you. Let us not stop at Mount Pisgar. Let us enter the promised land. Let the mountain be a mountain of us keeping our promise because he has promised and he has repeated time and again that his promises are yes and amen. Let us enter the promised land for I believe that is our prayer. May God bless us all. We welcome the closing hymn. Please little boy come. Please come. [Music] 

==================================================

TIMESTAMPED TRANSCRIPT:
[0.2s] Speak to the children of God.
[17.3s] Happy Sabbath church. Happy day.
[22.0s] Uh I would like to start by
[23.9s] acknowledging the effort of the teachers
[27.2s] that have been working with the children
[30.1s] all through from Monday Tuesday. I'm
[33.6s] sure the parents are happy. I'm sure you
[36.5s] felt relieved. And what a a better place
[39.6s] to be than at Jesus' feet. Let's give
[42.1s] the teachers a good amen. Amen. Thank
[45.4s] you so much. Teachers, please feel
[49.6s] appreciated and believe this a star in
[53.2s] your crown. Just fight and strive for
[55.8s] that day that the crown will have its
[58.2s] honor so that you can enjoy the stars.
[61.0s] I'm not ignorant of the fact that us as
[63.8s] parents will still make some very mean
[67.5s] statements about you, how you managed
[70.4s] our children within the week, but that
[73.0s] should not break your spirit. Hang on
[75.6s] there. That's what our Christ did for
[78.1s] all the time that he was here. He taught
[81.0s] us. He fed us. He performed great
[83.8s] miracles. But we still f found faults on
[86.8s] him. So please hang in there such that
[89.4s] if you are called upon next year, you're
[91.8s] not hanging your boots. You are ready to
[94.5s] serve these little children. I want to
[96.6s] tell you, dealing with these people is
[98.0s] not easy. The person who was dealing
[99.9s] with the teens, that was amazing.
[103.4s] That group is not easy to handle.
[106.2s] They're not even sure of their voices.
[108.3s] You try the soprano, they switch to
[110.4s] alto. You try the young men to do
[112.8s] tenner, they switch to bass. You ask
[114.9s] them now, let's do the bass, they tell
[116.4s] you, teacher, we are gone. And they walk
[118.3s] out of the gate. The person who was
[120.3s] managing the teens, may God sincerely
[123.5s] bless you. The high schoolers, that was
[128.0s] awesome. Your friend just mentioned that
[130.5s] that was a lastm minute arrangement. Is
[133.0s] that so? Wow, that was so so amazing.
[137.4s] Believe me, God will bless
[140.0s] you church.
[142.5s] Uh without taking much of your time, I'd
[147.3s] like us to begin the word of the day,
[150.6s] the children have learned about
[153.4s] Elijah. They were taught how he visited
[156.6s] a widow and the supplies never ran out.
[161.2s] They were fed day in day out until the
[164.8s] drought was gone. They were taught of a
[167.9s] fire that came from heaven and poured
[170.9s] down. And I like what the Bible records
[174.1s] it leaked everything from the burnt
[177.7s] offering to the water that was poured
[180.3s] around the trenches. They thought of
[183.4s] Elijah even after being with God for all
[186.5s] that time got scared at some point and
[190.6s] he ran away. He ran away. He didn't want
[193.9s] to meet the people that he was still
[196.1s] prophesying to them about this great
[197.8s] God. I believe they learned about a man
[202.2s] who was all flesh and blood but managed
[206.1s] to remain faithful until he was hixed
[209.0s] away through the whale wind by the
[211.6s] chariot. I believe these children are
[214.4s] wellfed and as we are crowning we're
[217.0s] going to share something small. It might
[219.8s] be slightly different but it is
[222.3s] perfectly in tune with what the children
[225.0s] were learning because it's still under
[227.2s] the mountain of miracles. Let us pray so
[230.7s] that we
[234.4s] begin. Dear God who lives in heaven, it
[238.6s] has pleased you that we share this
[240.6s] moment together with my brothers at New
[243.9s] Life. Oh God who reigns forever, this is
[247.6s] our prayer. What do you have for us
[250.0s] today? What do you want us to learn
[252.6s] about you today? Will it help us grow
[256.1s] spiritually, dear God? Will it draw us
[259.0s] closer to your feet? Will it strengthen
[262.1s] our faith? Will it let us know more
[265.1s] about you? Oh father who reigns forever,
[269.3s] we are waiting. Speak. your children are
[273.1s] listening and all glory and honor will
[276.3s] be upon your name. Our humble plea in
[279.4s] Jesus' name.
[282.4s] Amen. Like what our apostle
[285.6s] said, what was captured is that the deal
[289.8s] is
[291.2s] sealed. I said, "We're going to address
[295.0s] another
[296.0s] man, another great giant of faith, and
[300.2s] then walk with him all through the
[302.3s] mountains, and within a very short time,
[305.3s] we will be done." You don't keep
[307.0s] children waiting for long. We're going
[309.8s] to look at a wonderful gentleman who is
[313.1s] called by the name of Moses.
[318.4s] Moses and
[320.4s] Elijah, as much as they appeared at
[322.9s] Jesus
[324.0s] transfiguration, they share similar
[327.1s] characteristics. And that is why I want
[329.3s] us partly to pick on Elijah, dwell more
[333.2s] on Moses, and then we wrap up and we'll
[336.4s] have something to carry us throughout
[338.6s] the week. Elijah came at a time when
[342.2s] they had already settled in the land of
[344.1s] Canaan. Moses happened centuries before
[347.8s] Elijah came to being and Moses had a
[350.8s] physical journey to deliver these
[353.0s] children to the promised land. The deal
[356.2s] was sealed. God had had their plea from
[359.3s] the land of Egypt. And by hearing their
[361.9s] plea, he did his map work very well. The
[365.4s] layout was complete. I will pick Moses.
[368.7s] I will walk with him to the palace and
[371.3s] then we will bring out these children
[373.4s] and I'll take them to Canaan. There was
[375.9s] a very important meeting by the burning
[378.9s] bush. A very important God was there and
[382.4s] Moses and they had a wonderful
[384.5s] conversation and the conversation was
[386.7s] complete and then the journey began. I
[389.4s] want us to walk with Moses through all
[391.4s] this and then by the time we getting to
[393.7s] Deuteronomy 34, we will be done and I
[396.8s] pray that the lesson will be home. Moses
[399.8s] received all the instructions and he
[403.0s] participated in several phases. The
[406.5s] journey from Egypt had um I would call
[409.7s] them three phases. I don't know how
[411.0s] you'd like to interpret them, but they
[413.0s] were split into several of them. The
[416.6s] first one was the um exchange between
[420.4s] him and the king. Let my people go
[423.5s] today. Okay, you'll go tomorrow.
[425.5s] Something happens. He's not yet
[427.3s] convinced. Something else happened until
[429.8s] they counted up to 10 and they had to
[432.5s] leave. Friends, you'll quickly agree
[435.2s] with me at that point that was enough to
[438.6s] convince Moses that God is almighty. God
[442.4s] is all knowing and God is able to do
[445.6s] that which man cannot do. And that was
[448.2s] enough to convince you and me we need to
[451.9s] rely on this God fully. But what
[454.2s] happened to our brother? It was not that
[456.5s] easy. And the journey began. So we get
[459.0s] into phase two. Along the way these
[462.6s] people would get
[464.8s] hungry. Our dear Moses would go to God
[468.3s] and he would pray. You know, like the
[470.4s] way you go to fast food joints and you
[472.6s] place your order and cross over the
[474.3s] window and you pick your stuff. This is
[476.6s] what would happen. Food would be made
[478.5s] from heaven and it would come down and
[480.6s] it was given a name. They call it mana.
[482.7s] When I get to heaven, I would like to
[484.7s] test that because every time I read the
[486.6s] Bible, they say it was so nice, but
[489.0s] there was something about it. You store
[490.7s] more than what you needed for the day,
[493.2s] it will all get spoiled. That is besides
[495.5s] the point. They would get thirsty and
[498.2s] then that is where the story
[500.9s] began. I don't know it was the tone that
[504.0s] they used to approach Moses. I don't
[506.5s] know the prevailing circumstances that
[509.4s] made Moses so irritated that he forgot
[513.1s] who he was dealing with for a moment. I
[515.9s] really don't understand what triggered
[518.5s] the anger that Moses had. This is so
[521.8s] common to most of us, especially when we
[524.8s] are dealing with these little angels.
[527.3s] Our anger is packed up so easily and we
[530.6s] hit them for no reason. Every time
[532.8s] you're dealing with these people, please
[534.7s] be as gentle as you can. We say this
[539.1s] that between zero and 12 like what they
[542.7s] have learned the whole of this week will
[545.1s] form part of their core memories. This
[547.5s] is the absorbent stage. So, how you deal
[550.6s] with them, how you respond to their
[553.0s] mistakes, count 1 to 10. And by the time
[555.9s] you get to number 10, if you still feel
[558.2s] that you need to slap them, if you still
[560.6s] feel that you need to hit them, please
[562.6s] go ahead. You're beyond repair. But by
[565.8s] the time you're counting 1 to 10, I want
[568.1s] to believe your anger will go low. And
[570.6s] you will not repeat what our dear
[573.0s] brother did.
[575.0s] You will not repeat what he did because
[577.1s] that costed him what we're going to see
[579.4s] at the tail end of all this story. He
[582.4s] hit the rock and that angered his
[585.4s] friend, his God, his maker, his creator,
[589.4s] his
[590.4s] sustainer. How many times does our anger
[593.5s] draw us away from our God? A moment of
[597.1s] range, you're so furious you cannot even
[600.2s] contain your anger. You haul unprintable
[603.3s] words. You make some moves that you live
[606.3s] to regret. Friends, I want to add you
[609.3s] this
[610.7s] morning, let us contain our anger. We
[614.7s] will see how much it costed our dear
[617.6s] brother. When you look at uh the book of
[621.2s] Numbers chapter 23:1 19, my Bible
[625.4s] record numbers 23:1
[636.3s] 19. God is not a man that he should
[640.8s] lie. He had promised the land of
[644.6s] Canaan. And all along Moses is getting
[648.2s] upset and at some point he's getting
[651.2s] confused. Is this word real? Will it
[654.8s] come to pass? I am leading a bunch of At
[658.5s] some point he hurled some insults to
[660.6s] them and God was not
[663.4s] pleased. When you study that verse, it
[666.4s] is a reminder of what they agreed. If
[669.6s] there was no canon, he would have said
[671.8s] it.
[673.4s] If it was something that he was not sure
[676.1s] of, I believe my God would have told
[678.5s] him, "Let us start the journey. We'll
[680.6s] figure it out on the way." But the deal
[682.8s] was completely sealed. And Moses did not
[685.4s] want to walk this talk. When we move
[687.8s] swiftly to the book
[689.8s] of John 14:E3, we're going back to the
[694.1s] New Testament again. Give me John
[700.2s] 14:13. John 14:13. All
[717.8s] right, I'm
[724.0s] here. My Bible records
[729.2s] this. John chapter
[733.4s] 14 verse 1-3
[736.6s] sorry John chapter 14 verse 1 to
[747.8s] 3. Let not your heart be troubled. You
[752.0s] believe in God, believe also in me. In
[754.9s] my father's house are many mansions. If
[757.8s] it were not so, I would have told you. I
[760.6s] go to prepare a place for you. And if I
[763.9s] go and prepare a place for you, I will
[767.0s] come again and receive you unto myself
[769.9s] that where I am, there you may be also.
[774.1s] Jesus made this solemn promise to you
[777.5s] and to me just like he did with our
[781.0s] brother, just like God did with our
[783.0s] brother back in the days.
[785.8s] He says that he's going to prepare a
[788.2s] place for us. Go with me to the book of
[790.8s] Deuteronomy 34:1 and
[794.3s] 2. Go with me to the book of
[797.2s] Deuteronomy 14 verse 1 and
[806.5s] 2. It's the last chapter of Deuteronomy.
[816.8s] This is the most interesting bit about
[819.0s] this whole story. And Moses went up from
[822.6s] the plains of Moab and all that and all
[825.7s] that. I like the latter part. And the
[828.6s] Lord showed him all the land of Gilead
[832.6s] and Tudan. He showed him the promised
[835.8s] land. They braced the mountain. Getting
[839.2s] up a mountain is not easy. But when they
[841.6s] got up there, the Lord told him, "Come
[844.3s] here, Moses, my friend. You see down
[846.6s] there, I told you there's a land flowing
[849.2s] with honey and milk. That is the
[852.3s] promised land. But sadly, my friend, you
[855.4s] will not get there because of your
[859.1s] disobedience." He walked the long
[861.3s] journey. He did all that appeared right.
[864.6s] He did that which was right. He led the
[868.1s] children. He spoke with God. He
[870.6s] interceded on their behalf. He anointed.
[873.8s] He put order in the children of Israel.
[876.9s] But here goes the catch. You will not
[879.4s] enter because you were disobedient to
[882.2s] me. When I asked you to speak to the
[884.9s] rock, friends, I'm saying this with a
[886.8s] very heavy heart. In our journey of
[889.3s] salvation, we pray, we perform miracles,
[893.0s] we intercede for the sick, we visit the
[896.0s] poor, we go to crusades, we do
[899.0s] everything that pertains the work of
[901.1s] faith, but something about us tells us
[904.2s] that God may get to some point and say,
[907.0s] "Mercy, you can only come this far."
[910.6s] What does Revelation say 1:7? Revelation
[914.5s] 1:7 so that we can compare these two and
[917.7s] wind up tells me
[919.8s] this and every eye. The little English
[924.1s] that I know tells me this every is all
[927.7s] inclusive. I don't know why they picked
[930.0s] on the people who pierced Jesus cuz they
[932.8s] are added. They are given a separate
[934.4s] statement. Maybe it was too painful.
[937.0s] Maybe the crucification was so
[938.9s] humiliating. I don't know why they are
[941.0s] given a special sentence by themselves.
[943.4s] But when you study that verse, it goes
[945.4s] like this. Every eye, your eye, my eye,
[950.4s] our friend's eye, the enemy's eye will
[953.6s] see Jesus as he's coming down in his
[958.2s] cloud. Then what happens after that? It
[961.6s] is to your discretion.
[963.6s] Moses was brought to Mount Pisgah, but
[966.3s] he was told by God, "You can only come
[969.0s] this far." Friends, heaven is real. The
[972.0s] deal is sealed. He died for us on the
[975.0s] cross that we may get eternal
[978.1s] life. And his promises are yes and amen.
[981.7s] The Bible repeats that time and again.
[984.2s] We've seen it in the Old Testament. We
[986.7s] saw it in the New Testament out of the
[989.2s] key verse. 2 Corinthians chapter 1 verse
[993.0s] 20. It is very clear that his promises
[996.6s] are yes and amen. He promised to come
[999.8s] and take us
[1001.4s] home. He has promised a heaven. At this
[1005.4s] point, we have not seen it. Just like
[1008.1s] our brothers who were following Moses,
[1010.2s] they had not seen the cannon that they
[1012.4s] were promised. No, they had not seen it.
[1015.0s] They had not seen it.
[1017.8s] But Moses saw it but he did not enter. I
[1022.6s] don't want this to be the same story
[1024.2s] about us especially the family of new
[1026.9s] life SDA. This should not be our story.
[1029.9s] We will not only see him but we will
[1032.9s] join him in the heavenly kingdom. We
[1035.5s] will rejoice with him because we will
[1038.1s] choose to be obedient. Happy Sabbath.
[1042.1s] We will follow Jesus when he comes. Our
[1045.7s] story will not be cut short like our
[1048.3s] brother Moses. No, you see, we are doing
[1051.2s] all that which is right. We taking care
[1054.1s] of these children. They were advised to
[1057.2s] write the commandments at the doorpost
[1059.0s] so that they can read when they're going
[1061.0s] and when they're coming back. We have
[1063.1s] done exactly that to these children and
[1065.6s] shock on you. These children will get
[1068.2s] the lessons that they've been taught and
[1069.9s] they will follow God to the latter. And
[1072.2s] just like our two friends that are
[1074.2s] recorded in Numbers
[1076.1s] 32:12, they will enter the heavenly
[1078.8s] kingdom because they will choose to
[1081.8s] wholly follow
[1083.6s] God. It will be so sad that our children
[1087.1s] will make it up there and then us will
[1089.9s] have what I like calling the Mount
[1092.2s] Pisgar
[1093.3s] experience. We will see but we will not
[1097.1s] enter. That will be so sad. All the
[1100.2s] hours that we've spent in this
[1104.0s] ministry, all the efforts, all the
[1107.0s] energy, the zeal that we've had, how we
[1109.8s] testify to everyone, we are Adventists.
[1113.3s] I like it. Even in the corporate world
[1115.2s] when they're running programs, you'll
[1116.8s] hear, "Ah, please excuse so and so. He's
[1119.3s] an Adventist. He'll not be available on
[1121.2s] Saturday. Let's have it run on Thursday
[1123.2s] or Monday." We stand firm and we tell
[1126.0s] the world we're Adventist. But it would
[1128.4s] be so sad when that time comes and we
[1131.5s] have a Mount Pisga experience because
[1134.5s] believe me and I'll repeat and I'll keep
[1136.5s] repeating it until I leave this pullpit.
[1139.1s] The deal is sealed. Heaven is real.
[1142.7s] Christ pronounced this with his own
[1144.9s] mouth. He said he's only going for a
[1147.1s] while and he's coming. And when we move
[1149.8s] swiftly to Revelation, we find the
[1152.2s] confirmation that he will come and every
[1155.1s] eye. But then let's read Revelation. Let
[1157.9s] us read
[1159.7s] Revelation 1 verse
[1164.7s] 7.
[1166.6s] Revelation
[1169.2s] 1 verse 7.
[1171.4s] Correct. Behold, he comes with clouds
[1176.2s] and every eye shall see him. Every
[1180.6s] eye. I repeat I don't know why the
[1184.5s] people who pierced him maybe pastor will
[1187.0s] teach us some other day why they are
[1189.4s] given their own sentence and all tribes
[1192.2s] of earth shall wail because of him even
[1194.3s] so amen that is beautiful but I'm
[1196.8s] interested in the bit of every eye no
[1200.5s] exception everybody will see Christ just
[1204.0s] like Moses who saw the promised land and
[1206.8s] never got to it is not recorded anywhere
[1209.6s] he made it of course there's a story of
[1211.8s] him dying, being buried up there and God
[1214.2s] coming and all that, but he never
[1216.3s] stepped in the promised land whereby he
[1219.1s] was the first person to know of this
[1220.9s] great secret. The story at the burning
[1223.6s] bush, we don't have a crowd. We only
[1226.1s] have the bush burning and God's voice
[1229.8s] and Moses even his wife was not there.
[1232.7s] Maybe the witnesses were animals. But in
[1235.2s] the human race, the person who got the
[1237.8s] secret that there's a promised land
[1240.2s] somewhere was
[1242.3s] Moses. Just like
[1244.7s] you in your household, the person who
[1248.0s] got the message of the promised land is
[1250.7s] you probably introduced your wife or you
[1253.5s] introduced your husband and then the
[1255.5s] flock that came after that. But it would
[1258.2s] be so interesting that this flock that
[1260.8s] is learning follows the lessons to the
[1264.0s] latter like what we read in numbers
[1266.6s] 32:12. Let's see. Let's see numbers
[1269.2s] 32:12 I quote stuff that is not
[1273.0s] there. Numbers 32:12. And if you project
[1277.7s] you just let me know so that I don't
[1280.5s] take a lot of time flipping through my
[1283.8s] Bible. 32:12. Correct.
[1287.5s] My Bible records all that Calb and
[1290.4s] Joshua I like the latter part for they
[1293.5s] wholly followed
[1297.0s] God. That brings us to today's
[1301.2s] lesson. There is call for total
[1303.8s] obedience to our
[1307.3s] God. The opposite of that, the contrary
[1310.6s] of that is that we will see the Bible
[1314.2s] will never contradict itself. Yes, we
[1316.7s] will see him, but we will not go with
[1320.6s] him. It will be a repeat of history. I
[1323.4s] like what Solomon keeps on reminding us
[1325.4s] in the book of Ecclesiastes. There is
[1327.4s] nothing new under the sun. But it would
[1329.3s] be so sad to have a repeat of you
[1332.2s] missing the heavenly kingdom just
[1334.3s] because of something very small called
[1337.6s] disobedience. You are called to enjoy a
[1341.0s] active daily relationship with Christ.
[1344.2s] How often do we do this? When we were
[1347.1s] small, when we were in their age, we
[1349.0s] committed to keeping the morning watch.
[1351.3s] How active are we doing this? You're
[1354.0s] called to choose
[1357.0s] obedience. How many times do we defy
[1359.9s] what God advises us to do, what he asks
[1362.7s] us to do? How many times do we make our
[1367.0s] own statements?
[1369.6s] How many times do we find stories that
[1371.9s] are similar to what God wants us to do,
[1374.1s] but we are so sure that they are
[1376.2s] drifting from what he wants us to do.
[1379.1s] Friends, I want to say this at this
[1381.6s] hour. God will never lower his standards
[1385.6s] to please man.
[1388.0s] Mm- He will never lower his standards no
[1390.9s] matter what. He's never moved by
[1393.1s] numbers. The numbers that left Egypt,
[1395.9s] they were big numbers. Simple math will
[1398.9s] tell you it was like our whole country
[1400.6s] of Kenya moving in one large group
[1403.4s] because the numbers that were there. You
[1405.3s] give them wives, you give the wives
[1407.6s] children, you give each household
[1409.6s] servants and the livestock and crown it
[1413.0s] with a mixed multitude. It was a large
[1415.7s] number that was
[1417.1s] moving. But when you study the Bible
[1419.4s] keenly, you realize that a small
[1423.5s] insignificant percentage made it to the
[1426.2s] promised land. Even Captain Major
[1428.4s] General Buana Moses was not there just
[1432.2s] because of
[1434.0s] disobedience. God made sure that he
[1437.4s] showed him. I was not telling you of a
[1440.2s] cannon that does not exist.
[1442.6s] Uh-uh. I am God and I do not lie. I am
[1446.7s] not a son of man that I will tell a lie.
[1449.0s] I am God and I speak the truth. Come,
[1451.5s] Moses, let me show you the promised
[1453.4s] land. Look down there. It's there. Have
[1455.8s] you seen it? But you will not taste
[1458.8s] it. And the Bible
[1461.2s] records the people who saw were children
[1464.7s] who were actually born in the journey.
[1466.9s] They were not there when the journey
[1468.2s] started. But when they were born like
[1470.5s] these precious children here, like the
[1472.5s] teens here, they were taught of a God
[1475.7s] who lives, of a God who feeds them from
[1478.2s] heaven, of a God who can take care of
[1480.4s] them, of a God who will raise a snake
[1482.6s] when they're beaten. they can when they
[1484.2s] faced of a great God and they followed
[1487.3s] this God in all and true to his word he
[1491.5s] delivered them to the promised land but
[1493.7s] the major generals and the captains and
[1495.8s] the other leaders they were missing in
[1498.4s] this story he calls us to endure trials
[1503.7s] like our brother
[1505.6s] Elijah he did all that but at some point
[1509.9s] he got so lonely and he felt aband
[1513.6s] abandoned. He felt
[1515.9s] neglected. But then God revealed himself
[1518.7s] and showed him that there were others
[1520.9s] that were in store somewhere that were
[1522.9s] still ready to serve him. Friends, keep
[1525.6s] the oils in our lamps just like we are
[1529.0s] advised in the book of Matthew chapter
[1532.8s] 25. Matthew chapter
[1537.1s] 25. It's a very interesting story. All
[1539.8s] these stories are known to us especially
[1542.0s] us Adventists who are very very good
[1545.0s] Bible scholars is the story of the oils
[1547.7s] and the lambs and the virgins and we
[1550.2s] know what happened around that time we
[1552.5s] are asked to keep oil in our lamps. How
[1556.5s] long are we going to doubt God and how
[1559.0s] long are we going to doubt his promises?
[1561.7s] For how long are we going to toy around
[1564.1s] with the fact that he promised to come
[1566.7s] and to take us home to his heavenly
[1569.5s] kingdom? For how long are we going to
[1571.8s] falter? We're not even sure. Yes, we are
[1575.0s] doing all that which is right. Because
[1576.9s] if you study the story of Moses, it's a
[1579.0s] very interesting one. Even after doing
[1581.1s] all that, he still had another meeting
[1582.7s] with God. He was given the he still had
[1585.2s] another meeting with God. He would meet
[1587.5s] him face to face. I'm sure if I am to
[1590.5s] pass this microphone to the adults, they
[1593.2s] would give me stories confessing of how
[1595.4s] much God has walked with them. They
[1597.9s] would tell me, you know, sister Marci,
[1599.8s] at this point I prayed and heavens came
[1602.8s] down and this and this came to pass. You
[1605.8s] have similar stories to tell just like
[1608.2s] our brother. But are you convinced
[1610.2s] there's heaven? And if you are convinced
[1612.4s] there's heaven, what are you doing in
[1614.5s] readiness for the second coming of
[1616.4s] Christ? Because believe you me he is
[1619.6s] coming. The story of redemption does not
[1622.3s] end at him dying on the cross and
[1624.2s] disappearing. It will end when he comes
[1626.9s] like what is recorded in Revelations
[1631.1s] 1:7. It is
[1633.3s] sure Jesus will come to take us
[1637.2s] home. Shall we all
[1639.7s] gather and have a Mount Pisgah moment
[1643.4s] watching him come down in clouds? our
[1646.9s] eyes confirming that yes that is Jesus
[1649.9s] and then our story ends at that point
[1654.0s] or will our story continue by inheriting
[1657.6s] the heavenly kingdom which is our take
[1661.0s] where do we stand where exactly do we
[1664.2s] stand and what is our desire because you
[1667.4s] see like I mentioned God will never
[1670.0s] lower his standards to please man no
[1671.7s] matter what we do he will never do that
[1674.8s] we can disobey all we want. We can
[1678.0s] sugarcoat the statements as much as we
[1680.1s] want, but he will never change. When you
[1683.1s] look at the math, uh we've just done the
[1685.2s] math of Moses and the Egyptians. Look at
[1687.4s] the Gideonites. There were 10,000 of
[1689.7s] them. And God worked with a very small
[1692.7s] number. A very very small number. And
[1696.1s] such similar stories are recorded
[1699.1s] clearly in the scriptures. Now what
[1701.4s] makes us feel a bit unique that when
[1704.6s] that time
[1705.9s] comes he will think about us he will
[1709.9s] consider our effort he will uh bat one
[1713.4s] eye but you know he calls for total
[1718.3s] obedience read with
[1720.5s] me the
[1722.6s] book of numbers again we are going to
[1725.7s] our numbers chapter 23 verse 19 where we
[1735.5s] started. This
[1737.5s] verse gives us the concept that God is
[1742.7s] faithful. God is not a man that he
[1745.9s] should lie. Neither the son of man that
[1749.0s] he should repent. Has he said, "Shall he
[1753.4s] not do it? Or has he spoken and shall he
[1757.1s] not make it good?
[1762.8s] God is faithful. He's not only faithful,
[1767.7s] but he's reliable. I don't know how you
[1770.7s] view him. I don't know how you analyze
[1773.0s] him, but friends, I'm here to remind you
[1775.4s] this. I'm telling you because I know you
[1777.2s] know, but I'm here to remind you this
[1779.2s] that God is faithful. I don't know what
[1782.1s] you've petitioned to him. I don't know
[1784.4s] what item you've brought to him. Our
[1787.1s] brother would bring very big prayer
[1789.5s] requests being pushed by the multitude
[1791.9s] that he was leading and not a single one
[1794.4s] of them did not come to pass. Even the
[1796.8s] moment they asked him, "We want to see
[1798.8s] that
[1800.0s] God. We want to see that God. That God
[1803.1s] you keep telling us you're going to meet
[1804.6s] him. We want to see him." Then he went
[1806.8s] to God and he told him, "Dear God, your
[1810.4s] people, they are no longer his now. Your
[1812.8s] people want to see you." That was a bit
[1815.3s] clear. That was a bit weird. But what
[1817.5s] did he say? Go and tell them to prepare.
[1819.8s] I'll come. Not interested in the details
[1822.1s] of their preparation and all. I'm
[1824.0s] interested in the bit that they asked to
[1826.4s] see him and he still
[1829.2s] obliged. Forget about the food, the
[1832.3s] crossing of the Red Sea. They asked to
[1834.7s] see him eye to eye. He did not refuse.
[1838.1s] He said, "I'll
[1840.1s] come." What have we taken to God in
[1842.5s] prayer? What faith do we have that he'll
[1845.0s] bring it to pass? He has brought it to
[1847.4s] pass. Are we still obedient enough? Are
[1850.6s] we hanging on his word that he will come
[1853.4s] and take us home like the song that we
[1855.7s] did? The promises are very sweet, but
[1858.7s] are we willing to walk the talk? Are we
[1861.1s] willing to hang in there until he comes
[1863.4s] and takes us home? or we will walk and
[1866.2s] then at some point he'll say, "Dear
[1870.0s] friend, my dear one, you can only come
[1873.5s] this far. Ha, Peter, this one is beyond
[1877.3s] you. This is for the heavenly bodies.
[1879.8s] This is for them that obeyed me fully.
[1882.0s] This is for them that are ready for the
[1884.1s] heavenly
[1885.3s] kingdom." What is your take? When we
[1888.4s] look at Elijah, we're winding up. Elijah
[1891.8s] just chose to follow God. He was a
[1893.8s] coward. He used to get scared over small
[1896.1s] things. But not a single moment did he
[1898.9s] doubt that God was there with him. He
[1901.4s] would question him. Then he would listen
[1903.9s] and take all the instructions with him.
[1906.3s] Still like Moses, he never saw the full
[1908.7s] conversion of the Israelites back to
[1910.9s] their God. He did all that he did, but
[1913.6s] his successor delivered the mission.
[1916.0s] Now, as we wind up,
[1918.6s] friends, I'm still asking this. You want
[1922.1s] to stop at Mount Pisgah after doing all
[1925.1s] this, after nurturing the small ones,
[1928.5s] after coming here, after going to
[1931.1s] missions, after doing all that which
[1933.8s] pertains the journey of salvation, after
[1936.8s] denying yourself, after even denouncing
[1940.2s] your friends because you are an
[1942.0s] Adventist, you're going to have a Mount
[1944.2s] Pisga moment whereby just like Moses,
[1947.7s] you will
[1948.9s] see, but You will not enjoy the heavenly
[1953.4s] kingdom because I repeat, heaven is
[1956.7s] real. He promised us and he will
[1959.8s] deliver. He promised. His promises are
[1962.6s] yes and amen. We're moving to 2
[1965.2s] Corinthians
[1967.5s] 1:20. 2 Corinthians
[1970.2s] 1:20. Our givers.
[1975.0s] It's a replica of what we've just read
[1978.0s] in Numbers 23:19, where we find a
[1981.2s] faithful God and a reliable
[1985.9s] God. For all the promises of God in him
[1990.6s] are yes. I don't know what he's promised
[1994.6s] you. I don't know what your terms of
[1997.0s] engagement
[1998.3s] were. All the men we have in the
[2000.6s] scriptures, they had terms of
[2001.7s] engagement. Yes, I'm coming. I'll be a
[2003.9s] fisher of men. You're going to teach me?
[2005.8s] Yes. There were terms of engagement, but
[2008.2s] I will not go back. Even Elisha when he
[2010.5s] was summoned, he said, um, I have my
[2013.2s] oxen. Um, and I have my mother. Let me
[2017.0s] go kiss my mother goodbye. But when you
[2019.3s] went, he dealt even with the oxen. And
[2021.7s] he came and he fully served God. Don't
[2024.1s] know what your terms of engagement were,
[2026.8s] but believe you me, the promises that he
[2029.5s] made to you are yes and amen. He will
[2033.4s] bring them to pass one after the other.
[2036.9s] The question is, are you patient
[2041.7s] enough? Or he'll walk with you until you
[2044.6s] come,
[2045.5s] mercy? Look, just see the much I had
[2048.6s] promised you. Just see how much I had
[2051.1s] planned to bring it to pass. But because
[2053.7s] of your disobedience, you're not going
[2056.0s] to get it. There's not a single promise
[2058.6s] that I made to you that I did not intend
[2060.7s] to bring it to pass. But your
[2062.6s] disobedience has denied you all this. Or
[2066.4s] it will be a sweet song of redemption.
[2069.1s] It will be a sweet song of deliverance.
[2071.4s] It will be a sweet song of me joining
[2074.2s] the heavenly kingdom for eternal
[2077.1s] life. It is a conversation and a solo
[2080.6s] one that you need to have and be honest
[2083.4s] to yourself and see God bring it to
[2085.8s] pass. 2 Corinthians 1 20. For all the
[2091.7s] promises of God in him are yes and in
[2095.2s] him amen and to the glory of
[2100.3s] God. God's love is eternal. God's love
[2105.8s] is sufficient for you and for me. It is
[2109.3s] enough. There is enough for every one of
[2111.8s] us in God's love. The children
[2114.6s] throughout the week learn about God's
[2117.5s] love is rock solid. How I pray that
[2122.2s] after this VBS, you project the same
[2125.3s] love back at home. You don't go and
[2128.1s] bring confusion to these young minds.
[2130.4s] They've learned they have been taught.
[2133.1s] They are fully packed. They know of a
[2135.8s] God who loves them. They know of a God
[2138.6s] who can deliver. They know of a God who
[2141.4s] can provide. Please don't bring
[2142.9s] confusion to the
[2144.4s] children. Please spread the same message
[2146.9s] back home. They know of a God who is
[2149.0s] patient. Started by saying let us tame
[2151.8s] our anger. It is anger that costed Moses
[2155.2s] cannon. Nothing
[2156.7s] else. The Bible records that. The Bible
[2159.5s] records that uh let me confirm before I
[2163.1s] say on this microphone what costed
[2167.4s] Moses Mhm.
[2178.1s] Uh there's a bit on the Deuteronomy
[2183.0s] 34:4 where he's confirming that this is
[2187.0s] the land that I promised Abraham that
[2189.0s] I'll give him to to I'll give it to his
[2190.9s] descendants. I've caused you to see it
[2193.0s] with your eyes, but you shall not go
[2195.4s] over there. I'm looking for the verse
[2197.4s] which records because he was
[2200.0s] disobedient. If you find it, you can
[2202.2s] signal me. It's always a learning
[2204.2s] process. It's a continuous process. It
[2206.2s] is disobedience that cost Moses the
[2209.0s] promised
[2210.4s] land. He did everything else as God
[2214.0s] would have willed, but his
[2216.5s] disobedience costed him the great
[2219.8s] promise. as much as he was the first
[2222.9s] person to hear of this great story. My
[2226.6s] plea this
[2227.8s] afternoon, let us not stop at Mount
[2231.2s] Pisgar. I'm pleading with you. Let us
[2234.6s] not stop at Mount Pisgar. Let us enter
[2237.9s] the promised land.
[2240.2s] Let the mountain be a mountain of us
[2242.8s] keeping our promise because he has
[2245.6s] promised and he has repeated time and
[2248.6s] again that his promises are yes and
[2251.9s] amen. Let us enter the promised land for
[2255.7s] I believe that is our prayer. May God
[2258.2s] bless us all.
[2261.2s] We welcome the closing
[2268.0s] hymn. Please little boy
[2271.4s] come. Please come.
[2277.4s] [Music]
