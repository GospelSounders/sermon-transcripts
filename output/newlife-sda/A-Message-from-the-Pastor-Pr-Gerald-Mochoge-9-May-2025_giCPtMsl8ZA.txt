FULL TRANSCRIPT:
[Music] Greetings and God's richest blessings to every one of you. The fifth Gong Avenue New Life SD Church members, I want to welcome you to this moment. My name is Pastor Gerald Moore. Thanking God for the humble opportunity to serve in this particular church at such a time as this. God is faithful and he who has begun a good work has promised that he shall be with us until the completion of this work in Christ Jesus. First things first, I'd like to let you know church members that God is with us and he's here in this church to lead us from one height to another. And it's for that reason that he has given us this humble opportunity to be here at such a time as this. that I want to welcome us that we may grow together as a family as a fraternity here in this home of the flying marines. One of the things that is very much in the core of my heart is the aspect of family and when I look at what we do day by day especially as church members it can only be much better if we do it the way the Lord desires us to be. And he has given us an exhortation in his word. He says, "Unless the Lord builds a house, they labor in vain that do it." Brothers and sisters, I want to ask us a question as a church fraternity. Are we laboring in vain? And the only way we can say we are laboring in vain is if we're making efforts through our wealth or probably through our own efforts to build up our homes. And is that what the Lord wants us to do? I believe there is a better foundation that the Lord is asking us to lay our homes and make our homes through. The service we offer here is just but another tool we can serve but yet still have challenges in our homes. That's the reason as to why I'm asking us as a church family to revive our homes one more time. You see, as the scriptures say, unless the Lord builds a home, they labor in vain that do it. So does the pen of inspiration say that let us make our homes a little heaven here below. If our homes and our families in this church are well grounded, this church will grow and flourish in many ways. In the recent past, I've had a discussion with the family life department and the communication department. We have agreed together. We want to come up and begin a series where we're beginning to talk bimonthly to all our viewers, to all our members. We'll be doing these online from 8:00 to 8:45 every Tuesday bimonthly. We're beginning on 13th of May this month and we'll be doing the same on 27th with Elder Magatti who is well grounded in family issues and I'm encouraging us to begin following this series. It'll be online and we'll be doing these as I also encourage family life members. I will be speaking to the counseling department and also the prayer ministries department. We have a room at the second floor of our building, children block building, and we want to utilize that room every day. You see, as pastors, we are here for you. Sometimes we are seated in the office and we're waiting for people to come in for us to pray with them. Sometimes we also want to come and visit with you and pray with you. But for those of you who have challenges in your families, either through finances, communication, or whatever it is, sometimes some of us have young people who have got challenges. the pressure that is out there and is taking them as a storm. We wish to discuss that with you. We have a group of professional counselors in this church and we're not making good use of them. I want to encourage us to utilize this building that office that has been granted to us graciously by the deconry department that every day we are here for you. every Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday and Friday as pastors we are here and if possible we'll speak to the counseling department to give us some professional counselors who can come and tackle certain issues and we want to do them as a church proono and I want to welcome every one of you please as you come for that remember also the programs that I've spoken about and so May 30 is the date May 27th will be another date by and by will talk to you every quarter we wish to have a speaker to us on a regular basis that we may have our families well grounded and here in church there many other things I would like to encourage but on the Sabbath basis I like to encourage every one of us to have the full day worship service if you're not a blessing out there for schools ministry or our Sabbath schools be a blessing in here please don't come and just be out there be in here and fellowship to mentor and inspire one another heavenward you see very early in the morning I would love us to have all the lesson teachers here before the Sabbath school begins Let's come together, sit and see and summarize what it is that we shall be teaching our lesson classes that we will not go there and find our lesson classes down not well grounded in scriptures. Get to know who these are in your lesson class. Have it. And then secondly, I would like us to all participate in the lesson classes. Please buy yourself a lesson and read it and make sure the discussions you're also active. Don't allow your teacher to be there and do a monologue. And then in the divine hour, I would want to pray and pray for the speakers as they come that they may fill us with the richness and the fatness of the word of God. In the afternoon, we want to have interactive sessions. And so we can make sure that our young people are well grounded this coming Sabbath. I'm meeting the young people up at the terrace. We'll be having a discussion on music unfolded. That'll be a series that I want to begin. And then we'll have other discussions in here. I know the ammo, they're having another discussions here by Elder Sama Gut. We'll be talking about investments and many other things. And so please utilize the afternoon that we may have interactive sessions and then later in the day let's finish the Sabbath together and go out there Sabbath by Sabbath. I would like us to also participate in all activities that we have to do. Thank you very much for welcoming us to be here with you. We would like to be a part of this family to spy you heavenward in the best way that we can. Please pray for us. Pray for our families as we pray for you and mentor you too. Thank you all department heads and all our elders for what you're doing. Our prayer is that you may team up together with us to make new life the place to be. And not only that, for those who come as visitors that indeed they may find no reason whatsoever why they should leave New Life. This is a vast family. We want to be a blessing to this church.

TIMESTAMPED TRANSCRIPT:
[1.2s] [Music]
[7.3s] Greetings and God's richest blessings to
[10.2s] every one of
[11.6s] you. The fifth Gong Avenue New Life SD
[15.4s] Church members, I want to welcome you to
[17.3s] this moment. My name is Pastor Gerald
[20.5s] Moore. Thanking God for the humble
[22.7s] opportunity to serve in this particular
[25.1s] church at such a time as this. God is
[29.2s] faithful and he who has begun a good
[31.7s] work has promised that he shall be with
[33.4s] us until the completion of this work in
[35.4s] Christ Jesus. First things first, I'd
[38.4s] like to let you know church members that
[40.2s] God is with us and he's here in this
[43.0s] church to lead us from one height to
[45.8s] another. And it's for that reason that
[47.8s] he has given us this humble opportunity
[49.7s] to be here at such a time as this. that
[51.7s] I want to welcome us that we may grow
[53.4s] together as a family as a fraternity
[56.2s] here in this home of the flying
[60.0s] marines. One of the things that is very
[62.6s] much in the core of my heart is the
[65.0s] aspect of
[66.2s] family and when I look at what we do day
[69.2s] by day especially as church
[72.5s] members it can only be much better if we
[75.3s] do it the way the Lord desires us to be.
[77.7s] And he has given us an exhortation in
[79.3s] his word. He says, "Unless the Lord
[82.2s] builds a house, they labor in vain that
[84.8s] do it." Brothers and sisters, I want to
[87.0s] ask us a question as a church
[88.4s] fraternity. Are we laboring in vain? And
[91.4s] the only way we can say we are laboring
[93.0s] in vain is if we're making efforts
[95.2s] through our wealth or probably through
[97.4s] our own efforts to build up our homes.
[99.9s] And is that what the Lord wants us to
[101.7s] do? I believe there is a better
[103.8s] foundation that the Lord is asking us to
[106.8s] lay our homes and make our homes
[108.5s] through. The service we offer here is
[110.9s] just but another tool we can serve but
[113.4s] yet still have challenges in our homes.
[115.7s] That's the reason as to why I'm asking
[117.2s] us as a church family to revive our
[120.6s] homes one more time. You see, as the
[123.3s] scriptures say, unless the Lord builds a
[124.9s] home, they labor in vain that do it. So
[127.8s] does the pen of inspiration say that let
[129.4s] us make our homes a little heaven here
[131.0s] below.
[132.2s] If our homes and our families in this
[134.2s] church are well grounded, this church
[136.1s] will grow and flourish in many
[138.5s] ways. In the recent past, I've had a
[140.9s] discussion with the family life
[142.7s] department and the communication
[144.1s] department. We have agreed together. We
[146.2s] want to come up and begin a series where
[148.8s] we're beginning to talk bimonthly to all
[152.3s] our viewers, to all our members. We'll
[155.1s] be doing these online from 8:00 to 8:45
[158.8s] every Tuesday bimonthly. We're beginning
[161.8s] on 13th of May this month and we'll be
[165.0s] doing the same on 27th with Elder
[166.9s] Magatti who is well grounded in family
[168.7s] issues and I'm encouraging us to begin
[172.1s] following this series. It'll be online
[174.6s] and we'll be doing these as I also
[176.3s] encourage family life members. I will be
[179.2s] speaking to the counseling department
[180.8s] and also the prayer ministries
[182.2s] department. We have a room at the second
[185.0s] floor of our building, children block
[187.0s] building, and we want to utilize that
[189.1s] room every day. You see, as pastors, we
[192.0s] are here for you. Sometimes we are
[193.4s] seated in the office and we're waiting
[194.8s] for people to come in for us to pray
[196.7s] with them. Sometimes we also want to
[198.5s] come and visit with you and pray with
[200.4s] you. But for those of you who have
[202.2s] challenges in your families, either
[204.5s] through finances, communication, or
[206.1s] whatever it is, sometimes some of us
[207.8s] have young people who have got
[208.9s] challenges. the pressure that is out
[211.0s] there and is taking them as a storm. We
[214.4s] wish to discuss that with you. We have a
[216.4s] group of professional counselors in this
[218.1s] church and we're not making good use of
[219.8s] them. I want to encourage us to utilize
[222.1s] this building that office that has been
[224.2s] granted to us graciously by the deconry
[226.4s] department that every day we are here
[228.6s] for you. every Monday, Tuesday,
[230.4s] Wednesday, Thursday and Friday as
[231.8s] pastors we are here and if possible
[234.0s] we'll speak to the counseling department
[235.5s] to give us some professional counselors
[238.9s] who can come and tackle certain issues
[240.8s] and we want to do them as a church
[242.2s] proono and I want to welcome every one
[244.2s] of you please as you come for that
[246.7s] remember also the programs that I've
[248.2s] spoken about and so May 30 is the date
[251.0s] May 27th will be another date by and by
[253.6s] will talk to you every quarter we wish
[255.1s] to have a speaker to us on a regular
[257.6s] basis that we may have our families well
[260.4s] grounded and here in church there many
[263.0s] other things I would like to encourage
[264.3s] but on the Sabbath basis I like to
[266.3s] encourage every one of us to have the
[268.2s] full day worship service if you're not a
[270.8s] blessing out there for schools ministry
[272.7s] or our Sabbath schools be a blessing in
[275.0s] here please don't come and just be out
[277.2s] there be in here and fellowship to
[279.4s] mentor and inspire one another
[280.8s] heavenward you see very early in the
[283.1s] morning I would love us to have all the
[285.5s] lesson teachers here before the Sabbath
[287.3s] school begins Let's come together, sit
[289.5s] and see and summarize what it is that we
[291.9s] shall be teaching our lesson classes
[294.6s] that we will not go there and find our
[296.8s] lesson classes down not well grounded in
[299.9s] scriptures. Get to know who these are in
[302.0s] your lesson class. Have it. And then
[304.6s] secondly, I would like us to all
[305.8s] participate in the lesson classes.

[310.5s] and make sure the discussions you're
[312.4s] also active. Don't allow your teacher to
[314.2s] be there and do a monologue. And then in
[316.6s] the divine hour, I would want to pray
[318.6s] and pray for the speakers as they come
[320.4s] that they may fill us with the richness
[322.2s] and the fatness of the word of God. In
[324.6s] the afternoon, we want to have
[326.0s] interactive sessions. And so we can make
[328.5s] sure that our young people are well
[330.0s] grounded this coming Sabbath. I'm

[333.7s] terrace. We'll be having a discussion on
[335.5s] music unfolded. That'll be a series that
[337.5s] I want to begin. And then we'll have

[359.6s] welcoming us to be here with you. We
