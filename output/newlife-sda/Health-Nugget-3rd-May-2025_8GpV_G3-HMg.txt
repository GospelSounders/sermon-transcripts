FULL TRANSCRIPT:
Happy Sabbath. Happy Sabbath. Happy day. Uh let's bow down for a word of prayer. Jehovah God, thank you for this day. We are not taking it for granted. Speak through me. I don't have the right language to speak to your children. Let somebody get help from this message. In Jesus name we request. Okay. Uh my name is Jackie Manguayo and today I'm going to talk about something that rarely do we want to hear about and this is drug and substance abuse. Most of the time people assume that we can't have such cases of drug abuse in our churches. That's not true. We have it and you'll be surprised if everybody opens up to you. you will realize in one way or the other we are abusing drugs. Um so I would want us to really define the word drug uh because we can't assume everyone knows. So drug is a chemical substance that when administered to a living organism produces a biological effect. And this one, it includes substances used for medical purposes as well as illicit purposes. Underline the word illicit because that one that's the area I'm interested in so much. Now that's a drug. Now what about uh drug abuse? This one refers to the you know repeated use of drug despite uh the negative consequences on health and well-being. It involves using of drugs or substances to alter mood and feel better not for medical reasons. If you talk to the people who have used illicit drugs or the ones that abuse even the prescribed drugs, they the most common response they're going to tell you the reason why they do this is there's a feeling that they usually have. Some people want to sleep. They had this sleep. So they feel like if they abuse a certain drug, they're going to sleep. There are some people who feel like, "Oh, I'm depressed. I'm sad." And if I take these, I have I I usually get that happy mood, happy moment. That's when they get confidence to talk. There's always reason for them taking uh drugs. Now, today I'm only going to do introduction. We are going to have this series for the whole month. So if I get to some point and you feel you're left in suspense don't worry we will sort you out. Now these drugs we have different roots in which they get into our system and one of them we can inhale. Sometimes we can take it orally intravenous where you inject the veins rectal and intramuscular uh trans uh dermal and sublingual. There are people even put you know some pills just under their tongue below their tongue that is sublingual and maybe some people who have taken some uh hypertensive pills you might have met one of them that you put under your tongue. So there are some that are not meant for that but people still put them under the tongue. There are people even who use tobacco by putting them under the tongue. So we have different truths. Now if you can see the images, I hope it's being projected. Someone is injecting you know their vein. And then there are some that you'll take orally like their candies that when you go to the market you might think they're just normal candies. They are not normal candies. Some are some are not. Some are made of marijuana. And yesterday when I went to the store with my husband, I was telling him like, you see this kind of candy? I was doing some research on them and I realized that some of them are not just plain candies as we may think, but they are quoted with marijuana. So don't just allow your children to be given candies by anybody thinking that oh that's just a candy. Someone is being nice to my child. Don't accept. They could be introducing your child to drug and substance use. Now we can smoke them. Some uh you know cookies. Cookies made of marijuana and other marijuana. We commonly know it as bang in Kenya. So they made of that. They look like any other cookie. So you'll find like your youth in the house or your teenager in the house has come with some cookies and they eating together with the siblings and you just feel it's normal. They went to the store got some cookies and that's what they having. Sometimes they're not just having cookies. They're taking marijuana in your own house, a house that you are paying rent for. So let us don't let us not just sit down and assume that everything that we are taking are clean and they do they don't have any uh you know uh substances that are illicit. So just be aware of that. But don't go back home and start punishing your children for taking cookies or candies that Jackie said they are all made of marijuana. I did not say that. I just said that we need to be extra cautious because we have them in the market. I've seen some with my naked eyes. I've met youth that sell them. They sell them out there and who knows, they could even be selling them in church or giving them free to their friends that they would want to be in their companies. So we also have reasons for taking these drugs and even abusing them. People have different reasons and your reason might not be my reason nor the other person's reason. Now we have people uh you know start abusing drugs because their friends do that. So they just say, you know, because my friends are doing this and I've never seen them struggle in one way or the other, why can't I also do it? And they end up abusing the drugs that their friends are also abusing. We have influence of the social media. Social media is, you know, a place that most of our youth and even the grown-ups, the adults are getting information. And if we don't know what to do with the information, we might misuse the information and try to feel how other people feel. Dysfunctional families. Some people get into drug because they have dysfunctional families. Dad and mom are there, but there's they don't live like it's a family. And so the children might get stressed up because it's not a dysfunctional family. The parents don't care so much about children. Parents come in when they want, get out when they want and so are the children. Everybody is a leader in that family. And such families, it's very easy for the youth to start abusing drug. Environmental factors. If you live in a place that getting drug is so easy and taking drugs, abusing them is the norm of the day, it's very easy for your children to start using drugs. Curiosity and experimental. There are people that they okay, the family is well functioning. The environment is so good. There's nothing that they've lacked. But because they hear there's something called alcohol, bang or cigarette, heroine, cocaine, name them. They just want to have that feeling. By the way, how do people feel when they smoke? How do people feel when they sniff gum? When do how do people feel when they they they take whichever kind of drug they want to experiment on? Then accessibility. There are some parents that take alcohol. There are some parents that use these drugs and they bring them home. I know of a family right now that is dealing with their teenager who is taking alcohol and actually abusing it. It's very difficult for them to correct the teenager because when I talked to the teenager, when did you first take this alcohol? The teenager told me when I was 6 years old. Now this uh I can call him a man because he's now an adult is 19. And when he was six, the father used to take alcohol. He used to bring alcohol at home and put it in the fridge. So when the daddy's drunk has gone to the bedroom, the small you know the amount that is left in the bottle the boy will come and clear the bottle for the the father and when the father is not there he could go to the fridge and if there's any that is open he kept on sipping and little by little right now he's into the game and he's doing it so so well according to him. So let us avoid that stressful early life experience. Some children are abused in the families. Some child sexual abuse and other kind of traumas. There are so many kind of traumas that people can go through. So if there are some people that when they go through this and it's not handled properly, they've not seek help, they've not healed, high chances are they are going to find themselves using drugs and even abusing them. Genetic uh predisposition. Now we have a family a chain of you know like you'll say this family is known for you know alcoholism they take alcohol their grandmother was taking their grandfather was taking it tickles down to the parents and eventually to the to the children then uh prenatal exposure to alcohol or other drugs. When a mother is expecting a baby and this mother decides to take alcohol, high chances are that if you don't take uh great care, this child will eventually start taking alcohol. Now, how can you spot this? Because we can't sit down and say that it is okay. I will definitely know by the time you are seeing your child staggering, the child has really matured into this game. Now, some children will start making secretive calls. They'll start missing school, locking uh themselves in the bedroom, frequently asking for money, ignoring or breaking curfews, avoiding eye contacts and uh resisting discipline. You try to hit this child and they block. Or you try and correct, you try correcting them, they resist. then isolating from others. They they sometimes they can start having they start shaking and have tremors. They have bloody watery eyes. Sleeping more than usual. They're always sleeping in their room and that's not what they used to do earlier. Sudden weight loss, losing interest in activities they once enjoyed, hyperactivity or unusual elated. then unable to focus and they become less motivated. Now there's something to note. If you know your son or daughter very well, you'll be able to know that there is something a miss, there's something abnormal, something that never used to be there. And so you'll start questioning and maybe seeking help before this child gets into this to an extent that it will be very difficult. My parting short is it is easier to stay away from drugs and other substances than getting off them. you'd rather avoid getting into it than wait for the time that you'll be struggling to uh get off drugs. Thank you very much. That's what I had for today. This is not the end. We are going to continue. So, watch out for uh more next Sabbath. We have counselors around. We have counseling department. they can support our children, our youth and even the adults. You can uh get you can approach one of them. Our leader is Caroline. I'm also there and we'll share the list of the counselors that we have around. They're well trained. Don't be worried about anything. Be sure of confidentiality. Thank you very much. Let's have a word of prayer before we leave. Thank you Jehovah for allowing us to speak to your children. Lord allow one child or one adult to get a message and uh let them get help. Be with the rest of us who will be joining other uh departments uh for different programs. Take care of everybody. Take care of even our church pastor when his time comes. In Jesus' name we ask. Amen.

TIMESTAMPED TRANSCRIPT:
[0.6s] Happy
[2.8s] Sabbath. Happy
[5.0s] Sabbath. Happy
[7.4s] day. Uh let's bow down for a word of
[11.6s] prayer. Jehovah God, thank you for this
[14.2s] day. We are not taking it for granted.
[17.1s] Speak through me. I don't have the right
[19.4s] language to speak to your children. Let
[22.3s] somebody get help from this message. In
[25.4s] Jesus name we
[27.9s] request. Okay. Uh my name is Jackie
[31.7s] Manguayo and today I'm going to talk
[35.6s] about something that rarely do we want
[38.7s] to hear about and this is drug and
[41.7s] substance abuse. Most of the time people
[45.3s] assume that we can't have such cases of
[48.6s] drug abuse in our churches. That's not
[51.6s] true. We have it and you'll be surprised
[54.6s] if everybody opens up to you. you will
[57.5s] realize in one way or the other we are
[60.1s] abusing drugs.
[63.2s] Um so I would want us to
[67.2s] really define the word drug uh because
[71.1s] we can't assume everyone knows. So drug
[74.4s] is a chemical substance that when
[77.6s] administered to a living organism
[81.0s] produces a biological effect. And this
[84.1s] one, it includes substances used for
[87.0s] medical purposes as well as illicit
[91.3s] purposes. Underline the word illicit
[94.2s] because that one that's the area I'm
[97.4s] interested in so much. Now that's a
[101.6s] drug. Now what about uh drug abuse? This
[105.9s] one refers to the you know repeated use
[109.0s] of drug despite
[111.9s] uh the negative consequences on health
[115.9s] and well-being. It involves using of
[119.5s] drugs or substances to alter mood and
[123.8s] feel better not for medical reasons. If
[127.4s] you talk to the people who have used
[129.7s] illicit drugs or the ones that abuse
[133.2s] even the prescribed drugs, they the most
[137.3s] common response they're going to tell
[139.7s] you the reason why they do this is
[142.2s] there's a feeling that they usually
[144.5s] have. Some people want to sleep. They
[147.3s] had this sleep. So they feel like if
[149.6s] they abuse a certain drug, they're going
[152.2s] to sleep. There are some people who feel
[155.0s] like, "Oh, I'm depressed. I'm sad." And
[158.7s] if I take these, I have I I usually get
[162.5s] that happy mood, happy moment. That's
[165.6s] when they get confidence to talk.
[168.1s] There's always reason for them taking uh
[172.8s] drugs.
[174.6s] Now, today I'm only going to do
[177.6s] introduction. We are going to have this
[179.8s] series for the whole month. So if I get
[183.0s] to some point and you feel you're left
[184.8s] in suspense don't worry we will sort you
[187.8s] out. Now these drugs we have different
[190.6s] roots in which they get into our system
[194.6s] and one of them we can inhale. Sometimes
[198.2s] we can take it orally intravenous where
[201.6s] you inject the veins rectal and
[205.4s] intramuscular
[207.2s] uh trans uh dermal and sublingual. There
[211.0s] are people even put you know some pills
[214.0s] just under their tongue below their
[216.7s] tongue that is sublingual and maybe some
[219.1s] people who have taken some uh
[221.7s] hypertensive pills you might have met
[225.0s] one of them that you put under your
[227.9s] tongue. So there are some that are not
[230.8s] meant for that but people still put them
[234.1s] under the tongue. There are people even
[236.3s] who use tobacco by putting them under
[239.4s] the tongue. So we have different truths.
[241.8s] Now if you can see the images, I hope
[244.6s] it's being
[246.4s] projected. Someone is
[248.6s] injecting you know their vein. And then
[252.3s] there are some that you'll take orally
[254.9s] like their candies that when you go to
[257.9s] the market you might think they're just
[260.8s] normal candies. They are not normal
[263.9s] candies. Some are some are not. Some are
[267.7s] made of marijuana. And yesterday when I
[270.2s] went to the store with my husband, I was
[272.1s] telling him like, you see this kind of
[274.0s] candy? I was doing some research on them
[276.9s] and I realized that some of them are not
[280.5s] just plain candies as we may think, but
[284.0s] they are quoted with marijuana. So don't
[287.4s] just allow your children to be given
[289.4s] candies by anybody thinking that oh
[292.4s] that's just a candy. Someone is being
[294.2s] nice to my child. Don't accept. They
[297.0s] could be introducing your child to drug
[300.7s] and substance use. Now we can smoke
[305.0s] them. Some uh you know cookies. Cookies
[309.0s] made of marijuana and other marijuana.
[313.1s] We commonly know it as bang in Kenya. So
[316.7s] they made of that. They look like any
[319.3s] other cookie. So you'll find like your
[322.3s] youth in the house or your teenager in
[325.0s] the house has come with some cookies and
[327.9s] they eating together with the siblings
[330.1s] and you just feel it's normal. They went
[332.8s] to the store got some cookies and that's
[335.4s] what they having. Sometimes they're not
[337.9s] just having cookies. They're taking
[340.1s] marijuana in your own house, a house
[342.7s] that you are paying rent for. So let us
[346.0s] don't let us not just sit down and
[348.6s] assume that everything that we are
[351.0s] taking are clean and they do they don't
[354.3s] have any uh you know uh substances that
[358.6s] are illicit.
[360.8s] So just be aware of that. But don't go
[364.2s] back home and start punishing your
[366.8s] children for taking cookies or candies
[370.2s] that Jackie said they are all made of
[372.6s] marijuana. I did not say that. I just
[375.7s] said that we need to be extra cautious
[378.8s] because we have them in the market. I've
[381.4s] seen some with my naked eyes. I've met
[384.6s] youth that sell them. They sell them out
[388.1s] there and who knows, they could even be
[390.6s] selling them in church or giving them
[393.0s] free to their friends that they would
[395.6s] want to be in their companies. So we
[399.8s] also have reasons for taking these drugs
[403.9s] and even abusing them. People have
[407.0s] different reasons and your reason might
[409.7s] not be my reason nor the other person's
[413.1s] reason. Now we have people uh you know
[416.7s] start abusing drugs because their
[418.9s] friends do that. So they just say, you
[422.7s] know, because my friends are doing this
[424.7s] and I've never seen them struggle in one
[427.0s] way or the other, why can't I also do
[429.3s] it? And they end up abusing the drugs
[432.3s] that their friends are also abusing. We
[435.4s] have influence of the social media.
[438.2s] Social media is, you know, a place that
[441.8s] most of our youth and even the
[444.0s] grown-ups, the adults are getting
[447.4s] information. And if we don't know what
[450.1s] to do with the information, we might
[452.9s] misuse the information and try to feel
[456.8s] how other people feel. Dysfunctional
[461.2s] families. Some people get into drug
[464.5s] because they have dysfunctional
[467.6s] families. Dad and mom are there, but
[471.6s] there's they don't live like it's a
[473.8s] family. And
[476.5s] so the children might get stressed up
[480.1s] because it's not a dysfunctional family.
[482.8s] The parents don't care so much about
[485.0s] children. Parents come in when they
[487.6s] want, get out when they want and so are
[490.7s] the children. Everybody is a leader in
[493.1s] that family. And such families, it's
[495.9s] very easy for the youth to start abusing
[499.6s] drug. Environmental factors. If you live
[503.4s] in a place that getting drug is so easy
[507.3s] and taking drugs, abusing them is the
[510.6s] norm of the day, it's very easy for your
[514.3s] children to start using drugs. Curiosity
[518.1s] and experimental.
[520.1s] There are people that they okay, the
[523.1s] family is well functioning. The
[524.6s] environment is so good. There's nothing
[527.0s] that they've lacked. But because they
[529.4s] hear there's something called alcohol,
[531.6s] bang or cigarette, heroine, cocaine,
[535.4s] name them. They just want to have that
[537.9s] feeling. By the way, how do people feel
[540.9s] when they smoke? How do people feel when
[543.7s] they sniff gum? When do how do people
[546.4s] feel when they they they take whichever
[550.1s] kind of drug they want to experiment on?
[554.3s] Then
[556.1s] accessibility. There are some parents
[558.4s] that take alcohol. There are some
[560.5s] parents that use these drugs and they
[562.9s] bring them home. I know of a family
[565.3s] right now that is dealing with their
[567.2s] teenager who is taking alcohol and
[570.5s] actually abusing it. It's very difficult
[573.4s] for them to correct the teenager because
[576.2s] when I talked to the teenager, when did
[578.6s] you first take this alcohol? The
[581.4s] teenager told me when I was 6 years old.
[585.5s] Now this uh I can call him a man because
[588.5s] he's now an adult is 19. And when he was
[592.1s] six, the father used to take alcohol. He
[594.6s] used to bring alcohol at home and put it
[597.0s] in the fridge. So when the daddy's drunk
[600.1s] has gone to the bedroom, the small you
[603.5s] know the amount that is left in the
[605.6s] bottle the boy will come and clear the
[608.2s] bottle for the the father and when the
[611.0s] father is not there he could go to the
[612.8s] fridge and if there's any that is open
[615.4s] he kept on sipping and little by little
[618.8s] right now he's into the game and he's
[622.0s] doing it so so well according to him. So
[625.5s] let us avoid that stressful early life
[629.9s] experience. Some children are abused in
[632.9s] the families. Some child sexual abuse
[637.4s] and other kind of traumas. There are so
[639.5s] many kind of traumas that people can go
[642.6s] through. So if there are some people
[644.9s] that when they go through this and it's
[647.3s] not handled properly, they've not seek
[650.6s] help, they've not healed, high chances
[654.2s] are they are going to find themselves
[657.3s] using drugs and even abusing
[660.8s] them. Genetic uh
[664.0s] predisposition. Now we have a family a
[667.4s] chain of you know like you'll say this
[669.6s] family is known for you know alcoholism
[673.1s] they take alcohol their grandmother was
[675.4s] taking their grandfather was taking it
[677.6s] tickles down to the parents and
[680.4s] eventually to the to the children then
[683.9s] uh prenatal exposure to alcohol or other
[687.4s] drugs. When a mother is expecting a baby
[690.3s] and this mother decides to take alcohol,
[692.9s] high chances are that if you don't take
[696.6s] uh great care, this child will
[699.2s] eventually start taking alcohol. Now,
[702.9s] how can you spot this? Because we can't
[705.7s] sit down and say that it is okay. I will
[709.4s] definitely know by the time you are
[711.3s] seeing your child staggering, the child
[713.8s] has really matured into this game. Now,
[717.4s] some children will start making
[719.8s] secretive calls. They'll start missing
[722.6s] school, locking uh themselves in the
[726.2s] bedroom, frequently asking for money,
[729.7s] ignoring or breaking curfews, avoiding
[733.8s] eye contacts and uh resisting
[736.8s] discipline. You try to hit this child
[739.2s] and they block. Or you try and correct,
[742.1s] you try correcting them, they resist.
[744.8s] then isolating from others. They they
[749.0s] sometimes they can start having they
[751.3s] start shaking and have tremors. They
[754.2s] have bloody watery eyes. Sleeping more
[757.7s] than usual. They're always sleeping in
[759.9s] their room and that's not what they used
[762.0s] to do earlier. Sudden weight loss,
[765.2s] losing interest in activities they once
[767.9s] enjoyed,
[769.6s] hyperactivity or unusual elated. then
[773.8s] unable to focus and they become less
[778.0s] motivated.
[779.7s] Now there's something to note. If you
[783.5s] know your son or daughter very well,
[788.1s] you'll be able to know that there is
[791.0s] something a miss, there's something
[793.6s] abnormal, something that never used to
[796.1s] be there. And so you'll start
[797.8s] questioning and maybe seeking help
[800.5s] before this child gets into this to an
[803.7s] extent that it will be very difficult.
[806.7s] My parting short is it is easier to stay
[810.6s] away from drugs and other substances
[814.1s] than getting off them. you'd rather
[817.5s] avoid getting into it than wait for the
[821.4s] time that you'll be struggling to uh get
[825.0s] off drugs. Thank you very much. That's
[828.3s] what I had for today. This is not the
[831.2s] end. We are going to continue. So, watch
[834.3s] out for uh more next Sabbath. We have
[837.6s] counselors around. We have counseling
[840.3s] department. they can support our
[842.7s] children, our youth and even the adults.
[846.6s] You can uh get you can approach one of
[849.2s] them. Our leader is Caroline. I'm also
[852.2s] there and we'll share the list of the
[854.6s] counselors that we have around. They're
[856.6s] well trained. Don't be worried about
[859.5s] anything. Be sure of
[861.9s] confidentiality. Thank you very much.
[864.9s] Let's have a word of prayer before we
[867.6s] leave. Thank you Jehovah for allowing us
[870.0s] to speak to your children. Lord allow
[872.7s] one child or one adult to get a message
[876.2s] and uh let them get help. Be with the
[879.2s] rest of us who will be joining other uh
[883.0s] departments uh for different programs.
[885.7s] Take care of everybody. Take care of
[887.6s] even our church pastor when his time
[889.9s] comes. In Jesus' name we ask. Amen.
