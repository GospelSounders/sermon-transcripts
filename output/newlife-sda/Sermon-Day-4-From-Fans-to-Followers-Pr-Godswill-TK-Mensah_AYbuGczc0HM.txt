FULL TRANSCRIPT:
Good evening. That's a weak one. Good evening. How was your day? Good or bad? No response. How was your day? Good or bad? Okay. Good, bad, in between. How was your day? Good. All right. As I always do, it was Jesus himself who said, "If you continue in my words, then you are my disciples indeed, and you shall know the truth, and the truth shall set you free. If the Son set you free, you will be free indeed." Can someone say an amen out there? Week one. Can someone say an amen out there? Amen. I make to you four promises. Promise number one is the Bible is going to be the bedrock of our study. The reason is the Bible means what it says and says just what it means. Promise number two is you shall be enlightened regardless of who you are. Promise number three, you are going to be challenged to make the most important decision of your life. And then promise number four, your life and mine will never be the same. Our subject for this evening is being retweaked from fans to followers subheading the cost of true disciplehip. What we intended to share today, we will share that tomorrow. But in the intervening period for this evening, our subject is from fans to followers. The subheading is the cost of true disciplehip. Our brother theme for this week is called charged commission. And we are attempting to say God has called us for something unusual. And in context, we are called to all the world to be witnesses of Christ including the world of academia, the campuses. And then we have been charged with a message through the power of the Holy Spirit. And then we have been commissioned to all the ends of the earth regardless of tribe, ethnicity, status. There is something God is expecting in this last days. So day number one, we dealt with the forgotten battlefield. Why campus ministries hold the future of the church. Day number two, we dealt with blueprints for a movement. The subtitle is heaven's vision for campus ministry. And then yesterday we look at loss in plain sight. Why disciplehip is the only defense. We looked at how we are losing membership. Christians across the world including our own church and on campus is becoming threatening. The very existential life of the church is at a threat. In the words of the leader of the archives at the general conference, our church is an endangered species. So what is the solution? Disciplehip. But for this evening we want to look at a different framework of disciplehip. That is the cost of disciplehip. The reason [Music] we are where we are globally it's because majority of us are fans of Jesus and not followers. And the underpinninging is we don't understand the cost of disciplehip. Let's bow our heads one more time. Father in heaven, as we unveil this area of your word, we pray tonight for understanding. Speak through me. Speak to me. And then all of us then will be blessed. Let them not hear my sinful voice. May they hear the voice of Jesus. Not I, but Christ. Be honored. Love and exalted. Not I, but Christ. Be seen. Be known and be heard. Not I, but Christ in every look and action. Not I, but Christ in every thought and word. In Jesus name. Somebody should say an amen. Amen. From fans to followers. I have two objectives or goals for this evening. Goal number one is to awaken hearts to the difference between being admirers of Christ and authentic followers. Calling hearers, myself inclusive, to surrender everything and truly walk in his step. So are you an admirer of Jesus or are you an authentic follower? My second goal for tonight is to challenge the church by that not the structure members myself inclusive to move beyond shallow Christianity to embrace daily cost daily sacrifice and daily mission of real disciplehip from fans to followers. I want to make a major statement. Jesus never called anyone to be his fan or an admirer. Be it in close range or from distance. He calls us to be followers who walk his costly, narrow and sacrificial path. No shortcuts, no half-hearted loyalty. It's either you give your all or you give nothing else. So this is the basis of this evening. Now yesterday we close with me reminding you that in the New Testament Christians are mentioned three times. In the new testament disciple mates it's mentioned 261 times and the word believer depending on the translation you are using about 2 to 10 times in accent. The New Testament framework is not for us to be Christians, not just for us to be fans or believers, but we must become disciples. A disciple must of course be a believer. But when you study Jesus's model of disciplehip, it's more radical than we ever could imagine. Very disturbing, very profound, and very demanding from funds to followers. In essence, a disciple is a people or a learner. But it's deeper than just being a learner. So if you see me using the word today interchangeably when I mean follower I'm referring to disciple just definition of term and clarity when you see me use the word interchangeably anytime I'm referring to a follower I'm referring to a disciple in ence Christ disciplehip framework involves deliberate choice definite denial and determined obedience And I'm going to break that down today. What we see today and one of the reason why students are not committed to Christ, majority are fans of Jesus or disciples from the shallow substandard perspective being masqueraded in the 21st century without the cause that it demands. In every church, in every community, there must be disciplehip. In the New Testament, when the disciples are called to be disciples in the early church, they know it is called uncompromising commitment. No wonder Peter said Mark 10:28, we have left everything to follow you. Peter was not a fan. He was a follower. We have left everything to follow you. Now this defines the death of disciplehip. Let me say it differently. Whenever we baptize people, we are so fixated with the numbers and only God can tell the purpose for our fixation with the numbers. Then we don't graduate the folks, children, young people, our own sons and daughters. They remain baptized members on the book. They never become believers. They never become followers in excence. They never become disciples in the true sense of the word. And how do you know? Many have left nothing and followed Christ. Follow me. In the book of John chapter 6 verse 6-6, the Bible says there were group of people who claimed to be followers, but Jesus knew they were not followers. They were his fans. So in John 6:66, while they were moving with Jesus for a while, Jesus made some disturbing statement. And the Bible says from that time many of his disciples they turned back and no longer followed him. Because of the cost of disciplehip many of Jesus's disciples they changed their status from being followers and they became fans of Jesus. I will explain. When we say discipleship, what do we mean in excent? We are talking about individuals who love Jesus. They love him without reservation. They are learners from him or they learn from him and they are loyal to him alone. So disciples they love him they learn from him and they are loyal to him alone. Anything apart from this the individual is not a follower. The individual is what? A fan. on Saturday when you see the numbers and those of you who may go to church on Sunday watching across many people who claim to be followers of Jesus or to be believers and disciples of Jesus the best definition we are not just followers no we are not we are just the fans of Jesus how we don't love him comprehensively we don't learn from him unreservedly and we are not loyal to him alone. Let me say it differently. We love Jesus but we love other things more than Jesus. We worship the Lord but we worship other things more than the Lord. We speak about Jesus but we speak about other things more than the Lord. We are loyal to Jesus but we are not loyal to him alone. We are loyal to other things more than Jesus. This is the way I put it. Disciplehip is not what you study. It's it's what you surrender. It's not just knowledge you acquire. It's the cross you carry. Listen, I am never fixated about the number of church members we have across the world. It's not the KPI of qualitative Christianity. The question is we are going to the general conference searching again and young people hear me right. When we say praise the Lord, we have 25 million church members. The question we ought to ask is are they fans of Jesus or they are followers of Jesus? Let's bring it home. Are you a follower or you are a fan? If ever the campus will see a hall of the spiritual declivity, we need to move our members from just being church members to the place of disciplehip. I used to give a presentation titled the seven pillars to change the world of campus. It's only based on one critical philosophy and this is church members become disciples of Christ. So the question then is what does it mean to be a disciple? I've used some 3 L uh to describe it. But it's more deeper than that. How do we become how do you understand what it means to be a disciple? I'm going to give some point and then I'm going to focus on some key points getting to the tail end. Take note one, disciplehip is a death sentence before it's a mission field. Take note. In ence, you cannot truly follow Jesus until something in you dies. Many people are alive still with Jesus. We can't be with Christ and then we are still living for self. So disciplehip means I am willing to die for Jesus before I go to a mission field. I will explain how do I know Jesus says Luke 9:23 if anyone desires to come after me let him deny himself take up his cross and follow me. I'll be breaking this text down in couple of minutes. But my first point is discipleship is death sentence before it's a mission field. Point number two, what do I mean or does the Bible mean when it says disciplehip? Meaning number two, disciplehip. Watch the text very carefully. Luke 6 verse 40. If anyone desires to come after me, let him deny himself. take up his cross and follow me. Disciplehip is the transfer of the teacher spirit not just his knowledge. Many individual are so obsessed with information without it leading to transformation. So disciplehip is just not knowing the Bible. It's just not understanding the spirit of prophecy. It's not just knowing the doctrines of the church. Disciplehip is the transfer of the spirit of Jesus. Not just the knowledge of Jesus. Many of us know about Christ but we are yet to know Christ. The knowledge of Christ must lead to adopting the spirit of Christ. The question this evening is if you are a fan of Jesus, you are not yet a Christian. I'm sorry. And we are going to see in in in in in in the next few minutes, many of us are not yet Christians. Why we are not yet disciples? Do you just have a knowledge of Christ and you have not yet adopted his spirit, his spirit of forgiveness, his spirit of love, his spirit of integrity, his spirit of obedience? Ladies and gentlemen, the question is Christianity is not a popularity context. Is either we are Christians or we are not. What do we mean when we talk about disciplehip? Disciplehip in ence is the divine disruption of all other loyalties. I put it this way. Jesus was not anti-f family. He was not anti- idolatry. Disciplehip demands that every allegent bow to the supremacy of Christ. If anyone comes to me and does not hate his father and mother and wife and children, he cannot be my disciples. Jesus is saying it is a divine disruption of all other loyalty. I must be first. I must be best and I must be the last. Ellen White says those who make God first, best and last, they are the happiest people in the world. Somebody should say an amen out there. Disciplehip is divine disruption of all other loyalties. In other words, loyalty must only be to Christ alone. Supreme loyalty. Following Jesus may not just cost you your schedule or schedule. It might cost you your safety net. Your father cannot come before Christ. Your mother cannot come before Christ. Your boyfriend cannot come before Christ. Your daddy cannot come before Christ. Disciplehip mean God is disrupting all other loyalty. He wants to be the first. He want to be the best and he wants to be the last. Anything aside these you are a fan not a follower. What do we mean when we say disciplehip he say go into all the world make disciples of all nations. Matthew chapter 28:e 19 disciplehip is heaven's strategy for wealth domination. The reason why Christianity has not yet dominated the world is we have a lot of believers in code, a lot of Christians in code, a lot of fans not followers. Every true disciple becomes a multiplier not a monument. Disciplehip. Disciplehip means every branch in me, Jesus says, that bears fruit, he prunes that it may bear more fruits. Every branch in me that bears fruit already bearing fruit. Jesus is not satisfied with our mediocre spirituality. He wants much more. So he says, "I will prune you and I will make you bear more fruit." In essence, disciplehip is the refining fire that burns the canal out of those who are called. Disciplehip. If you abide in me, my word and then you are my disciples indeed. That is what I use for my introduction. and you shall know the truth and the truth shall set you free. Disciplehip is the is is is is the fusion of obedience and intimacy. You are not a disciple because you are you are attending an event. You are a disciple because you obey. Disciplehip. Do not be conformed to this world, but be transformed by the renewing of the mind. In excellent, disciplehip is the journey of being unmade by the world and remade by the word. Disciplehip. Look at the text again. Do not be conformed to this world but be transformed by the renewing of the mind. In ence, disciplehip is the journey of being made or unmade by the world and remade by the word. Anybody in church and still not being unmade by the world, the world losing its grip and chains and allurement then it means the world is not remaking us. We are not disciples then at best we are followers. Let me say it one more time. differently. I want that to be projected. You don't change a campus by trending. You change it by training disciples. The reason we have not dominated the public campuses, we have a lot of fans of Jesus who are yet to become followers of Jesus. Listen, it's not trends that makes us change the campuses. It is training disciples. Without training disciple, Ellen White says, "With such an army of youth, rightly trained might furnish how soon the message of a crucified, risen, and sooncoming savior might be carried to the whole well education." And she says, "The youth are the Lord's helping hand." Messages to young people, page 196. I repeat again. Hear me. We are not losing the campuses because the campuses, the enemy is too strong. We are losing them because the armies God had there. They are undiscipled. They are untrained and they are unfocused. The reason why the universities tomorrow I'm going to deal with it the jungles of the university. It's not that Satan is powerful. It's not that atheism agnosticism or its bewitching influence or all the ism you can have. It's not as if they are powerful. The difficulty is that we have not discipled God's army, trained God army and focused them. Many young people are very disfocused. I dare say many of we the pastors, many of we the elders, many of we the parents. We are ourselves not yet followers of Christ. So our children are growing. Many of us may be here even tonight. Chances are that we are not yet followers. We are fans of Jesus. Always fans of Jesus. And I want to spare some time in the words of AW to the greatest need of the hour is not for more events but for more obedient disciples. The greatest need of the hour is not for more events. We think that activities will now become productivity. No, we can organize revivals upon revival. The trust of the matter is are we fans of Jesus or we are followers of Jesus. Our subject for this evening from fans to followers subheading the cost of disciplehip. Here is the beef. I'm coming to share some key points. John 14:E1 15. I'm now coming to share what is now the identifying mark between a fan and a follower. I will do the contrast. Who is a fan? Who is a follower? I've bulleted it one by one. I will take my time and I pray that God will grant us including myself understanding. Number one, fans admire Jesus. Followers obey Jesus. Jesus says, "If you love me, you keep my commandment. Immediately you are admiring Jesus." And I have in my notes here. You see many of us admire the power of Jesus, the miracle of Jesus, the sympathy, all the virtues of Jesus. We admire him. But admiring the ethos, the things that make Jesus Jesus admiring it doesn't make you a follower. At best, you are what? A fan of Jesus. How do I know I am a follower? It's obedience. It's easy. to applaud the wisdom of Jesus, the compassion of Jesus, the courage of Jesus. Many admire his sermons on the mount. Many apply the golden rule of Jesus. Many marvel at his miracles. All these doesn't make us followers. We are fans of Jesus. We cheer him from the sidelines. We are moved by his words but we are unchanged in our hearts towards him. But the followers are different. They don't merely admire Jesus. They imitate Jesus through obedience. Anytime you you think about it, are you a fan of Jesus or you are a follower of Jesus? Fans admire Jesus. It's not enough to admire him. Example, the rich young ruler. Luke 18:8-23. He admired Jesus. He came to him, he bowed. But when he gave the rule to following him, the Bible says he walked away sorrowful. That is not a follower. The rich young ruler was the a fan of Jesus. Peter in Luke 5:5-11 obeyed. He left all and followed Jesus. That is a follower. Are you a fan or you are a follower? Second identify in Mark the book of Philippians chapter 1 vers 29. You see fans want blessings. Followers embrace suffering. I will explain. For to you it has been granted on behalf of Christ not only to believe in him but also to suffer for his sake. Take note the funds want the blessing. Anytime your motivation of coming to Jesus is the blessing, is the favor, is the grace, is the abundance, is the healing, is the knowledge, is the protection, is the shield. Be he become your God. Know that you are not a follower, you are a fan. How do you know you are a follower? If you are willing to embrace the suffering of following Jesus, fans seek the benefits from following Jesus. Followers embrace both the blessings and the cross. Fans when they come to Jesus, what they ask is can I get the healing? Can I get the success? Can I get the peace of mind? But followers know the true disciplehip it includes I'm ready to suffer for his name's sake. The question this evening is on campus. Many young people are fans of Jesus. They are not yet followers. Let me whisper it nicely. the parents, elders, pastors, church leaders, preachers like Tikman, we have become fans of Jesus but not followers of Jesus. Do you know why? This why the church is weak. This why the world has not yet taken cognizance of who we are. Not by virtue of mere miracles, by virtue of how we live, what we do, and how we carry ourselves. We are not followers yet. We are fans of Jesus. What makes me a fan or a follower? Point number three, fans serve when it's easy. Followers serve at any costs. 2 Timothy 4:2, preach the word. be ready in season and out of season. That is a follower with all longsuffering and teaching. So let me say this way. Fans serve when convenient is or it is convenient but followers serve no matter the costs. Immediately serving Jesus. It must be when it is convenient for you. You know that you are not a fan. Can you serve the Lord faithfully even when you are endangered? Some of us cannot even keep a basic Sabbath just because of a chemistry result. Just be can you imagine any time serving Christ we sacrifice him for convenience. We we we serve him when it is it is possible for me. Not when I am disturbed or worried. We should know that we are not followers. We are fans of Jesus. It reminds me of second Timothy 4:10. This man by name Dee, Paul says he left me for worldly ease. redeem us. He was a fan of the gospel. But when you look at act seven, Steven served even to death. That is a follower. If you ask what makes I'm talking about from fun to followers, the cost of disciplehip cost number four or mark number four. Fans cheer at a distance but followers they walk closely in his step. I will explain. Look at the basis of my argument. For to this you were called. I'm talking about 1 Peter 2:21. For to this you were called because Christ also suffered for us living as an example that you should follow his footstep. Many who are fans, they cheer Jesus from the sideline, from a distance. They love him from a distance. They shout his name from a distance. But those who are followers, they follow step by step. In other words, they are ready. Fans have faith when it is it is a private faith. Followers, they walk boldly even in public in Jesus's step. Fans can be very loud and noisy. But followers, they are not speakers. They are the doers. Immediately your Christianity is more of what you say much more than what you do. You are not a follower. You are a fan. Fans are silent sometimes when it is unpopular or inconvenient. They fear being labeled or rejected. But followers, however difficult the embarrassment and the shame, they are ready to identify with Jesus. A typical example in John chapter 3 verse 1 to verse two, Nicodemus at that phase of the chapter. He was not a follower yet. He was a fan of Jesus. When did he come to Jesus? At night. But John the beloved in John 19:26 at the cross. When others fled, John was there with the mother of Jesus. He was willing to go with him step by step. Many of us are not followers. We are fans of Jesus. How do we know we are fans or followers? The fans ask, "What is in it for me?" Followers of Jesus will say, "What does he require of me?" Micah 6:8, he has shown you, oh man, what is good and what does the Lord require of you? But to do justly, to love mercy, and to walk humbly with your God. When you are a fan, you ask, "What is it when I follow Jesus?" But if you are a follower, you ask, "What does he want from me?" In case in point in Mark chapter 10:35 to 37 James and John they sought position they were no followers at that stage they were fans of Jesus so they were asking what is it in it for me even their mother came but Isaiah in Isaiah 6:8 he said here I am send me what do you want me to do for you Lord I will do it. There is a a a contrast between a fun and a follower. Fans seek potential gain. Followers seek God's will. Fans seek popularity, but followers seek God's way. Fans comes to Jesus with wish lists. Followers come with him with open hands. Fans want their dreams fulfilled. Followers want God's will and God's purpose fulfilled. Followers surrender their plans trusting in God's will even when it's hard. But fans at all cost it must be their will or they lose interest in seeking his face. Jesus prayed, "Not my will but your will be done." Let me ask you, if for the next 50 years all the prayers you pray, God's answer to you will be no, will you still pray? If no, you are a fan, not a follower. Let me say it differently. If the next 50 years or just say the next one year, every prayer you pray, God will not answer. Will you still communicate with him? If no, you are a fan. In other words, fans, they use the Lord. Followers are used by the Lord. Let me say it one more time. Fans use Jesus. They come to him, I need healing. I need peace. My daughter should go to MIT. They should go to Ivy League school. I need a boyfriend. I need a husband. I need a baby. I need a this. I need a that. They use Jesus like an ATM card. And sometimes we use him like a prostitute. When we are done, we dock him. We are fans. How do I know I'm a fan or I'm a follower? Fans choose comfort. Followers choose the cross. Luke 9:23. Then he said to them all, "If anyone desires to come after me, let him deny himself and take up his cross daily and follow me." Fans they choose comfort. Followers they choose the cross. In other words, fans avoid hardship. Followers embrace sacrifice. Fans look for the easy road, the path of least resistance. When things get hard, they retreat. But followers, however difficult the hardship may be, they are willing because they are loyal to him and him alone. An example, they will be followers of Jesus in the book of Luke chapter 9. Say, "Master, I will follow you wherever you go." And Jesus said, "Foxes up hold." And the rest of it, he gave up on Christ. Let me go and bury my mother. Let me go and do this. No. Many of us, we choose comfort. But those who are followers, they choose the cross. If I were to have time, we'll have sung the song all to Jesus. I surrender. Listen, it's a scam. Sometimes I wish we just close the church. Everybody should go home. What do we come doing at all? What do we come to do? It's like who is who has bewitched us to pretend if we will worship God, let's do him full time, if we will not worship him, nobody is forcing us. In the universities, many young people have not yet committed to the Lord fully. They are fans of Jesus. It's so popular to say I'm a Christian. It's so fancy to say I'm a Christian. Many of us are going along just to get along. But the followers of Jesus, they will choose the cross. How do we know we are fans or we are followers? Fans love his miracles, but followers love his message. John 6:26, I say to you, you seek me not not because you saw the signs, but because you ate of the loaves and were filled. Fans love the miracle five loaves to 5,000. But those who are followers, they love his message. A case in point the crowd after feeding John chapter 6 verse 26 Jesus said it and then Mary at Bethany in the book of Luke 10:39 she sat at the feet of Jesus and she will never be moved. She was so passionate about the message not just about the loaves not just about the miracles. Fans chase signs followers hunger for truth. Fans want excitement. They look for miracles, wonders, and emotional highs. When the signs fade, so does their interest. But for the followers is the message. They crave after God. They desire his word, his wisdom, his presence, his instruction, his direction. As the dear pant for so much soul hunger after thee. Listen, who is forcing us to be Christians? Are you a fan or you are a follower? How do we know we are fans or followers? Fans follow the crowd. The followers, they follow the Christ. Matthew 7:13 to 14. Enter by the narrow gates. For wide is the gate and broad is the way that leads to destruction and there are many who go in by it. Because narrow is the gate and difficult is the way which leads to life and there are few who find it. Many of us we follow the crowd but the followers they follow the Christ reminds me of our song I'll follow thee my savior where so red my lot may be where thou goes I will follow yes my lord I will follow thee fans go with the majority followers stand with Christ even if you in Christianom today. The reason why many people are on on the Broadway is because many who claim to be Christians are fans. They follow where the crowd is. So they go with the majority. But followers, they follow the Christ. Fans love the crowd's approval. They follow Christ as long as others do. But when the path becomes difficult, they turn back. followers are willing to go alone. They are willing to go regardless of the number. That is the distinction. It reminds me during the Palm Sunday, the crowd who were the fans, they praise him today, tomorrow they crucified him. But the 11 apostles in act 1:14, they followed after the crowd left. Are you a fan or you are a follower? Our subject for this night, from fans to followers. It's my contention that by the grace of God, God will move us from being mere fans, mere admirers of Jesus to adant followers of Christ. How do I know I am a fan? Fans prefer convenience. Followers endure the cost. It reminds me Matthew 8:19 to20. Then a certain scribe came and said to him, "Teacher, I will follow you wherever you go." And Jesus said, "Foxes have holes and birds of the air have nest, but the son of man has nothing to lay his hand. He returned." Many of us are enthusiastic fans. But like Paul, he said, "I endured all for the sake of Christ." Funs they hide faith when tested, but followers confess Christ boldly. Fans, they want inspiration. Followers want transformation. Many of us are excited about the the inspiration of the gospel, not its transformation. And the Bible says in Romans 12, "And do not be conformed to this world, but be transformed by the renewing of your mind." Fans like to hear good words, followers, let God change them. fans enjoy uplifting sermons, powerful music, inspiring talks, as long as it doesn't change their comfort zone. They seek affirmation without transformation. But followers, they welcome the convicting voice of the Holy Spirit. They don't just want to feel good. They want to change. So they will say, "Change me, Lord. Change my heart. Change my spirit." But friends they are excited about the powerful Sabbath sermon the powerful ministration the powerful present the powerful life everything was powerful but the only thing that will not change their heart will be the same camp meeting from camp meeting campus crusade to cample crusade 10 days to 10 days week of prayer to week of prayer nothing change listen you are a fan you are not a follower like Herod in Mark 6:20. He liked to hear John the Baptist, but Herod never changed. He rather went and take his brother's wife and married the brother's wife. And when John the Baptist was preaching, the Bible says in Mark 6:20, Herod love John the Baptist inspiration, but he will never be changed. Bzakios. He was a follower. When he heard about this Messiah, a short man climbed the sycamore tree and he says, "Rabbi, time with me." And when he got to his house, he did restitution. All the people I seal, I will return to them a four-fold. He was not just a person interested in inspiration. Zaki needs transformation. The SDA church you in Kenya you do a lot of programs. So a lot of program I follow you pastor a lot of program across. I admire your tenacity. Are you just being inspired as for West Africa? We already dead you know. Is it just inspiration or you want transformation? Funds they seek favor with people but followers they seek favor with God. For do I now persuade men or God? Or do I seek to please men? For if I still preach or if I still please men, I would not be a born servant of Christ including pastors, preachers. If what I am doing here is for human applause, God knows. He sees the heart. If my diligence in study is to show something that is much more than God's will and way for this hour, I am a fan. I'm seeking the favor, the applause of men. You can be anointed and you can have powerful words and you can have revelation, but if it is to seek the favor of men, you will never please Christ. You are not a follower. You are a fan. Pilate sought to please the crowd. Mark 15 verse1 15. But Daniel sought to please God. Which are we? A fan or a follower? It reminds me look fans come for the benefits. Followers stay for the burden. John 6 from verse 66 to 68. From that time many of his disciples went back and walked with him no more. They came for the benefit. Anytime your motivation of following Christ is for the benefit, you go to hell. You are a fan. It's simple. Let me say it one more time. Anytime the motivation of coming to Christ is for the benefit, you are candidate for hell. You are not a follower. You are a fan. But when you are ready to stay, even when there are burdens, you carry the burdens with the Lord. Like Simon, the black man who carried the cross with Christ, you are willing to suffer. It says for as many as surface with him shall also glory with him. Many of us will come for the benefit. Our children know God is powerful, God is good, God is gracious, God is strong, God is that. They don't know the cost of following God. So when they grow a little and they notice that no, it is not what mommy and daddy said. Listen, tell them from a younger age, it's tough to be a Christian. It's tough to be a follower. Let them know the difference between being a fan and being a follower like many of the disciples or like Peter. I don't want to be a fan of Jesus, an admirer of Jesus. I admire his power, his humility, his grace, his efficacy, his authority. No, I don't want that. I want to be a follower. Ladies and gentlemen, fans, they praise when it's used to them. Followers praise no matter what. Fans they use Jesus to build their life. Followers let Jesus become their life. Let me say it one more time. When you are a fan you will use Jesus to build your life. Some of us we have used Jesus. People are eating because of Jesus. They are eating daily bread because of Jesus. So the reason why they pray that is why they get daily bread. The reason why they worship that is how they survive. Because the Bible say in him we live. In him we move. In him we have our being. So because we want to live, we want to move. We want to have our being. What must we do? We will follow Jesus. We use him to build our life. But a follower will let Jesus become their alive. Galatians 2 verse 20. I have been crucified with Christ. It is no longer I who live but Christ lives in me. The life which I now live in the flesh. I live by the faith in the son of God. Hear me. Fans want Jesus for personal gain. Followers surrender all to him. Fans come to Jesus hoping to get something like health, like wealth, like success. Their focus is what can Jesus do for me? followers come to Jesus with empty hands surrendered heart and they say Lord do to me according to your gra like the way Mary a 17year-old virgin said let it be to your maid servant according to your will that is a follower hear me fans they quit when it's hard followers they cling when it's hardest but Simon Peter answered Lord To whom shall we go? You have the words of eternal life. You see, fans give up following Christ. Followers cling tighter when the going gets tough. Fans lose heart when trials come. Their faith has always been shallow, but followers are willing to go. Paul said, "We are hardpressed on every side yet not crush, struck down but not destroy." Two Corinthians 4:8 and verse 9. Are you a fan or you are a follower? From fans to followers. Fans they settle for emotional moments. Followers hunger for spiritual growth. But solid food belong to those who are all of age. That is those who by reason offers have their senses exercised to discern both good and evil. Hebrews 5:14. In essence, fans want feeling, followers want maturity and death. Enough of the emotionalism in Christian dom. We don't pray when we feel life. We pray because we will we we we we watch by faith that Christ understands he hears. We don't do it when we feel like. We need to transition from emotionalism from being an ardent believer. I hunger for spiritual growth. I read the Bible not when I feel like. I pray not like when I feel like. This fairweather Christianity is not followership. It's not disciplehip. At best you are an admirer of Christianity. The Christian ethos, the Christian principle, the Christian philosophy, funds, they measure by size and success. Followers, they measure by sacrifice and faithfulness. Moreover, it is required that one be found faithful. It reminds me of those who were the builders in the tower of Babel. Genesis chapter 11. They wanted faith. In Genesis chapter 6:22, Noah he preached to an unresponsive world. Two groups, one they are ceased by success. Another one they are measure by sacrifice and faithfulness. God did not call us to be successful. He called us to be what? Faithful friends. They follow from afar. Followers follow face to face. Fans they call him Lord in word. Followers they call him Lord indeed. My sheep hear my voice and I know them and they follow me. In excent all I have said this evening in summary. There are two groups in the church. Among the pastors, among the church administrators, the reason why among the church members, the choir leaders, the how do we call them, the church board, the reason why Jesus says, and many will say to me on that day, Lord, Lord, did we not prophesy in your name and in your name done wonders, undeniable miracles? And I would tell them plainly, "Depart from me, you workers of iniquity." The reason is they were not followers. They were fans. When you're a fan, God can use you. He even used Cyrus. You He even used Babylon to fulfill his agenda. Even he used a donkey. If he can use a donkey, he can use a godless human being who is a fan. Being used by God is not a testament of your redemption. Get it clear. Many will say to me under the Lord, "Did we not prophesy in your name and in your name cast out demons?" Samson was being used by God to break the bows of the Philistines major city walls. But guess what? He was on the path to destruction. It's not enough to be used by God. Being used by God is not a sign of my redemption. You can be a fan and God will make use of you. But you are not converted. In summary, I don't want to admire Jesus. I want to obey Jesus. I don't want the blessings of Jesus. I want to embrace the sufferings of Jesus. I don't want to serve when it's easy. I want to serve at any cost. I don't want to cheer at a distance. I want to walk closely in his footstep. I don't want what is in it for me. I want to ask him what does he require of me? I don't want to choose comfort. I want to choose the cross. I as a person I want to love him based on his message not just because of his miracles. I want to follow the Christ not the crowd. I as a person as I'm growing in Christ and I want to be a disciple I hear me I don't prefer convenience. I want to endure any cost for Christ. I as a person I have committed that look I will not hide my faith when it is tested I'll confess Christ boldly in the rest for the rest of my life I have made a covenant with God that by his grace I want transformation not mere inspiration I want to seek favor from God not favor from men for the rest of my life I pray God help me I want to come to him and take the burdens with him. I don't want to come just for his benefits. I don't want to praise when it suits me. I want to praise no matter the costs. I want for the rest of my life to let Jesus order my steps. I don't want to use Jesus to build my life. I don't want to use Jesus to become popular. I want to submit to Jesus without any reservation. If you are here this evening, you don't want to be a fan, but you feel in light of this brief Bible study, you are a fan and you are not a follower. Be honest with yourself. Raise your hand. God be my witness. I am not a follower. I'm just an admirer of Jesus. Hands up. All those of you watching online, if you are not a follower and the Holy Spirit has convicted you that you are a fan, just miserable fan, I cheer Jesus. Please hands down. I want us to sing two songs and call tonight a night and I'm going to ask our head pastor to pray with us when we sing the last. I want us to sing and I want the musicians coming and you sing good song as you did earlier. I will follow thee my savior. What? Where so rare my lot may be. Where thou goest, I will follow. Those of you watching online, I want you to join as we get to sing the last song. Anybody in this auditorium online who feel I want God to convert me from being a fan of Jesus to be a follower of Jesus, I want you to walk and kneel right down here so that we pray. Just sing it. Sit. Just sit down and sing it. As we sing it, watch the lyrics. Listen, nobody is forcing us. If you want to do the world, let's do the well. But if you want to do Christ, we need to do him full time. I will follow thee, my savior. Yes, my lord. Song number 623. Estimol. I'll follow thee. I will follow thee, my savior, wheresoever my lord may be. Where thou goest I will follow. Yes my lord I'll follow thee. I will follow myior. Lift up your voice. Only followers can say this. And though all men should forsake thee by the grace, by the grace I'll follow thee. Though the road be trackless as the fing the falling sea. Thou has trod this way before me. And I'll gladly gladly follow thee follow thee. I will follow thee my savior thee myavior. Thou did share thy blood for me for me and to all the men and women should not by my strength by your grace and follow though I may with tribulation I am so tempted [Music] to go I remember thou was also tempted And I want to rejoice to follow thee. and rejoice to follow thee. I will follow thee for thee my savior [Music] for me and no more man should forsake me by thy grace. Let me stand [Music] there action who forsake and know I be. Thou was testitude afflicted and I only follow thee. I will fall on my savior. I don't want to be a fan. I want to be a follower and all who by thy grace by thy grace I'll follow you. Whilst we sing the last stanza to Jordan rolling before cold and deeply as me. Thou has always before me and I still will follow thee. I will follow thee my savior. God is sure my God for me. I don't want to be a fan. I want to be a follower three times. You sing it very quietly. If you are in this auditorium and you feel you are not a follower and you are a fan, they're going to sing the refrain three times. I want you to come here and kneel down and we pray together. I am not a follower, I am a fan. Just walk down and come here. We call our head pastor to come and pray with us. Just walk down here. I want to be a follower. Currently I am a fan. Just come. Let's sing the refrain. Don't come because others are coming. That makes you a follower. You kneel down right here. and all that shall forsake thee. By thy grace I shall follow thee. I will follow thee my savior. Love that is shed. Thy blood for me and the man should forsake thee. By thy grace I follow thee. I will follow thee my savior that is shed thy blood for me and no one should forsake thee. By thy grace I follow thee. All heads bowed, all eyes closed. [Music] Have mercy upon us, oh Lord. Incline your ear. And because your eyes are moving to and fro to look upon us, we pray that thou may have mercy upon us. Every word spoken tonight is a testimony that indeed I have been a fan and not a follower. I know not about those that are standing and those that are kneeling, but the testimony of your word tonight has shown we have sought for information and not transformation. Father have mercy upon us. We have come to you because of the benefits that you grant unto us. We have come to you because of the miracles and yet we have not come to you that thou may live in us our hope of glory. Have mercy on us, oh Lord. Yet tonight, our prayer is that as these words be settled upon the tables of our minds, transform us into your likeness. May these words be embedded upon our hearts to prick our d senses that father like Peter, like Paul, we may behold the crucified. And like Paul we may say the life that I live now I live not but Christ lives in me my hope of glory. Savior divine we are thankful for these words and how we pray that anyone who has heard the testimony of these words tonight be it in this sanctuary or watching us online. We pray may we never be the same again. As you visit many to pour down your Holy Spirit and prepare many for your kingdom to come. Please do not pass us by. Remember us also and seal us for the heavenly Ghana. And so tonight we are thankful for the message that has been presented to us by your servant. And our prayer is that may the Holy Spirit settle these words upon our hearts to the glory of your name. Besides that, dear father, we are also reminded of the state of our nation. Father, we are praying that you may visit us. The enemy seeks to settle his feet upon our nation, upon our capital and upon the hearts of very many of our young people. But we want to stand against him in the name of Jesus. You have said that when the spirit of the enemy shall pass by, you shall lift up a standard in us high that he shall have no place in us. We pray lift up the standard of these young people, the Gen Z's. lift up the standard upon our nation and every young person especially tonight and tomorrow that my father testimony may be born that you lifted up a standard high and the enemy had no footing neither in our church neither in our young people nor in our nation. Father, blood has been shed before. Lives have been lost before but not anymore. Father in heaven, we refuse these works of the enemy in Jesus name. And we pray gather the young people whom you've said if only but hundred could be brought together where there is one how soon shall your work be brought to an end. So father these 100fold that are coming tonight and others who are out there being inspired to go to the streets. We pray my lord that you may turn their hearts that they may raise the voice of the messiah who is about to come. Jesus Christ we are thankful for our leaders. We pray for them too my lord for sobriety. We pray heavenly father also for those who make decisions in this nation in many ways my father stand in the gap and how we pray heavenly father that the holy spirit may hover around us that father we may be inclined to do thine will. Thank you tonight for thou hast visited us in a powerful way as we walk to our homes as we walk to our resting places. My father we pray walk with us like you walked with those two disciples who went to a mouse. Walk with us also that we may not be blind but that we may see you and hear you whisper to our hearts. Blessed be your name now and forever. For these things we ask in Jesus name. And let God's children say amen. Go in the peace of the Lord and may the Lord bless you. 

==================================================

TIMESTAMPED TRANSCRIPT:
[6.6s] Good evening.
[8.8s] That's a weak one. Good evening.
[13.6s] How was your day?
[16.2s] Good or bad?
[19.1s] No response.
[21.0s] How was your day?
[23.5s] Good or bad?
[26.2s] Okay. Good, bad, in between.
[29.3s] How was your day?
[31.6s] Good.
[33.7s] All right.
[35.4s] As I always do, it was Jesus himself who
[39.5s] said, "If you continue in my words, then
[44.2s] you are my disciples indeed, and you
[47.8s] shall know the truth, and the truth
[51.1s] shall set you free. If the Son set you
[55.1s] free, you will be free indeed." Can
[58.4s] someone say an amen out there?
[61.4s] Week one. Can someone say an amen out
[63.8s] there? Amen. I make to you four
[66.2s] promises. Promise number one is the
[68.4s] Bible is going to be the bedrock of our
[71.4s] study. The reason is the Bible means
[74.4s] what it says and says just what it
[77.8s] means. Promise number two is you shall
[80.6s] be enlightened regardless of who you
[83.1s] are. Promise number three, you are going
[85.7s] to be challenged to make the most
[87.2s] important decision of your life. And
[89.8s] then promise number four, your life and
[93.5s] mine will never be the same. Our subject
[97.9s] for this evening is being retweaked from
[100.8s] fans to followers subheading the cost of
[104.8s] true disciplehip.
[107.7s] What we intended to share today, we will
[110.6s] share that tomorrow. But in the
[112.6s] intervening period for this evening, our
[115.3s] subject is from fans to followers. The
[119.5s] subheading is the cost of true
[123.0s] disciplehip. Our brother theme for this
[126.1s] week is called charged commission. And
[130.6s] we are attempting to say God has called
[134.7s] us for something unusual. And in
[138.1s] context, we are called to all the world
[142.2s] to be witnesses of Christ including the
[144.8s] world of academia, the campuses. And
[148.9s] then we have been charged with a message
[152.6s] through the power of the Holy Spirit.
[155.5s] And then we have been commissioned to
[158.2s] all the ends of the earth regardless of
[162.2s] tribe, ethnicity, status. There is
[166.8s] something God is expecting in this last
[169.9s] days. So day number one, we dealt with
[172.8s] the forgotten battlefield. Why campus
[176.0s] ministries hold the future of the
[179.1s] church.
[181.1s] Day number two, we dealt with blueprints
[185.1s] for a movement. The subtitle is heaven's
[188.6s] vision for campus ministry. And then
[192.5s] yesterday we look at loss in plain
[194.9s] sight. Why disciplehip
[197.8s] is the only defense. We looked at how we
[201.3s] are losing membership. Christians across
[204.8s] the world including our own church and
[207.8s] on campus is becoming threatening. The
[211.6s] very existential life of the church is
[214.6s] at a threat. In the words of the leader
[217.8s] of the archives at the general
[219.4s] conference, our church is an endangered
[222.6s] species. So what is the solution?
[225.6s] Disciplehip.
[227.1s] But for this evening we want to look at
[229.4s] a different framework of disciplehip.
[232.9s] That is the cost of disciplehip.
[236.8s] The reason
[240.4s] [Music]
[242.6s] we are where we are globally
[246.6s] it's because majority of us are fans of
[251.7s] Jesus and not followers.
[256.5s] And the underpinninging is we don't
[260.2s] understand the cost of disciplehip.
[263.9s] Let's bow our heads one more time.
[265.8s] Father in heaven,
[268.0s] as we unveil
[270.0s] this area of your word, we pray tonight
[273.8s] for understanding.
[276.6s] Speak through me.
[279.3s] Speak to me. And then all of us then
[283.3s] will be blessed. Let them not hear my
[285.7s] sinful voice. May they hear the voice of
[288.2s] Jesus. Not I, but Christ. Be honored.
[292.6s] Love and exalted. Not I, but Christ. Be
[297.3s] seen. Be known and be heard. Not I, but
[302.9s] Christ in every look and action. Not I,
[307.5s] but Christ in every thought and word. In
[311.4s] Jesus name. Somebody should say an amen.
[314.9s] Amen. From fans to followers. I have two
[319.4s] objectives or goals for this evening.
[323.1s] Goal number one is to awaken hearts to
[325.9s] the difference between being admirers of
[329.2s] Christ and authentic followers.
[333.3s] Calling hearers, myself inclusive, to
[336.6s] surrender everything and truly walk in
[340.7s] his step. So are you an admirer of Jesus
[344.9s] or are you an authentic follower? My
[348.1s] second goal for tonight is to challenge
[350.9s] the church by that not the structure
[353.8s] members myself inclusive to move beyond
[357.8s] shallow Christianity to embrace daily
[361.1s] cost daily sacrifice and daily mission
[365.0s] of real disciplehip from fans to
[369.0s] followers. I want to make a major
[372.7s] statement.
[375.4s] Jesus never called anyone to be his fan
[381.0s] or an admirer.
[383.8s] Be it in close range or from distance.
[386.8s] He calls us to be followers who walk his
[390.8s] costly, narrow and sacrificial path. No
[394.9s] shortcuts, no half-hearted loyalty. It's
[398.6s] either you give your all or you give
[401.2s] nothing else.
[403.4s] So this is the basis of this evening.
[405.8s] Now yesterday we close with me reminding
[410.0s] you that in the New Testament Christians
[413.6s] are mentioned three times.
[417.2s] In the new testament disciple mates
[422.3s] it's mentioned
[424.2s] 261
[425.8s] times
[427.5s] and the word believer
[430.4s] depending on the translation you are
[433.0s] using about 2 to 10 times in accent. The
[438.2s] New Testament framework is not for us to
[441.5s] be Christians, not just for us to be
[446.6s] fans or believers, but we must become
[451.8s] disciples.
[453.5s] A disciple
[456.5s] must of course be a believer.
[460.7s] But when you study Jesus's model of
[463.1s] disciplehip,
[465.1s] it's more radical than we ever could
[468.1s] imagine. Very disturbing,
[471.4s] very profound, and very demanding
[475.7s] from funds to followers.
[479.1s] In essence, a disciple is a people or a
[481.8s] learner.
[483.5s] But it's deeper than just being a
[485.5s] learner. So if you see me using the word
[487.9s] today interchangeably when I mean
[490.5s] follower I'm referring to disciple just
[493.6s] definition of term and clarity when you
[495.8s] see me use the word interchangeably
[497.8s] anytime I'm referring to a follower I'm
[500.6s] referring to a disciple in ence Christ
[505.8s] disciplehip
[507.5s] framework involves deliberate choice
[511.8s] definite denial and determined obedience
[515.8s] And I'm going to break that down today.
[518.3s] What we see today and one of the reason
[520.8s] why students are not committed to
[523.5s] Christ, majority are
[527.3s] fans of Jesus
[529.4s] or disciples from the shallow
[533.7s] substandard perspective being
[536.1s] masqueraded in the 21st century without
[539.7s] the cause that it demands.
[542.6s] In every church, in every community,
[545.8s] there must be disciplehip. In the New
[548.2s] Testament, when the disciples are called
[551.3s] to be disciples in the early church,
[553.4s] they know it is called uncompromising
[557.2s] commitment. No wonder Peter said Mark
[561.2s] 10:28,
[562.8s] we have left everything to follow you.
[569.2s] Peter was not a fan. He was a follower.
[573.8s] We have left everything to follow you.
[578.9s] Now this defines the death of
[582.5s] disciplehip. Let me say it differently.
[587.4s] Whenever we baptize people,
[590.6s] we are so fixated with the numbers and
[594.5s] only God can tell the purpose for our
[597.7s] fixation with the numbers.
[601.0s] Then we don't graduate
[604.7s] the folks, children, young people, our
[608.3s] own sons and daughters. They remain
[611.1s] baptized members on the book. They never
[614.3s] become believers. They never become
[616.7s] followers in excence. They never become
[619.0s] disciples in the true sense of the word.
[621.5s] And how do you know? Many have left
[624.4s] nothing
[626.2s] and followed Christ.
[629.7s] Follow me.
[633.2s] In the book of John chapter 6 verse 6-6,
[638.2s] the Bible says there were group of
[640.8s] people who claimed to be followers, but
[643.6s] Jesus knew they were not followers. They
[645.8s] were his fans. So in John 6:66,
[650.6s] while they were moving with Jesus for a
[652.6s] while, Jesus made some disturbing
[654.7s] statement. And the Bible says from that
[657.5s] time many of his disciples they turned
[661.8s] back and no longer followed him.
[667.1s] Because of the cost of disciplehip
[671.0s] many of Jesus's disciples they changed
[674.0s] their status from being followers and
[678.0s] they became fans of Jesus.
[682.5s] I will explain.
[685.8s] When we say discipleship,
[688.6s] what do we mean in excent? We are
[691.9s] talking about individuals who love
[694.9s] Jesus. They love him without
[697.7s] reservation.
[699.7s] They are learners from him or they learn
[704.3s] from him and they are loyal to him
[708.1s] alone.
[709.9s] So disciples
[712.2s] they love him
[714.6s] they learn from him and they are loyal
[719.0s] to him alone.
[721.7s] Anything apart from this the individual
[725.2s] is not a follower. The individual is
[727.8s] what? A fan.
[731.1s] on Saturday
[733.2s] when you see the numbers and those of
[735.1s] you who may go to church on Sunday
[736.8s] watching across many people who claim to
[740.5s] be followers of Jesus or to be believers
[743.0s] and disciples of Jesus the best
[745.3s] definition we are not just followers no
[749.5s] we are not we are just the fans of Jesus
[752.6s] how we don't love him comprehensively we
[756.6s] don't learn from him unreservedly
[759.8s] and we are not loyal to him alone.
[764.1s] Let me say it differently. We love Jesus
[767.0s] but we love other things more than
[768.9s] Jesus.
[771.3s] We worship the Lord but we worship other
[774.1s] things more than the Lord.
[777.4s] We speak about Jesus but we speak about
[780.0s] other things more than the Lord. We are
[783.2s] loyal to Jesus but we are not loyal to
[785.8s] him alone. We are loyal to other things
[788.7s] more than Jesus. This is the way I put
[791.4s] it.
[793.0s] Disciplehip
[795.6s] is not what you study.
[798.6s] It's it's what you surrender.
[802.2s] It's not just knowledge you acquire.
[805.1s] It's the cross you carry.
[809.6s] Listen,
[811.4s] I am never fixated about the number of
[815.1s] church members we have across the world.
[818.8s] It's not the KPI of qualitative
[822.7s] Christianity.
[824.8s] The question is we are going to the
[827.2s] general conference searching again and
[828.7s] young people hear me right. When we say
[831.3s] praise the Lord, we have 25 million
[835.0s] church members. The question we ought to
[838.2s] ask is are they fans of Jesus or they
[842.3s] are followers of Jesus? Let's bring it
[846.0s] home. Are you a follower or you are a
[849.1s] fan?
[854.6s] If ever the campus
[857.4s] will see a hall of the spiritual
[861.0s] declivity,
[862.7s] we need to move our members from just
[865.8s] being church members to the place of
[868.8s] disciplehip. I used to give a
[870.5s] presentation titled the seven pillars to
[873.4s] change the world of campus. It's only
[876.5s] based on one critical philosophy and
[879.4s] this is church members become disciples
[882.9s] of Christ. So the question then is what
[885.9s] does it mean to be a disciple? I've used
[889.1s] some 3 L uh to describe it. But it's
[892.8s] more deeper than that. How do we become
[896.2s] how do you understand what it means to
[898.6s] be a disciple? I'm going to give some
[901.0s] point and then I'm going to focus on
[903.5s] some key points getting to the tail end.
[907.8s] Take note one, disciplehip
[911.4s] is a death sentence before it's a
[914.7s] mission field.
[917.0s] Take note.
[919.4s] In ence,
[922.0s] you cannot truly follow Jesus until
[925.4s] something in you dies.
[929.7s] Many people are alive still with Jesus.
[934.1s] We can't be with Christ and then we are
[938.4s] still living for self. So disciplehip
[943.0s] means I am willing to die for Jesus
[947.4s] before I go to a mission field.
[951.8s] I will explain how do I know Jesus says
[955.0s] Luke 9:23 if anyone desires to come
[959.2s] after me let him deny himself take up
[961.5s] his cross and follow me. I'll be
[963.1s] breaking this text down in couple of
[964.8s] minutes. But my first point is
[967.0s] discipleship
[968.6s] is death sentence before it's a mission
[971.9s] field.
[974.6s] Point number two, what do I mean or does
[977.0s] the Bible mean when it says disciplehip?
[981.3s] Meaning number two, disciplehip. Watch
[984.3s] the text very carefully. Luke 6 verse
[987.6s] 40. If anyone desires to come after me,
[991.1s] let him deny himself. take up his cross
[993.0s] and follow me. Disciplehip
[995.8s] is the transfer of the teacher spirit
[1000.2s] not just his knowledge.
[1003.7s] Many individual are so obsessed with
[1007.5s] information
[1009.2s] without it leading to transformation. So
[1012.8s] disciplehip is just not knowing the
[1015.6s] Bible. It's just not understanding the
[1018.8s] spirit of prophecy. It's not just
[1021.0s] knowing the doctrines of the church.
[1023.6s] Disciplehip
[1025.1s] is the transfer of the spirit of Jesus.
[1029.7s] Not just the knowledge of Jesus.
[1033.6s] Many of us know about Christ but we are
[1037.0s] yet to know Christ.
[1040.3s] The knowledge of Christ must lead to
[1044.5s] adopting the spirit of Christ. The
[1048.0s] question this evening is if you are a
[1051.8s] fan of Jesus, you are not yet a
[1054.2s] Christian. I'm sorry. And we are going
[1057.0s] to see in in in in in in the next few
[1060.2s] minutes, many of us are not yet
[1063.7s] Christians. Why we are not yet
[1066.4s] disciples?
[1072.6s] Do you just have a knowledge of Christ
[1075.8s] and you have not yet adopted his spirit,
[1079.0s] his spirit of forgiveness, his spirit of
[1082.0s] love, his spirit of integrity, his
[1085.3s] spirit of obedience? Ladies and
[1087.7s] gentlemen, the question is Christianity
[1090.2s] is not a popularity context.
[1093.8s] Is either we are Christians
[1096.7s] or we are not.
[1099.9s] What do we mean when we talk about
[1101.9s] disciplehip?
[1104.2s] Disciplehip in ence is the divine
[1108.0s] disruption of all other loyalties.
[1112.1s] I put it this way.
[1114.7s] Jesus was not anti-f family.
[1118.1s] He was not anti-
[1120.5s] idolatry. Disciplehip demands that every
[1124.2s] allegent bow to the supremacy of Christ.
[1128.6s] If anyone comes to me and does not hate
[1131.4s] his father and mother and wife and
[1134.9s] children, he cannot be my disciples.
[1138.6s] Jesus is saying it is a divine
[1141.3s] disruption of all other loyalty. I must
[1145.3s] be first. I must be best and I must be
[1148.7s] the last. Ellen White says those who
[1151.2s] make God first, best and last, they are
[1155.6s] the happiest people in the world.
[1157.6s] Somebody should say an amen out there.
[1160.9s] Disciplehip
[1163.2s] is divine disruption
[1166.0s] of all other loyalties. In other words,
[1169.8s] loyalty must only be to Christ alone.
[1174.2s] Supreme loyalty.
[1176.8s] Following Jesus may not just cost you
[1180.1s] your schedule or schedule. It might cost
[1183.5s] you your safety net.
[1187.1s] Your father cannot come before Christ.
[1190.6s] Your mother cannot come before Christ.
[1193.6s] Your boyfriend cannot come before
[1195.9s] Christ. Your daddy cannot come before
[1199.1s] Christ. Disciplehip mean God is
[1202.7s] disrupting
[1204.4s] all other loyalty. He wants to be the
[1207.4s] first. He want to be the best and he
[1210.9s] wants to be the last. Anything
[1215.0s] aside these you are a fan not a
[1219.3s] follower.
[1223.4s] What do we mean when we say disciplehip
[1226.7s] he say go into all the world make
[1229.3s] disciples of all nations.
[1233.0s] Matthew chapter 28:e 19 disciplehip is
[1237.0s] heaven's strategy for wealth domination.
[1241.4s] The reason why Christianity has not yet
[1244.4s] dominated the world is we have a lot of
[1247.9s] believers in code, a lot of Christians
[1250.9s] in code, a lot of fans not followers.
[1256.6s] Every true disciple becomes a multiplier
[1261.2s] not a monument.
[1263.7s] Disciplehip.
[1266.1s] Disciplehip means every branch in me,
[1270.2s] Jesus says, that bears fruit, he prunes
[1274.2s] that it may bear more fruits. Every
[1278.6s] branch in me that bears fruit already
[1282.2s] bearing fruit. Jesus is not satisfied
[1285.0s] with our mediocre spirituality.
[1288.8s] He wants much more. So he says, "I will
[1291.9s] prune you and I will make you bear more
[1295.2s] fruit." In essence, disciplehip is the
[1298.6s] refining fire that burns the canal out
[1303.5s] of those who are called.
[1307.0s] Disciplehip.
[1308.9s] If you abide in me,
[1311.8s] my word and then you are my disciples
[1315.3s] indeed. That is what I use for my
[1317.4s] introduction. and you shall know the
[1319.0s] truth and the truth shall set you free.
[1322.1s] Disciplehip is the is is is is the
[1325.4s] fusion of obedience and intimacy. You
[1329.4s] are not a disciple
[1331.8s] because you are you are attending an
[1334.4s] event. You are a disciple because you
[1337.4s] obey.
[1340.8s] Disciplehip.
[1343.5s] Do not be conformed to this world, but
[1347.3s] be transformed by the renewing of the
[1351.2s] mind. In excellent, disciplehip is the
[1354.9s] journey of being unmade by the world and
[1359.9s] remade by the word.
[1364.2s] Disciplehip. Look at the text again. Do
[1367.4s] not be conformed
[1370.2s] to this world but be transformed
[1374.4s] by the renewing of the mind. In ence,
[1378.5s] disciplehip is the journey of being made
[1383.2s] or unmade by the world and remade by the
[1389.4s] word. Anybody
[1392.1s] in church and still not being unmade by
[1397.2s] the world, the world losing its grip and
[1400.5s] chains and allurement
[1403.2s] then it means the world is not remaking
[1407.0s] us. We are not disciples then at best we
[1411.7s] are followers.
[1417.4s] Let me say it one more time.
[1420.0s] differently.
[1421.8s] I want that to be projected.
[1425.5s] You don't change a campus by trending.
[1431.0s] You change it by training disciples.
[1435.8s] The reason we have not dominated the
[1439.1s] public campuses, we have a lot of fans
[1441.9s] of Jesus who are yet to become followers
[1445.6s] of Jesus. Listen, it's not trends that
[1449.4s] makes us change the campuses. It is
[1452.4s] training disciples.
[1455.1s] Without training disciple, Ellen White
[1457.4s] says, "With such an army of youth,
[1461.7s] rightly trained
[1464.4s] might furnish how soon the message of a
[1467.4s] crucified, risen, and sooncoming savior
[1470.6s] might be carried to the whole well
[1473.2s] education." And she says, "The youth are
[1475.8s] the Lord's helping hand." Messages to
[1478.3s] young people, page 196. I repeat again.
[1482.4s] Hear me. We are not losing the campuses
[1485.8s] because the campuses, the enemy is too
[1488.4s] strong. We are losing them because the
[1491.2s] armies God had there. They are
[1493.6s] undiscipled. They are untrained and they
[1496.5s] are unfocused.
[1498.3s] The reason why the universities tomorrow
[1500.7s] I'm going to deal with it the jungles of
[1502.9s] the university. It's not that Satan is
[1505.4s] powerful. It's not that atheism
[1507.9s] agnosticism or its bewitching influence
[1511.4s] or
[1512.9s] all the ism you can have. It's not as if
[1516.6s] they are powerful. The difficulty is
[1519.5s] that we have not
[1522.9s] discipled God's army, trained God army
[1526.9s] and focused them. Many young people are
[1529.4s] very disfocused. I dare say many of we
[1532.0s] the pastors, many of we the elders, many
[1534.7s] of we the parents. We are ourselves not
[1537.4s] yet followers of Christ. So our children
[1540.0s] are growing. Many of us may be here even
[1542.6s] tonight. Chances are that we are not yet
[1545.7s] followers. We are fans of Jesus. Always
[1550.0s] fans of Jesus. And I want to spare some
[1552.5s] time in the words of AW to
[1558.0s] the greatest need of the hour is not for
[1561.1s] more events but for more obedient
[1564.5s] disciples.
[1567.8s] The greatest need of the hour is not for
[1572.2s] more events. We think that activities
[1576.0s] will now become
[1579.0s] productivity. No, we can organize
[1582.8s] revivals upon revival. The trust of the
[1586.4s] matter is are we fans of Jesus or we are
[1591.0s] followers of Jesus. Our subject for this
[1593.4s] evening from fans to followers
[1596.3s] subheading the cost of disciplehip. Here
[1600.3s] is the beef.
[1603.0s] I'm coming to share some key points.
[1608.1s] John 14:E1 15.
[1610.9s] I'm now coming to share
[1613.4s] what is now the identifying mark between
[1616.3s] a fan and a follower. I will do the
[1619.8s] contrast. Who is a fan? Who is a
[1622.9s] follower? I've bulleted it one by one. I
[1625.9s] will take my time and I pray that God
[1628.7s] will grant us including myself
[1631.4s] understanding. Number one, fans admire
[1634.9s] Jesus.
[1636.6s] Followers obey Jesus. Jesus says, "If
[1641.1s] you love me, you keep my commandment.
[1645.0s] Immediately you are admiring Jesus." And
[1648.2s] I have in my notes here. You see many of
[1651.0s] us admire the power of Jesus, the
[1653.6s] miracle of Jesus, the sympathy, all the
[1656.7s] virtues of Jesus. We admire him. But
[1659.9s] admiring the ethos, the things that make
[1662.8s] Jesus Jesus admiring it doesn't make you
[1666.5s] a follower. At best, you are what? A fan
[1670.0s] of Jesus. How do I know I am a follower?
[1673.3s] It's obedience.
[1676.2s] It's easy. to applaud the wisdom of
[1678.9s] Jesus, the compassion of Jesus, the
[1682.0s] courage of Jesus. Many admire his
[1684.7s] sermons on the mount. Many apply the
[1688.1s] golden rule of Jesus. Many marvel at his
[1691.4s] miracles. All these doesn't make us
[1694.7s] followers. We are fans of Jesus.
[1698.8s] We cheer him from the sidelines. We are
[1702.4s] moved by his words but we are unchanged
[1706.0s] in our hearts towards him. But the
[1708.3s] followers are different. They don't
[1710.7s] merely admire Jesus. They imitate Jesus
[1715.0s] through obedience.
[1716.9s] Anytime you you think about it, are you
[1720.1s] a fan of Jesus or you are a follower of
[1722.9s] Jesus? Fans admire Jesus. It's not
[1726.3s] enough to admire him. Example, the rich
[1729.5s] young ruler. Luke 18:8-23.
[1733.0s] He admired Jesus. He came to him, he
[1736.6s] bowed. But when he gave the rule to
[1739.8s] following him, the Bible says he walked
[1742.3s] away sorrowful. That is not a follower.
[1745.8s] The rich young ruler was the a fan of
[1749.1s] Jesus. Peter in Luke 5:5-11 obeyed. He
[1755.0s] left all and followed Jesus. That is a
[1758.1s] follower.
[1760.2s] Are you a fan or you are a follower?
[1763.2s] Second identify in Mark the book of
[1765.9s] Philippians chapter 1 vers 29. You see
[1768.6s] fans
[1770.1s] want blessings. Followers embrace
[1773.5s] suffering.
[1775.2s] I will explain.
[1780.1s] For to you it has been granted on behalf
[1783.4s] of Christ not only to believe in him but
[1787.4s] also to suffer for his sake. Take note
[1793.6s] the funds want the blessing. Anytime
[1797.6s] your motivation of coming to Jesus is
[1800.6s] the blessing, is the favor, is the
[1803.7s] grace, is the abundance, is the healing,
[1807.0s] is the knowledge, is the protection, is
[1810.2s] the shield. Be he become your God. Know
[1814.4s] that you are not a follower, you are a
[1816.4s] fan.
[1820.5s] How do you know you are a follower? If
[1822.7s] you are willing to embrace the suffering
[1826.6s] of following Jesus,
[1829.4s] fans seek the benefits from following
[1832.2s] Jesus.
[1834.8s] Followers embrace both the blessings and
[1838.1s] the cross.
[1840.0s] Fans when they come to Jesus, what they
[1843.0s] ask is can I get the healing? Can I get
[1845.3s] the success? Can I get the peace of
[1847.0s] mind? But followers know the true
[1850.1s] disciplehip it includes I'm ready to
[1853.2s] suffer for his name's sake. The question
[1856.0s] this evening is on campus. Many young
[1859.4s] people are fans of Jesus. They are not
[1862.3s] yet followers. Let me whisper it nicely.
[1867.4s] the parents,
[1869.4s] elders, pastors, church leaders,
[1873.4s] preachers like Tikman,
[1875.7s] we have become fans of Jesus but not
[1879.2s] followers of Jesus. Do you know why?
[1882.8s] This why the church is weak. This why
[1885.6s] the world has not yet taken cognizance
[1889.0s] of who we are. Not by virtue of mere
[1891.7s] miracles, by virtue of how we live, what
[1895.0s] we do, and how we carry ourselves. We
[1898.3s] are not followers yet. We are fans of
[1901.5s] Jesus. What makes me a fan or a
[1904.6s] follower? Point number three, fans serve
[1908.3s] when it's easy. Followers serve at any
[1911.7s] costs. 2 Timothy 4:2, preach the word.
[1917.6s] be ready in season and out of season.
[1922.6s] That is a follower with all
[1924.9s] longsuffering
[1926.4s] and teaching.
[1929.4s] So let me say this way.
[1932.1s] Fans serve when convenient is or it is
[1936.9s] convenient but followers serve no matter
[1939.8s] the costs.
[1941.5s] Immediately serving Jesus. It must be
[1945.3s] when it is convenient for you. You know
[1948.1s] that you are not a fan. Can you serve
[1951.0s] the Lord faithfully even when you are
[1953.8s] endangered? Some of us cannot even keep
[1956.7s] a basic Sabbath just because of a
[1959.4s] chemistry result. Just be can you
[1962.0s] imagine any time serving Christ we
[1965.7s] sacrifice him for convenience. We we we
[1968.7s] serve him when it is it is possible for
[1971.8s] me. Not when I am disturbed or worried.
[1974.7s] We should know that we are not
[1977.0s] followers.
[1978.7s] We are fans of Jesus. It reminds me of
[1983.0s] second Timothy 4:10.
[1986.2s] This man by name Dee, Paul says he left
[1990.8s] me for worldly ease. redeem us. He was a
[1995.8s] fan of the gospel. But when you look at
[1999.6s] act seven, Steven served even to death.
[2004.8s] That is a follower.
[2007.7s] If you ask what makes I'm talking about
[2009.8s] from fun to followers, the cost of
[2013.4s] disciplehip
[2015.5s] cost number four or mark number four.
[2019.2s] Fans cheer at a distance but followers
[2023.9s] they walk closely in his step. I will
[2027.0s] explain. Look at the basis of my
[2030.1s] argument.
[2031.6s] For to this you were called. I'm talking
[2034.9s] about 1 Peter 2:21. For to this you were
[2038.1s] called because Christ also suffered for
[2041.5s] us living as an example that you should
[2044.9s] follow his footstep. Many who are fans,
[2048.5s] they cheer Jesus from the sideline, from
[2051.0s] a distance. They love him from a
[2053.2s] distance. They shout his name from a
[2055.2s] distance. But those who are followers,
[2057.5s] they follow step by step. In other
[2060.3s] words, they are ready. Fans have faith
[2064.1s] when it is it is a private faith.
[2066.7s] Followers, they walk boldly even in
[2069.8s] public in Jesus's step. Fans
[2073.8s] can be very loud and noisy. But
[2076.6s] followers, they are not speakers. They
[2079.8s] are the doers.
[2082.8s] Immediately your Christianity is more of
[2086.2s] what you say much more than what you do.
[2090.0s] You are not a follower. You are a fan.
[2095.0s] Fans are silent sometimes when it is
[2098.4s] unpopular or inconvenient. They fear
[2101.6s] being labeled or rejected. But
[2104.5s] followers, however difficult the
[2106.7s] embarrassment and the shame, they are
[2109.1s] ready to identify with Jesus. A typical
[2111.9s] example in John chapter 3 verse 1 to
[2114.6s] verse two, Nicodemus at that phase of
[2117.2s] the chapter. He was not a follower yet.
[2119.4s] He was a fan of Jesus. When did he come
[2121.7s] to Jesus? At night.
[2124.7s] But John the beloved in John 19:26
[2128.1s] at the cross. When others fled, John was
[2131.7s] there with the mother of Jesus. He was
[2134.4s] willing to go with him step by step.
[2138.2s] Many of us are not followers. We are
[2140.6s] fans of Jesus.
[2146.6s] How do we know we are fans or followers?
[2150.6s] The fans ask, "What is in it for me?"
[2154.6s] Followers of Jesus will say, "What does
[2157.0s] he require of me?"
[2162.6s] Micah 6:8, he has shown you, oh man,
[2167.4s] what is good and what does the Lord
[2169.9s] require of you? But to do justly, to
[2172.9s] love mercy, and to walk humbly with your
[2175.7s] God. When you are a fan, you ask, "What
[2178.1s] is it when I follow Jesus?" But if you
[2180.5s] are a follower, you ask, "What does he
[2182.6s] want from me?"
[2188.4s] In case in point in Mark chapter 10:35
[2191.1s] to 37 James and John they sought
[2194.6s] position they were no followers at that
[2197.4s] stage they were fans of Jesus so they
[2200.2s] were asking what is it in it for me even
[2202.8s] their mother came but Isaiah in Isaiah
[2206.2s] 6:8 he said here I am send me what do
[2210.5s] you want me to do for you Lord I will do
[2213.3s] it. There is a a a contrast between a
[2217.8s] fun and a follower. Fans seek potential
[2221.6s] gain.
[2223.2s] Followers seek God's will.
[2226.6s] Fans seek popularity,
[2229.9s] but followers seek God's way. Fans comes
[2233.5s] to Jesus with wish lists. Followers come
[2237.7s] with him with open hands. Fans want
[2241.6s] their dreams fulfilled. Followers want
[2244.9s] God's will and God's purpose fulfilled.
[2249.2s] Followers surrender their plans trusting
[2252.0s] in God's will even when it's hard. But
[2255.8s] fans at all cost it must be their will
[2259.4s] or they lose interest in seeking his
[2263.3s] face.
[2266.2s] Jesus prayed, "Not my will but your will
[2271.5s] be done." Let me ask you, if for the
[2273.9s] next 50 years all the prayers you pray,
[2277.8s] God's answer to you will be no, will you
[2280.0s] still pray? If no, you are a fan, not a
[2283.6s] follower.
[2285.1s] Let me say it differently.
[2288.7s] If the next 50 years
[2291.6s] or just say the next one year, every
[2294.3s] prayer you pray, God will not answer.
[2297.4s] Will you still communicate with him? If
[2300.3s] no, you are a fan. In other words, fans,
[2304.1s] they use the Lord. Followers are used by
[2307.5s] the Lord. Let me say it one more time.
[2310.5s] Fans use Jesus. They come to him, I need
[2314.2s] healing. I need peace. My daughter
[2316.2s] should go to MIT. They should go to Ivy
[2318.6s] League school. I need a boyfriend. I
[2320.5s] need a husband. I need a baby. I need a
[2322.6s] this. I need a that. They use Jesus like
[2325.0s] an ATM card. And sometimes we use him
[2327.8s] like a prostitute. When we are done, we
[2329.8s] dock him. We are fans.
[2333.8s] How do I know I'm a fan or I'm a
[2337.0s] follower? Fans choose comfort.
[2340.7s] Followers choose the cross.
[2344.0s] Luke 9:23. Then he said to them all, "If
[2347.2s] anyone desires to come after me, let him
[2350.6s] deny himself and take up his cross daily
[2354.3s] and follow me." Fans they choose
[2357.0s] comfort. Followers they choose the
[2359.5s] cross. In other words, fans avoid
[2362.9s] hardship. Followers embrace sacrifice.
[2367.4s] Fans look for the easy road, the path of
[2370.3s] least resistance. When things get hard,
[2373.6s] they retreat. But followers, however
[2377.1s] difficult the hardship may be, they are
[2380.3s] willing because they are loyal to him
[2383.4s] and him alone.
[2387.1s] An example,
[2389.6s] they will be followers of Jesus in the
[2392.4s] book of Luke chapter 9. Say, "Master, I
[2395.1s] will follow you wherever you go." And
[2396.8s] Jesus said, "Foxes up hold." And the
[2398.6s] rest of it, he gave up on Christ. Let me
[2401.0s] go and bury my mother. Let me go and do
[2403.0s] this. No. Many of us, we choose comfort.
[2407.0s] But those who are followers, they choose
[2409.6s] the cross.
[2412.5s] If I were to have time, we'll have sung
[2414.4s] the song
[2416.6s] all to Jesus.
[2418.6s] I surrender. Listen,
[2424.5s] it's a scam.
[2427.0s] Sometimes I wish we just close the
[2428.3s] church. Everybody should go home. What
[2430.2s] do we come doing at all? What do we come
[2433.0s] to do? It's like who is who has
[2436.0s] bewitched us to pretend if we will
[2438.9s] worship God, let's do him full time, if
[2441.8s] we will not worship him, nobody is
[2443.8s] forcing us. In the universities, many
[2446.3s] young people have not yet committed to
[2448.5s] the Lord fully. They are fans of Jesus.
[2451.8s] It's so popular to say I'm a Christian.
[2454.9s] It's so fancy to say I'm a Christian.
[2457.6s] Many of us are going along just to get
[2459.9s] along. But the followers of Jesus, they
[2463.3s] will choose the cross.
[2465.8s] How do we know we are fans or we are
[2468.9s] followers?
[2470.4s] Fans love his miracles, but followers
[2473.2s] love his message.
[2476.9s] John 6:26, I say to you, you seek me not
[2483.7s] not because you saw the signs, but
[2486.4s] because you ate of the loaves and were
[2490.3s] filled.
[2494.2s] Fans love the miracle five loaves to
[2499.1s] 5,000.
[2501.0s] But those who are followers, they love
[2505.0s] his message.
[2506.6s] A case in point the crowd after feeding
[2509.5s] John chapter 6 verse 26 Jesus said it
[2512.3s] and then Mary at Bethany in the book of
[2515.0s] Luke 10:39 she sat at the feet of Jesus
[2518.6s] and she will never be moved. She was so
[2520.8s] passionate about the message not just
[2523.2s] about the loaves not just about the
[2525.1s] miracles.
[2526.8s] Fans chase signs
[2529.8s] followers hunger for truth. Fans want
[2533.8s] excitement.
[2535.3s] They look for miracles, wonders, and
[2537.7s] emotional highs. When the signs fade, so
[2541.8s] does their interest. But for the
[2543.5s] followers is the message. They crave
[2546.3s] after God. They desire his word, his
[2549.8s] wisdom, his presence, his instruction,
[2552.5s] his direction.
[2554.3s] As the dear pant for so much soul hunger
[2559.4s] after thee. Listen, who is forcing us to
[2563.3s] be Christians?
[2565.8s] Are you a fan
[2568.2s] or you are a follower? How do we know we
[2571.5s] are fans or followers? Fans follow the
[2575.6s] crowd.
[2577.2s] The followers, they follow the Christ.
[2582.2s] Matthew 7:13 to 14. Enter by the narrow
[2586.1s] gates. For wide is the gate and broad is
[2590.4s] the way that leads to destruction and
[2594.1s] there are many who go in by it. Because
[2597.1s] narrow is the gate and difficult is the
[2599.9s] way which leads to life and there are
[2602.7s] few who find it. Many of us we follow
[2606.7s] the crowd
[2610.6s] but the followers they follow the Christ
[2615.9s] reminds me of our song I'll follow thee
[2618.4s] my savior
[2620.1s] where so red my lot may be
[2623.3s] where thou goes I will follow yes my
[2626.5s] lord I will follow thee fans go with the
[2630.2s] majority followers stand with Christ
[2633.7s] even if you in Christianom today. The
[2637.2s] reason why many people are on on the
[2640.0s] Broadway is because many who claim to be
[2644.2s] Christians are fans. They follow where
[2648.1s] the crowd is. So they go with the
[2651.1s] majority. But followers, they follow the
[2653.9s] Christ. Fans love the crowd's approval.
[2657.3s] They follow Christ as long as others do.
[2660.6s] But when the path becomes difficult,
[2663.2s] they turn back. followers are willing to
[2665.9s] go alone. They are willing to go
[2669.3s] regardless of the number. That is the
[2671.7s] distinction. It reminds me during the
[2673.7s] Palm Sunday, the crowd who were the
[2676.7s] fans, they praise him today, tomorrow
[2679.8s] they crucified him. But the 11 apostles
[2683.3s] in act 1:14, they followed after the
[2686.6s] crowd left. Are you a fan or you are a
[2691.4s] follower? Our subject for this night,
[2693.4s] from fans to followers. It's my
[2696.9s] contention that by the grace of God, God
[2700.6s] will move us from being mere fans, mere
[2704.8s] admirers of Jesus to adant followers of
[2708.6s] Christ. How do I know I am a fan? Fans
[2712.8s] prefer convenience.
[2715.1s] Followers endure the cost.
[2719.0s] It reminds me Matthew 8:19 to20. Then a
[2722.9s] certain scribe came and said to him,
[2725.0s] "Teacher, I will follow you wherever you
[2728.4s] go." And Jesus said, "Foxes have holes
[2731.8s] and birds of the air have nest, but the
[2734.4s] son of man has nothing to lay his hand.
[2737.7s] He returned."
[2740.8s] Many of us are enthusiastic fans. But
[2744.6s] like Paul, he said, "I endured all for
[2748.6s] the sake of Christ."
[2751.8s] Funs
[2753.5s] they hide faith when tested, but
[2756.7s] followers confess Christ boldly. Fans,
[2761.0s] they want inspiration. Followers want
[2764.6s] transformation.
[2766.8s] Many of us are excited about the the
[2770.3s] inspiration of the gospel, not its
[2774.0s] transformation. And the Bible says in
[2776.1s] Romans 12, "And do not be conformed to
[2778.6s] this world, but be transformed by the
[2781.3s] renewing of your mind." Fans like to
[2785.0s] hear good words, followers, let God
[2789.3s] change them.
[2791.5s] fans enjoy uplifting sermons, powerful
[2795.7s] music, inspiring talks, as long as it
[2799.6s] doesn't change their comfort zone. They
[2802.2s] seek affirmation without transformation.
[2805.3s] But followers, they welcome the
[2807.7s] convicting voice of the Holy Spirit.
[2810.2s] They don't just want to feel good. They
[2813.1s] want to change. So they will say,
[2815.5s] "Change me, Lord. Change my heart.
[2818.8s] Change my spirit." But friends they are
[2822.2s] excited about the powerful Sabbath
[2824.8s] sermon the powerful ministration the
[2827.4s] powerful present the powerful life
[2830.0s] everything was powerful but the only
[2832.1s] thing that will not change their heart
[2834.7s] will be the same camp meeting from camp
[2836.7s] meeting campus crusade to cample crusade
[2839.2s] 10 days to 10 days week of prayer to
[2841.4s] week of prayer nothing change listen you
[2844.3s] are a fan you are not a follower
[2848.3s] like Herod in Mark 6:20. He liked to
[2852.3s] hear John the Baptist, but Herod never
[2855.0s] changed. He rather went and take his
[2857.0s] brother's wife and married the brother's
[2859.4s] wife. And when John the Baptist was
[2861.3s] preaching, the Bible says in Mark 6:20,
[2864.5s] Herod love John the Baptist inspiration,
[2867.6s] but he will never be changed.
[2871.0s] Bzakios.
[2873.9s] He was a follower.
[2876.7s] When he heard about this Messiah, a
[2880.1s] short man climbed the sycamore tree and
[2883.2s] he says, "Rabbi,
[2885.6s] time with me." And when he got to his
[2888.2s] house, he did restitution. All the
[2890.1s] people I seal, I will return to them a
[2892.2s] four-fold.
[2893.8s] He was not just a person interested in
[2896.2s] inspiration.
[2897.7s] Zaki needs
[2900.4s] transformation. The SDA church you in
[2903.7s] Kenya you do a lot of programs. So a lot
[2907.0s] of program I follow you pastor a lot of
[2910.2s] program across. I admire your tenacity.
[2913.0s] Are you just being inspired as for West
[2915.4s] Africa? We already dead you know. Is it
[2919.0s] just inspiration
[2920.9s] or you want transformation?
[2926.2s] Funds
[2928.2s] they seek favor with people but
[2931.7s] followers they seek favor with God.
[2937.0s] For do I now persuade men
[2941.2s] or God? Or do I seek to please men?
[2946.6s] For if I still preach or if I still
[2949.8s] please men, I would not be a born
[2953.3s] servant of Christ including pastors,
[2957.9s] preachers. If what I am doing here is
[2961.1s] for human applause, God knows. He sees
[2964.9s] the heart. If my diligence in study is
[2968.6s] to show something that is much more than
[2972.2s] God's will and way for this hour, I am a
[2975.8s] fan. I'm seeking the favor, the applause
[2978.8s] of men. You can be anointed and you can
[2982.2s] have powerful words and you can have
[2984.6s] revelation, but if it is to seek the
[2988.4s] favor of men, you will never please
[2991.3s] Christ. You are not a follower. You are
[2995.4s] a fan.
[2997.0s] Pilate sought to please the crowd. Mark
[2999.9s] 15 verse1 15. But Daniel sought to
[3003.8s] please God.
[3007.1s] Which are we? A fan or a follower?
[3013.7s] It reminds me look fans come for the
[3017.4s] benefits.
[3018.9s] Followers stay for the burden.
[3022.9s] John 6 from verse 66 to 68.
[3027.0s] From that time many of his disciples
[3030.1s] went back and walked with him no more.
[3033.6s] They came for the benefit. Anytime your
[3037.3s] motivation of following Christ is for
[3039.9s] the benefit, you go to hell. You are a
[3042.7s] fan.
[3044.4s] It's simple. Let me say it one more
[3046.3s] time. Anytime
[3048.4s] the motivation of coming to Christ is
[3051.8s] for the benefit, you are candidate for
[3054.4s] hell. You are not a follower. You are a
[3057.0s] fan. But when you are ready to stay,
[3060.5s] even when there are burdens, you carry
[3063.0s] the burdens with the Lord. Like Simon,
[3067.8s] the black man who carried the cross with
[3070.6s] Christ, you are willing to suffer. It
[3073.4s] says for as many as surface with him
[3076.0s] shall also glory with him. Many of us
[3079.4s] will come for the benefit. Our children
[3081.5s] know God is powerful, God is good, God
[3083.9s] is gracious, God is strong, God is that.
[3086.4s] They don't know the cost of following
[3088.4s] God. So when they grow a little and they
[3091.3s] notice that no, it is not what mommy and
[3093.9s] daddy said. Listen, tell them from a
[3096.2s] younger age, it's tough to be a
[3099.5s] Christian. It's tough to be a follower.
[3102.4s] Let them know the difference between
[3103.8s] being a fan and being a follower like
[3107.4s] many of the disciples or like Peter. I
[3110.6s] don't want to be a fan of Jesus, an
[3113.3s] admirer of Jesus. I admire his power,
[3116.1s] his humility, his grace, his efficacy,
[3118.9s] his authority. No, I don't want that. I
[3121.7s] want to be a follower. Ladies and
[3124.6s] gentlemen, fans,
[3127.5s] they praise when it's used to them.
[3131.1s] Followers praise no matter what. Fans
[3135.7s] they use Jesus to build their life.
[3139.1s] Followers let Jesus become their life.
[3143.4s] Let me say it one more time. When you
[3145.4s] are a fan you will use Jesus to build
[3148.4s] your life. Some of us we have used
[3150.6s] Jesus. People are eating because of
[3152.5s] Jesus.
[3154.2s] They are eating daily bread because of
[3156.1s] Jesus. So the reason why they pray that
[3158.7s] is why they get daily bread. The reason
[3160.8s] why they worship that is how they
[3162.6s] survive. Because the Bible say in him we
[3164.9s] live. In him we move. In him we have our
[3168.2s] being. So because we want to live, we
[3170.8s] want to move. We want to have our being.
[3173.4s] What must we do? We will follow Jesus.
[3175.8s] We use him to build our life. But a
[3180.2s] follower will let Jesus become their
[3184.3s] alive. Galatians 2 verse 20. I have been
[3187.4s] crucified with Christ. It is no longer I
[3191.4s] who live but Christ lives in me. The
[3194.7s] life which I now live in the flesh. I
[3197.8s] live by the faith in the son of God.
[3200.3s] Hear me. Fans want Jesus for personal
[3203.4s] gain. Followers surrender all to him.
[3207.1s] Fans come to Jesus hoping to get
[3210.2s] something like health, like wealth, like
[3213.0s] success. Their focus is what can Jesus
[3216.4s] do for me? followers come to Jesus with
[3220.2s] empty hands surrendered heart and they
[3222.6s] say Lord do to me according to your gra
[3227.0s] like the way Mary a 17year-old virgin
[3229.5s] said let it be to your maid servant
[3232.3s] according to your will that is a
[3234.9s] follower hear me fans they quit when
[3239.4s] it's hard followers they cling when it's
[3243.8s] hardest
[3245.4s] but Simon Peter answered Lord
[3247.9s] To whom shall we go? You have the words
[3251.4s] of eternal life. You see, fans give up
[3257.4s] following Christ. Followers cling
[3260.4s] tighter when the going gets tough. Fans
[3263.8s] lose heart when trials come. Their faith
[3267.5s] has always been shallow, but followers
[3270.8s] are willing to go. Paul said, "We are
[3273.7s] hardpressed on every side yet not crush,
[3277.6s] struck down but not destroy." Two
[3280.4s] Corinthians 4:8 and verse 9. Are you a
[3283.4s] fan or you are a follower?
[3287.5s] From fans to followers. Fans
[3292.2s] they settle for emotional moments.
[3294.8s] Followers hunger for spiritual growth.
[3298.7s] But solid food belong to those who are
[3300.6s] all of age. That is those who by reason
[3303.9s] offers have their senses exercised to
[3307.2s] discern both good and evil. Hebrews
[3309.3s] 5:14.
[3311.0s] In essence, fans want feeling, followers
[3315.0s] want maturity and death. Enough of the
[3318.6s] emotionalism in Christian dom. We don't
[3321.7s] pray when we feel life. We pray because
[3324.1s] we will we we we we watch by faith that
[3327.5s] Christ understands he hears. We don't do
[3330.5s] it when we feel like. We need to
[3332.9s] transition from emotionalism
[3335.4s] from being an ardent believer. I hunger
[3339.2s] for spiritual growth. I read the Bible
[3341.3s] not when I feel like. I pray not like
[3343.4s] when I feel like. This fairweather
[3345.5s] Christianity is not followership. It's
[3348.2s] not disciplehip. At best you are an
[3350.7s] admirer of Christianity. The Christian
[3353.2s] ethos, the Christian principle, the
[3355.1s] Christian philosophy, funds, they
[3357.9s] measure by size and success. Followers,
[3361.8s] they measure by sacrifice and
[3364.1s] faithfulness.
[3366.1s] Moreover, it is required that one be
[3369.8s] found faithful. It reminds me of those
[3372.9s] who were the builders in the tower of
[3374.4s] Babel.
[3376.0s] Genesis chapter 11. They wanted faith.
[3380.7s] In Genesis chapter 6:22, Noah he
[3383.7s] preached to an unresponsive world. Two
[3387.0s] groups, one they are ceased by success.
[3391.3s] Another one they are measure by
[3393.6s] sacrifice and faithfulness. God did not
[3396.5s] call us to be successful. He called us
[3399.5s] to be what? Faithful
[3402.6s] friends.
[3405.0s] They follow from afar.
[3407.4s] Followers follow face to face. Fans they
[3412.6s] call him Lord in word. Followers they
[3417.0s] call him Lord indeed. My sheep hear my
[3421.5s] voice and I know them and they follow
[3425.3s] me. In excent all I have said this
[3428.7s] evening in summary.
[3432.4s] There are two groups
[3434.5s] in the church. Among the pastors, among
[3437.9s] the church administrators,
[3440.6s] the reason why among the church members,
[3442.6s] the choir leaders, the how do we call
[3445.4s] them, the church board,
[3447.5s] the reason why Jesus says, and many will
[3449.4s] say to me on that day, Lord, Lord, did
[3452.6s] we not prophesy in your name and in your
[3455.5s] name done wonders, undeniable miracles?
[3459.0s] And I would tell them plainly, "Depart
[3461.0s] from me, you workers of iniquity." The
[3463.8s] reason is they were not followers. They
[3466.7s] were fans. When you're a fan, God can
[3468.7s] use you.
[3470.7s] He even used Cyrus.
[3473.4s] You He even used Babylon to fulfill his
[3477.1s] agenda. Even he used a donkey. If he can
[3480.6s] use a donkey, he can use a godless human
[3483.7s] being who is a fan. Being used by God is
[3487.4s] not a testament of your redemption. Get
[3490.4s] it clear.
[3493.8s] Many will say to me under the Lord, "Did
[3495.8s] we not prophesy in your name and in your
[3498.4s] name cast out demons?"
[3501.5s] Samson was being used by God to break
[3505.2s] the bows of the Philistines major city
[3509.1s] walls. But guess what? He was on the
[3511.8s] path to destruction.
[3513.9s] It's not enough to be used by God. Being
[3516.5s] used by God is not a sign of my
[3518.8s] redemption.
[3521.5s] You can be a fan and God will make use
[3524.4s] of you. But you are not converted.
[3529.4s] In summary,
[3531.8s] I don't want to admire Jesus. I want to
[3534.1s] obey Jesus.
[3536.0s] I don't want the blessings of Jesus. I
[3539.0s] want to embrace the sufferings of Jesus.
[3541.7s] I don't want to serve when it's easy. I
[3544.3s] want to serve at any cost. I don't want
[3548.7s] to cheer at a distance. I want to walk
[3551.1s] closely in his footstep.
[3553.8s] I don't want what is in it for me. I
[3558.0s] want to ask him what does he require of
[3560.5s] me? I don't want to choose comfort. I
[3564.0s] want to choose the cross. I as a person
[3567.8s] I want to love him based on his message
[3571.4s] not just because of his miracles. I want
[3573.8s] to follow the Christ
[3576.9s] not the crowd. I as a person as I'm
[3580.9s] growing in Christ and I want to be a
[3583.0s] disciple I hear me
[3588.7s] I don't prefer convenience. I want to
[3591.2s] endure any cost for Christ.
[3594.7s] I as a person I have committed that look
[3597.6s] I will not hide my faith when it is
[3599.8s] tested I'll confess Christ boldly
[3603.5s] in the rest for the rest of my life I
[3605.2s] have made a covenant with God that by
[3607.4s] his grace I want transformation
[3611.7s] not mere inspiration
[3614.2s] I want to seek favor from God not favor
[3617.7s] from men for the rest of my life I pray
[3621.0s] God help me I want to come to him and
[3624.6s] take the burdens with him. I don't want
[3627.1s] to come just for his benefits.
[3629.9s] I don't want to praise when it suits me.
[3632.6s] I want to praise no matter the costs. I
[3635.9s] want for the rest of my life
[3639.2s] to let Jesus order my steps. I don't
[3642.7s] want to use Jesus to build my life.
[3646.2s] I don't want to use Jesus to become
[3648.2s] popular.
[3649.7s] I want to submit to Jesus without any
[3652.6s] reservation. If you are here this
[3654.7s] evening,
[3656.6s] you don't want to be a fan, but you feel
[3660.1s] in light of this brief Bible study, you
[3663.5s] are a fan and you are not a follower. Be
[3667.4s] honest with yourself. Raise your hand.
[3672.8s] God be my witness. I am not a follower.
[3677.0s] I'm just an admirer of Jesus.
[3680.1s] Hands up. All those of you watching
[3682.2s] online, if you are not a follower and
[3685.6s] the Holy Spirit has convicted you that
[3687.8s] you are a fan, just miserable fan,
[3692.6s] I cheer Jesus. Please hands down. I want
[3695.0s] us to sing two songs and call tonight a
[3698.2s] night and I'm going to ask our head
[3700.6s] pastor to pray with us when we sing the
[3703.8s] last. I want us to sing and I want the
[3706.2s] musicians coming and you sing good song
[3708.6s] as you did earlier. I will follow thee
[3712.0s] my savior.
[3713.8s] What? Where so rare my lot may be. Where
[3717.7s] thou goest, I will follow. Those of you
[3720.6s] watching online, I want you to join as
[3723.8s] we get to sing the last song. Anybody in
[3726.8s] this auditorium online who feel I want
[3730.5s] God to convert me from being a fan of
[3733.4s] Jesus to be a follower of Jesus, I want
[3736.0s] you to walk and kneel right down here so
[3738.2s] that we pray. Just sing it. Sit. Just
[3741.1s] sit down and sing it. As we sing it,
[3745.2s] watch the lyrics.
[3747.5s] Listen, nobody is forcing us. If you
[3750.6s] want to do the world, let's do the well.
[3753.4s] But if you want to do Christ, we need to
[3755.6s] do him full time. I will follow thee, my
[3759.4s] savior.
[3762.5s] Yes, my lord. Song number 623.
[3766.9s] Estimol.
[3768.5s] I'll follow thee.
[3774.6s] I will follow
[3777.0s] thee, my savior,
[3779.9s] wheresoever
[3782.2s] my lord may be.
[3785.6s] Where thou goest
[3788.3s] I will follow.
[3791.0s] Yes my lord I'll follow thee.
[3796.6s] I will follow
[3799.5s] myior.
[3801.1s] Lift up your voice.
[3804.6s] Only followers can say this. And though
[3808.3s] all men should forsake thee by the
[3812.5s] grace, by the grace
[3815.2s] I'll follow thee.
[3819.3s] Though the road be trackless as the fing
[3827.0s] the falling sea. Thou has trod this way
[3831.4s] before me.
[3834.1s] And I'll gladly gladly follow thee
[3838.2s] follow thee. I will follow thee my
[3840.8s] savior
[3843.4s] thee myavior.
[3845.6s] Thou did share thy blood for me for me
[3850.9s] and to all the men and women should not
[3855.6s] by my strength by your grace
[3859.2s] and follow
[3863.0s] though I may with tribulation
[3867.0s] I am so tempted
[3869.0s] [Music]
[3870.5s] to go I remember thou was also tempted
[3875.6s] And I want to rejoice to follow thee.
[3879.1s] and rejoice
[3881.2s] to follow thee. I will follow thee for
[3887.0s] thee my savior
[3889.0s] [Music]
[3892.9s] for me and no more
[3897.2s] man should forsake me by thy grace.
[3902.4s] Let me stand
[3904.7s] [Music]
[3909.1s] there action
[3912.3s] who forsake
[3914.4s] and know I be.
[3917.4s] Thou was testitude
[3920.6s] afflicted
[3922.6s] and I only
[3925.3s] follow thee.
[3928.1s] I will fall on my savior. I don't want
[3933.1s] to be a fan. I want to be a follower
[3938.6s] and all
[3941.2s] who
[3942.7s] by thy grace by thy grace
[3946.1s] I'll follow you. Whilst we sing the last
[3948.6s] stanza
[3950.8s] to Jordan
[3953.0s] rolling before
[3955.8s] cold and deeply
[3958.8s] as me.
[3960.9s] Thou has
[3963.0s] always before me
[3966.2s] and I still will follow thee.
[3971.4s] I will follow
[3973.8s] thee my savior.
[3976.6s] God is sure
[3978.8s] my God for me. I don't want to be a fan.
[3983.0s] I want to be a follower
[3988.9s] three times. You sing it very quietly.
[3991.5s] If you are in this auditorium and you
[3993.8s] feel you are not a follower and you are
[3997.2s] a fan, they're going to sing the refrain
[3998.8s] three times. I want you to come here and
[4000.7s] kneel down and we pray together. I am
[4003.0s] not a follower, I am a fan. Just walk
[4005.4s] down and come here. We call our head
[4007.4s] pastor to come and pray with us. Just
[4010.0s] walk down here. I want to be a follower.
[4013.4s] Currently I am a fan. Just come.
[4017.0s] Let's sing the refrain. Don't come
[4019.2s] because others are coming. That makes
[4021.0s] you a follower.
[4023.8s] You kneel down right here.
[4026.9s] and all that shall forsake thee.
[4032.2s] By thy grace I shall follow thee.
[4037.8s] I will follow
[4040.4s] thee my savior.
[4043.2s] Love that is shed. Thy blood for me
[4048.7s] and the
[4050.8s] man should forsake thee. By thy grace I
[4056.7s] follow thee.
[4059.4s] I will follow
[4062.0s] thee my savior
[4064.9s] that is shed thy blood for me
[4070.1s] and no one
[4072.6s] should forsake thee. By thy grace
[4077.8s] I follow thee.
[4082.7s] All heads bowed, all eyes closed.
[4086.1s] [Music]
[4089.8s] Have mercy upon us, oh Lord.
[4094.2s] Incline your ear.
[4098.2s] And because your eyes are moving to and
[4101.0s] fro to look upon us, we pray that thou
[4104.2s] may have mercy upon us.
[4107.8s] Every word spoken tonight is a testimony
[4110.6s] that indeed
[4112.6s] I have been a fan and not a follower.
[4115.9s] I know not about those that are standing
[4118.6s] and those that are kneeling, but the
[4121.3s] testimony of your word tonight has shown
[4124.9s] we have sought for information and not
[4126.9s] transformation.
[4129.1s] Father have mercy upon us. We have come
[4132.7s] to you because of the benefits that you
[4135.0s] grant unto us. We have come to you
[4138.0s] because of the miracles and yet we have
[4139.9s] not come to you that thou may live in us
[4142.2s] our hope of glory. Have mercy on us, oh
[4145.6s] Lord. Yet tonight, our prayer is that as
[4149.7s] these words be settled upon the tables
[4152.0s] of our minds, transform us into your
[4154.6s] likeness. May these words be embedded
[4157.1s] upon our hearts to prick our d senses
[4162.2s] that father like Peter, like Paul, we
[4165.4s] may behold the crucified.
[4168.5s] And like Paul we may say the life that I
[4171.4s] live now I live not but Christ lives in
[4173.6s] me my hope of glory. Savior divine we
[4177.4s] are thankful for these words and how we
[4180.2s] pray that anyone who has heard the
[4181.9s] testimony of these words tonight be it
[4184.6s] in this sanctuary or watching us online.
[4188.3s] We pray may we never be the same again.
[4190.9s] As you visit many to pour down your Holy
[4194.7s] Spirit and prepare many for your kingdom
[4196.8s] to come. Please do not pass us by.
[4199.9s] Remember us also and seal us for the
[4201.8s] heavenly Ghana. And so tonight we are
[4204.2s] thankful for the message that has been
[4205.8s] presented to us by your servant. And our
[4208.3s] prayer is that may the Holy Spirit
[4209.9s] settle these words upon our hearts to
[4211.5s] the glory of your name. Besides that,
[4214.2s] dear father, we are also reminded of the
[4216.3s] state of our nation.
[4218.8s] Father, we are praying that you may
[4221.6s] visit us. The enemy seeks to settle his
[4225.6s] feet upon our nation, upon our capital
[4228.9s] and upon the hearts of very many of our
[4230.8s] young people. But we want to stand
[4233.2s] against him in the name of Jesus. You
[4236.2s] have said that when the spirit of the
[4238.0s] enemy shall pass by, you shall lift up a
[4240.6s] standard in us high that he shall have
[4242.6s] no place in us. We pray lift up the
[4245.8s] standard of these young people, the Gen
[4247.8s] Z's. lift up the standard upon our
[4250.2s] nation and every young person especially
[4252.8s] tonight and tomorrow that my father
[4255.4s] testimony may be born that you lifted up
[4257.6s] a standard high and the enemy had no
[4259.9s] footing neither in our church neither in
[4263.2s] our young people nor in our nation.
[4265.9s] Father, blood has been shed before.
[4268.2s] Lives have been lost before but not
[4270.5s] anymore. Father in heaven, we refuse
[4272.7s] these works of the enemy in Jesus name.
[4275.3s] And we pray gather the young people whom
[4277.6s] you've said if only but hundred could be
[4279.9s] brought together where there is one how
[4281.8s] soon shall your work be brought to an
[4283.9s] end. So father these 100fold that are
[4287.0s] coming tonight and others who are out
[4289.1s] there being inspired to go to the
[4290.8s] streets. We pray my lord that you may
[4292.9s] turn their hearts that they may raise
[4295.3s] the voice of the messiah who is about to
[4298.2s] come.
[4299.7s] Jesus Christ we are thankful for our
[4301.4s] leaders. We pray for them too my lord
[4303.6s] for sobriety. We pray heavenly father
[4306.1s] also for those who make decisions in
[4308.6s] this nation in many ways my father stand
[4311.3s] in the gap and how we pray heavenly
[4314.1s] father that the holy spirit may hover
[4315.8s] around us that father we may be inclined
[4318.8s] to do thine will. Thank you tonight for
[4321.1s] thou hast visited us in a powerful way
[4323.8s] as we walk to our homes as we walk to
[4325.8s] our resting places. My father we pray
[4328.4s] walk with us like you walked with those
[4330.8s] two disciples who went to a mouse. Walk
[4333.3s] with us also that we may not be blind
[4335.2s] but that we may see you and hear you
[4337.6s] whisper to our hearts. Blessed be your
[4340.6s] name now and forever. For these things
[4342.3s] we ask in Jesus name. And let God's
[4344.0s] children say amen. Go in the peace of
[4346.7s] the Lord and may the Lord bless you.
