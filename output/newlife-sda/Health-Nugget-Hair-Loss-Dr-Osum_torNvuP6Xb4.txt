they go down your hair may also uh be lost now in men we nowadays call it andropause and in women we call it menopause so if your uh spouse is going to hospital to be attended to because of menopause please as a man accompany her because you may also need to be attended to for andropause uh in men it's more often Vanishing hairline but uh in the women it's more of a receding hairline now there's also a unique one called chemotherapy induced Al opesia or hair loss that comes about because of the treatment that someone is being given especially in circumstances where you're dealing with cancer I'm sure you've seen uh individuals there was a presentation that was meant to be put up it would have shown you the difference between the normal hair loss and the one for uh cancer treatment you

use to just uh make your hair it can lead to uh hair loss in some circumstances you can find that in mental illness there are individuals who pull uh or their hair and you find they lose all their hair by just pulling uh there is also the one that is seen in newborn children or rather the neonates um a baby is born and you look at their head and you don't know whether to comment about it or just keep quiet so that you don't offend anyone it could be due to friction the way the baby is being laid to rest uh when they are sleeping it's a natural shedding face and it usually is replaced by full hair after some time it's not meant to be a concern except after one year um there are circumstances where you can have a condition in women called polycystic ovarian disease or syndrome more often than not it leads to excessive hair but there's a unique type that can actually lead you to have hair loss now which foods help in fighting hair loss there is Fe fish there's lean red meat there's avocados there almonds spinach and fruits now which foods encourage alopecia or hair loss if you eat donuts if you eat chocolate crisps cake um uh french fries you may suffer hair loss and you
