Through the hustle and bustle of the city life, it's yet another exciting moment for our children to experience an unforgettable adventure. Get ready to climb the mountain of miracles because VBS 2025 is here. Here are some of the experiences that our children have gone through. When I was younger, I didn't like any activities that involved the church. But when I was brought into the VBS, I was able to interact and even get friends. I was so shy. I wasn't even able to socialize. But through VBS, my circle grew larger and I knew how to socialize with many more people. What drives my attention the most is the singing. The singing just brings people together. It unites us. It teachs us more about God's word and it is very interesting. Crafts brings us together enabling us to better our skills in making things. After a whole three months, I usually enjoy coming down to New Life and it's really good to know God and share the joys you find at church with many friends of yours. Let's not forget about food. Of course, our favorite meal being chapati and our favorite fruit being melon. And that is why I love the BBS. From April 14th to 19th, Fifth Gong Avenue is the place to be. We invite all children aged 4 to 18 years old to join us for a week filled with faith, fun, and friendships. So, I encourage you all kids at home to come along. Don't forget to bring a friend.
