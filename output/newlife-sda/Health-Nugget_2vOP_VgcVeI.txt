FULL TRANSCRIPT:
[Music] Good morning and happy Sabbath. Good morning and happy Sabbath. My name is Betrice and uh I'd like to invite each one of you to say hi to the person on your right. Shake the hand of the person next to your right and shake the hand of the person on your left. be very intentional as you do this. I'm just wondering what might be going through your mind even as I'm asking you to shake their hands. This month has been dedicated to shaking to to shedding light on mental wellness. And I'm encouraging each one of us to just listen to this and and whatever you will gather that at the end of the day, you will have a tool to be able to help you to support the person who's next to you. Not too long ago, I received a call from somebody who was really panicking and she on the other side of the phone, she said, "Betrice, where are you?" And because I was driving, she had persistently called. who had had gone off the road to just listen to her and she said, "Could you speak to this person on the other side of the line because she wants to commit suicide and she wants to kill all her three children? If this was you, what would you have done?" I'm glad that she had a number to call and I'm glad that she was able to find me on the other side of the line. We all have received a distress call at one point or another or we are the ones through who are going through distress and instead we have resorted to negative coping mechanisms so that we are smoking, drinking or taking whichever kind of drug that is that is numbing that pain. Sometimes we go to the doctor and the doctor will look for whatever it is and they will not find and they will squeeze all the money out of you because they seem to be treating this thing that is not getting healed every time. And so we need to have an open mind without judgment and be able to direct such people to the counseling department. And hence I'm introducing the new life counseling department to you. Is there help? Is there help when I'm in disgrace? Yes, we have psychological support and counseling not just for an individual but for groups and even for family. The Bible tells us in Proverbs 11:14, "Without good direction, people lose their way. The more wise council you follow, the better your chances. So, which chance do you have? I'm just wondering what's on your screen and if you're able to see what uh was projected. Sometimes the weight on our brains or in our heart is so heavy that we pretend that nothing is happening. We probably had a fight in the house and when you come to church, you're not even able to greet the person next to you. There's a helping hand and this helping hand is New Life Counseling Team. So counseling is a professional way that can support you with trained counselors to help those individuals to help the counselors and to help groups to explore and understand our thoughts, our emotions and the challenges that we are going through. Instead of resorting to social media for help or this next person who will tell you, "Let's go and have the next drink," you can have a trusted counselor who can sit with you and have this conf uh conversation with you. In the counseling room, there's confidentiality. That's to say as I speak to you or as a counselor speaks to you, they are going to keep this conversation confidential and they will not judge you even as they are speaking to you. And as we have this conversation, we will have a goal that we want to achieve and empower you with the skills that you can be able to move on. We may not um have all the solutions, but we can have a way that we can cope with this distressing situations. Let us not be like the proverbial um ostrich burring our mind our heads inside the sun pretending that we do not have challenges. Our brains are a very complicated um organ. However, it's pretty cool. But then because of various challenges could be biological, could be environmental, social, genetic or even trauma we then go through some level of distress. And so I dare ask you, who do you go to when you have a problem? The last time I was here, I had crutches and so there was an elder who was able to help me bring my laptop here and have my presentation. That is a physical thing we can do. But when we have mental challenges, nobody is able to take us to a lab and draw out some blood and get this issue out of us. And so just sitting and having a conversation with somebody is able to help us get that out from you and help us be able to sort out whichever challenge we are going through. And so what's the simple solution? Our first step could just be having the courageous thought to have a conversation with somebody. And it could also be having that first handshake. Many of us may not have shaken anybody's hand since they woke up or since they they walked into the compound. And so I'm reminding you since you shook the person on the right and on the left, I'd like you to shake the hand of somebody behind you or in front of you, kindly do that. And as you do that, that could just be the first conversation that you're going to have with this person. And I'm just going to share an experience that not too long ago I was invited to a conference and and they were talking about drug addiction and the the presenter said one in every two in a Christian no let me say religious university one in two take drugs or alcohol. And I was sitting next to the person next to me. I looked to my right. I looked to my left and I was just wondering, so who is that one person? And I took the next step to find out, have you abused any drugs? And she said, yes, I have. And I I went to my right and I asked, have you taken any drugs? And she reached out to her bag and she asked, "Can I show you what I have?" So that was already real. I decided to look behind and I asked the guy behind me, "Have you taken any drugs or is this real?" He said, "Yes, I just puffed before I came in." And the person in front of me was the same. So that's to say five of us already. So four in one is no, four in five have abused drugs. That's to say they probably are going through a challenge and they do not know where to go to. I'm inviting you as New Life Church that we have help. You do not have to seek those um you do not have to go and smoke or drink or take drugs to be able to sort out your challenges. And so I'm inviting us to always have this handshake and be intentional. And if you see anybody who has a challenge, please direct them to New Life uh counseling department. I hope that there's a number on your screen. You can be able to to call that number when you want help. I'd like to invite Dr. Wangai to please come and pray for us and pray with us that we would have that courage to make that first step because that would change our life. Thank you. Uh thank you sister Beatrice. Please take note of the number on the screen. You may want to note it down somewhere. Uh when there's a need, I'd like us to just pray together. Let's pray. And even as we pray, I'll give you half a minute. Just talk to God about your own personal needs. We all have needs various maybe medical, maybe relationship, maybe parents, maybe spouses, maybe children, relatives, bosses, financial, personal. Just talk to the Lord for half a minute. Father, for every item we have brought before the throne of grace today, we just ask that Father, in the name of Jesus Christ, meet each of us at the point of contact with the item that we have brought before you. We've been reminded today that all of us have issues and sometime the issues overwhelm us. We recognize that the devil is mighty to bring about mighty things before us. But we thank you God because although the devil is mighty, you are almighty. And we thank you because when you're in control, nothing gets out of control. And therefore, Father, whatever is overwhelming us today, we place it before you to touch, to address, to modify. But above all, Father, help us to know as we pray sometimes and we feel that we are overwhelmed by issues and we feel that the heavens are still like brass and we cannot touch your hand. Father, help us to know when we can't seem to touch your hand. We can be able to know and touch your heart. Help us to know you love us. You see us, you address our issues, and help us to hold on as we wait upon you. And now, Father, for the items I brought before you, oh God, address them where there's been weakness, give strength, where we've been fizzling out and almost giving up, restore us. And we've been feeling like giving up. Help us to hold on tenaciously to you. And we promise you, Father, that when you continue to answer prayers, we'll give you the praise, the honor, and the glory. For we pray these things in Jesus name. Amen. as

TIMESTAMPED TRANSCRIPT:
[0.1s] [Music]
[1.1s] Good morning and happy
[4.0s] Sabbath. Good morning and happy
[7.7s] Sabbath. My name is Betrice and uh I'd
[11.3s] like to invite each one of you to say hi
[14.1s] to the person on your
[17.6s] right. Shake the hand of the person next
[20.2s] to your right and shake the hand of the
[23.1s] person on your left.
[27.0s] be very intentional as you do
[33.2s] this. I'm just wondering what might be
[36.1s] going through your mind even as I'm
[38.0s] asking you to shake their hands. This
[40.6s] month has been dedicated to shaking to
[43.0s] to shedding light on mental wellness.
[46.3s] And I'm encouraging each one of us to
[48.6s] just listen to this and and whatever you
[52.1s] will gather that at the end of the day,
[54.0s] you will have a tool to be able to help
[56.4s] you to support the person who's next to
[59.1s] you. Not too long ago, I received a call
[62.6s] from somebody who was really panicking
[65.7s] and she on the other side of the phone,
[68.4s] she said, "Betrice, where are you?" And
[72.4s] because I was driving, she had
[73.8s] persistently called. who had had gone
[75.9s] off the road to just listen to her and
[78.3s] she said, "Could you speak to this
[80.2s] person on the other side of the line
[82.6s] because she wants to commit suicide and
[85.0s] she wants to kill all her three
[87.2s] children? If this was you, what would
[90.6s] you have
[91.8s] done?" I'm glad that she had a number to
[94.7s] call and I'm glad that she was able to
[96.8s] find me on the other side of the line.
[99.8s] We all have received a distress call at
[102.6s] one point or another or we are the ones
[105.8s] through who are going through distress
[108.4s] and instead we have resorted to negative
[112.2s] coping mechanisms so that we are
[114.2s] smoking, drinking or taking whichever
[117.1s] kind of drug that is that is numbing
[119.8s] that pain.
[123.8s] Sometimes we go to the doctor and the
[126.1s] doctor will look for whatever it is and
[129.0s] they will not find and they will squeeze
[132.6s] all the money out of you because they
[135.0s] seem to be treating this thing that is
[137.9s] not getting healed every time. And so we
[141.7s] need to have an open mind without
[144.2s] judgment and be able to direct such
[147.0s] people to the counseling department. And
[149.8s] hence I'm introducing the new life
[151.8s] counseling department to you. Is there
[154.6s] help? Is there help when I'm in
[157.5s] disgrace? Yes, we have psychological
[160.6s] support and counseling not just for an
[163.9s] individual but for groups and even for
[167.6s] family. The Bible tells us in Proverbs
[171.6s] 11:14, "Without good direction, people
[175.0s] lose their way. The more wise council
[178.1s] you follow, the better your chances. So,
[182.6s] which chance do you have? I'm just
[185.1s] wondering what's on your screen and if
[186.9s] you're able to see what uh was
[190.0s] projected.
[191.8s] Sometimes the weight on our brains or in
[195.6s] our heart is so heavy that we pretend
[199.2s] that nothing is happening. We probably
[202.5s] had a fight in the house and when you
[205.4s] come to church, you're not even able to
[207.7s] greet the person next to you. There's a
[210.6s] helping hand and this helping hand is
[213.6s] New Life Counseling Team.
[217.4s] So counseling is a professional way that
[220.2s] can support you with trained counselors
[223.3s] to help those individuals to help the
[225.6s] counselors and to help groups to explore
[228.6s] and understand our thoughts, our
[231.5s] emotions and the challenges that we are
[234.0s] going through. Instead of resorting to
[237.1s] social media for help or this next
[240.0s] person who will tell you, "Let's go and
[242.2s] have the next drink," you can have a
[244.7s] trusted counselor who can sit with you
[247.8s] and have this conf uh conversation with
[250.4s] you. In the counseling room, there's
[253.1s] confidentiality.
[254.7s] That's to say as I speak to you or as a
[258.2s] counselor speaks to you, they are going
[260.3s] to keep this conversation confidential
[263.7s] and they will not judge you even as they
[265.8s] are speaking to you. And as we have this
[268.4s] conversation, we will have a goal that
[270.7s] we want to achieve and empower you with
[273.4s] the skills that you can be able to move
[275.5s] on. We may not um have all the
[278.6s] solutions, but we can have a way that we
[281.3s] can cope with this distressing
[283.0s] situations. Let us not be like the
[285.6s] proverbial um ostrich burring our mind
[289.7s] our heads inside the sun pretending that
[292.2s] we do not have challenges. Our brains
[295.4s] are a very complicated
[297.6s] um organ. However, it's pretty cool. But
[301.8s] then because of various challenges could
[304.6s] be biological, could be environmental,
[307.1s] social, genetic or even trauma we then
[310.7s] go through some level of distress. And
[313.4s] so I dare ask you, who do you go to when
[316.7s] you have a
[318.2s] problem? The last time I was here, I had
[321.5s] crutches and so there was an elder who
[324.0s] was able to help me bring my laptop here
[327.2s] and have my presentation. That is a
[329.8s] physical thing we can do. But when we
[332.1s] have mental challenges, nobody is able
[334.6s] to take us to a lab and draw out some
[337.2s] blood and get this issue out of us. And
[340.7s] so just sitting and having a
[342.8s] conversation with somebody is able to
[346.2s] help us get that out from you and help
[349.1s] us be able to sort out whichever
[351.7s] challenge we are going through. And so
[354.3s] what's the simple solution? Our first
[357.1s] step could just be having the courageous
[359.9s] thought to have a conversation with
[362.0s] somebody. And it could also be having
[365.1s] that first handshake.
[367.7s] Many of us may not have shaken anybody's
[370.0s] hand since they woke up or since they
[372.1s] they walked into the compound. And so
[374.4s] I'm reminding you since you shook the
[377.0s] person on the right and on the left, I'd
[379.6s] like you to shake the hand of somebody
[381.5s] behind you or in front of you, kindly do
[388.5s] that. And as you do that, that could
[391.5s] just be the first conversation that
[393.6s] you're going to have with this person.
[396.1s] And I'm just going to share an
[397.6s] experience that not too long ago I was
[400.7s] invited to a conference and and they
[403.6s] were talking about drug
[405.5s] addiction and the the presenter said one
[409.3s] in every two in a Christian no let me
[412.9s] say religious university one in two take
[416.7s] drugs or alcohol. And I was sitting next
[420.2s] to the person next to me. I looked to my
[422.6s] right. I looked to my left and I was
[424.6s] just wondering, so who is that one
[427.0s] person? And I took the next step to find
[430.1s] out, have you abused any drugs? And she
[433.3s] said, yes, I have. And I I went to my
[436.6s] right and I asked, have you taken any
[438.8s] drugs? And she reached out to her bag
[440.6s] and she asked, "Can I show you what I
[443.2s] have?" So that was
[445.6s] already real. I decided to look behind
[449.2s] and I asked the guy behind me, "Have you
[451.7s] taken any drugs or is this real?" He
[454.2s] said, "Yes, I just puffed before I came
[456.5s] in." And the person in front of me was
[459.7s] the same. So that's to say five of us
[464.0s] already. So four in one is no, four in
[470.1s] five have abused drugs. That's to say
[473.9s] they probably are going through a
[475.5s] challenge and they do not know where to
[477.7s] go to. I'm inviting you as New Life
[481.1s] Church that we have help. You do not
[483.9s] have to seek those um you do not have to
[487.4s] go and smoke or drink or take drugs to
[490.5s] be able to sort out your challenges. And
[493.0s] so I'm inviting us to always have this
[495.5s] handshake and be intentional. And if you
[498.7s] see anybody who has a challenge, please
[501.1s] direct them to New Life uh counseling
[504.0s] department. I hope that there's a number
[506.1s] on your screen. You can be able to to
[508.5s] call that number when you want help. I'd
[511.0s] like to invite Dr. Wangai to please come
[513.7s] and pray for us and pray with us that we
[516.9s] would have that courage to make that
[519.3s] first step because that would change our
[522.1s] life. Thank you.
[524.8s] Uh thank you sister Beatrice. Please
[526.5s] take note of the number on the screen.
[529.0s] You may want to note it down somewhere.
[532.0s] Uh when there's a need, I'd like us to
[534.2s] just pray together. Let's
[536.2s] pray. And even as we pray, I'll give you
[538.7s] half a minute. Just talk to God about
[541.0s] your own personal needs. We all have
[544.1s] needs
[546.4s] various maybe medical,
[549.2s] maybe relationship, maybe parents, maybe
[553.0s] spouses, maybe children,
[555.6s] relatives,
[557.1s] bosses, financial, personal. Just talk
[562.1s] to the Lord for half a minute.
[574.8s] Father, for every item we have brought
[578.3s] before the throne of grace today, we
[581.1s] just ask that Father, in the name of
[584.2s] Jesus
[585.8s] Christ, meet each of us at the point of
[590.8s] contact with the item that we have
[593.0s] brought before you. We've been reminded
[595.9s] today that all of us have issues and
[599.0s] sometime the issues overwhelm us. We
[602.6s] recognize that the devil is mighty to
[606.3s] bring about mighty things before us. But
[608.6s] we thank you God because although the
[611.8s] devil is mighty, you are almighty. And
[615.4s] we thank you because when you're in
[617.2s] control, nothing gets out of control.
[620.8s] And therefore, Father, whatever is
[622.2s] overwhelming us today, we place it
[625.2s] before you to touch, to address, to
[630.2s] modify. But above all, Father, help us
[634.2s] to
[635.3s] know as we pray sometimes and we feel
[638.6s] that we are overwhelmed by issues and we
[642.0s] feel that the heavens are still like
[646.6s] brass and we
[648.8s] cannot touch your hand. Father, help us
[652.6s] to know when we can't seem to touch your
[657.2s] hand. We can be able to know and touch
[662.7s] your heart. Help us to know you love us.
[667.4s] You see
[668.4s] us, you address our issues, and help us
[672.1s] to hold on as we wait upon you. And now,
[676.7s] Father, for the items I brought before
[678.6s] you, oh
[679.9s] God, address
[682.0s] them where there's been weakness, give
[684.6s] strength, where we've been fizzling out
[687.0s] and almost giving up, restore us. And
[690.7s] we've been feeling like giving up. Help
[693.5s] us to hold on tenaciously to you. And we
[697.2s] promise you, Father, that when you
[699.8s] continue to answer prayers, we'll give
[702.3s] you the praise, the honor, and the
[705.5s] glory. For we pray these things in Jesus
[709.0s] name. Amen.
[714.6s] as
