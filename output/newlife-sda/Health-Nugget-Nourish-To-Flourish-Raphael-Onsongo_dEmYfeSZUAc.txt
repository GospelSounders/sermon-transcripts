FULL TRANSCRIPT:
Happy day. Uh my name is Enongo Rafa Yamiso. It's my pleasure to be with you uh on this uh Sabbath day and to share some health nuggets. Before we begin, I'll invite all of us to bow our heads, close our eyes. Let's pray together. A kinder loving father and master what in heaven we humbly come before you this blessed morning. Thankful for the blessed gift of life and dear Lord for your desire to have us be in health even as we prosper spiritually. Guide us as we go through this nugget is I pray in Jesus name. Amen. All right. So, um, our message today is entitled, uh, Nourish to Flourish. And we're going to look at lessons on health, holiness, and wholeness from the book of Daniel chapter 1, borrowing from the example of Daniel as an exile. And so, uh, Daniel chapter 1 opens to us and tells us that Daniel and his friends are in Babylon. They are the captives of Nebuchadnezzar having selected the best of all lands and of all nations. And in this new place they put in the University of Babylon. Um and uh it's a secular campus and they they come under a lot of changes. Their names are changes from Ananiah, Michel and Azariah to Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego. And Daniel himself is called uh Belaza. And so um the there's a lot of changes. And part of the changes that Daniel and his friends and his group of friends uh met was cultural pressure to conform things which are not new to those of us who have been in public campuses as well as in offices. I think peer pressure is something that we all uh experience cultural pressure regardless of um where we are coming from uh in and where we are in life. And so ultimately we learn uh in Daniel chapter one the question of diet is swiftly put to the forefront in which the ch the these children of Israel are being provided a portion of the king's meat the deities of the king you know um how many of us have perhaps desired to be called out to be to be hosted perhaps by the American president who is perhaps the equivalent of Nebuchadnezzar in our in our world today for uh the president's ball and and to participate in the dainties of of of of such a such a dinner. But nonetheless, we find in Daniel and Michel and Aariah children who know that indeed God cares about our bodies. God cares about our bodies as 1 Corinthians chapter 6 verse 19 to 20 tells us. We eventually find Daniel um speaking out of conviction, telling us that indeed the matter of our diet is something that is uh significant and that it is of of great importance to not only our spiritual well-being but also our physical well-being. The Bible records in verse 8, Daniel 1:8, if I would, if I would read. But Daniel purposed in his heart that he would not defile himself with a portion of the king's meat, nor with the wine which he drank. Therefore, he requested of the prince of the unax that he might not defile himself. Daniel, the Bible records, purposed in his heart. Indeed, it is a spiritual principle that conviction will lead to consecration. And therefore Daniel chose to honor God even when it came to the matter of diet. And similarly God was able to vindicate uh this gentleman Daniel as well as the lot of the Hebrew boys. Eventually we come across one I would say one of the earliest uh scientific studies recorded in the book of Daniel where we have a case under control and uh it is recorded in the book of Daniel chapter 1 verse 12-4 in which we see one group of people eating of the deities of the king's table while others uh composed of Daniel this small band eating pulse and water it's pulse and water versus the king's food simplicity and trust in divine wisdom being put to the test. And the Bible records after 10 days this test um uh showed that indeed the result was that they were flourishing in every way. They were better physically. They had a better appearance. Verse 15 says indeed it's simply telling us that in an in a world and in a in an era in which many of us have uh are following various beauty routines there's no better beauty routine as your diet. Amen. Your diet is critical in the way even you look physically and how you appear. Mentally they were better in knowledge and in wisdom. Verse 17 tells us and spiritually we see even this decision of theirs was anchored in in in having a faith and a trust in God uh who provided for them and came through for them. What is our modern application today in our culture today? We are surrounded by fast foods and processed diets. Indeed uh fads in diets are uh mushrooming right left and center. There's a keto diet. There's a cannivorous diet. There's all manner of diets. Um, all of which are calling for our attention. But Daniel tells us to consider the diet that God meant for man as he created man in the book of Genesis at the beginning, which is a diet that is significantly if not exclusively plant-based. And so we live in a time in which there is a health crisis in our midst. Obesity, diabetes, heart diseases as well as many other non-communicable diseases are on the rise because we have changed our diets. Especially we who are from this uh African continent, the more western we have become, the more we find ourselves um uh having western um uh diseases in our midst. But as we see in Daniel this day, I ask us to purpose in our hearts to choose a different path. To choose a different path. What does the science say? Science indeed does support Danielle's choice. The WHO as well as many other publications, a plethora of publications are actually coming to terms that indeed a plant-based diet has more is is more beneficial and uh better for mankind in the long term. when it comes to cardiovascular health, plant-based diet has a lower risk uh for having any cardiovascular accident or incidents and better cholesterol control. Whereas animal based diets um animal based diets, diets high in animal products where they eat milk uh or eggs are high in saturated fats as well as cholesterol. Indeed, those who are significantly um um a great chunk of their of their diet is plant-based have a approximately 32% uh lower risk of cardiovascular having cardiovascular incident. For those of us who struggle with weight management as well as metabolism, a plant-based diet high in fiber and low in calories is actually the best especially if you are treat you're trying to lose weight. Just try plant-based for a number of weeks and you will shed the weight seamlessly. And indeed uh nature, the journal of nature in 2020 actually uh produced an article that said it significantly leads to more fat loss in a plant-based diet. When it comes to cancer risk and immunity, we have studies like the China study that proved that one of the greatest factors in the um in the progression of cancer is actually diet more so animal-based proteins and therefore plants are rich with antioxidants and fibers that protects um against cancer. And indeed recently the WHO categorized processed meats as a group one casino proving to us once again that indeed um God's plan is the best when it comes to our gut microbiome and our mental health. Plant plant-based plants feed good gut bacteria and they set us in a better mood, improve our immunity as well as our cognitive function. Animal fats on the other hand health sometimes tend to uh disrupt gut balance as well as um as well as um um make it difficult for the system. And so in conclusion, I call us to study even nature itself. Some of the longest and healthiest um animals uh in in in in in nature itself are habos. even in terms of their character, even in terms of their of their disposition, uh, habs tend to be gentler, tend to live longer. And therefore, we can learn from nature itself as well as from the God of the Bible uh as to um what exactly we need to take in order to flourish in terms of our nourishment. And so in conclusion, Daniel's example is there for all of us that God God honors our obedience and that health is actually a spiritual matter and it calls all of us to be intentional and prayerful even in the things that we present before ourselves and before our children. Those of us who have the high honor of preparing meals for others in our households. In conclusion, Paul writes to us in Romans 12 and verse one and he asks us to present our our bodies as sacrifices as a temples present our bodies na nicely in a nice way you know and the question to us today are we willing to honor God in our bodies today the same text in verse two says but be not conformed to the things of this world but that be transformed by the renewing of your mind. It is my It is my my plea and my prayer that this day, like Daniel, we will make the right choices in our diet and indeed we shall nourish to flourish. Let's believe and pray. Our kind and loving father and master, we thank you and praise your name for in this brief time we've been able to look at the importance of our diets even in our spiritual, physical, mental, and in all aspects, dear Jesus. And we know for a fact that you love us to be in good health and to prosper. And so to this end, dear Lord, may you enable us to have a heart of conviction and a mind, dear Lord, that we make the choice like Daniel, that after all is said and done, we shall indeed be 10 times better and indeed enjoy health and wealth in the fullness of your love and in your salvation. This is our prayer, believing and trusting in you. Amen. May God bless you and keep you. [Music]

TIMESTAMPED TRANSCRIPT:
[0.2s] Happy day. Uh my name is Enongo Rafa
[3.4s] Yamiso. It's my pleasure to be with you
[5.6s] uh on this uh Sabbath day and to share
[8.2s] some health nuggets. Before we begin,
[10.2s] I'll invite all of us to bow our heads,
[12.2s] close our eyes. Let's pray together.
[15.0s] A kinder loving father and master what
[16.6s] in heaven we humbly come before you this
[18.2s] blessed morning. Thankful for the
[19.4s] blessed gift of life and dear Lord for
[22.0s] your desire to have us be in health even
[24.3s] as we prosper spiritually. Guide us as
[26.9s] we go through this nugget is I pray in
[28.5s] Jesus name. Amen. All right. So, um, our
[32.2s] message today is entitled, uh, Nourish
[34.7s] to Flourish. And we're going to look at
[36.7s] lessons on health, holiness, and
[39.2s] wholeness from the book of Daniel
[41.2s] chapter 1, borrowing from the example of
[43.6s] Daniel as an exile. And so, uh, Daniel
[47.5s] chapter 1 opens to us and tells us that
[49.7s] Daniel and his friends are in Babylon.
[51.8s] They are the captives of Nebuchadnezzar
[54.6s] having selected the best of all lands
[56.8s] and of all nations. And in this new
[59.9s] place they put in the University of
[61.5s] Babylon. Um and uh it's a secular campus
[65.4s] and they they come under a lot of
[68.3s] changes. Their names are changes from
[70.2s] Ananiah, Michel and Azariah to Shadrach,
[72.3s] Meshach, and Abednego. And Daniel
[74.1s] himself is called uh Belaza. And so um
[79.0s] the there's a lot of changes. And part
[81.6s] of the changes that Daniel and his
[83.4s] friends and his group of friends uh met
[86.5s] was cultural pressure to conform things
[89.8s] which are not new to those of us who
[92.2s] have been in public campuses as well as
[95.2s] in offices. I think peer pressure is
[97.8s] something that we all uh experience
[100.4s] cultural pressure regardless of um where
[103.4s] we are coming from uh in and where we
[106.2s] are in life. And so ultimately we learn
[110.5s] uh in Daniel chapter one the question of
[113.0s] diet is swiftly put to the forefront in
[116.2s] which the ch the these children of
[118.3s] Israel are being provided a portion of
[121.1s] the king's meat the deities of the king
[123.8s] you know um how many of us have perhaps
[126.5s] desired to be called out to be to be
[129.2s] hosted perhaps by the American president
[131.8s] who is perhaps the equivalent of
[133.0s] Nebuchadnezzar in our in our world today
[135.8s] for uh the president's ball and and to
[138.8s] participate in the dainties of of of of
[141.3s] such a such a dinner. But nonetheless,
[144.2s] we find in Daniel and Michel and Aariah
[147.4s] children who know that indeed God cares
[150.9s] about our bodies. God cares about our
[154.0s] bodies as 1 Corinthians chapter 6 verse
[157.0s] 19 to 20 tells us. We eventually find
[161.7s] Daniel um speaking out of conviction,
[165.0s] telling us that indeed the matter of our
[167.8s] diet is something that is uh significant
[171.0s] and that it is of of great importance to
[173.4s] not only our spiritual well-being but
[175.7s] also our physical well-being. The Bible
[178.5s] records in verse 8, Daniel 1:8, if I
[182.3s] would, if I would read. But Daniel
[184.6s] purposed in his heart that he would not
[186.5s] defile himself with a portion of the
[188.3s] king's meat, nor with the wine which he
[190.7s] drank. Therefore, he requested of the
[193.0s] prince of the unax that he might not
[194.9s] defile himself. Daniel, the Bible
[197.7s] records, purposed in his heart. Indeed,
[201.0s] it is a spiritual principle that
[202.9s] conviction will lead to consecration.
[205.7s] And therefore Daniel chose to honor God
[209.0s] even when it came to the matter of diet.
[211.6s] And similarly God was able to vindicate
[215.4s] uh this gentleman Daniel as well as the
[218.5s] lot of the Hebrew boys. Eventually we
[222.1s] come across one I would say one of the
[225.0s] earliest uh scientific studies recorded
[228.0s] in the book of Daniel where we have a
[229.5s] case under control and uh it is recorded
[232.2s] in the book of Daniel chapter 1 verse
[234.5s] 12-4 in which we see one group of people
[238.5s] eating of the deities of the king's
[240.6s] table while others uh composed of Daniel
[243.5s] this small band eating pulse and water
[246.7s] it's pulse and water versus the king's
[248.6s] food simplicity and trust in divine
[251.6s] wisdom being put to the test. And the
[253.9s] Bible records after 10 days this test um
[258.1s] uh showed that indeed the result was
[260.5s] that they were flourishing in every way.
[263.0s] They were better physically. They had a
[264.6s] better appearance. Verse 15 says indeed
[267.9s] it's simply telling us that in an in a
[271.0s] world and in a in an era in which many
[273.2s] of us have uh are following various
[275.8s] beauty routines there's no better beauty
[278.4s] routine as your diet. Amen. Your diet is
[282.2s] critical in the way even you look
[284.9s] physically and how you appear. Mentally
[287.0s] they were better in knowledge and in
[288.5s] wisdom. Verse 17 tells us and
[290.4s] spiritually we see even this decision of
[293.9s] theirs was anchored in in in having a
[297.8s] faith and a trust in God uh who provided
[301.8s] for them and came through for them. What
[304.2s] is our modern application today in our
[306.8s] culture today? We are surrounded by fast
[310.1s] foods and processed diets. Indeed uh
[313.4s] fads in diets are uh mushrooming right
[316.6s] left and center. There's a keto diet.
[318.2s] There's a cannivorous diet. There's all
[319.6s] manner of diets. Um, all of which are
[322.3s] calling for our attention. But Daniel
[324.8s] tells us to consider the diet that God
[328.5s] meant for man as he created man in the
[331.0s] book of Genesis at the beginning, which
[333.0s] is a diet that is significantly
[336.7s] if not exclusively plant-based. And so
[340.1s] we live in a time in which there is a
[341.6s] health crisis in our midst. Obesity,
[344.2s] diabetes, heart diseases as well as many
[346.4s] other non-communicable diseases are on
[348.3s] the rise because we have changed our
[350.2s] diets. Especially we who are from this
[352.9s] uh African continent, the more western
[355.0s] we have become, the more we find
[357.1s] ourselves um uh having western um uh
[361.8s] diseases in our midst. But as we see in
[365.1s] Daniel this day, I ask us to purpose in
[368.5s] our hearts to choose a different path.
[370.8s] To choose a different path. What does
[372.9s] the science say? Science indeed does
[375.5s] support Danielle's choice. The WHO as
[378.9s] well as many other publications, a
[381.2s] plethora of publications are actually
[382.8s] coming to terms that indeed a
[385.0s] plant-based diet has more is is more
[388.4s] beneficial and uh better for mankind in
[392.3s] the long term. when it comes to
[393.9s] cardiovascular health, plant-based diet
[396.2s] has a lower risk uh for having any
[398.4s] cardiovascular accident or incidents and
[401.0s] better cholesterol control. Whereas
[403.4s] animal based diets um animal based
[406.8s] diets, diets high in animal products
[409.0s] where they eat milk uh or eggs are high
[412.1s] in saturated fats as well as
[413.4s] cholesterol. Indeed, those who are
[417.0s] significantly um um a great chunk of
[420.3s] their of their diet is plant-based have
[422.7s] a approximately 32% uh lower risk of
[425.9s] cardiovascular having cardiovascular
[427.8s] incident. For those of us who struggle
[429.8s] with weight management as well as
[431.4s] metabolism, a plant-based diet high in
[434.0s] fiber and low in calories is actually
[437.0s] the best especially if you are treat
[439.4s] you're trying to lose weight. Just try
[442.2s] plant-based for a number of weeks and
[444.6s] you will shed the weight seamlessly.
[447.8s] And indeed uh nature, the journal of
[450.8s] nature in 2020 actually uh produced an
[453.5s] article that said it significantly leads
[455.9s] to more fat loss in a plant-based diet.
[459.4s] When it comes to cancer risk and
[460.9s] immunity, we have studies like the China
[462.9s] study that proved that one of the
[465.1s] greatest factors in the um in the
[467.9s] progression of cancer is actually diet
[471.0s] more so animal-based proteins and
[473.4s] therefore plants are rich with
[475.4s] antioxidants and fibers that protects um
[478.5s] against cancer. And indeed recently the
[481.1s] WHO categorized processed meats as a
[483.9s] group one casino proving to us once
[487.0s] again that indeed um God's plan is the
[491.4s] best when it comes to our gut microbiome
[493.8s] and our mental health. Plant plant-based
[496.8s] plants feed good gut bacteria and they
[499.7s] set us in a better mood, improve our
[501.8s] immunity as well as our cognitive
[503.4s] function. Animal fats on the other hand
[506.2s] health sometimes tend to uh disrupt gut
[510.3s] balance as well as um as well as um um
[513.4s] make it difficult for the system. And so
[516.5s] in conclusion, I call us to study even
[519.0s] nature itself. Some of the longest and
[522.2s] healthiest um animals uh in in in in in
[526.6s] nature itself are habos. even in terms
[529.0s] of their character, even in terms of
[530.8s] their of their disposition, uh, habs
[533.5s] tend to be gentler, tend to live longer.
[536.4s] And therefore, we can learn from nature
[538.3s] itself as well as from the God of the
[540.6s] Bible uh as to um what exactly we need
[544.6s] to take in order to flourish in terms of
[547.4s] our nourishment. And so in conclusion,
[550.9s] Daniel's example is there for all of us
[553.0s] that God God honors our obedience and
[556.0s] that health is actually a spiritual
[558.6s] matter and it calls all of us to be
[561.3s] intentional and prayerful even in the
[564.5s] things that we present before ourselves
[567.0s] and before our children. Those of us who
[569.7s] have the high honor of preparing meals
[572.1s] for others in our households. In
[574.2s] conclusion, Paul writes to us in Romans
[576.6s] 12 and verse one and he asks us to
[579.0s] present our our bodies as sacrifices as
[582.7s] a temples present our bodies na nicely
[586.8s] in a nice way you know and the question
[589.5s] to us today are we willing to honor God
[593.0s] in our bodies today the same text in
[596.5s] verse two says but be not conformed to
[599.2s] the things of this world but that be
[601.0s] transformed by the renewing of your
[603.1s] mind. It is my It is my my plea and my
[606.4s] prayer that this day, like Daniel, we
[609.4s] will make the right choices in our diet
[612.3s] and indeed we shall nourish to flourish.
[615.0s] Let's believe and pray.
[617.7s] Our kind and loving father and master,
[619.0s] we thank you and praise your name for in
[621.0s] this brief time we've been able to look
[623.5s] at the importance of our diets even in
[626.2s] our spiritual, physical, mental, and in
[628.6s] all aspects, dear Jesus. And we know for
[631.4s] a fact that you love us to be in good
[633.6s] health and to prosper. And so to this
[636.3s] end, dear Lord, may you enable us to
[638.2s] have a heart of conviction and a mind,
[641.4s] dear Lord, that we make the choice like
[643.4s] Daniel, that after all is said and done,
[645.8s] we shall indeed be 10 times better and
[648.2s] indeed enjoy health and wealth in the
[651.8s] fullness of your love and in your
[653.8s] salvation. This is our prayer, believing
[655.8s] and trusting in you. Amen. May God bless
[658.6s] you and keep you.
