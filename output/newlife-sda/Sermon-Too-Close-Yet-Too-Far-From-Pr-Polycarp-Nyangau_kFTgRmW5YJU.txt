FULL TRANSCRIPT:
Happy Sabbath everyone. God is good all the time and all the time. I receive greetings from uh Nairobi remand prisons. I passed by in the morning to see my people and see how they have woken up and I make sure that they are well taken care of. As I I'm here, I met Elder Murua, Elder Oduka and Kirui. They were already there and they told me to greet you as I come this way. Receive greetings from my family as well. They told me this morning to greet you. They were not able to be here for some reasons uh which probably they will be able to explain for themselves when they come here next time. Uh I'm uh honored to be here today. I want to thank God for this uh rare opportunity that I found to share with you the blessings from heaven. I want to thank the leadership uh of this church. I want to thank my senior pastor who is with me here and my colleague who is away for the support they have given me through the week. As I was preparing to be here this morning, uh, I want to pray. Father in heaven, we thank you again this morning because you've enabled us to be here. As we read through your word, we pray that your blessings will accompany us. And let this word find room in our hearts and bless us this day. draw us closer to you through your word. In Jesus name we pray. Amen. This morning I want to talk about being too close and yet far away from salvation. Our key text from the book of Matthew chapter 7 21 says, "Not everyone who says to me, Lord, Lord, shall enter the kingdom of heaven, but he who does the will of my father in heaven." When we were growing up uh in the village, those early years uh we came to the age that is common to everyone where you feel a need to have a friend or to interact with friends of the opposite gender. Now this is a common uh stage for everyone especially men uh to prove that you are growing up and you want to interact further. There was a problem uh in our village. I hope it's a problem that cut across all villages that uh it was not easy to interact with people of the opposite gender because of probably what was taught to them by their parents especially mothers. Every time you tried to talk to them, they were so harsh. And we witnessed some of our seniors who were ahead of us being beaten terribly and even sometimes reported to the parents and parents dealt with them accordingly. Uh with questions like where did you learn this from and how many people have you told this. So some of us who are young, we were scared to do this or to say this lest we get into trouble. Those who are lucky enough were those who had big sisters ahead of them. They never struggled with this because their sisters will do this for them. Now after some time we thought that uh it's important to do this because we found it so nice when we saw our seniors move around with their friends and they had fun everywhere especially in church in school and other places even market places. And so we were like it's about time that we can also interact this way and so that we can also feel that we are part of the society and everything was fine. Now because we were scared and we thought it is not we are not ready for whatever we saw our seniors go through. We sat down and agreed that we are going to deise a way that will prove to us that what we want to do uh is safe or not. And so we agreed amongst ourselves uh people of my age and others that if you were interested in having a friend then you go sit closer to her. If she doesn't have a problem with you, you're good to go. to make it even so funny that we'd even have some gifts, you know, the kind of gifts that we could afford those days. And if they accepted these gifts and we could play out together, we thought that we have made it. After some time, we could find this not working because we would find them going away from us and interacting with our seniors and we were uh we lost them. Then when we complained that why is this happening and we thought this our friends uh uh they were asked why they could do this to us and then the simple response was they never told us anything. We thought this is a normal interaction. They never mentioned anything that they were interested in making us friends and that's how we lost the friendship that we wanted to have with our good ladies. Now after some time then we started learning that just closeness with them did not mean anything. That is when we started learning that at least you need to say something so that uh they can be able to know that uh it's true that there's something that you're interested in and uh you are very safe. Now our closeness gave us some painful moments and experiences that we never appreciated until much later when we grew up to be uh mature then we knew that something else must be done for you to be that which you wanted. Now I am interested in a h a text in the Bible and several other verses that can be able to help me explain what I want to say. In the Bible, we read about Jesus. Uh in the book of Luke chapter 6, this is where we read the story of Jesus and his disciples and then finally the apostles. Jesus uh having come to the age that he wanted to start his ministry, the ministry that brought him on earth. So he went to the mountain as we read from the book of Luke chapter 6. And then he spent a night there praying and people gathered around him and uh they were also praying with him. And in the morning he picked 12 out of all those who came around him. And then it came to a point now that uh uh as in after when the morning came Jesus picked on the 12 and uh when you read through verse 14- 16 names were mentioned of the people that Jesus chose to be the disciples. And then of interest to me is verse 16 that reads, "Judas the son of James and Judas is scalot who also betrayed who became a traitor was among them." Now the spirit of prophecy in the book of in the book conflict and courage page 285 says that while uh Jesus was preparing the disciples for ordin for the ordination one who had not been summoned urged his presence among them and this was Judas is scalot a man who professed to be the follower of Jesus Christ. Now the spirit of prophecy tells me this that out of the 12 that Jesus appointed one of them came by himself and this was Judas's scalot spirit of prophecy tells me that he came by himself not called by Jesus that's what I understand for reasons that I will explain as we go by now Jesus did not put him away he instead received him and chose to work with him. Remember in the whole team we had Judas again. So Judas were two. Now Judas for them to differentiate between the other Judas they had to use another name to make the difference. In the days of old we didn't have surnames from my understanding. So surnames came when you shared a name uh and they wanted to differentiate between you and the other person they would come up with something else to make you a different person. For example, uh some of us who are brought uh who were born in uh in Kissy where I come from uh there are come there came a time when we lost one of our loved ones. A person that we cherished most in the village and uh after a year or so all those who were born around that time were named after this particular person. But again you see when you want to identify who is who uh you could use his name plus the name of the father so that you make the difference. Now in the Old Testament as well or in the entire Bible that I've read when you want to differentiate between who and who uh they had to choose either a town where this the other person is found or another unique character that is found in one of them like what the sign languages do. They have what we call the sign name. A signed name is a name that is picked from a unique uh thing or a character that is unique amongst all I mean uh that is unique in you from all of us here that is a name that they can identify you with so that it makes it easy for them to talk about you equally what I'm trying to say is that even those days therefore that the differentiating between Judas and the other Judas they had to use another name for the other Judas. And so Judas the second person who the spirit of prophecy says who brought himself to be one of the disciples of Jesus was named Judas's scalute to mean this way. Number one is scalute had two meanings. number one meaning number one was that uh uh Judas the surname Judas uh meant uh uh was derived from a Latin name uh secaras which meant a murderer or an assassin uh the meaning that uh belonged to a group I can call it a terrorist group uh a Jewish terrorist or radical group uh that was vi violent during their time. Now we guess that uh uh Judas Escalot was given the name Iscalot to mean that he was a member of this group that was terrorizing that was that gave people no peace in the Jewish time and he was known to be a murderer uh by this name. And the other meaning meant that he came from a town that was named Kerot that was 190 kilometers away from uh Bethlehem where Jesus was born. Now the two can apply in my view that Judas's scalot might have come from Kot a town 190 kilometers away from Bethlehem where Jesus was born. And again in the same same sense, Judas was a murderer in a group that used to murder people during his time and probably was used by the authorities then to silence people who appeared to be a threat who appeared to be a problem to them during that time and I'm I met to understand it was an outlawed group like what we have heard about in our country and other places. Now, why am I interested in this? Judas might have been born early than Jesus, and so he understood Bethlehem so well because a distance of 190 kilometers was not too far that you could not know people around there. During our time, our grandfathers could know people as far as 200 kilometers away. I remember when my uncles came to introduce their girlfriends to our grandfathers, they had a lot of questions to ask these ladies. Where do you come from? Who is your father? Which is your village? Is your mother so and so? Who comes from this village? Whose mother is so and so? Whose father is so and so? Who lived in such and such a place? And when you hear these questions, he means a person who comes from so many kilometers away from home. And after that he was able to say what he wanted to say and that was fine. Equally with Jesus and Judas the distance between their homes were not very far. They shared a town that is Judea but again those villages apart were not too far from them. Remember Joseph was a carpenter and carpenters uh during those days moved from one place to another either roofing houses doing furniture for people at home. So they were so well known and I also want to guess that Judas Scalot came from a family a family of businessmen a family that knew money a family that moved from one place to another. So the interaction between the two families were inevitable. So he understood very well the characters and even the economic status of the people of Bethlehem where Jesus came from. also want to support this that uh Judas erh seemingly came from a welloff a well of home where he knew about money and he valued money and he treasured money so much that is why anything money you will find Judas there remember there's a time that Jesus was invited to a visit in a h somewhere and then Mary was there came to anoint Jesus for the good things that he did to her. And so the Bible says that Mary came with a very expensive ointment to anoint his feet. And now Judas complained about what happened and Jesus was there to rebuke him of what he had in mind. And the Bible says that Judas was a thief. So anything about money Judas was not to avoid it. Judas started showing his motives for the following uh uh for for for what he intended to do to Jesus. And this we read from the book of John 12 verse 6 to uh verse 4-6. And now every other thing that Jesus did, everywhere that Jesus went with Judas, Judas was able to notice certain things that were unique there. And so uh the Bible tries to describe the character of Judas in so many ways. But Luke becomes a bit fair and friendly by saying this in Luke 22 3-6. He says that uh all that Judas was trying to do was not out of his wish but rather he was visited by Satan. And so Satan was trying to move him to move him around in what he was doing. And so Jesus having seen this and uh having seen what Judas was planning to do, Jesus started rebuking him from a distance. Jesus took time to talk to Judas because he knew the intentions of his coming. Judas had come for reasons that were not according to uh the will of Jesus. And so Jesus having accommodated him in this group, he started rebuking him from so far. He started talking to him, telling Judas, what you are planning to do is not good. Your intentions are not very right. You are here to serve God together with your fellow uh disciples and me. And so change your mind from what you are doing. But Judas never listened to this. And so in John 6:7, Jesus speaks to the entire group of disciples and says that uh did I not choose you the 12 and one of you is the devil? And they spoke of Judas is scalot. Uh now Jesus did not keep quiet but rather even informed the entire uh group of disciples that amongst you we have the devil and the devil is Judas is scalute. Judas heard all these things but he did not even take time to understand what Jesus was talking about. I am saying you can be too close to salvation but again too far from it. After Jesus rebuked Judas, Judas was angry with him. Judas had known that the priests and all these people, the high priest, the the scribes and everyone around were not happy with Jesus for reasons that they thought that Jesus was about to form another kingdom that was to oppose theirs. Jesus had said so many things against them and Jesus was not so friendly to them. And so Judas knew that at some point these people were looking for Jesus either to eliminate him or kill him or do something about him. So after Jesus had rebuked Judas, Matthew 26 says that after Jud Jesus had rebuked Judas, Judas was angry and so went to the priests and spoke about Jesus to them. And so all he wanted he wanted to be paid for him to betray Jesus and so that he can also feel what he felt when he used to rebuke him in the open before the other disciples. Now there was a negotiation between Jesus I mean between Judas and the priests of how much he was to be paid for doing this. Remember the pictures that we see around like Jesus is a huge man. uh I don't know all those pictures were not real. Jesus was like any other human being when he was amongst other people you could not identify him unless you knew him. And so sometimes when these people were going for him they could not notice him until they wanted to look for someone who could be able to identify him so that they can be able to arrest him. Judas was the best choice for reasons that he was their good friend. Now I wondered that uh Judas even having been with Jesus he could also find time to go and interact with the priests and talk to them and have some share probably because he was a businessman he was looking for money he could also look for a way of raising some money from other sources. Now the Bible tells me this. The discussion between Judas and the priests uh was done and they agreed or they settled on 30 pieces of silver for Jesus to be betrayed. The book of John 13 27 still it insists or emphasizes that Satan was in in Judas as he was doing all these things. And so 26 of Matthew to 27 tells us the entire story of what happened with Judas is scalot. My Bible tells me that after some time Judas started rebelling seriously uh to Jesus and his team because he felt that now it was about time not to work with Jesus again. Spirit of prophecy told me that Judas thought that interacting with Jesus, being part of the being part of the disciples, he was most likely to have a higher position in the kingdom of Jesus when Jesus could form one. So he was interested in Jesus shaping him, giving him a character that could fit in his kingdom when he established one. But he waited for long and they thought that Jesus was not serious about it and so he decided to betray him. Now allow me again be a bit fair to Judas. You know Judas knew that Jesus was able to do certain miracles. You remember there's a time that Jesus spoke ill of the priests in the in the temple. And so they decided that this day they were going to show him to teach him a lesson. So they picked him and took him somewhere so that they can drop him down the valley and Jesus could die. They walked him all the way. Judas was there. The other disciples were there and all the congregation was with them because they thought it is enough. Jesus is now becoming too much and so they wanted to get rid of him. And the Bible says a common verse that so many of us read and is even used by politicians out there that when they took him and ready to throw him down, they were all confused and Jesus walked away from them. They did not notice him until when he disappeared is when they wondered what they were doing there and Jesus was not among them. All these things uh Judas experienced. So he knew even if he did what he was able to do, they could not be able to arrest Jesus and kill him the way they had planned only to find when you read through chapter 26 only to find that Jesus has been arrested and he's been taken through the authority and is now ready to be crucified. Judas was not at peace. Judas was remorseful. That is what the Bible says. And so uh he decided to go away. The book of Matthew 27:3, the Bible says that after Judas discovered that uh it has not worked with him the way he intended, so he went back to the priests and threw the money that he was given, the silver that he was given to the priests and went his way. And verse 5 of 27 says, Judas went and hanged himself. And so Judas died. The Bible tells me this that at that time when Judas left and hanged himself, the entire group of the disciples uh were so sad about what Judas did to himself. I want to believe this that uh Judas had an opportunity to live again. Judas had an opportunity to see the eternal life. Judas had an opportunity to be in heaven when Jesus come again. But he made one mistake. And the mistake was to walk away from Christ who was the giver of life who was God on earth who was everything that Judas needed simply because of a simple and a kind and a friendly rebuke that came from Jesus because of what he was doing. Friends, sometimes in this church, in wherever we live, there are times we choose to walk away from salvation just because of a rebuke that has come from pastors that has come from leaders that has come from the from the members around who wish us well and we choose to walk away and say we've left this church for them. Where we are going, we know it. Now I thought the death of Judas could take away even the spirit of Judas. But I can tell you this morning that the spirit of Judas exists amongst us even today. And you can be able to see it in so many of us. Sometimes you may not know that. But there are times that the spirit of Judas can be manifested in us and we do not know. Now Judas walked away and he yned himself and that was the end of the story. And after that Judas died a very very painful death. I've never read anywhere that it was prophesied or it was said that whoever could betray Jesus was to die and lose eternity. However, it was prophesied that Jesus at some point was to be betrayed and hanged and die and crucified and die. But whoever was to do this was not uh sentenced to death. And so Judas, if Judas went to Jesus like what Simon Peter did and repent to Jesus and say, "I have done this not because I wished to, but I was moved by some desires and I'm sorry for what I did." probably I feel and I'm convinced in myself that Judas would have been forgiven that Jesus would have given him a spirit of endurance as he watched Jesus die but at the end of the day Judas would have received or would have gotten eternal life but walking away from Christ and hanging himself denied him uh the eternal life. I have seen people walk away from church because of rebukes because people have mentioned them h for some reasons and they lose their lives. People walk away from simple rebukes and when they go out there the devil is waiting for them takes them into drinking takes them into women and men and then they do all sorts of things out there and by the time they know it they are not there. They have lost their lives and they don't have even the eternal life again. Friends, we can be in this church. We can be here every other Sabbath doing so many things here. But inside us, we have the spirit of Judas that is moving us around. We are doing things contrary to the will of God. Just because we can raise money to do things around here, just because we can sing so nicely, just because we can preach so well, but still the spirit of Judas is in ourselves, we are likely to get the direction that Judas went. How I pray and wish that even as we are here, we try and make sure that we don't do that which Judas did that would deny us eternity when Jesus come again. I have seen people even going to confess before wrong people and finally they don't get the help that they needed. Allow me allow me say a few things here in conclusion. One sometimes mind who you get closer to or who you choose to keep company. Judas, a friend of Jesus, the disciple of Jesus, chose to keep company with the enemies of Jesus. People who never wished well with Jesus. And so whatever they told him to do was against the will of God, was against Jesus, uh, not knowing that they were pulling him away from Christ, who was life by himself to Judas. Sometimes our close friends can lead us away from Christ. Sometimes the closest friends that we have within ourselves are the people who are leading us to do wrong things, who are leading us to go away from Christ and before we know it, we are not there. Uh I worked with the university for some time and uh I chose myself to be the chaplain and patron for the SDS because he was not there. And so I interacted with our students every other time even in class and wherever and they could find time to come to my office and share with me their experiences. Among the serious experiences they shared with me were the interaction and the relationship they met which are common in universities but took them away from the faith that they confessed the faith that was put in them by their parents from the village. And so they came regretting and remorseful for what had happened to them. And I was able to tell them it is not all lost. Sometimes some of them wanted to interact with their parents and confess whatever they did that was wrong and tell them how much they have disappointed them by not being good Christians again. The Christians who they were from home but again they were not able and I did that for them. Now our friends can be able to lead us away from Christ. Regrettably, even our wives and husbands, sometimes you are so committed, you want to do the will of God, and this man is around here pulling you here and there, telling you to do things that are not in line with what you believe. And because he's your husband, you must obey anyway. And before you know it, you start leaving coming to church or you'll come to church at 11:00. Tomorrow you are here at noon and the other day you are not there simply because you have chosen to do what he tells you. Sometimes our wives as well can lead us away. Our children, our parents, our closest friends can do this. So let's be mindful of the people that we keep company with. And if you know you are here to be to keep somebody company and lead him away from Christ, the Bible says is better that a heavy a heavy stone is is tied around your neck and you are thrown into the Pacific Ocean and you are not there to do many of these things that you are planning to do. Number two, do not judge people by where they come from. I want to mean this. Judas and Jesus came from Bethlehem. Sorry, from Judea. And uh Bethlehem and Kerot were towns within Judea. And so they knew each other. Judas knew exactly where uh where Jesus came from. And so he was able to judge him by who he was, by where he came from. And so he could not take serious some of the things that Jesus told him because he knew anyway this is a son of a carpenter. This is a man who came from that village where they are not even well off like us. And so I am only waiting for him to establish his kingdom. And he gives me uh some position there. and I'm good to go. Where we come from does not does not define who we can be. You know, uh I have a problem with my fellow Kissy men around for some reasons. I come from uh one of the unique uh clans in KCI and uh when when you interact with uh these men around here or even women there's a question that they ask that I've tried to avoid but again I can't avoid because of some reason especially now that I'm here now the first this question is where do you come from and you say I come from such and such a place I come from this clan and they are quick to tell you the character that is found in this clan H I come from a place called Samaria. You know apart from the Samaria that we read in the Bible, there's Samaria in Ki. But because they did not how to mention Samaria, they mentioned Bamaro. And uh now you know it's Samaria and I a Samaritan. Somebody told me that my my my senior pastor is also a Samaritan. I am yet to confirm. And we are known by a unique a unique uh a unique character. And the unique character here is uh that we are known to be eating a lot of ugali which is not very true. So anything that is not uggali is not food. And sometimes uh I I I I have tried to question this a lot and Samaritans who are here can be able to help me understand this. And so when people see you around I'm sure from here people start looking at me like that guy who eats a lot. I don't eat a lot. I just eat enough. This is likely to uh to create even problems to me and if my senior pastor is from the other side as well. We are going to have hard times in this church especially when we come to your homes for prayers. When we come to your offices, when you see us, you get stressed because you see people eat. We don't do that. Now when you start judging us by where we come from, then you are missing the mark. We'll be struggling hammering points here. things that are supposed to lead you into salvation but all you are seeing is somebody from Samaria these days people called me a pastor from prison some people in here that is fine but you are able to see something beyond prison in me that God has brought me here together with my colleagues so that we can lead you to heaven not to prison those who lead you to prison are there so if you have this spirit of Judas like it was in him before the only thing you can see in somebody is where he comes from and you choose to judge him by that and you miss the blessings that come from this person. Praise the name of God. You have judged people for some reason for where they come from wrongly. And finally, you miss certain things that they have for you. It is important to note this that where we come from, I repeat again, does not define what uh this person can be. And so spare us where we come from. Listen to what God has sent us to do to to tell you here. And I'm here to tell you that you can be too close but still far away from salvation. And that is the point here. So if you start judging us by where we come from, we'll stay here the longer we stay here. And we are not in hurry. By the way, we are here as long as we are here. And so you will not get the blessings that we have for you until when we leave this place. And when we leave here, we don't know. Number three, listen to warnings and take rebukes positively. Sometimes when somebody wants you, this is a good friend to you. When somebody rebukes you, this person means well for you. And so take these things seriously. Take it positively. There are people sometimes when you warn him, he start telling you who told you this, let me know him. I can go to court. I mean all these things they don't mean anything. And when you hear somebody mentioning going to court, this person is guilty of what you are telling him. So tell him calm down. Listen to what I'm telling you. This is for your good court. We can go no problem. But the point is this is wrong. If that is what you do, this is going to help you. Walking away from Christ, walking away from these rebukes, walking away from this uh these warnings, it is not going to help you, but rather it is going to lead you astray. Sometimes you sit somewhere and you listen to people drinking out there and they are busy singing songs that they used to sing in church when they walked away from church simply because somebody rebuked them simply because somebody warned them. Then you hear songs like my heart can sing when I post to remember and somebody so drunk and then you wonder why can't you remember this and go back to where you came from. And when you hear somebody start singing the songs that he used to sing in church, give him a few days, he will not be there. The devil is preparing him for grave and before you know it, he is not there. May God help us that we don't uh take these things for granted and choose uh to listen and take them serious. I'm almost finishing. I know there are people here who are not getting happy with me. And uh the next thing is Judas must have chosen uh uh Judas must have chosen to be the disciple of Jesus for wrong reasons. Wrong reasons were that he knew that being with Jesus he was able to get this position that he was looking for and the rest were not of of importance to him. You know sometimes we may be in this church because of some wrong reasons. Maybe you heard people talk about New Life SDA church fifth gong avenue and I wonder why we don't say fourth gong avenue and fourth gong avenue is just here. Now you are like that's a church that I'm supposed to belong to and when you come in here you are not part part of this group because you have come here for your own uh wrong reasons. Some of the wrong reasons are that I've seen in so many churches like there are people for example we are soon building another church not this one and uh Eldo calls it a cathedral there's a way he pronounce it and you feel like uh it's it's just a mini a mini white house that we are planning to build here now we are intending to do this and there are people who know exactly what they want out of this place when we about to get there they will start positioning themselves somewhere so that they can get to some influential positions where they can be able to make money out of these projects and get away with this thing and they don't care what happens next. There was a church somewhere where they started building a good church like uh the one that we are planning to do in future. I think pastor told me we are starting this thing in December and uh now my funds were raised and now they were able and ready to do this and somebody went to a company somewhere and picked an invoice a stamped invoice and allocated himself some 40 million to be I mean for things that were never supplied and within that period the pastor who was in this church was transferred and when the new pastor came in went through the the development committee a file and picked on an invoice and went to this company and asked them that uh you supplied something to the church and you are waiting to be paid 40 millions and so the manager was like uh we don't supply these things in the first place. Uh I don't know who who supplied them and and such like questions. So he left the office with a pastor and went to the accounts and asked them who supplied this to the church and then people started looking at each other because they knew exactly there was nothing that was supplied but somebody was waiting for 40 million to be paid to his account now through this company. And so somebody from the middle of this accountants went and told uh the manager that I hope my revelation is not is not going to cost me my to cost me my job. And he said so and so a member of this church uh came to us and said and asked for an invoice that is stamped and not written anything for him to make money from somewhere. And so this is the kind of this is the invoice that you have. and pastor was stressed and left this place came and called the development committee and told them that we are not going to continue from here until further notice and the rest was history. Now people know how to make money if from even from where they are not supposed to make money. And you'll be surprised if we will be here long enough to see this. You'll tell me that this is true. They are not waiting. Some of them don't even give even offerings or any other thing here. But they are quick to know who to influence where so that they can get to those positions. Sometimes if they can be able to put to pocket the pastors and I'm telling you we are the wrong number. uh so that they can be able to influence a few decisions here so that at the end of the day they get away with money that has been uh that has been given by members to build a church for God and finally you realize that uh they have done it they are here for wrong reasons are you here for the right reason now some of us could be here because they feel when I die I'll be given a a befitting send a decent burial. And I've never understood why people are bothered about a decent burial. In my view, when you are dead, you are dead. You don't know anything. Even if they buried you in a even if they just left you by the roadside to be eaten by wild animals, that is none of your business. You are not there. But people are stressed by this so-called uh uh decent burial which even costs up to 10 millions for reasons that are not there. Now you are here because you feel that you have a company that will give you a decent barrier whether you are here or not when you die you'll be buried anyway. Now if you are here you feel that that is what you are waiting for sometimes it may not be possible just be here worship God uh repent your sins prepare yourself for heaven and all the rest will come at its own time praise the name of God if you feel that you are here because of certain interest I want to assure you this morning rather afternoon that uh you may not get it now you'll get to notice that the spirit of Judas is around you and rebuke it as long as uh you have not gone where uh Judas went. Now, finally, I want to say this that at some point you need somebody to follow up on you. I was looking for the right English word. I could not find one and I came up with mine and said you need a spiritual. A spiritual is something that will remind you that the direction that you are going spiritually is wrong. You need somebody who can be able to tell you now the way we are seeing you is not the way you are supposed to be. When we came here, my senior pastor and my other colleagues sat down and told ourselves that we are here as a brother's keepers. When you see me going the wrong direction, please call me back. Tell me this is wrong. That way we can be able to support each other and we will be able to support you people as well. Now again the last uh the church board that I attended here uh after the after the board uh our senior pastor and I and others met somewhere with the pastoral meeting and my senior pastor was quick to remind them again that we are here that you can also tell us where we don't do things right. You are our brother's keepers that if you don't tell us where things are wrong as elders in the pastoral council and things go wrong we'll blame you. So as pastors in this church at least we have a team of people who can be able to come any time around us and tell us look this is not the way we are supposed to go this is not the way we are supposed to do things and we quickly retreat and sit back and say it's true what they are saying is not right let's do the right thing and that is the right way to go even you as a member you need to have somebody who can be able to tell you that this is what you are supposed to do and when he tells you this like what Jesus used to tell Judas then appreciate this and try to check around yourself and get uh you fixed for the right thing. That way you will make it. But if we don't have this, we will not know when we are right. We will not know when we are wrong. At the end of the day, the spirit of Judas in us will be too much on us and before we know it, we are dead and we miss eternal life. How I pray that even as we are here, we are here committed to serve you. We are here committed to be your spiritual matter. By the way, we see you doing what is not right. Uh trust me, we will tell you. We'll call you somewhere and tell you so and so what you are doing is not right. We better go this way. I have a team from New Life that works with me in prison who have not given me peace. But I love what they do. Anytime they send something wrong, uh they will come and tell me, "Pastor, we are not going to live like this." And so I'm quiet to listen to them and know how they want us to live. After listening to them, I'm able to get the point and then we start walking together and do that which is right. That is what is expected of all of us. And when we get it that way, we will get it right. Finally, humility is key to every believer, to every Christian and to all of us. Because humility will be able to take us closer to Christ, will be able to give us to be humble before Christ and take his instructions right and take his warnings correctly and have him bless us and have him prepare us for eternity. Judas missed a very important uh a very important part of his life that was in Christ that uh he could not get again. I want to pray for all of us and to all of us this way that may God help us, may God bless us as we try and check around ourselves and see to it that we do not miss this. We do not go walk away from Christ that we are too close to Christ but we miss eternal life but rather let's be too close to this and and still get this salvation that has prepared for all of us. And that way we'll rejoice in heaven when Jesus come as we sing hallelujah hosana because we have made it. May God bless us all in Jesus name. Amen. Amen.

TIMESTAMPED TRANSCRIPT:
[26.4s] Happy Sabbath everyone.
[29.7s] God is good all the time and all the
[33.2s] time.
[37.5s] I receive greetings from uh Nairobi
[40.1s] remand prisons. I passed by in the
[42.4s] morning
[43.3s] to see my people and see how they have
[46.8s] woken
[48.1s] up and I make sure that they are well
[51.8s] taken care of. As I I'm
[54.8s] here, I met Elder Murua,
[59.3s] Elder Oduka and Kirui. They were already
[62.6s] there and they told me to greet you as I
[65.5s] come this
[68.6s] way. Receive greetings from my family as
[71.5s] well. They told me this morning to greet
[73.8s] you. They were not able to be here for
[75.8s] some reasons
[78.0s] uh which probably they will be able to
[80.2s] explain for themselves when they come
[82.6s] here next
[87.1s] time. Uh I'm uh honored to be here
[90.9s] today. I want to thank God for this uh
[95.0s] rare opportunity that I found to share
[98.6s] with you the blessings from
[101.3s] heaven. I want to thank the leadership
[104.6s] uh of this
[106.2s] church. I want to thank my senior pastor
[108.9s] who is with me here and my colleague who
[111.0s] is
[111.9s] away for the support they have given me
[115.8s] through the week. As I was preparing to
[119.3s] be here this morning,
[125.0s] uh, I want to
[128.8s] pray. Father in heaven, we thank you
[131.8s] again this
[133.2s] morning because you've enabled us to be
[137.0s] here. As we read through your word, we
[139.6s] pray that your blessings will accompany
[141.6s] us. And let this word find room in our
[145.0s] hearts and bless us this day.
[148.0s] draw us closer to you through your word.
[150.1s] In Jesus name we pray.
[153.7s] Amen. This morning I want to talk about
[157.8s] being too
[159.1s] close and yet far away from
[164.0s] salvation.
[165.5s] Our key text from the book of Matthew
[168.1s] chapter 7 21 says, "Not everyone who
[171.6s] says to me, Lord, Lord, shall enter the
[175.0s] kingdom of heaven, but he who does the
[179.9s] will of my father in heaven."
[188.7s] When we were growing up uh in the
[192.0s] village, those early years
[196.4s] uh we came to the age that is common to
[200.2s] everyone where you feel a need to have a
[204.6s] friend or to interact with friends of
[208.2s] the opposite gender.
[212.6s] Now this is a common uh stage for
[215.8s] everyone especially men
[218.5s] uh to prove that you are growing up and
[220.8s] you want to interact
[223.0s] further. There was a problem uh in our
[226.6s] village. I hope it's a problem that cut
[229.3s] across all
[231.6s] villages that uh it was not easy to
[234.7s] interact with people of the opposite
[237.0s] gender because of probably what was
[240.0s] taught to them by their parents
[242.4s] especially mothers.
[244.8s] Every time you tried to talk to them,
[247.4s] they were so harsh. And we witnessed
[250.6s] some of our seniors who were ahead of us
[252.8s] being beaten terribly and even sometimes
[256.3s] reported to the parents and parents
[258.8s] dealt with them
[260.2s] accordingly. Uh with questions like
[262.8s] where did you learn this from and how
[265.4s] many people have you told this. So some
[268.7s] of us who are young, we were scared to
[270.9s] do this or to say this lest we get into
[274.4s] trouble. Those who are lucky enough were
[277.1s] those who had big sisters ahead of them.
[279.9s] They never struggled with this because
[281.8s] their sisters will do this for them.
[284.5s] Now after some time we thought that uh
[287.4s] it's important to do this because we
[289.4s] found it so nice when we saw our seniors
[292.5s] move around with their friends and they
[294.8s] had fun everywhere especially in church
[298.2s] in school and other places even market
[301.2s] places. And so we were like it's about
[304.2s] time that we can also interact this way
[307.0s] and so that we can also feel that we are
[310.1s] part of the society and everything was
[313.5s] fine. Now because we were scared and we
[316.5s] thought it is not we are not ready for
[319.4s] whatever we saw our seniors go through.
[322.7s] We sat down and agreed that we are going
[325.1s] to deise a way that will prove to us
[328.4s] that what we want to do uh is safe or
[331.4s] not. And so we agreed amongst ourselves
[335.0s] uh people of my age and others that if
[338.3s] you were interested in having a friend
[340.8s] then you go sit closer to her. If she
[343.5s] doesn't have a problem with you, you're
[345.4s] good to go. to make it even so funny
[349.2s] that we'd even have some gifts, you
[351.1s] know, the kind of gifts that we could
[353.0s] afford those days. And if they accepted
[355.6s] these gifts and we could play out
[357.6s] together, we thought that we have made
[360.4s] it. After some time, we could find this
[363.8s] not working because we would find them
[366.5s] going away from us and interacting with
[368.7s] our seniors and we were uh we lost them.
[372.6s] Then when we complained that why is this
[375.8s] happening and we thought this our
[377.6s] friends uh uh they were asked why they
[381.8s] could do this to us and then the simple
[384.6s] response was they never told us
[387.0s] anything. We thought this is a normal
[389.1s] interaction. They never mentioned
[391.2s] anything that they were interested in
[393.8s] making us friends and that's how we lost
[396.8s] the friendship that we wanted to have
[399.4s] with our good ladies. Now after some
[402.6s] time then we started learning that just
[405.8s] closeness with them did not mean
[408.4s] anything. That is when we started
[410.6s] learning that at least you need to say
[413.0s] something so that uh they can be able to
[415.8s] know that uh it's true that there's
[418.2s] something that you're interested in and
[420.9s] uh you are very
[422.6s] safe. Now our closeness gave us some
[425.9s] painful moments and experiences that we
[429.0s] never appreciated until much later when
[432.3s] we grew up to be uh mature then we knew
[436.6s] that something else must be done for you
[439.6s] to be that which you
[441.5s] wanted. Now I am interested in a h a
[446.4s] text in the Bible and several other
[448.6s] verses that can be able to help me
[451.3s] explain what I want to say.
[453.8s] In the Bible, we read about Jesus. Uh in
[458.0s] the book of Luke chapter 6, this is
[461.1s] where we read the story of Jesus and his
[464.3s] disciples and then finally the
[467.7s] apostles. Jesus uh having come to the
[471.4s] age that he wanted to start his
[474.2s] ministry, the ministry that brought him
[476.7s] on earth. So he went to the mountain as
[479.7s] we read from the book of Luke chapter 6.
[482.6s] And then he spent a night there praying
[485.2s] and people gathered around him and uh
[487.9s] they were also praying with him. And in
[490.8s] the morning he picked 12 out of all
[494.5s] those who came around him. And then it
[498.1s] came to a point now that
[502.3s] uh
[503.8s] uh as in after when the morning came
[507.9s] Jesus picked on the 12 and uh when you
[511.8s] read through verse 14- 16 names were
[516.2s] mentioned of the people that Jesus chose
[519.6s] to be the disciples. And then of
[522.3s] interest to me is verse 16 that reads,
[526.4s] "Judas the son of James and Judas is
[530.1s] scalot who also betrayed who became a
[533.7s] traitor was among them."
[536.6s] Now the spirit of prophecy in the book
[538.8s] of in the book conflict and courage page
[543.2s] 285 says that while uh Jesus was
[548.4s] preparing the disciples for ordin for
[551.0s] the ordination one who had not been
[554.0s] summoned urged his presence among them
[557.3s] and this was Judas is scalot a man who
[560.7s] professed to be the follower of Jesus
[563.8s] Christ. Now the spirit of prophecy tells
[566.9s] me this that out of the 12 that Jesus
[570.7s] appointed one of them came by himself
[574.2s] and this was Judas's scalot spirit of
[577.9s] prophecy tells me that he came by
[581.3s] himself not called by Jesus that's what
[583.9s] I understand for reasons that I will
[586.9s] explain as we go by now Jesus did not
[591.0s] put him away he instead received him and
[594.9s] chose to work with him. Remember in the
[598.8s] whole team we had Judas again. So Judas
[602.4s] were two. Now Judas for them to
[605.9s] differentiate between the other Judas
[608.3s] they had to use another name to make the
[610.9s] difference. In the days of old we didn't
[613.8s] have surnames from my understanding. So
[617.0s] surnames came when you shared a name uh
[620.7s] and they wanted to differentiate between
[622.7s] you and the other person they would come
[625.4s] up with something else to make you a
[627.5s] different person. For example,
[630.9s] uh some of us who are brought uh who
[633.5s] were born in uh in Kissy where I come
[635.6s] from uh there are come there came a time
[639.2s] when we lost one of our loved ones. A
[642.1s] person that we cherished most in the
[644.2s] village and uh after a year or so all
[648.6s] those who were born around that time
[650.7s] were named after this particular person.
[653.8s] But again you see when you want to
[656.0s] identify who is who uh you could use his
[659.4s] name plus the name of the father so that
[661.8s] you make the difference. Now in the Old
[664.9s] Testament as well or in the entire Bible
[667.8s] that I've read when you want to
[670.3s] differentiate between who and who uh
[673.3s] they had to choose either a town where
[675.8s] this the other person is found or
[678.1s] another unique character that is found
[680.5s] in one of them like what the sign
[682.8s] languages do. They have what we call the
[685.9s] sign name. A signed name is a name that
[689.0s] is picked from a unique uh thing or a
[692.3s] character that is unique amongst all I
[695.2s] mean uh that is unique in you from all
[698.0s] of us here that is a name that they can
[700.8s] identify you with so that it makes it
[703.4s] easy for them to talk about you equally
[707.0s] what I'm trying to say is that even
[709.4s] those days therefore that the
[712.5s] differentiating between Judas and the
[714.6s] other Judas they had to use another name
[717.8s] for the other Judas. And so Judas the
[721.4s] second person who the spirit of prophecy
[723.9s] says who brought himself to be one of
[726.6s] the disciples of Jesus was named Judas's
[729.8s] scalute to mean this way. Number one is
[734.3s] scalute had two meanings. number one
[737.4s] meaning number one was that
[741.0s] uh uh Judas the surname Judas uh meant
[746.7s] uh
[750.6s] uh was derived from a Latin name
[753.7s] uh secaras which meant a murderer or an
[758.2s] assassin
[759.8s] uh the meaning that uh belonged to a
[763.8s] group I can call it a terrorist group uh
[768.0s] a Jewish terrorist or radical group
[771.7s] uh that was vi violent during their
[775.1s] time. Now we guess that uh uh Judas
[779.6s] Escalot was given the name Iscalot to
[782.8s] mean that he was a member of this group
[786.0s] that was terrorizing that was that gave
[789.2s] people no peace in the Jewish time and
[792.3s] he was known to be a murderer uh by this
[796.2s] name. And the other meaning meant that
[799.0s] he came from a town that was named Kerot
[802.9s] that was 190 kilometers away from uh
[807.0s] Bethlehem where Jesus was born. Now the
[810.6s] two can apply in my view that Judas's
[814.0s] scalot might have come from Kot a town
[818.2s] 190 kilometers away from Bethlehem where
[821.5s] Jesus was born. And again in the same
[824.2s] same sense, Judas was a murderer in a
[827.4s] group that used to murder people during
[830.1s] his time and probably was used by the
[833.0s] authorities then to silence people who
[836.2s] appeared to be a threat who appeared to
[838.6s] be a problem to them during that time
[842.6s] and I'm I met to understand it was an
[845.5s] outlawed group like what we have heard
[847.9s] about in our country and other places.
[850.7s] Now, why am I interested in this? Judas
[855.0s] might have been born early than Jesus,
[857.8s] and so he understood Bethlehem so well
[861.5s] because a distance of 190 kilometers was
[865.6s] not too far that you could not know
[868.2s] people around there. During our time,
[871.4s] our grandfathers could know people as
[873.4s] far as 200 kilometers away. I remember
[877.0s] when my uncles came to introduce their
[879.3s] girlfriends to our grandfathers, they
[881.9s] had a lot of questions to ask these
[883.8s] ladies. Where do you come from? Who is
[886.6s] your father? Which is your village? Is
[889.4s] your mother so and so? Who comes from
[891.8s] this village? Whose mother is so and so?
[894.7s] Whose father is so and so? Who lived in
[897.1s] such and such a place? And when you hear
[899.5s] these questions, he means a person who
[901.8s] comes from so many kilometers away from
[903.9s] home. And after that he was able to say
[906.3s] what he wanted to say and that was fine.
[909.6s] Equally with Jesus and Judas the
[913.0s] distance between their homes were not
[915.0s] very far. They shared a town that is
[917.4s] Judea but again those villages apart
[920.7s] were not too far from them. Remember
[923.8s] Joseph was a carpenter and carpenters uh
[927.4s] during those days moved from one place
[929.5s] to another either roofing houses doing
[932.6s] furniture for people at home. So they
[934.8s] were so well known and I also want to
[937.0s] guess that Judas Scalot came from a
[940.6s] family a family of businessmen a family
[944.1s] that knew money a family that moved from
[946.6s] one place to another. So the interaction
[949.3s] between the two families were
[951.6s] inevitable. So he understood very well
[954.2s] the characters and even the economic
[957.0s] status of the people of Bethlehem where
[961.2s] Jesus came from. also want to support
[964.8s] this that uh Judas
[969.5s] erh seemingly came from a welloff a well
[973.5s] of home where he knew about money and he
[977.0s] valued money and he treasured money so
[979.6s] much that is why anything money you will
[982.9s] find Judas there remember there's a time
[986.0s] that Jesus was invited to a visit in a h
[989.9s] somewhere and then Mary was there came
[993.6s] to anoint Jesus for the good things that
[996.3s] he did to her. And so the Bible says
[999.7s] that Mary came with a very expensive
[1002.2s] ointment to anoint his feet. And now
[1005.7s] Judas complained about what happened and
[1008.4s] Jesus was there to rebuke him of what he
[1011.1s] had in mind. And the Bible says that
[1013.7s] Judas was a thief. So anything about
[1016.5s] money Judas was not to avoid
[1021.1s] it. Judas started showing his motives
[1024.4s] for the following uh uh for for
[1027.6s] for what he intended to do to Jesus. And
[1031.0s] this we read from the book of John 12
[1034.2s] verse 6 to uh verse 4-6. And now every
[1038.1s] other thing that Jesus did, everywhere
[1040.5s] that Jesus went with Judas, Judas was
[1043.4s] able to notice certain things that were
[1045.5s] unique there. And so uh the Bible tries
[1049.5s] to describe the character of Judas in so
[1052.0s] many ways. But Luke becomes a bit fair
[1055.4s] and friendly by saying this in Luke 22
[1060.1s] 3-6. He says that uh all that Judas was
[1064.5s] trying to do was not out of his wish but
[1067.6s] rather he was visited by Satan. And so
[1071.4s] Satan was trying to move him to move him
[1073.7s] around in what he was doing. And so
[1076.4s] Jesus having seen this and uh having
[1079.2s] seen what Judas was planning to do,
[1082.0s] Jesus started rebuking him from a
[1084.7s] distance. Jesus took time to talk to
[1087.4s] Judas because he knew the intentions of
[1089.8s] his coming. Judas had come for reasons
[1093.4s] that were not according to uh the will
[1096.2s] of Jesus. And so Jesus having
[1098.6s] accommodated him in this group, he
[1101.0s] started rebuking him from so far. He
[1104.2s] started talking to him, telling Judas,
[1107.0s] what you are planning to do is not good.
[1109.3s] Your intentions are not very right. You
[1111.6s] are here to serve God together with your
[1113.7s] fellow uh disciples and me. And so
[1116.9s] change your mind from what you are
[1118.8s] doing. But Judas never listened to this.
[1122.9s] And so in John
[1124.5s] 6:7, Jesus speaks to the entire group of
[1127.9s] disciples and says that uh did I not
[1131.9s] choose you the 12 and one of you is the
[1135.6s] devil? And they spoke of Judas is
[1138.4s] scalot. Uh now Jesus did not keep quiet
[1143.9s] but rather even informed the entire uh
[1147.0s] group of disciples that amongst you we
[1150.6s] have the devil and the devil is Judas is
[1153.8s] scalute. Judas heard all these things
[1156.6s] but he did not even take time to
[1158.5s] understand what Jesus was talking about.
[1162.6s] I am saying you can be too close to
[1166.1s] salvation but again too far from
[1171.2s] it. After Jesus rebuked Judas, Judas was
[1175.4s] angry with him. Judas had known that the
[1179.5s] priests and all these people, the high
[1182.1s] priest, the the scribes and everyone
[1184.3s] around were not happy with Jesus for
[1186.8s] reasons that they thought that Jesus was
[1189.9s] about to form another kingdom that was
[1192.9s] to oppose theirs. Jesus had said so many
[1196.2s] things against them and Jesus was not so
[1199.4s] friendly to them. And so Judas knew that
[1202.3s] at some point these people were looking
[1204.3s] for Jesus either to eliminate him or
[1206.7s] kill him or do something about him. So
[1209.8s] after Jesus had rebuked Judas, Matthew
[1212.5s] 26 says that after Jud Jesus had rebuked
[1216.2s] Judas, Judas was angry and so went to
[1220.1s] the priests and spoke about Jesus to
[1222.9s] them. And so all he wanted he wanted to
[1225.8s] be paid for him to betray Jesus and so
[1229.2s] that he can also feel what he felt when
[1232.0s] he used to rebuke him in the open before
[1235.2s] the other disciples. Now there was a
[1237.7s] negotiation between Jesus I mean between
[1240.7s] Judas and the priests of how much he was
[1243.8s] to be paid for doing this. Remember the
[1246.6s] pictures that we see around like Jesus
[1249.0s] is a huge man. uh I don't know all those
[1252.2s] pictures were not real. Jesus was like
[1254.8s] any other human being when he was
[1256.8s] amongst other people you could not
[1259.2s] identify him unless you knew him. And so
[1261.8s] sometimes when these people were going
[1263.9s] for him they could not notice him until
[1266.7s] they wanted to look for someone who
[1268.9s] could be able to identify him so that
[1271.3s] they can be able to arrest
[1273.1s] him. Judas was the best choice for
[1276.2s] reasons that he was their good friend.
[1278.9s] Now I wondered that uh Judas even having
[1282.6s] been with Jesus he could also find time
[1285.0s] to go and interact with the priests and
[1287.2s] talk to them and have some share
[1289.2s] probably because he was a businessman he
[1291.7s] was looking for money he could also look
[1293.7s] for a way of raising some money from
[1295.4s] other sources. Now the Bible tells me
[1299.6s] this. The discussion between Judas and
[1302.5s] the priests uh was done and they agreed
[1305.9s] or they settled on 30 pieces of silver
[1308.9s] for Jesus to be betrayed. The book of
[1312.3s] John 13 27 still it insists or
[1317.2s] emphasizes that Satan was in in Judas as
[1321.5s] he was doing all these things. And so 26
[1325.2s] of Matthew to 27 tells us the entire
[1329.0s] story of what happened with Judas is
[1333.4s] scalot. My Bible tells me that after
[1337.1s] some time Judas started rebelling
[1340.9s] seriously uh to Jesus and his team
[1344.8s] because he felt that now it was about
[1347.8s] time not to work with Jesus again.
[1351.0s] Spirit of prophecy told me that Judas
[1354.7s] thought that interacting with Jesus,
[1357.6s] being part of the being part of the
[1359.6s] disciples, he was most likely to have a
[1363.0s] higher position in the kingdom of Jesus
[1365.8s] when Jesus could form one. So he was
[1368.6s] interested in Jesus shaping him, giving
[1371.6s] him a character that could fit in his
[1374.4s] kingdom when he established one. But he
[1377.6s] waited for long and they thought that
[1380.1s] Jesus was not serious about it and so he
[1383.8s] decided to betray him. Now allow me
[1387.4s] again be a bit fair to Judas. You know
[1391.4s] Judas knew that Jesus was able to do
[1394.2s] certain miracles. You remember there's a
[1396.9s] time that Jesus spoke ill of the priests
[1399.9s] in the in the temple. And so they
[1402.4s] decided that this day they were going to
[1404.6s] show him to teach him a lesson. So they
[1407.3s] picked him and took him somewhere so
[1409.6s] that they can drop him down the valley
[1412.2s] and Jesus could die. They walked him all
[1415.2s] the way. Judas was there. The other
[1417.8s] disciples were there and all the
[1420.2s] congregation was with them because they
[1422.6s] thought it is enough. Jesus is now
[1425.0s] becoming too much and so they wanted to
[1427.4s] get rid of him. And the Bible says a
[1430.1s] common verse that so many of us read and
[1432.8s] is even used by politicians out there
[1435.4s] that when they took him and ready to
[1438.2s] throw him down, they were all confused
[1441.1s] and Jesus walked away from them. They
[1443.7s] did not notice him until when he
[1445.9s] disappeared is when they wondered what
[1448.3s] they were doing there and Jesus was not
[1450.7s] among them. All these things uh Judas
[1453.8s] experienced. So he knew even if he did
[1456.7s] what he was able to do, they could not
[1459.1s] be able to arrest Jesus and kill him the
[1461.3s] way they had planned only to find when
[1464.0s] you read through chapter 26 only to find
[1467.0s] that Jesus has been arrested and he's
[1470.0s] been taken through the authority and is
[1472.3s] now ready to be crucified. Judas was not
[1475.4s] at peace. Judas was remorseful. That is
[1478.2s] what the Bible says. And so uh he
[1481.4s] decided to go away. The book of Matthew
[1485.9s] 27:3, the Bible says that after Judas
[1490.0s] discovered that uh it has not worked
[1492.6s] with him the way he intended, so he went
[1495.3s] back to the priests and threw the money
[1497.9s] that he was given, the silver that he
[1499.9s] was given to the priests and went his
[1502.4s] way. And verse 5 of 27 says, Judas went
[1507.4s] and hanged himself. And so Judas died.
[1513.2s] The Bible tells me
[1515.2s] this that at that time when Judas left
[1519.9s] and hanged
[1521.2s] himself, the entire group of the
[1524.2s] disciples
[1525.8s] uh were so sad about what Judas did to
[1530.6s] himself. I want to believe
[1533.2s] this that uh Judas had an opportunity to
[1537.6s] live again.
[1539.2s] Judas had an opportunity to see the
[1542.6s] eternal life. Judas had an opportunity
[1545.7s] to be in heaven when Jesus come again.
[1549.2s] But he made one mistake. And the mistake
[1552.0s] was to walk away from Christ who was the
[1556.8s] giver of life who was God on earth who
[1560.9s] was everything that Judas needed simply
[1564.2s] because of a simple and a kind and a
[1567.3s] friendly rebuke that came from Jesus
[1570.5s] because of what he was doing. Friends,
[1573.2s] sometimes in this church, in wherever we
[1575.9s] live, there are times we choose to walk
[1578.7s] away from salvation just because of a
[1582.2s] rebuke that has come from pastors that
[1585.0s] has come from leaders that has come from
[1587.6s] the from the members around who wish us
[1590.5s] well and we choose to walk away and say
[1593.4s] we've left this church for them. Where
[1595.7s] we are going, we know it. Now I thought
[1599.0s] the death of Judas could take away even
[1601.5s] the spirit of Judas. But I can tell you
[1604.2s] this morning that the spirit of Judas
[1606.9s] exists amongst us even today. And you
[1609.9s] can be able to see it in so many of us.
[1612.4s] Sometimes you may not know that. But
[1614.9s] there are times that the spirit of Judas
[1617.3s] can be manifested in us and we do not
[1620.0s] know. Now Judas walked away and he yned
[1623.6s] himself and that was the end of the
[1625.8s] story. And after that Judas died a very
[1630.6s] very painful death. I've never read
[1634.0s] anywhere that it was prophesied or it
[1637.2s] was said that whoever could betray Jesus
[1640.6s] was to die and lose eternity. However,
[1643.8s] it was prophesied that Jesus at some
[1646.4s] point was to be betrayed and hanged and
[1649.1s] die and crucified and die. But whoever
[1652.6s] was to do this was not uh sentenced to
[1655.9s] death. And so Judas, if Judas went to
[1659.5s] Jesus like what Simon Peter did and
[1662.5s] repent to Jesus and say, "I have done
[1665.2s] this not because I wished to, but I was
[1668.2s] moved by some desires and I'm sorry for
[1671.3s] what I did." probably I feel and I'm
[1674.5s] convinced in myself that Judas would
[1677.4s] have been forgiven that Jesus would have
[1679.7s] given him a spirit of endurance as he
[1682.6s] watched Jesus die but at the end of the
[1685.1s] day Judas would have received or would
[1687.4s] have gotten eternal life but walking
[1690.1s] away from Christ and hanging himself
[1693.0s] denied him uh the eternal
[1695.6s] life. I have seen people walk away from
[1698.8s] church because of rebukes because people
[1701.2s] have mentioned them h for some reasons
[1705.4s] and they lose their lives. People walk
[1708.2s] away from simple rebukes and when they
[1710.8s] go out there the devil is waiting for
[1713.3s] them takes them into drinking takes them
[1716.2s] into women and men and then they do all
[1719.3s] sorts of things out there and by the
[1721.8s] time they know it they are not there.
[1723.8s] They have lost their lives and they
[1726.0s] don't have even the eternal life again.
[1729.0s] Friends, we can be in this church. We
[1731.4s] can be here every other Sabbath doing so
[1734.3s] many things here. But inside us, we have
[1737.4s] the spirit of Judas that is moving us
[1739.9s] around. We are doing things contrary to
[1742.2s] the will of God. Just because we can
[1744.5s] raise money to do things around here,
[1746.7s] just because we can sing so nicely, just
[1749.4s] because we can preach so well, but still
[1751.8s] the spirit of Judas is in ourselves, we
[1754.9s] are likely to get the direction that
[1756.6s] Judas went. How I pray and wish that
[1760.2s] even as we are here, we try and make
[1762.7s] sure that we don't do that which Judas
[1765.4s] did that would deny us eternity when
[1768.6s] Jesus come again.
[1771.0s] I have seen people even going to confess
[1774.5s] before wrong people and finally they
[1777.5s] don't get the help that they needed.
[1780.3s] Allow me allow me say a few things here
[1783.2s] in
[1784.0s] conclusion.
[1785.6s] One sometimes mind who you get closer to
[1791.4s] or who you choose to keep company.
[1794.2s] Judas, a friend of Jesus, the disciple
[1797.4s] of Jesus, chose to keep company with the
[1800.7s] enemies of Jesus. People who never
[1803.3s] wished well with Jesus. And so whatever
[1805.9s] they told him to do was against the will
[1808.4s] of God, was against Jesus, uh, not
[1811.4s] knowing that they were pulling him away
[1813.8s] from Christ, who was life by himself to
[1817.7s] Judas. Sometimes our close friends can
[1820.6s] lead us away from Christ. Sometimes the
[1823.3s] closest friends that we have within
[1825.3s] ourselves are the people who are leading
[1827.8s] us to do wrong things, who are leading
[1829.8s] us to go away from Christ and before we
[1832.4s] know it, we are not
[1836.0s] there. Uh I worked with the university
[1839.4s] for some time and
[1843.2s] uh I chose myself to be the chaplain and
[1847.2s] patron for the SDS because he was not
[1849.4s] there. And so I interacted with our
[1851.8s] students every other time even in class
[1854.3s] and wherever and they could find time to
[1856.8s] come to my office and share with me
[1859.0s] their experiences. Among the serious
[1861.9s] experiences they shared with me were the
[1864.4s] interaction and the relationship they
[1866.2s] met which are common in universities but
[1868.8s] took them away from the faith that they
[1871.1s] confessed the faith that was put in them
[1873.6s] by their parents from the village. And
[1876.0s] so they came regretting and remorseful
[1878.7s] for what had happened to them. And I was
[1881.0s] able to tell them it is not all lost.
[1884.2s] Sometimes some of them wanted to
[1885.8s] interact with their parents and confess
[1888.2s] whatever they did that was wrong and
[1890.4s] tell them how much they have
[1891.8s] disappointed them by not being good
[1894.1s] Christians again. The Christians who
[1896.3s] they were from home but again they were
[1898.5s] not able and I did that for them. Now
[1901.8s] our friends can be able to lead us away
[1904.3s] from Christ. Regrettably, even our wives
[1907.2s] and husbands, sometimes you are so
[1909.5s] committed, you want to do the will of
[1911.5s] God, and this man is around here pulling
[1914.2s] you here and there, telling you to do
[1916.4s] things that are not in line with what
[1918.5s] you believe. And because he's your
[1920.2s] husband, you must obey anyway. And
[1922.6s] before you know it, you start leaving
[1924.6s] coming to church or you'll come to
[1926.6s] church at 11:00. Tomorrow you are here
[1929.0s] at noon and the other day you are not
[1931.1s] there simply because you have chosen to
[1934.2s] do what he tells you. Sometimes our
[1938.0s] wives as well can lead us away. Our
[1940.3s] children, our parents, our closest
[1942.6s] friends can do this. So let's be mindful
[1945.4s] of the people that we keep company with.
[1948.2s] And if you know you are here to be to
[1950.7s] keep somebody company and lead him away
[1953.1s] from Christ, the Bible says is better
[1956.5s] that a heavy a heavy stone is is tied
[1960.5s] around your neck and you are thrown into
[1963.4s] the Pacific Ocean and you are not there
[1966.9s] to do many of these things that you are
[1968.8s] planning to do.
[1972.1s] Number
[1973.3s] two, do not judge people by where they
[1977.8s] come
[1979.1s] from. I want to mean this. Judas and
[1983.7s] Jesus came from Bethlehem. Sorry, from
[1988.4s] Judea. And uh Bethlehem and Kerot were
[1992.7s] towns within Judea. And so they knew
[1996.2s] each other. Judas knew exactly where uh
[2001.0s] where Jesus came from. And so he was
[2003.3s] able to judge him by who he was, by
[2006.2s] where he came from. And so he could not
[2008.7s] take serious some of the things that
[2010.8s] Jesus told him because he knew anyway
[2013.3s] this is a son of a carpenter. This is a
[2015.4s] man who came from that village where
[2017.8s] they are not even well off like us. And
[2020.3s] so I am only waiting for him to
[2022.5s] establish his kingdom. And he gives me
[2025.0s] uh some position there. and I'm good to
[2027.5s] go. Where we come from does not does not
[2031.8s] define who we can
[2034.1s] be. You know, uh I have a problem with
[2038.7s] my fellow Kissy men around for some
[2041.7s] reasons.
[2043.2s] I come from uh one of the unique uh
[2046.1s] clans in KCI and uh when when you
[2049.8s] interact with uh these men around here
[2052.0s] or even women there's a question that
[2054.4s] they ask that I've tried to avoid but
[2056.4s] again I can't avoid because of some
[2058.2s] reason especially now that I'm here now
[2061.2s] the first this question is where do you
[2063.3s] come from and you say I come from such
[2065.8s] and such a place I come from this clan
[2068.4s] and they are quick to tell you the
[2070.4s] character that is found in this clan
[2073.7s] H I come from a place called Samaria.
[2076.8s] You know apart from the Samaria that we
[2078.6s] read in the Bible, there's Samaria in
[2080.9s] Ki. But because they did not how to
[2083.1s] mention Samaria, they mentioned Bamaro.
[2086.6s] And uh now you know it's Samaria and I a
[2090.8s] Samaritan. Somebody told me that my my
[2093.2s] my senior pastor is also a Samaritan. I
[2095.6s] am yet to confirm. And we are known by a
[2098.6s] unique a unique uh a unique character.
[2102.1s] And the unique character here is uh that
[2105.0s] we are known to be eating a lot of ugali
[2107.2s] which is not very true. So anything that
[2110.0s] is not uggali is not food. And sometimes
[2114.2s] uh I I I I have tried to question this a
[2117.3s] lot and Samaritans who are here can be
[2119.5s] able to help me understand this. And so
[2122.2s] when people see you around I'm sure from
[2124.5s] here people start looking at me like
[2126.7s] that guy who eats a lot. I don't eat a
[2129.0s] lot. I just eat enough.
[2131.7s] This is likely to uh to create even
[2133.9s] problems to me and if my senior pastor
[2136.1s] is from the other side as well. We are
[2138.4s] going to have hard times in this church
[2140.8s] especially when we come to your homes
[2142.4s] for prayers. When we come to your
[2144.4s] offices, when you see us, you get
[2146.4s] stressed because you see people eat. We
[2149.5s] don't do that. Now when you start
[2152.3s] judging us by where we come from, then
[2155.0s] you are missing the mark. We'll be
[2157.0s] struggling hammering points here. things
[2159.6s] that are supposed to lead you into
[2161.0s] salvation but all you are seeing is
[2163.6s] somebody from Samaria these days people
[2166.2s] called me a pastor from prison some
[2168.2s] people in here that is fine but you are
[2171.6s] able to see something beyond prison in
[2173.8s] me that God has brought me here together
[2176.2s] with my colleagues so that we can lead
[2178.3s] you to heaven not to prison those who
[2180.9s] lead you to prison are there so if you
[2183.2s] have this spirit of Judas like it was in
[2185.5s] him before the only thing you can see in
[2188.1s] somebody is where he comes from and you
[2191.0s] choose to judge him by that and you miss
[2193.4s] the blessings that come from this
[2195.3s] person. Praise the name of
[2197.9s] God. You have judged people for some
[2200.5s] reason for where they come from wrongly.
[2203.2s] And finally, you miss certain things
[2204.9s] that they have for you. It is important
[2208.0s] to note this that where we come from, I
[2210.8s] repeat again, does not define what uh
[2214.8s] this person can be. And so spare us
[2218.6s] where we come from. Listen to what God
[2221.2s] has sent us to do to to tell you here.
[2223.9s] And I'm here to tell you that you can be
[2226.5s] too close but still far away from
[2229.8s] salvation. And that is the point here.
[2232.6s] So if you start judging us by where we
[2235.4s] come from, we'll stay here the longer we
[2237.8s] stay here. And we are not in hurry. By
[2239.6s] the way, we are here as long as we are
[2241.8s] here. And so you will not get the
[2244.0s] blessings that we have for you until
[2246.3s] when we leave this place. And when we
[2248.3s] leave here, we don't
[2252.1s] know. Number three, listen to warnings
[2255.0s] and take rebukes
[2258.2s] positively.
[2260.4s] Sometimes when somebody wants you, this
[2263.9s] is a good friend to you. When somebody
[2266.4s] rebukes you, this person means well for
[2269.3s] you. And so take these things seriously.
[2272.3s] Take it positively. There are people
[2274.0s] sometimes when you warn him, he start
[2276.2s] telling you who told you this, let me
[2278.4s] know him. I can go to court. I mean all
[2280.6s] these things they don't mean anything.
[2283.0s] And when you hear somebody mentioning
[2284.8s] going to court, this person is guilty of
[2287.0s] what you are telling him. So tell him
[2289.0s] calm down. Listen to what I'm telling
[2291.1s] you. This is for your good court. We can
[2293.8s] go no problem. But the point is this is
[2296.9s] wrong. If that is what you do, this is
[2299.3s] going to help you. Walking away from
[2301.5s] Christ, walking away from these rebukes,
[2304.4s] walking away from this uh these
[2306.4s] warnings, it is not going to help you,
[2308.9s] but rather it is going to lead you
[2311.4s] astray. Sometimes you sit somewhere and
[2315.1s] you listen to people drinking out there
[2317.9s] and they are busy singing songs that
[2320.1s] they used to sing in church when they
[2322.0s] walked away from church simply because
[2324.3s] somebody rebuked them simply because
[2326.6s] somebody warned them. Then you hear
[2329.0s] songs like my heart can sing when I post
[2331.8s] to remember and somebody so drunk and
[2333.8s] then you wonder why can't you remember
[2336.2s] this and go back to where you came from.
[2338.8s] And when you hear somebody start singing
[2340.7s] the songs that he used to sing in
[2342.7s] church, give him a few days, he will not
[2345.0s] be there. The devil is preparing him for
[2347.4s] grave and before you know it, he is not
[2349.8s] there. May God help us that we don't uh
[2353.3s] take these things for granted and choose
[2356.8s] uh to listen and take them serious. I'm
[2360.1s] almost finishing. I know there are
[2361.8s] people here who are not getting happy
[2363.4s] with me. And uh the next thing is Judas
[2367.6s] must have chosen uh uh Judas must have
[2372.6s] chosen to be the disciple of Jesus for
[2376.2s] wrong reasons. Wrong reasons were that
[2379.5s] he knew that being with Jesus he was
[2382.3s] able to get this position that he was
[2384.2s] looking for and the rest were not of of
[2387.4s] importance to him. You know sometimes we
[2390.8s] may be in this church because of some
[2393.6s] wrong reasons. Maybe you heard people
[2396.2s] talk about New Life SDA church fifth
[2399.0s] gong avenue and I wonder why we don't
[2401.3s] say fourth gong avenue and fourth gong
[2403.1s] avenue is just here. Now you are like
[2406.3s] that's a church that I'm supposed to
[2408.0s] belong to and when you come in here you
[2410.8s] are not part part of this group because
[2412.8s] you have come here for your own uh wrong
[2416.0s] reasons. Some of the wrong reasons are
[2418.3s] that I've seen in so many churches like
[2420.6s] there are people for example we are soon
[2423.5s] building another church not this one and
[2426.9s] uh Eldo calls it a cathedral there's a
[2429.4s] way he pronounce it and you feel like uh
[2432.0s] it's it's just a mini a mini white house
[2435.7s] that we are planning to build here now
[2438.8s] we are intending to do this and there
[2440.9s] are people who know exactly what they
[2442.6s] want out of this place when we about to
[2445.1s] get there they will start positioning
[2447.3s] themselves somewhere so that they can
[2449.4s] get to some influential positions where
[2452.2s] they can be able to make money out of
[2454.0s] these projects and get away with this
[2456.2s] thing and they don't care what happens
[2458.6s] next. There was a church somewhere where
[2461.2s] they started building a good church like
[2463.2s] uh the one that we are planning to do in
[2465.3s] future. I think pastor told me we are
[2467.4s] starting this thing in December and uh
[2470.9s] now my funds were raised and now they
[2474.0s] were able and ready to do this and
[2476.2s] somebody went to a company somewhere and
[2478.4s] picked an invoice a stamped invoice and
[2481.0s] allocated himself some 40 million to be
[2484.2s] I mean for things that were never
[2486.0s] supplied and within that period the
[2488.8s] pastor who was in this church was
[2490.5s] transferred and when the new pastor came
[2492.8s] in went through the the development
[2495.4s] committee a file and picked on an
[2498.1s] invoice and went to this company and
[2500.6s] asked them that uh you supplied
[2503.6s] something to the church and you are
[2505.4s] waiting to be paid 40 millions and so
[2508.2s] the manager was like uh we don't supply
[2511.0s] these things in the first place. Uh I
[2513.8s] don't know who who supplied them and and
[2516.7s] such like questions. So he left the
[2519.2s] office with a pastor and went to the
[2522.3s] accounts and asked them who supplied
[2525.2s] this to the church and then people
[2528.4s] started looking at each other because
[2530.2s] they knew exactly there was nothing that
[2532.6s] was supplied but somebody was waiting
[2534.7s] for 40 million to be paid to his account
[2537.5s] now through this company. And so
[2540.8s] somebody from the middle of this
[2543.1s] accountants went and told uh the manager
[2546.1s] that I hope my revelation is not is not
[2548.6s] going to cost me my to cost me my job.
[2551.0s] And he said so and so a member of this
[2554.5s] church uh came to us and said and asked
[2557.8s] for an invoice that is stamped and not
[2560.7s] written anything for him to make money
[2563.0s] from somewhere. And so this is the kind
[2565.0s] of this is the invoice that you have.
[2567.0s] and pastor was stressed and left this
[2569.0s] place came and called the development
[2571.4s] committee and told them that we are not
[2573.9s] going to continue from here until
[2576.2s] further notice and the rest was history.
[2578.6s] Now people know how to make money if
[2581.3s] from even from where they are not
[2583.4s] supposed to make money. And you'll be
[2585.1s] surprised if we will be here long enough
[2587.6s] to see this. You'll tell me that this is
[2590.2s] true. They are not waiting. Some of them
[2592.6s] don't even give even offerings or any
[2594.9s] other thing here. But they are quick to
[2596.9s] know who to influence where so that they
[2599.5s] can get to those positions. Sometimes if
[2601.8s] they can be able to put to pocket the
[2603.8s] pastors and I'm telling you we are the
[2605.7s] wrong number. uh so that they can be
[2607.7s] able to influence a few decisions here
[2610.0s] so that at the end of the day they get
[2612.4s] away with money that has been uh that
[2615.2s] has been given by members to build a
[2617.5s] church for God and finally you realize
[2620.9s] that uh they have done it they are here
[2623.8s] for wrong reasons are you here for the
[2626.2s] right reason now some of us could be
[2629.0s] here because they feel when I die I'll
[2632.6s] be given a a befitting send
[2636.3s] a decent burial. And I've never
[2638.3s] understood why people are bothered about
[2641.0s] a decent burial. In my view, when you
[2644.1s] are dead, you are dead. You don't know
[2646.5s] anything. Even if they buried you in a
[2649.6s] even if they just left you by the
[2651.4s] roadside to be eaten by wild animals,
[2653.7s] that is none of your business. You are
[2655.4s] not there. But people are stressed by
[2657.5s] this so-called uh uh decent burial which
[2662.1s] even costs up to 10 millions for reasons
[2665.0s] that are not there. Now you are here
[2667.5s] because you feel that you have a company
[2670.4s] that will give you a decent barrier
[2672.6s] whether you are here or not when you die
[2675.8s] you'll be buried anyway. Now if you are
[2678.2s] here you feel that that is what you are
[2680.0s] waiting for sometimes it may not be
[2682.4s] possible just be here worship God uh
[2686.0s] repent your sins prepare yourself for
[2688.3s] heaven and all the rest will come at its
[2691.5s] own time praise the name of God if you
[2694.2s] feel that you are here because of
[2695.7s] certain interest I want to assure you
[2698.2s] this morning rather afternoon that uh
[2701.4s] you may not get it now you'll get to
[2704.3s] notice that the spirit of Judas is
[2706.6s] around you and rebuke it as long as uh
[2711.1s] you have not gone where uh Judas went.
[2716.0s] Now, finally, I want to say this that at
[2719.3s] some point you need somebody to follow
[2721.9s] up on you. I was looking for the right
[2724.0s] English word. I could not find one and I
[2726.3s] came up with mine and said you need a
[2729.0s] spiritual. A spiritual is something that
[2731.9s] will remind you that the direction that
[2734.1s] you are going spiritually is wrong. You
[2736.6s] need somebody who can be able to tell
[2738.6s] you now the way we are seeing you is not
[2740.9s] the way you are supposed to be. When we
[2743.0s] came here, my senior pastor and my other
[2745.8s] colleagues sat down and told ourselves
[2748.3s] that we are here as a brother's keepers.
[2751.1s] When you see me going the wrong
[2752.6s] direction, please call me back. Tell me
[2755.0s] this is wrong. That way we can be able
[2757.3s] to support each other and we will be
[2759.4s] able to support you people as well. Now
[2762.6s] again the last uh the church board that
[2764.6s] I attended here uh after the after the
[2767.3s] board uh our senior pastor and I and
[2769.5s] others met somewhere with the pastoral
[2772.2s] meeting and my senior pastor was quick
[2774.9s] to remind them again that we are here
[2777.6s] that you can also tell us where we don't
[2779.7s] do things right. You are our brother's
[2782.1s] keepers that if you don't tell us where
[2784.7s] things are wrong as elders in the
[2786.4s] pastoral council and things go wrong
[2788.7s] we'll blame you. So as pastors in this
[2791.5s] church at least we have a team of people
[2794.0s] who can be able to come any time around
[2796.1s] us and tell us look this is not the way
[2798.5s] we are supposed to go this is not the
[2800.6s] way we are supposed to do things and we
[2802.7s] quickly retreat and sit back and say
[2804.7s] it's true what they are saying is not
[2806.3s] right let's do the right thing and that
[2808.8s] is the right way to go even you as a
[2811.3s] member you need to have somebody who can
[2814.0s] be able to tell you that this is what
[2815.5s] you are supposed to do and when he tells
[2817.4s] you this like what Jesus used to tell
[2819.8s] Judas then appreciate this and try to
[2822.8s] check around yourself and get uh you
[2825.7s] fixed for the right thing. That way you
[2828.2s] will make it. But if we don't have this,
[2830.5s] we will not know when we are right. We
[2832.5s] will not know when we are wrong. At the
[2834.4s] end of the day, the spirit of Judas in
[2836.4s] us will be too much on us and before we
[2838.8s] know it, we are dead and we miss eternal
[2840.9s] life. How I pray that even as we are
[2844.0s] here, we are here committed to serve
[2846.3s] you. We are here committed to be your
[2848.6s] spiritual matter. By the way, we see you
[2851.0s] doing what is not right. Uh trust me, we
[2853.6s] will tell you. We'll call you somewhere
[2856.0s] and tell you so and so what you are
[2858.2s] doing is not right. We better go this
[2860.6s] way. I have a team from New Life that
[2863.8s] works with me in prison who have not
[2866.0s] given me peace. But I love what they do.
[2869.0s] Anytime they send something wrong, uh
[2871.2s] they will come and tell me, "Pastor, we
[2872.9s] are not going to live like this." And so
[2874.7s] I'm quiet to listen to them and know how
[2877.1s] they want us to live. After listening to
[2879.3s] them, I'm able to get the point and then
[2881.6s] we start walking together and do that
[2883.9s] which is right. That is what is expected
[2886.1s] of all of us. And when we get it that
[2888.5s] way, we will get it right. Finally,
[2892.4s] humility is key to every believer, to
[2896.1s] every Christian and to all of us.
[2898.3s] Because humility will be able to take us
[2901.0s] closer to Christ, will be able to give
[2903.0s] us to be humble before Christ and take
[2905.4s] his instructions right and take his
[2907.6s] warnings correctly and have him bless us
[2910.3s] and have him prepare us for eternity.
[2913.1s] Judas missed a very important uh a very
[2916.3s] important part of his life that was in
[2918.4s] Christ that uh he could not get again. I
[2922.0s] want to pray for all of us and to all of
[2924.1s] us this way that may God help us, may
[2927.1s] God bless us as we try and check around
[2930.2s] ourselves and see to it that we do not
[2933.1s] miss this. We do not go walk away from
[2935.9s] Christ that we are too close to Christ
[2938.9s] but we miss eternal life but rather
[2941.8s] let's be too close to this and and still
[2945.1s] get this salvation that has prepared for
[2947.9s] all of us. And that way we'll rejoice in
[2950.8s] heaven when Jesus come as we sing
[2953.1s] hallelujah hosana because we have made
[2955.7s] it. May God bless us all in Jesus name.
[2958.2s] Amen. Amen.
