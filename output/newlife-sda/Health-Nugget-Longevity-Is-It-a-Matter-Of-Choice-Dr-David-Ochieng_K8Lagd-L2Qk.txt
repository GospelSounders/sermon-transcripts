FULL TRANSCRIPT:
[Music] Happy Sabbath. God is good and all the time. Okay. I'm Dr. David Owatch. I'll be taking you through the health nugget today and my presentation is entitled lifespan. Is it a matter of choice? Lifespan, is it a matter of choice? If you look at the book of the third letter of John, chapter 1 and verse two, the Bible says, "Dear friend, I pray that you may enjoy good health and that all may go well with you even as your soul is getting along well." If you look at uh the second text, 1 Thessalonians chapter 5 and verse 23, the Bible says, "Now may the God of peace himself sanctify you completely and may your whole body, may your whole spirit, soul, and body be presented blameless at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ." From those two texts, it is clear that God wants us to be preserved in all aspects of our lives. God is interested in our spiritual lives. He's interested in how we are taking care of our bodies and our minds as well. The Bible has a lot to say about our health. And uh we need to go back to the health message. Modern medicine has increased life expectancy over the past 100 years, the past century. Globally the life expectancy has uh more than doubled. I'll request that we put up the presentation. When you look at the trends over the last 100 years, there's been an increase in our the in our life expectancy. However, this has not been accompanied by an equivalent increase in what we call healthy life expectancy. In other words, people are living longer, but they're not necessarily living they're not healthier. Okay? So, we have uh lifespan. I'm using the term lifespan or longevity. This is the total number of years we live. But I will introduce another term health span which refers to how many of those years we live uh remain healthy we remain healthy and free from disease. So if you look at um a slide don't know if it is up if you can go to slide number four looking at the trends the global trends of life expectancy kindly go back to slide number four uh life expectancy globally you will see that the trends have been increasing from 1770 up to around 19 up around uh uh 1900 100 life expectancy took a turn in all the continents. That was a time when uh modern medicine there were advancements in uh modern medicine and um all over the world life expectancy changed. Looking at the trends in Kenya, our current life expectancy, males on average are living to uh 63.7 years, females around 68.4 years. All over the world, life expectancy has improved. But looking at the global picture, could you go to the next slide please? Looking at the global picture, there is some variation across the continents. There are those areas that we refer to as the blue zones where people are living longer. The number of people who are living to a 100red years is very high. The blue zones you can see there the Americas, Canada, part of Europe and in Australia. Next slide. There are some 15 countries that life expectancy is very high. I will not dwell on that. Just want to let us know that whereas longevity or lifespan has increased over the years, this has brought about chronic diseases and what we call disuse syndromes. People are living longer but there are uh um the quality of life is lowered. Yeah. With the extended uh um life people have a lot of cognitive they have cognitive decline. They have a lot of fragility syndromes, fractures, lots of stroke as they live longer, lots of uh degenerative disorders. Now the question is, yeah, what does the Bible have to say about this? How can we bridge the gap between lifespan and health span? If you look at the book of Proverbs chapter 3 and verse 8, the Bible gives some guidance on what would bring us more uh better life. Yeah. Proverbs 4 20 and 22 and also the book of Exodus 15 and verse 26. The eight laws of life of health that we talk about you know nutrition, exercise, water, sunshine, temperance, air, rest and trust in God. What we refer to as new start. They bridge the gap between um longevity and health span. So there are several studies that have shown that what we eat may be the one of the most important lifestyle modifications any one of us can make to significantly increase our health span and add quality of years uh add quality years of enjoyable life as we age. The blue zones which we all know have a lot that we can learn from. Let me um I think you need to take note of this that some people think people live longer because of their genetic constitution but studies have shown that genes are only 20% of the picture. Yeah. Um there is a question that some scientists sought to answer. Is the exceptional longevity in the blue zones the blue zone populations hereditary? And there is some publication that was made by some scientists in a paper published in 1996 entitled the heritability of human longevity a population-based study that was done in Denmark. They found out that um whereas we may have they found out that we may have some incredible power to control our health and prevent some chronic diseases which have a bearing on our longevity. So demographers have shown that um there is some study that I could also mention here uh done on human genetics entitled mechanisms of aging and development. Yeah. And they found out that what we call calorie restriction without malnutrition is currently the most effective non-genetic intervention to delay aging phenotypes. So as I as I wrap up because of time, there are some things that have been that we can learn from the blue zone populations. So many studies have been carried on those populations and they found out that more than 90% of those in the blue zone populations are on a plant-based diet. Their emphasis is on a wide variety of seasonal vegetables, fruits, and whole grains. Their daily they they they consume lots of legumes. Their use of meat is only they use meat only sparingly and they avoid processed foods. Water is their beverage of choice. Our diet studies have shown is a major contributor to our what we call longevity quotient. In fact our nutrition contributes about 15 to 25% of our longevity quotient. How much um we live depends to a large extent on what we eat, what you put in your tables. Want to recommend to us to go back to the original diet of man which we read about in Genesis 1 and verse 29 also in Genesis 2:8. It is good for us to note that when you look at the adenic diet, it was purely vegetarian. Edenic diet Genesis 1 28 29 talks about grains, nuts, fruits and seeds. Take note in Genesis 1:30 that God modified the diet of man after sin to introduce vegetables. Vegetables, green leafy vegetables, herbs and all those other things were introduced after the fall of man because man was going to fall sick. So the vegetables are to be taken for our healing. It's good for us to take note of that. There is a study uh I would just like to refer us to the Adventist mortality study that ran for several years from 1958. A number of things are to be learned from that uh uh study which where we had a cohort of 22,940 California-based Adventists. The prevalence of cancer in that population was among the non-Adventists was 79% lower. Yeah, across a number of cancers. The question that I would like to ask is um what is it about our Adventist lifestyle that that enables Adventist to live longer? We need to go back to Adventist lifestyle. The next the last bit as I wind up there is a study that some of you may want to look at entitled 10 years of life. Is it a matter of choice? Published in 2001 looking at the Adventist lifestyle and how that makes people live healthier and how that how it makes us live longer. There are so many studies. If I had time, I would talk about diet and mortality. I'll talk about diet and uh chronic diseases. I want to recommend to us uh the Adventist lifestyle. Let us look at our nutrition. They talk about Mediterranean diet and all those things. Let us look at what we put on our tables that will determine the quality of life that we live and have a bearing on how long we live. Our longevity is it a matter of choice. The decision is yours. I'll stop there in the interest of time. May God bless you.

TIMESTAMPED TRANSCRIPT:
[0.3s] [Music]
[12.0s] Happy Sabbath.
[14.2s] God is good and all the time.
[18.9s] Okay. I'm Dr. David Owatch. I'll be
[21.8s] taking you through the health nugget
[23.5s] today and my presentation is entitled
[27.4s] lifespan. Is it a matter of choice?
[31.1s] Lifespan, is it a matter of choice?
[35.2s] If you look at the book of the third
[37.3s] letter of John, chapter 1 and verse two,
[40.9s] the Bible says, "Dear friend, I pray
[43.4s] that you may enjoy good health and that
[46.2s] all may go well with you even as your
[48.8s] soul is getting along well."
[51.1s] If you look at uh the second text, 1
[54.0s] Thessalonians chapter 5 and verse 23,
[56.2s] the Bible says, "Now may the God of
[59.2s] peace himself sanctify you completely
[62.4s] and may your whole body, may your whole
[65.1s] spirit, soul, and body be presented
[67.6s] blameless at the coming of our Lord
[70.1s] Jesus Christ." From those two texts, it
[73.4s] is clear that God wants us to be
[76.3s] preserved in all aspects of our lives.
[79.4s] God is interested in our spiritual
[81.6s] lives. He's interested in how we are
[84.9s] taking care of our bodies and our minds
[87.2s] as well.
[89.1s] The Bible has a lot to say about our
[91.3s] health. And uh we need to go back to the
[95.1s] health message.
[97.1s] Modern medicine has increased life
[100.2s] expectancy over the past 100 years, the
[104.0s] past century. Globally the life
[108.4s] expectancy has uh more than doubled.
[111.9s] I'll request that we put up the
[114.4s] presentation.
[116.6s] When you look at the trends over the
[119.0s] last 100 years,
[121.4s] there's been an increase in our the in
[125.1s] our life expectancy. However, this has
[128.9s] not been accompanied by an equivalent
[131.5s] increase in what we call healthy life
[134.6s] expectancy. In other words, people are
[136.9s] living longer, but they're not
[138.5s] necessarily living they're not
[140.8s] healthier. Okay? So, we have uh
[145.5s] lifespan. I'm using the term lifespan or
[147.8s] longevity.
[149.4s] This is the total number of years we
[151.0s] live. But I will introduce another term
[153.3s] health span which refers to how many of
[156.1s] those years we live uh remain healthy we
[159.2s] remain healthy and free from disease. So
[162.2s] if you look at um a slide don't know if
[165.3s] it is up if you can go to slide number
[168.6s] four
[170.5s] looking at the trends the global trends
[172.7s] of life expectancy kindly go back to
[175.4s] slide number four
[177.8s] uh life expectancy globally you will see
[180.9s] that the trends have been increasing
[183.7s] from 1770
[186.6s] up to around 19 up around uh uh 1900 100
[191.8s] life expectancy took a turn in all the
[195.3s] continents. That was a time when uh
[199.4s] modern medicine there were advancements
[201.6s] in uh modern medicine and um all over
[206.6s] the world life expectancy changed.
[209.2s] Looking at the trends in Kenya, our
[211.6s] current life expectancy, males on
[214.4s] average are living to uh 63.7 years,
[218.2s] females around 68.4 years. All over the
[222.6s] world, life expectancy has improved. But
[226.6s] looking at the global picture, could you
[228.3s] go to the next slide please? Looking at
[230.5s] the global picture, there is some
[233.4s] variation across the continents. There
[235.8s] are those areas that we refer to as the
[238.2s] blue zones where people are living
[241.1s] longer. The number of people who are
[243.1s] living to a 100red years is very high.
[246.2s] The blue zones you can see there the
[247.8s] Americas, Canada, part of Europe and in
[250.6s] Australia. Next slide. There are some 15
[254.2s] countries that life expectancy is very
[257.2s] high. I will not dwell on that. Just
[260.3s] want to let us know that whereas
[263.4s] longevity or lifespan has increased over
[265.7s] the years,
[267.6s] this has brought about chronic diseases
[269.6s] and what we call disuse syndromes.
[272.6s] People are living longer but there are
[275.6s] uh um the quality of life is lowered.
[279.5s] Yeah. With the extended uh um life
[284.1s] people have a lot of cognitive they have
[286.4s] cognitive decline. They have a lot of
[288.2s] fragility syndromes, fractures, lots of
[291.4s] stroke as they live longer, lots of uh
[293.9s] degenerative disorders. Now the question
[297.0s] is, yeah, what does the Bible have to
[301.2s] say about this? How can we bridge the
[303.4s] gap between lifespan and health span? If
[306.6s] you look at the book of Proverbs chapter
[308.2s] 3 and verse 8, the Bible gives some
[311.4s] guidance on what would bring us more uh
[315.1s] better life. Yeah. Proverbs 4 20 and 22
[319.6s] and also the book of Exodus 15 and verse
[322.6s] 26. The eight laws of life of health
[326.2s] that we talk about you know nutrition,
[328.8s] exercise, water, sunshine, temperance,
[332.6s] air, rest and trust in God. What we
[335.3s] refer to as new start. They bridge the
[338.3s] gap between um longevity and health
[342.1s] span. So there are several studies that
[344.6s] have shown that what we eat may be the
[347.8s] one of the most important lifestyle
[349.9s] modifications any one of us can make to
[352.6s] significantly increase our health span
[355.0s] and add quality of years uh add quality
[359.5s] years of enjoyable life as we age. The
[362.7s] blue zones which we all know have a lot
[366.4s] that we can learn from. Let me um I
[370.6s] think you need to take note of this that
[372.8s] some people think people live longer
[374.8s] because of their genetic constitution
[377.7s] but studies have shown that genes are
[379.8s] only 20% of the picture. Yeah. Um
[384.8s] there is a question that some scientists
[386.6s] sought to answer. Is the exceptional
[388.8s] longevity in the blue zones the blue
[391.1s] zone populations hereditary?
[393.8s] And there is some publication that was
[396.3s] made by some scientists in a paper
[400.3s] published in 1996 entitled the
[403.1s] heritability of human longevity a
[405.4s] population-based study that was done in
[407.7s] Denmark. They found out that
[411.3s] um whereas we may have they found out
[415.6s] that we may have some incredible power
[419.4s] to control our health and prevent some
[422.7s] chronic diseases which have a bearing on
[425.5s] our longevity. So demographers have
[429.0s] shown
[431.0s] that um there is some study that I could
[434.2s] also mention here uh done on human
[438.0s] genetics entitled mechanisms of aging
[441.0s] and development. Yeah. And they found
[443.2s] out that what we call calorie
[445.9s] restriction without malnutrition is
[448.7s] currently the most effective non-genetic
[451.4s] intervention to delay aging phenotypes.
[454.5s] So as I as I wrap up because of time,
[460.2s] there are some things that have been
[462.4s] that we can learn from the blue zone
[465.7s] populations.
[467.4s] So many studies have been carried on
[469.0s] those populations and they found out
[470.4s] that more than 90% of those in the blue
[473.3s] zone populations are on a plant-based
[475.5s] diet. Their emphasis is on a wide
[478.4s] variety of seasonal vegetables, fruits,
[480.6s] and whole grains. Their daily they they
[484.3s] they consume lots of legumes. Their use
[488.4s] of meat is only they use meat only
[490.9s] sparingly and they avoid processed
[493.2s] foods. Water is their beverage of
[495.5s] choice.
[497.4s] Our diet studies have shown is a major
[501.4s] contributor to our what we call
[504.0s] longevity quotient. In fact our
[506.5s] nutrition contributes about 15 to 25% of
[509.0s] our longevity quotient. How much um we
[512.9s] live depends to a large extent on what
[515.8s] we eat, what you put in your tables.
[518.2s] Want to recommend to us to go back to
[519.9s] the original diet of man which we read
[522.5s] about in Genesis 1 and verse 29 also in
[525.5s] Genesis 2:8. It is good for us to note
[528.6s] that when you look at the adenic diet,
[531.2s] it was purely vegetarian. Edenic diet
[534.8s] Genesis 1 28 29 talks about grains,
[537.9s] nuts, fruits and seeds. Take note in
[540.3s] Genesis 1:30 that God modified the diet
[544.1s] of man after sin to introduce
[547.4s] vegetables.
[549.3s] Vegetables, green leafy vegetables,
[551.2s] herbs and all those other things were
[553.4s] introduced after the fall of man because
[555.6s] man was going to fall sick. So the
[558.1s] vegetables are to be taken for our
[559.7s] healing. It's good for us to take note
[561.8s] of that. There is a study uh I would
[565.3s] just like to refer us to the Adventist
[568.0s] mortality study that ran for several
[570.2s] years from 1958. A number of things are
[574.0s] to be learned from that uh uh study
[577.4s] which where we had a cohort of 22,940
[581.2s] California-based Adventists.
[583.6s] The prevalence of cancer in that
[585.8s] population was
[588.2s] among the non-Adventists was 79% lower.
[591.7s] Yeah, across a number of cancers. The
[594.5s] question that I would like to ask is
[598.5s] um what is it about our Adventist
[600.6s] lifestyle that that enables Adventist to
[603.4s] live longer? We need to go back to
[605.6s] Adventist lifestyle.
[608.2s] The next the last bit as I wind up
[613.5s] there is a study that some of you may
[615.9s] want to look at entitled 10 years of
[619.5s] life. Is it a matter of choice?
[622.7s] Published in 2001 looking at the
[626.3s] Adventist lifestyle and how that makes
[629.3s] people live healthier and how that how
[632.6s] it makes us live longer. There are so
[634.9s] many studies. If I had time, I would
[636.3s] talk about diet and mortality. I'll talk
[638.6s] about diet and uh chronic diseases. I
[641.8s] want to recommend to us uh the Adventist
[645.5s] lifestyle. Let us look at our nutrition.
[648.6s] They talk about Mediterranean diet and
[650.9s] all those things. Let us look at what we
[653.6s] put on our tables that will determine
[656.8s] the quality of life that we live and
[659.4s] have a bearing on how long we live. Our
[662.4s] longevity
[664.2s] is it a matter of choice. The decision
[668.2s] is yours. I'll stop there in the
[669.9s] interest of time. May God bless you.
