FULL TRANSCRIPT:
[Music] Hallelujah. Church. This is a beautiful Sabbath. When you people are friendly with the weather, as some of us are doing our best to enjoy it as well. I have been to Nairobi so many times but when it's a little bit warm and one day I was caught up at the airport the runway was filled with water so we couldn't fly out of Nairobi and even the airport was soaked as you can hear it in its dictionary form soaked in the airport I mean in water But it was not as cold as today. So I don't mind when you look at me in a cold form. I can understand. But we thank God for giving us this privilege to come and join you on this special and particular Sabbath. I was so moved by the skit of our children, our PS uh department. I would request you to always edit our Sabbath worship and bring out those clips of children presentations and store them on Google Cloud. So that when they are here teasing us as church elders, we can play them and when they want to behave stubbornly to go out of the church, we can always have a homecoming Sabbath for them and they watch themselves when they were here as Joe as David's and uh uh Jesse's and prophet Samuel the anoint winter and so they'll always look at them and remain firm in the Lord. We are so glad to join you, Pastor Macho Mach. Uh this is a beautiful church, New Life Church. Although I haven't really seen New Life in my life. So maybe by evening I'll be new. Where is the family life director of this church? Where are you? Aha. This week is our 11th anniversary with my wife. So make sure by evening I have new life. This is the best way pastors can advertise their problems to good. We bring greetings from Campala Central Church which is the district the mother of the Englishspeaking congregations in Uganda and Bethl is a church in this district. It is a young church uh not beyond two years which seeks to benchmark from New Life Church so that they can go and do God's mission in a better way. So make sure between yesterday, today and tomorrow you behave well so that we can benchmark well and take correct stuff and good stuff. And we also invite you to also come and benchmark with us because as much as is too young two years this is one of the youngest church in the country but doing great stuff. Amen. When you visit us, you will pray in your mother language. Uh so they come here to see how the Lord is using you in all your departments, the development department, treasury, evangelism, stewardship and so they can go back and they can implement. I also have a tour also for benchmarking between 9th to 13th October which we we shall have in Johannesburg. And I think we can also go because you also need benchmarking. You also need benchmarking also. So when I came here I saw many benches which you need to mark. So you better join us my pastor and the elders and the team that we can go to Johannesburg and also we see how God is using those men and women down there. But for now we want to get new life the experience and we begin applying what is applicable at our local church at Bethl. Can I have a team representing Bethl church to raise up all of you including those with poor voices who are not able to come here. All right. That's very good. That's good. The attires you see those are the cultural attires when you cross the other side of M. When you come this site is Ugari and Kumawiki. You know when you come to Kenya the only thing we suffer from is food. This a country of starvation. That's why they had greens as source. Can you imagine greens to become source? Sukuma week. Like you push the week to come to an end. Oh, it's all right. You can rest. You can rest. I know. So weeks in Kenya end by force. You sukuma. All right. Bring greetings from the district pastor who is my good friend pastor Benon Lincoln Chigundu is pastor of KC and also his associate justice Perez. They sent to you greetings in the Lord. I also bring greetings from Bugma University where I serve as a lecturer also in the school of theology and religious studies and uh they send you greetings. It's your university. We have many courses which you can also take. We have one of the newest school of health and sciences that offers courses in the medical world. So you can always have your children and you yourselves come to benefit from them. And we also have the largest theological seminary almost in the whole world because on Africa it is the largest and globally it is almost the largest because we have 1,000 theology students and no seminary competes with us. All seminaries sat, voted and agreed. It was moved and recorded and carried that bugma will always shine in theology. So we have made a course for all church members who have a degree in any area and we are introducing to you a postgraduate diploma in theology. You don't come with your diploma, you come with your degree. medicine, accounting, surveying, law, those other courses which you did without guidance. So we have we have made a course for everyone so that we can empower our church to do God's mission in the best way possible. Amen. When I was coming to new life, I decided to come with my wife. It was intentional to come with my wife so that the family life director can know that this week is our anniversary. So, make sure you do something good in the evening. Have you heard of? So my wife where are you? Ah you know when you make them stand they cook for more 3 years. Very good. Very good. Today I am using something small here as you can see because we have something big behind me here. Hallelujah church. And I don't know how God does he thinks that we unveil this big thing when we are coming to benchmark. So probably we can also benchmark this big thing because Bethl also worships like you. Uh they are still in a temporal structure. Is it better than this one? I was trying to rate this one is somehow better like 2%. So as we benchmark my development director Mr. Kenya who led the team, we may also need to benchmark this stuff. But of course we can't benchmark the cars outside. They are too small for us. Ugandans don't drive those small cars. Tuku, no. You better improve yourselves on that. Come and benchmark. You will see. Vehicles for God's children. These are vehicles for God's people, but they are also vehicles for God's children. Amen. Now, don't be annoyed. I am just a a preacher of the day. So let me pray so that you can forgive me. Shall we pray? Gracious father in heaven, give us this bread of life so that when we swallow it, it can build us for your kingdom. In Jesus's name I do pray. Amen. Come with me in the book of Exodus chapter 25 verse 8. And the theme of the day which the pastor gave me pastor Mach it says it's time to build the Lord a sanctuary. It is time to build the Lord the sanctuary. The Bible says verse 8, "And let them make me a sanctuary that I may dwell in their midst." When I was a child, I remember it was in 19 89 and the gospel of the Adventist church and the gospel of the Lord came to my village and it was time to build a sanctuary for the Lord. And I remember the pastor then pastors were scarce, not like today. We could only have a pastor twice a year and the rest of the months would be led by church elders who were also innocent in those days because the only verse they knew was John 3:16. So whenever this pastor would be coming and to make matters worse he was also ordained. When an ordained pastor would come in those days you know he has come for two things church discipline this fellowship and to contribute many gifts to him as you are also going to contribute many gifts to me. Turn to your neighbor, neighbor, leave the pastor alone. And so when he came, he said, we are going to build a mega church, a church which is going to represent us. Whenever men and women shall be walking through this town, they will know that the Lord of the heavens has a sanctuary here. So I was young. That was a Friday when the Sabbath was drawing. And so I told my father who was an evangelist by then in charge of this congregation and I had a hen. This hen was personal. It was never given to me by my father. It was my hen as you can hear it in the dictionary. My hen. So this hen had laid eggs. These these eggs were of my hand. Which hand was mine? So these eggs were mine because they were of of a hand which hen was mine. And this hand was not given to me by my father. It was given to me by me. You are joking. So I told my father I am going to give out my eggs for sale so that tomorrow I can have money to build the church whereby if anyone passes through this town as the man of God said yesterday they can know we have a God in this place. So my father who was head of mobilization of building the sanctuary said you can't sell those eggs. Uh other people will bring money you can't sell these eggs. You know in development you can't sell eggs because each egg is another hen or coke. After 21 days we'll have a chick coming out of this hen of of this egg and it will lay more eggs. So I told my father this hen is mine and he told me you are mine. So your your your eggs are yours because the hen is yours. And these eggs are mine because they are the eggs of your hen. Which hen is yours? Which you is mine. Now it became another hilarious Friday. And what I did, I made sure I put the eggs in my jacket on Sabbath morning. So I came to church smart in a suit when the eggs are in the jacket, both sides. Both sides. So when the pastor stood here and he said, "Can we have now people coming to bring in their offerings for the foundation of our church?" I was the first person lest him come closer to me. So I came out and I brought out my eggs. And I told the pastor, I want the church to buy my eggs, but I want the church, when the church is buying my eggs, I want my father to buy my eggs so that I can take back my eggs and they can become chicks. Now, when you pause like that at a bullpit, no one can interrupt you. I waited for the opportune time and so my father had to buy my eggs and then he gives them back to me. So I so when we went back home I said these eggs still belong back to me even when you bought them because you are also my father who owns this hen. So these eggs still belong to me. Why did I tell you this story? When it comes to building God's sanctuary, this is when we have the exodus of church members. I have lived in this church as a PK all these years and as a pastor for 17 years. Whenever you begin church construction, you have the exodus of church members. They go to where construction was done after you have finished everything. These members come back and they're the ones who say we build this church when they didn't contribute anything. Those are the members who break our tiles. Those are the members who misuse our washrooms. Those are the members who even vandalize church property because they have nothing to lose because they never injected in anything. Before I preach, how many of you are saying, "Lord, we want to go away when church construction begins." I want to pray for you a prayer so that you can die and we become like like which Swahili word can I use that can make someone to get annoyed that when you die we become happy that that you have gone away from us which word can I use someone can get annoyed pastor like vocabulary Huh? To is to go to it is to go. But I met you die and we get rid of you quickly, faster. Okay, as you are still building the vocabulary, you know, swiri in Uganda is unpopular. It is a language for thieves. [Applause] So for us we don't know much with your you know thieves you can come to on you don't say langu so we left the language to the army military and thieves because they're the ones who say lango so but nevertheless it's a very beautiful language that the old man in our country the only president whom you know before elections uh he has made it mandatory that if we can learn it so that we can be good East African me uh partners and members God has a desire and he had a desire too when He made man. He blessed man in the garden of Eden. There is a reason why God is blessing man in the garden of Eden. Because Eden means God is presence. God designed it this way that a humanity is always before his presence. When the presence of God goes away from humanity, humanity comes to its end. We cannot survive unless we are in God's presence. We cannot survive because we are I mean look at me now. Everything attached to humanity cannot survive unless you are in God's presence. That wife you have can only respect you my pastor because there is the presence of God between you and her. Women. Women. Who? My pastor. You don't know women. I know women. I know women. I know women. In my family. I am the first born and the fifth born in my family. I am the firstborn and the fifth born. So when you come to me, don't joke. I am the firstborn and the fifth born. My my father and my mother are pastors. My father is retiring this year as a pastor. But uh they gotten married long time ago. And uh my mother had she conceived uh like you people conceive also and uh she had a miscarriage. So she also conceived the second time and she also had a miscarriage. So she also conceived the third time and she also had a miscarriage. So she was not tired with the with the husband. She conceived the fourth time and she had a miscarriage. They didn't get tired. They they made a covenant with God. When you give us this child now, that child shall be a pastor. So they conceived a fifth time and I refused to be miscarriaged. You know there are some people who can't be miscarriaged. And that's the name guma which is disturbing you here. That name means patience. They had to go a lot of church talks. You know my church can talk. Oh my church has a PhD in talking. Even those who have no idea they talk. Even those who have uninformed ideas, they talk. And she had to stand the talking of the in-laws. You can know how in-laws can talk when such instances comes. Now when they gave birth to me, they gave birth to more four girls. So I grew up as the only boy amongst girls. So, pastor, I know women. Women. Pastor, I know women. Women. Pastor, I know women. Fear a woman. actually wake up at night, like at 3:00 a.m. Just wake up, sit on your bed, and fear women. [Applause] Just wake up at like at 3:00 a.m., sit, make your pillow, your back, and just do what? Fear women, then you go back to sleep. That woman pastor who obeys you, who respects you, can only do that because there's the presence of God. If it was known the presence of God [Music] to as far as I have written a script about women, you will be in disaster. Did you know that one, Madame Singer? Fear men. Oh, fear men. What did I say? Fear man. Fear a man in this world. I'll not spoke something bad about men because I am a man. But if I was not a man, I would have told you the reasons why you should fear men. But because I am compromised, men are good. But fear them. That man can only love you when there is the presence of God. So God designed it that men and women must always be in the presence of God. And the devil knew it that as long as men and women stay in God's presence, they will always have everything which the Lord has. That's why there was no lack in the garden of Eden. There was nothing as you can imagine that we are going through today. There was no mano in the garden of Eden. The word is what? The word is what? The word is what? What is the meaning of madam manuo pastor? Protest. Hey protest means madam manu. demonstration. Ah, it's a bad word now. I thought it was a beautiful one because manda, manda, isn't it like fire or something? Manda in Uganda, manda means fire or charcoal. Charcoal. This charcoal you burn from wood. We call it manda. So, it has now changed to protest. Oh, let's drop the word. In the garden of Eden, when man was before God, it was well. When the devil came and snatched God's presence out of our hearts, we surgeoned upon the face of this world and found ourselves into the land of Egypt. But then it has been always God's desire that he dwells among the stars. And so when they were surgeoning in the wilderness after leaving Egypt, he said, "Since you have left Egypt where I would watch over you, but not in your midst, build for me a sanctuary so that I can dwell am so that I can be amongst you so that I can repossess that which the devil had swept from me and you. He dragged us out from the garden of Eden which was God's presence. When you leave Egypt, God wants to tabernacle with you. Now listen, when you are in Egypt, God is watching over you. But when you are coming out of Egypt and you have come out of Egypt, God wants to fellowship with you. He's no longer a spectator. He's no longer watching. He wants to dwell in your mid east. And when you accept to build his tabernacle, hello. Hello. accepting to build his tabernacle is accepting God's fellowship with you. You didn't get this. Now, when God gave an instruction to Moses and the rest of these Israelites, their acceptance to build a sanctuary was not just a figure of construction. It was accepting God's presence in their midst. Now look at me here. The image of your sanctuary reflects the image of your spirituality. Look at these iron sheets. I said look at these iron sheets. Those are not a tires. Those are iron sheets. Look at them. Your spirituality is iron sheets. Hello. Hello. Don't be annoyed. I am not the one who put those iron sheets. You are the one. My pastor, you you I exempt you because you've just came of yesterday just of recent. These guys, you follow them enjoying their iron sheets. You know when you worship God in iron sheets, uh I don't know who is now the sheets. Either God or the worshipper. Now don't get annoyed. I am still coming. When you want to meet someone special, you meet him in a special place. Hello. When you are meeting someone special, when I was dating that innocent girl, oh boy, I took her to a place she could I I I took her to a place that she couldn't resist my proposal that before I said will you, she said, I will marry you. Why? I was longing up to something which I have today as my marriage. When you meet your God in any place, you don't meet a God of heaven of the heavens, but you meet any God. This is what I'm saying, pastor. When you meet God in any place, you are meeting any God, not the God of the heavens and the earth. Now when we speak these things, you think we want money from you so that we can build these churches, stay with your money. me. I am not a pastor who pleads who who will come and pamper uh breastfeed. I don't have any breasts. So we you you you stay with your money. But I am saying when you meet God from any place you are meeting any God and when you meet a God in any place and when you meet any God from any place you get any husband. When you get any husband you get any wife. When you get any wife, you get any children. When you get any children, you have any church membership. That's why my church is struggling because it has any membership. Why are you looking at me with a bad eye? Any membership pastor and your team. I saw the man of God was praying here to make sure the spirit of God can remind us that we have a duty to pray. Whenever you see a church fund rising for churches construction, get to know they have any membership. Building a sanctuary is worship before the Lord. It's not fundraising. It's worship. None of us has ever fundraised for tithe. Pastor, to the best of my knowledge, I haven't seen anyone find rise for tithe. We promote, we sell ties, but we don't fund raise for tithe. Building a sanctuary for the Lord is not a sign of fundraising. It is a form of worship. Why do we fundrise? Because one leg is in Egypt and one leg is in Canaan. As long as your leg is in Egypt and another leg is in Canaan, you can fund rise for God's sanctuary. But when you have your two legs in Canaan, you don't need to find rise. But you worship the Lord through the construction of his sanctuary. Now listen to this. When you are building a sanctuary, you are inviting God's presence in your midst. When you invite God's presence in your midst, you must be present when he is present. When you are present, when he is present, his presence takes care of you. There's no one who has ever been in the presence of God that has never been taken care of by the presence of God. Now listen to this and listen good. Hello Hello. When you are in God's presence, you are restoring what God designed from the very word go in the garden of Eden. Point number two, when you are in God's presence, you yourself you are restoring yourself to God's plan which he had in the garden of Eden. When you build God a sanctuary, hello. This sanctuary dwells in your midst. When it dwells in your midst, you also enter this sanctuary. When you enter this sanctuary, this sanctuary becomes your tabernacle. When it becomes your tabernacle, now God also tabernacle with you. When he did when he does this with you, you become the sanctuary yourself. You can't be a sanctuary yourself when there is no sanctuary. Am I communicating now? Come to this. We are not just going to build. God is a sanctuary. We are going to build ourselves as it shall be unveiled. The way it must look the artistic impression of God's sanctuary must be the artistic impression of you yourself. You haven't gotten where we are going. with a few minutes I'm remaining with. When you build a sanctuary, you must build a sanctuary which looks exactly like you. If you are below that image of the sanctuary you are building, you must pull up your socks quickly so that you can look exactly like the sanctuary you have built. That's why in a few years from now I don't want to see those cars there. There will be a mismatch to what will be here. As we build God's sanctuary, build your cars also. As you are building God's sanctuary, build yourself. Don't come to church with hair full of wiki. Come with good hair, women. Are you listening? Come with nice, good looking hair into God's sanctuary. Attend to your face. Hello. You haven't understood. God wanted when he is dwelling amidst his people, his people can be happy. His people can be fine. His people can be okay. You can't build a sanctuary when your table is fed with poor Ugari. Third grade Bugatti maze of the third season. Hello. Hello. Look at me here. You can't build God a sanctuary when your tie was given to you by Adra and your shoe was given to you by United Nations for refugee for high commission for refugees. Hello. Hello. You can't build God a sanctuary when you take an Adventist girl on a date and you only buy a a 500 ml bottle and you even divide it half. She takes half, you take half and you say we are dating. You can't build God a sanctuary when your bed inside your bedroom is a bed of people who are on a hurry. People who are on hurry, they can't spread their hands. They sleep on one side as Jacob did in the wilderness. He just put a stone on his head and then he began to see angels. So when you are in a hurry only sleep on one word on one side. When you have built God's sanctuary, God's sanctuary also builds your life. As the sanctuary is elevated up, I don't know how many stories it has. As it goes up in the sky, our lives too must go up in the sky. Amen. Our accommodation facilities at home should go up in the sky. Our level of education of our children must also go up in the sky. Our dressing must also go up in the sky. Someone cheated us when he said on a Saturday when you see a man in a jacket which is different from the panties, it is an Adventist man. Advent men do not, you know, the jacket must be different from from the panties. And so that is a pure Adventist. And if he has a tie, that is a a church elder or a deacon. And if the jacket is maybe trying to be similar to the panties, then he is their pastor. Okay? He's their pastor. And he also said that at every end of a dusty road you find an Adventist institution. I am so glad that we don't have a dusty road. At least God is merciful that we have takal. Hallelujah church. At least we have we are we are we are out of that of that question now. But what I'm simply saying is there is a way how we build God's sanctuaries and they are elevated high when our lives are going down. This symbol of building God's sanctuary, let it also be a symbol of building your lives so that both God's sanctuary and your lives can meet God's presence. Lastly, in Europe, churches are on sale. Did you know that? Did you know that when you go to Google, churches are on sale? Magnificent churches, magnificent cathedrals and a sale. Do you know who are buying them? Casinos, theaters, comedy theaters, dances and casinos. Why? They built the sanctuary but they never built their sanctuary. That's why I want to end with this note. As it is going to be unveiled before us and as we shall lay its foundation, we must begin building our sanctuary. Pastor, this is my commandment. You have heard of the old say to you, but I say unto you today that when you shall begin building God's sanctuary, stop committing adultery, turn to your neighbor and say, "Neighbor, You can commit adultery between now and when we shall begin building the sanctuary. That is if God will accept it. But because he doesn't accept it, it is my word of encouragement. As we are building God's sanctuary, let us build our sanctuary so that when we shall enter into his presence, we can be filled with God's holiness. And when we get filled with God's holiness, the entire world will know that he sent us to them so they can also glorify his name. May the good Lord be with you. strengthen you, cherish you, make you bold as you establish a new life sanctuary in Jesus's name. Amen. Pastor, you can come and join me and we pray together. All right. May you raise up and we pray together. [Music] Shall we pray? Our dear Lord, you have always desired to be in our midst. That's why in Eden, we were in your midst and you were in our midst. In the wilderness, you desired for us to build a sanctuary so that you can also tabernacle with us. And even in this present world, you sent an angel to say, "A son is going to be born and his name is Emmanuel, which means I am still dreading in your mid east." And so your men and women are going to build you here because you are the sanctuary. In it was bread of which you are the bread of life. Yes. In it was the manora of which you are the light of the world. In it was the water to cleanse and you are the water of life. In it you are you were the sacrificial lamb of which you are even today as our best atonement for our seat. So as we are going to raise you here in the image of a structure, may our lives also be built for your kingdom. So that when you shall be elevated here in this town, men and women of Nairobi may see you elevated in this township. children can see you and we can also be blessed to be counted among those whom you dwell among us. In Jesus's name I do pray. May God be with you. All right, please be seated. 

==================================================

TIMESTAMPED TRANSCRIPT:
[0.7s] [Music]
[26.2s] Hallelujah. Church.
[33.4s] This is a beautiful Sabbath.
[39.1s] When
[42.5s] you people are friendly with the
[44.2s] weather,
[48.1s] as some of us are doing our best
[54.1s] to enjoy it as well.
[59.0s] I have been to Nairobi
[62.2s] so many times but when it's a little bit
[65.0s] warm
[68.1s] and one day I was caught up at the
[69.9s] airport the runway was filled with water
[71.9s] so we couldn't fly out of Nairobi
[75.0s] and even the airport was soaked
[78.8s] as you can hear it in its dictionary
[80.6s] form soaked in the airport I mean in
[84.2s] water
[86.6s] But it was not as cold as today.
[90.6s] So I don't mind when you look at me in a
[94.2s] cold form. I can understand.
[99.0s] But we thank God for giving us this
[101.3s] privilege
[103.2s] to come and join you
[106.2s] on this special and particular Sabbath.
[110.6s] I was so moved by the skit of our
[114.2s] children,
[116.4s] our PS uh department.
[120.5s] I would
[122.5s] request you to always
[125.1s] edit our Sabbath worship and bring out
[130.4s] those clips of children presentations
[133.0s] and store them
[135.5s] on
[137.8s] Google Cloud.
[140.2s] So that when they are here teasing us as
[143.5s] church elders,
[146.0s] we can play them
[148.9s] and when they want to behave stubbornly
[151.1s] to go out of the church, we can always
[154.1s] have a homecoming Sabbath for them and
[156.7s] they watch themselves when they were
[158.7s] here as Joe as David's and
[162.5s] uh uh Jesse's and prophet Samuel the
[168.2s] anoint winter
[170.6s] and so they'll always look at them and
[173.0s] remain firm in the Lord.
[177.7s] We are so glad to
[180.4s] join you, Pastor Macho
[184.7s] Mach.
[187.1s] Uh this is a beautiful church,
[190.6s] New Life Church.
[193.5s] Although I haven't really seen New Life
[196.6s] in my life.
[199.0s] So maybe by evening I'll be new.
[204.2s] Where is the family life director
[207.5s] of this church?
[211.9s] Where are you? Aha. This week
[216.3s] is our 11th anniversary with my wife.
[220.8s] So make sure by evening I have new life.
[225.1s] This is the best way pastors can
[227.0s] advertise their problems
[229.8s] to
[232.2s] good.
[237.0s] We bring greetings from
[240.6s] Campala Central Church
[245.5s] which is the district the mother of the
[248.6s] Englishspeaking congregations in Uganda
[252.9s] and Bethl
[256.2s] is a church in this district.
[260.1s] It is a young church
[263.6s] uh not beyond two years
[267.0s] which seeks to benchmark
[270.6s] from New Life Church
[273.7s] so that they can go and do God's mission
[278.0s] in a better way.
[280.5s] So make sure between yesterday, today
[283.0s] and tomorrow you behave well
[285.8s] so that we can benchmark well and take
[289.4s] correct stuff and good stuff.
[292.4s] And we also invite you to also come and
[295.8s] benchmark with us because as much as is
[299.0s] too young two years this is one of the
[302.2s] youngest church in the country but doing
[305.0s] great stuff. Amen. When you visit us,
[310.1s] you will pray in your mother language.
[314.3s] Uh so they come here to see how the Lord
[318.7s] is using you in all your departments,
[322.0s] the development department, treasury,
[324.0s] evangelism, stewardship and so they can
[327.6s] go back and they can implement. I also
[330.4s] have a tour also for benchmarking
[333.3s] between 9th to 13th October which we we
[336.4s] shall have in Johannesburg.
[338.6s] And I think we can also go because you
[341.8s] also need benchmarking.
[347.0s] You also need benchmarking also. So when
[350.2s] I came here I saw many benches which you
[352.4s] need to mark.
[354.6s] So you better join us my pastor and the
[357.9s] elders and the team that we can go to
[361.0s] Johannesburg and also we see how God is
[363.8s] using those men and women down there.
[366.9s] But for now we want to get new life
[372.6s] the experience
[374.4s] and we begin applying what is applicable
[377.7s] at our local church at Bethl. Can I have
[381.1s] a team representing Bethl church to
[383.8s] raise up all of you including those with
[386.6s] poor voices who are not able to come
[388.3s] here.
[390.6s] All right.
[392.3s] That's very good. That's good. The
[394.6s] attires you see those are the cultural
[398.6s] attires when you cross the other side of
[401.4s] M.
[403.1s] When you come this site is Ugari and
[406.1s] Kumawiki.
[408.1s] You know when you come to Kenya the only
[409.8s] thing we suffer from is food. This a
[412.9s] country of starvation.
[416.5s] That's why they had greens as source.
[419.3s] Can you imagine greens to become source?
[422.8s] Sukuma week.
[427.3s] Like you push the week to come to an
[429.3s] end. Oh,
[433.0s] it's all right. You can rest. You can
[435.0s] rest.
[439.4s] I know.
[442.2s] So weeks in Kenya end by force. You
[444.6s] sukuma.
[450.0s] All right.
[452.2s] Bring greetings from the district pastor
[456.4s] who is my good friend pastor Benon
[458.6s] Lincoln Chigundu
[460.6s] is pastor of KC and also his associate
[464.4s] justice Perez. They sent to you
[466.8s] greetings in the Lord.
[470.3s] I also bring greetings from Bugma
[473.1s] University
[474.9s] where I serve as a lecturer also in the
[479.1s] school of theology and religious studies
[482.9s] and uh they send you greetings.
[486.0s] It's your university.
[488.6s] We have many courses which you can also
[491.7s] take.
[493.2s] We have one of the newest school of
[496.2s] health and sciences that offers courses
[499.1s] in the medical world. So you can always
[501.9s] have your children and you yourselves
[504.6s] come to
[507.1s] benefit from them. And we also have the
[510.4s] largest theological seminary almost in
[514.6s] the whole world
[516.7s] because on Africa it is the largest and
[520.0s] globally it is almost the largest
[523.1s] because we have 1,000 theology students
[527.6s] and no seminary competes with us. All
[530.7s] seminaries sat, voted and agreed.
[535.7s] It was moved and recorded and carried
[538.6s] that bugma will always shine in
[541.4s] theology.
[542.9s] So we have made a course for all church
[546.3s] members who have a degree in any area
[550.8s] and we are introducing to you a
[552.5s] postgraduate diploma in theology.
[556.8s] You don't come with your diploma, you
[559.3s] come with your degree. medicine,
[561.1s] accounting, surveying, law, those other
[564.9s] courses which you did without guidance.
[568.0s] So we have
[571.4s] we have made a course for everyone so
[574.4s] that we can empower our church to do
[577.6s] God's mission in the best way possible.
[580.6s] Amen.
[584.8s] When I was coming to new life,
[589.2s] I decided
[591.1s] to come with my wife.
[594.1s] It was intentional
[596.2s] to come with my wife so that the family
[599.4s] life director
[601.7s] can know that this week is our
[603.6s] anniversary.
[605.8s] So, make sure you do something good in
[607.7s] the evening. Have you heard of?
[613.7s] So my wife where are you?
[616.8s] Ah you know when you make them stand
[619.7s] they cook for more 3 years.
[623.0s] Very good.
[624.9s] Very good.
[628.2s] Today
[630.7s] I am using something small here as you
[633.4s] can see
[635.4s] because we have something big behind me
[638.2s] here.
[639.9s] Hallelujah church.
[644.0s] And I don't know how God does he thinks
[648.6s] that we unveil
[651.4s] this big thing
[653.8s] when we are coming to benchmark.
[658.8s] So probably we can also benchmark
[662.8s] this big thing
[665.0s] because Bethl also worships like you.
[669.4s] Uh they are still in a temporal
[671.8s] structure.
[674.8s] Is it better than this one?
[683.0s] I was trying to rate this one is somehow
[688.8s] better
[690.7s] like 2%.
[698.3s] So as we benchmark my development
[701.2s] director Mr. Kenya who led the team, we
[705.5s] may also need to benchmark this stuff.
[709.4s] But of course we can't benchmark the
[711.0s] cars outside. They are too small for us.
[714.9s] Ugandans don't drive those small cars.
[717.0s] Tuku,
[718.6s] no.
[720.6s] You better improve yourselves on that.
[724.1s] Come and benchmark. You will see.
[727.1s] Vehicles for God's children.
[730.1s] These are vehicles for God's people,
[734.0s] but they are also vehicles for God's
[735.7s] children. Amen.
[737.8s] Now, don't be annoyed. I am just a a
[741.1s] preacher of the day.
[743.4s] So let me pray so that you can forgive
[745.2s] me. Shall we pray?
[747.8s] Gracious father in heaven,
[750.8s] give us this bread of life
[754.4s] so that when we swallow it, it can build
[759.0s] us for your kingdom. In Jesus's name I
[762.3s] do pray. Amen. Come with me in the book
[766.2s] of Exodus
[769.0s] chapter
[771.3s] 25
[773.4s] verse
[775.0s] 8. And the theme of the day which the
[777.6s] pastor gave me pastor Mach
[780.6s] it says it's time to build the Lord a
[784.6s] sanctuary.
[786.2s] It is time
[789.1s] to build
[791.0s] the Lord the sanctuary.
[796.2s] The Bible says verse 8,
[800.2s] "And let them make me a sanctuary
[806.1s] that I may dwell in their midst."
[813.9s] When I was a child,
[819.9s] I remember
[822.3s] it was in 19
[826.2s] 89
[831.5s] and
[833.7s] the gospel of the Adventist church and
[836.2s] the gospel of the Lord came to my
[839.1s] village
[841.4s] and it was time to build a sanctuary for
[844.0s] the Lord.
[846.1s] And I remember the pastor then pastors
[848.7s] were scarce,
[850.9s] not like today. We could only have a
[854.0s] pastor twice a year
[857.0s] and the rest of the months would be led
[859.4s] by church elders
[861.8s] who were also innocent in those days
[865.3s] because the only verse they knew was
[867.0s] John 3:16.
[871.6s] So whenever this pastor would be coming
[875.0s] and to make matters worse he was also
[877.9s] ordained.
[881.6s] When an ordained pastor would come in
[883.8s] those days you know he has come for two
[886.2s] things church discipline this fellowship
[889.5s] and to contribute many gifts
[892.5s] to him as you are also going to
[894.9s] contribute many gifts to me.
[898.6s] Turn to your neighbor, neighbor,
[901.0s] leave the pastor alone.
[907.6s] And so when he came, he said, we are
[909.8s] going to build a mega church,
[914.4s] a church which is going to represent us.
[918.2s] Whenever men and women shall be walking
[920.3s] through this town, they will know that
[922.6s] the Lord of the heavens has a sanctuary
[928.6s] here.
[931.1s] So I was young.
[933.7s] That was a Friday
[936.4s] when the Sabbath was
[939.1s] drawing.
[941.5s] And so I told my father who was an
[945.0s] evangelist by then
[948.4s] in charge of this congregation
[951.0s] and I had a hen. This hen was personal.
[957.6s] It was never given to me by my father.
[959.5s] It was my hen
[961.9s] as you can hear it in the dictionary. My
[963.9s] hen. So this hen had laid eggs. These
[969.2s] these eggs were of my hand. Which hand
[971.8s] was mine?
[973.8s] So these eggs were mine because they
[976.4s] were of of a hand which hen was mine.
[981.0s] And this hand was not given to me by my
[983.3s] father. It was given to me by me.
[987.5s] You are joking.
[990.6s] So I told my father I am going to give
[992.8s] out my eggs for sale so that tomorrow I
[997.3s] can have money to build the church
[1000.6s] whereby if anyone passes through this
[1002.8s] town as the man of God said yesterday
[1005.6s] they can know we have a God in this
[1007.4s] place.
[1009.4s] So my father who was head of
[1012.4s] mobilization
[1014.7s] of building the sanctuary said you can't
[1018.2s] sell those eggs.
[1021.8s] Uh other people will bring money
[1025.8s] you can't sell these eggs.
[1028.8s] You know in development you can't sell
[1030.7s] eggs
[1032.2s] because each egg
[1034.9s] is another hen or coke.
[1039.4s] After 21 days we'll have a chick coming
[1042.4s] out of this hen of of this egg and it
[1045.4s] will lay more eggs.
[1047.8s] So I told my father this hen is mine and
[1051.2s] he told me you are mine.
[1054.2s] So your your your eggs are yours because
[1059.0s] the hen is yours. And these eggs are
[1062.6s] mine because they are the eggs of your
[1065.6s] hen. Which hen is yours? Which you is
[1070.0s] mine.
[1076.1s] Now
[1077.7s] it became another hilarious Friday.
[1082.4s] And what I did,
[1085.4s] I made sure
[1087.7s] I put the eggs in my jacket
[1091.3s] on Sabbath morning.
[1094.0s] So I came to church smart in a suit when
[1097.6s] the eggs are in the jacket, both sides.
[1103.9s] Both sides.
[1105.7s] So when the pastor stood here and he
[1108.6s] said, "Can we have now people coming to
[1111.4s] bring in
[1113.7s] their offerings for the foundation of
[1117.0s] our church?" I was the first person lest
[1120.2s] him come closer to me. So I came out and
[1123.7s] I brought out my eggs.
[1127.1s] And I told the pastor,
[1129.8s] I want the church to buy my eggs,
[1133.0s] but I want the church, when the church
[1135.4s] is buying my eggs, I want my father to
[1138.5s] buy my eggs so that I can take back my
[1141.7s] eggs and they can become chicks.
[1146.8s] Now, when you pause like that at a
[1148.7s] bullpit, no one can interrupt you.
[1152.6s] I waited for the opportune time and so
[1155.4s] my father had to buy my eggs
[1159.8s] and then he gives them back to me. So I
[1164.0s] so when we went back home I said these
[1166.3s] eggs still belong back to me even when
[1168.6s] you bought them because you are also my
[1171.8s] father who owns this hen. So these eggs
[1175.9s] still belong to me.
[1178.3s] Why did I tell you this story?
[1181.8s] When it comes to building God's
[1184.1s] sanctuary,
[1185.8s] this is when we have the exodus of
[1187.8s] church members.
[1190.6s] I have lived in this church as a PK
[1193.8s] all these years and as a pastor for 17
[1197.4s] years. Whenever you begin church
[1200.0s] construction,
[1201.7s] you have the exodus of church members.
[1204.5s] They go to where construction was done
[1210.2s] after you have finished everything.
[1212.9s] These members come back and they're the
[1216.3s] ones who say we build
[1219.9s] this church
[1222.1s] when they didn't contribute anything.
[1225.7s] Those are the members who break our
[1228.3s] tiles. Those are the members who misuse
[1231.4s] our washrooms. Those are the members who
[1235.0s] even vandalize church property because
[1238.0s] they have nothing to lose because they
[1240.6s] never injected in anything. Before I
[1244.6s] preach, how many of you are saying,
[1247.7s] "Lord, we want to go away when church
[1251.8s] construction begins." I want to pray for
[1255.0s] you a prayer so that you can die
[1259.2s] and we become like like
[1263.1s] which Swahili word can I use that can
[1265.2s] make someone to get annoyed that when
[1266.8s] you die we become happy that that you
[1269.9s] have gone away from us which word can I
[1273.2s] use someone can get annoyed
[1278.9s] pastor like vocabulary
[1283.3s] Huh? To
[1287.9s] is to go to it is to go. But I met you
[1292.9s] die and we get rid of you quickly,
[1296.2s] faster.
[1304.0s] Okay, as you are still building the
[1305.4s] vocabulary, you know, swiri in Uganda is
[1308.4s] unpopular.
[1309.9s] It is a language for thieves.
[1312.8s] [Applause]
[1314.6s] So
[1317.3s] for us we don't know much with your
[1320.4s] you know thieves you can come to on you
[1322.2s] don't say langu so
[1325.9s] we left the language to the army
[1327.9s] military and thieves because they're the
[1330.5s] ones who say lango so but nevertheless
[1334.8s] it's a very beautiful language that the
[1338.1s] old man in our country
[1340.6s] the only president whom you know before
[1342.8s] elections
[1345.2s] uh he has made it mandatory that if we
[1348.7s] can learn it so that we can be good East
[1351.7s] African me uh partners and members
[1360.1s] God
[1363.4s] has a desire
[1366.5s] and he had a desire too
[1370.4s] when He made man.
[1374.4s] He blessed man in the garden of Eden.
[1381.2s] There is a reason
[1383.8s] why God is blessing man in the garden of
[1387.8s] Eden.
[1389.4s] Because Eden means God is presence.
[1395.0s] God designed it this way that a humanity
[1399.4s] is always before his presence.
[1405.0s] When the presence of God goes away from
[1408.9s] humanity, humanity comes to its end.
[1414.0s] We cannot survive
[1417.0s] unless we are in God's presence.
[1422.6s] We cannot survive because
[1426.6s] we are I mean look at me now.
[1431.4s] Everything attached to humanity cannot
[1435.4s] survive unless you are in God's
[1437.9s] presence.
[1439.5s] That wife you have can only respect you
[1443.6s] my pastor because there is the presence
[1447.4s] of God between you and her. Women.
[1452.6s] Women. Who?
[1455.5s] My pastor. You don't know women.
[1459.3s] I know women.
[1466.2s] I know women. I know women.
[1470.9s] In my family.
[1473.7s] I am the first born and the fifth born
[1478.2s] in my family.
[1481.0s] I am the firstborn
[1483.2s] and the fifth born.
[1486.3s] So when you come to me, don't joke. I am
[1488.9s] the firstborn and the fifth born.
[1493.6s] My my father and my mother are pastors.
[1497.5s] My father is retiring this year as a
[1499.6s] pastor.
[1502.0s] But uh they gotten married long time
[1506.2s] ago.
[1508.8s] And uh my mother had
[1513.0s] she conceived
[1516.2s] uh like you people conceive also
[1520.8s] and uh she had a miscarriage.
[1527.2s] So she also conceived the second time
[1532.2s] and she also had a miscarriage.
[1536.3s] So she also conceived the third time
[1540.0s] and she also had a miscarriage.
[1543.5s] So she was not tired with the with the
[1545.8s] husband.
[1547.9s] She conceived the fourth time
[1551.1s] and she had a miscarriage.
[1554.3s] They didn't get tired.
[1557.3s] They they made a covenant with God. When
[1560.7s] you give us this child now, that child
[1565.5s] shall be a pastor.
[1567.8s] So they conceived a fifth time and I
[1571.6s] refused to be miscarriaged.
[1576.8s] You know there are some people who can't
[1578.1s] be miscarriaged.
[1582.6s] And that's the name guma which is
[1584.6s] disturbing you here. That name means
[1587.4s] patience.
[1589.4s] They had to go a lot
[1592.1s] of church talks. You know my church can
[1595.0s] talk.
[1596.7s] Oh
[1598.4s] my church has a PhD
[1601.4s] in talking.
[1603.6s] Even those who have no idea
[1606.5s] they talk.
[1608.6s] Even those who have uninformed ideas,
[1611.4s] they talk.
[1613.6s] And she had to stand the talking of the
[1617.3s] in-laws. You can know how in-laws can
[1620.1s] talk when such instances comes.
[1624.6s] Now when they gave birth to me, they
[1628.5s] gave birth to more four girls.
[1633.8s] So I grew up as the only boy amongst
[1637.4s] girls. So, pastor, I know women.
[1643.7s] Women.
[1645.6s] Pastor, I know women.
[1650.4s] Women.
[1653.6s] Pastor,
[1655.1s] I know women.
[1659.4s] Fear a woman.
[1662.2s] actually wake up at night, like at 3:00
[1664.4s] a.m. Just wake up, sit on your bed, and
[1666.7s] fear women.
[1668.4s] [Applause]
[1676.2s] Just wake up at like at 3:00 a.m., sit,
[1680.4s] make your pillow, your back, and just do
[1683.5s] what?
[1685.1s] Fear women, then you go back to sleep.
[1691.3s] That woman pastor
[1693.9s] who obeys you, who respects you, can
[1699.1s] only do that because there's the
[1702.2s] presence of God.
[1704.8s] If it was known the presence of God
[1708.7s] [Music]
[1710.1s] to as far as I have written a script
[1712.5s] about women,
[1715.3s] you will be in disaster.
[1718.6s] Did you know that one, Madame Singer?
[1723.8s] Fear men.
[1726.3s] Oh,
[1730.4s] fear men.
[1732.6s] What did I say?
[1734.7s] Fear man.
[1738.2s] Fear a man
[1741.3s] in this world. I'll not spoke something
[1744.1s] bad about men because I am a man.
[1748.4s] But if I was not a man, I would have
[1750.6s] told you the reasons why you should fear
[1752.9s] men.
[1754.4s] But because I am compromised, men are
[1756.8s] good. But fear them.
[1762.4s] That man can only love you when there is
[1767.5s] the presence of God.
[1771.1s] So God designed it that men and women
[1776.2s] must always be in the presence of God.
[1781.5s] And the devil knew it that as long as
[1785.4s] men and women stay in God's presence,
[1788.5s] they will always have everything which
[1791.7s] the Lord has.
[1794.0s] That's why there was no lack in the
[1796.0s] garden of Eden. There was nothing as you
[1799.0s] can imagine that we are going through
[1800.7s] today. There was no mano
[1804.8s] in the garden of Eden. The word is what?
[1809.8s] The word is what?
[1812.0s] The word is what?
[1814.9s] What is the meaning of madam manuo
[1816.4s] pastor?
[1819.8s] Protest.
[1821.8s] Hey protest means madam manu.
[1827.3s] demonstration.
[1829.0s] Ah, it's a bad word now. I thought it
[1832.6s] was a beautiful one
[1835.1s] because manda, manda, isn't it like fire
[1837.4s] or something? Manda in Uganda, manda
[1840.3s] means fire or charcoal.
[1843.9s] Charcoal.
[1846.0s] This charcoal you burn from wood. We
[1848.9s] call it manda.
[1851.3s] So, it has now changed to protest.
[1855.8s] Oh, let's drop the word.
[1860.2s] In the garden of Eden,
[1862.6s] when man was before God, it was well.
[1868.5s] When the devil came and snatched God's
[1871.5s] presence out of our hearts,
[1875.2s] we surgeoned upon the face of this world
[1878.5s] and found ourselves into the land of
[1881.1s] Egypt.
[1883.6s] But then it has been always God's desire
[1887.3s] that he dwells among the stars.
[1891.8s] And so when they were surgeoning in the
[1894.2s] wilderness after leaving Egypt,
[1898.3s] he said, "Since you have left Egypt
[1902.0s] where I would watch over you, but not in
[1905.5s] your midst, build for me a sanctuary
[1911.8s] so that
[1913.9s] I can dwell
[1917.3s] am
[1919.8s] so that I can be amongst you so that I
[1924.8s] can repossess that which the devil had
[1928.6s] swept
[1930.6s] from me and you. He dragged us out from
[1934.6s] the garden of Eden which was God's
[1937.8s] presence. When you leave Egypt,
[1941.6s] God wants to tabernacle with you. Now
[1945.0s] listen,
[1946.6s] when you are in Egypt, God is watching
[1949.3s] over you.
[1951.3s] But when you are coming out of Egypt and
[1955.0s] you have come out of Egypt, God wants to
[1957.4s] fellowship with you. He's no longer a
[1960.3s] spectator. He's no longer watching. He
[1964.1s] wants to dwell in your mid east.
[1968.1s] And when you
[1970.5s] accept to build his tabernacle,
[1975.4s] hello. Hello. accepting to build his
[1980.2s] tabernacle is accepting God's fellowship
[1983.8s] with you.
[1985.6s] You didn't get this. Now, when God gave
[1988.6s] an instruction to Moses and the rest of
[1990.6s] these Israelites, their acceptance to
[1993.9s] build a sanctuary was not just a figure
[1997.5s] of construction.
[1999.4s] It was accepting God's presence in their
[2003.3s] midst.
[2005.6s] Now look at me here.
[2008.7s] The image of your sanctuary
[2011.9s] reflects the image of your spirituality.
[2022.1s] Look at these iron sheets.
[2025.0s] I said look at these iron sheets.
[2028.3s] Those are not a tires. Those are iron
[2030.0s] sheets. Look at them.
[2032.5s] Your spirituality is iron sheets.
[2038.2s] Hello.
[2040.2s] Hello.
[2042.2s] Don't be annoyed.
[2045.0s] I am not the one who put those iron
[2046.6s] sheets.
[2049.3s] You are the one.
[2053.2s] My pastor, you you I exempt you because
[2056.2s] you've just came of yesterday just of
[2057.8s] recent. These guys, you follow them
[2060.2s] enjoying their iron sheets.
[2063.4s] You know when you worship God in iron
[2065.3s] sheets,
[2067.4s] uh I don't know who is now the sheets.
[2070.1s] Either God or the worshipper.
[2073.3s] Now don't get annoyed. I am still
[2074.8s] coming.
[2077.5s] When you want to meet someone special,
[2081.1s] you meet him in a special place.
[2085.3s] Hello. When you are meeting someone
[2088.4s] special, when I was dating that innocent
[2091.4s] girl, oh boy,
[2094.5s] I took her to a place she could
[2101.6s] I I I took her to a place that she
[2105.2s] couldn't resist my proposal
[2109.0s] that before I said will you, she said, I
[2112.9s] will marry you.
[2117.9s] Why? I was longing up to something which
[2121.9s] I have today as my marriage.
[2125.8s] When you meet your God in any place,
[2131.4s] you don't meet a God of heaven of the
[2135.4s] heavens, but you meet any God.
[2141.4s] This is what I'm saying, pastor. When
[2143.4s] you meet God in any place, you are
[2146.7s] meeting any God,
[2149.8s] not the God of the heavens and the
[2152.5s] earth.
[2154.8s] Now when we speak these things,
[2157.5s] you think we want money from you
[2161.8s] so that we can build these churches,
[2165.6s] stay with your money.
[2169.1s] me. I am not a pastor who pleads who who
[2174.2s] will come and pamper
[2177.3s] uh breastfeed.
[2179.0s] I don't have any breasts. So
[2182.2s] we you you you stay with your money. But
[2185.2s] I am saying
[2187.1s] when you meet God from any place
[2191.0s] you are meeting any God and when you
[2194.8s] meet a God in any place and when you
[2199.0s] meet any God from any place you get any
[2203.2s] husband. When you get any husband you
[2206.9s] get any wife. When you get any wife, you
[2210.8s] get any children. When you get any
[2213.4s] children, you have any church
[2215.3s] membership.
[2219.0s] That's why my church is struggling
[2221.8s] because it has any membership.
[2228.0s] Why are you looking at me with
[2230.8s] a bad eye?
[2235.8s] Any membership
[2238.6s] pastor
[2240.3s] and your team. I saw the man of God was
[2243.7s] praying here to make sure the spirit of
[2246.3s] God can
[2248.5s] remind us that we have a duty to pray.
[2251.1s] Whenever you see a church fund rising
[2254.1s] for churches construction, get to know
[2256.9s] they have any membership.
[2263.4s] Building a sanctuary
[2266.8s] is worship before the Lord.
[2270.6s] It's not fundraising.
[2273.1s] It's worship. None of us has ever
[2276.5s] fundraised for tithe.
[2280.3s] Pastor,
[2282.5s] to the best of my knowledge, I haven't
[2286.0s] seen anyone find rise for tithe.
[2290.7s] We promote, we sell ties, but we don't
[2293.0s] fund raise for tithe. Building a
[2295.6s] sanctuary for the Lord is not a sign of
[2298.5s] fundraising.
[2300.6s] It is a form of worship.
[2304.0s] Why do we fundrise?
[2306.1s] Because one leg is in Egypt
[2309.3s] and one leg is in Canaan.
[2315.3s] As long as your leg is in Egypt and
[2318.3s] another leg is in Canaan, you can fund
[2321.4s] rise for God's sanctuary. But when you
[2324.2s] have your two legs in Canaan, you don't
[2327.2s] need to find rise. But you worship the
[2330.0s] Lord through the construction of his
[2332.4s] sanctuary.
[2333.9s] Now listen to this.
[2345.8s] When you are building a sanctuary,
[2349.6s] you are inviting God's presence in your
[2353.1s] midst.
[2355.2s] When you invite God's presence in your
[2357.4s] midst,
[2359.0s] you must be present when he is present.
[2364.6s] When you are present, when he is
[2366.6s] present,
[2368.2s] his presence takes care of you.
[2372.7s] There's no one who has ever been in the
[2375.7s] presence of God that has never been
[2378.8s] taken care of by the presence of God.
[2383.4s] Now listen to this
[2386.4s] and listen good.
[2391.2s] Hello
[2393.4s] Hello.
[2399.4s] When you are
[2401.8s] in God's presence,
[2404.5s] you are restoring
[2407.0s] what God designed from the very word go
[2411.9s] in the garden of Eden.
[2415.7s] Point number two,
[2418.2s] when you are in God's presence, you
[2421.4s] yourself you are restoring yourself to
[2425.0s] God's plan
[2427.0s] which he had in the garden of Eden.
[2431.5s] When you build God a sanctuary,
[2435.6s] hello. This sanctuary dwells in your
[2439.2s] midst. When it dwells in your midst, you
[2443.3s] also enter this sanctuary.
[2446.5s] When you enter this sanctuary, this
[2449.0s] sanctuary becomes
[2451.8s] your tabernacle.
[2454.2s] When it becomes your tabernacle, now God
[2457.2s] also tabernacle with you. When he did
[2460.6s] when he does this with you, you become
[2464.1s] the sanctuary yourself.
[2467.4s] You can't be a sanctuary yourself when
[2470.5s] there is no sanctuary.
[2475.4s] Am I communicating
[2478.2s] now? Come to this.
[2482.6s] We are not just going to build. God is a
[2485.5s] sanctuary.
[2487.1s] We are going to build ourselves
[2496.1s] as it shall be unveiled.
[2499.5s] The way it must look the artistic
[2503.3s] impression of God's sanctuary must be
[2507.0s] the artistic impression of you yourself.
[2513.3s] You haven't gotten where we are going.
[2516.9s] with a few minutes I'm remaining with.
[2519.8s] When you build a sanctuary, you must
[2523.0s] build a sanctuary which looks exactly
[2526.1s] like you.
[2528.6s] If you are below that image of the
[2531.8s] sanctuary you are building, you must
[2533.9s] pull up your socks quickly so that you
[2536.6s] can look exactly like the sanctuary you
[2539.5s] have built.
[2541.4s] That's why in a few years from now I
[2545.1s] don't want to see those cars there.
[2548.3s] There will be a mismatch to what will be
[2551.5s] here.
[2554.6s] As we build God's sanctuary, build your
[2557.5s] cars also.
[2560.8s] As you are building God's sanctuary,
[2563.1s] build yourself.
[2565.2s] Don't come to church with hair full of
[2567.9s] wiki.
[2571.0s] Come with good hair, women. Are you
[2574.3s] listening?
[2576.6s] Come with nice, good looking hair into
[2581.8s] God's sanctuary. Attend to your face.
[2588.8s] Hello.
[2591.0s] You haven't understood.
[2597.6s] God wanted when he is dwelling amidst
[2601.4s] his people, his people can be happy. His
[2605.7s] people can be fine. His people can be
[2608.9s] okay. You can't build a sanctuary when
[2612.1s] your table is fed with poor Ugari.
[2618.1s] Third grade Bugatti
[2622.3s] maze of the third season.
[2627.2s] Hello.
[2628.8s] Hello.
[2630.3s] Look at me here. You can't build God a
[2633.4s] sanctuary when your tie was given to you
[2636.5s] by Adra
[2645.1s] and your shoe was given to you by United
[2648.3s] Nations for refugee for high commission
[2650.8s] for refugees.
[2655.1s] Hello.
[2656.6s] Hello. You can't build God a sanctuary
[2660.1s] when you take an Adventist girl on a
[2662.5s] date and you only buy a a 500 ml bottle
[2667.9s] and you even divide it half. She takes
[2670.8s] half, you take half
[2676.2s] and you say we are dating.
[2680.6s] You can't build God a sanctuary when
[2683.3s] your bed inside your bedroom is a bed of
[2688.0s] people who are on a hurry.
[2693.3s] People who are on hurry, they can't
[2695.0s] spread their hands.
[2697.5s] They sleep on one side as Jacob did in
[2701.2s] the wilderness. He just put a stone on
[2704.6s] his head and then he began to see
[2706.8s] angels. So when you are in a hurry only
[2709.2s] sleep on one word on one side. When you
[2712.1s] have built God's sanctuary, God's
[2715.3s] sanctuary also builds your life.
[2722.0s] As the sanctuary is elevated up, I don't
[2725.9s] know how many stories it has. As it goes
[2729.0s] up in the sky, our lives too must go up
[2733.1s] in the sky. Amen. Our accommodation
[2737.0s] facilities at home should go up in the
[2739.8s] sky. Our level of education of our
[2743.1s] children must also go up in the sky. Our
[2747.3s] dressing must also go up in the sky.
[2750.8s] Someone cheated us when he said on a
[2754.2s] Saturday when you see a man in a jacket
[2758.4s] which is different from the panties, it
[2761.1s] is an Adventist man.
[2765.6s] Advent men do not, you know, the jacket
[2767.8s] must be different from
[2770.0s] from the panties. And so that is a pure
[2772.6s] Adventist. And if he has a tie, that is
[2774.7s] a a church elder or a deacon.
[2778.1s] And if the jacket is maybe trying to be
[2781.1s] similar to the panties, then he is their
[2783.7s] pastor. Okay? He's their pastor.
[2787.6s] And he also said that at every end of a
[2790.5s] dusty road you find an Adventist
[2793.4s] institution. I am so glad that we don't
[2796.2s] have a dusty road. At least God is
[2798.9s] merciful that we have takal.
[2802.2s] Hallelujah church. At least we have we
[2804.5s] are we are we are out of that of that
[2806.7s] question now. But what I'm simply saying
[2808.9s] is there is a way how we build God's
[2811.9s] sanctuaries and they are elevated high
[2814.9s] when our lives are going down.
[2819.2s] This symbol of building God's sanctuary,
[2823.7s] let it also be a symbol of building your
[2826.6s] lives
[2828.2s] so that both God's sanctuary and your
[2831.4s] lives can meet God's presence.
[2841.5s] Lastly,
[2845.1s] in Europe,
[2848.5s] churches
[2850.2s] are on sale.
[2853.4s] Did you know that?
[2855.5s] Did you know that
[2857.6s] when you go to Google, churches are on
[2860.5s] sale? Magnificent churches, magnificent
[2864.8s] cathedrals
[2867.7s] and a sale. Do you know who are buying
[2870.2s] them? Casinos,
[2874.6s] theaters,
[2876.5s] comedy theaters,
[2880.3s] dances
[2882.2s] and casinos.
[2884.5s] Why? They built the sanctuary
[2888.3s] but they never built their sanctuary.
[2894.6s] That's why I want to end with this note.
[2899.3s] As it is going to be unveiled before us
[2902.6s] and as we shall lay its foundation, we
[2905.7s] must begin building our sanctuary.
[2910.8s] Pastor,
[2913.4s] this is my commandment.
[2917.9s] You have heard of the old say to you,
[2922.0s] but I say unto you today that when you
[2925.7s] shall begin building God's sanctuary,
[2930.6s] stop committing adultery,
[2935.0s] turn to your neighbor and say,
[2936.1s] "Neighbor,
[2942.8s] You can commit adultery between now
[2948.1s] and when we shall begin
[2951.6s] building the sanctuary. That is if God
[2954.8s] will accept it.
[2957.6s] But because he doesn't accept it, it is
[2960.7s] my word of encouragement.
[2962.9s] As we are building God's sanctuary, let
[2966.0s] us build our sanctuary so that when we
[2970.6s] shall enter into his presence,
[2974.2s] we can be filled with God's holiness.
[2979.0s] And when we get filled with God's
[2981.4s] holiness, the entire world will know
[2984.6s] that he sent us to them so they can also
[2987.7s] glorify his name. May the good Lord be
[2991.2s] with you.
[2992.7s] strengthen you, cherish you, make you
[2997.0s] bold as you establish a new life
[3002.1s] sanctuary in Jesus's name. Amen. Pastor,
[3007.2s] you can come and join me and we pray
[3009.7s] together.
[3012.2s] All right.
[3014.5s] May you raise up
[3017.7s] and we pray together.
[3021.9s] [Music]
[3026.3s] Shall we pray?
[3031.5s] Our dear Lord,
[3035.0s] you have always desired
[3037.6s] to be in our midst.
[3040.6s] That's why
[3042.8s] in Eden, we were in your midst
[3046.9s] and you were in our midst.
[3049.7s] In the wilderness,
[3051.7s] you desired for us to build a sanctuary
[3054.2s] so that you can also tabernacle with us.
[3057.5s] And even in this present world,
[3061.2s] you sent an angel to say, "A son is
[3064.2s] going to be born and his name is
[3066.0s] Emmanuel, which means I am still
[3069.1s] dreading in your mid east."
[3073.0s] And so your men and women are going to
[3075.9s] build you here
[3079.0s] because you are the sanctuary.
[3082.4s] In it was bread of which you are the
[3085.0s] bread of life. Yes. In it was the manora
[3088.3s] of which you are the light of the world.
[3090.6s] In it was the water to cleanse and you
[3093.4s] are the water of life. In it you are you
[3096.9s] were the sacrificial lamb of which you
[3099.4s] are even today as our best atonement for
[3103.6s] our seat. So as we are going to raise
[3106.2s] you here in the image of a structure,
[3109.8s] may our lives also be built for your
[3113.1s] kingdom. So that when you shall be
[3116.7s] elevated
[3118.2s] here in this town,
[3120.6s] men and women of Nairobi may see you
[3123.8s] elevated in this township.
[3127.1s] children can see you and we can also be
[3130.3s] blessed to be counted among those whom
[3133.8s] you dwell among us. In Jesus's name I do
[3137.2s] pray. May God be with you.
[3140.9s] All right, please be seated.
