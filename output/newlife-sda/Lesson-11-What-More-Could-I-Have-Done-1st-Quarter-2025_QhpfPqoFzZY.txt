[Music] good morning to you our brothers and sisters and happy Sabbath um thank you for joining us this wonderful Sabbath and uh we are coming to you live from New Life SDA Church fifth gong Avenue and just wanting to welcome you to our discussion uh for today and our topic for today is um what more could die have done I have with me a panel uh that will be diving into this particular discussion and I will like them just to be able to introduce themselves we get to know them as we continue so we'll start um from the furthest end uh we'll have um Elder you could introduce I greet you all in Jes Jesus name Hallelujah am thank you so much I'm Elder of this church welcome Happy Sabbath I'm Agnes Whitney may we be blessed as we discuss the word of God praise God my name is chrisal begera I'm

wonderful Sabbath morning that you valow us to be here to discuss your word Lord May Holy Spirit be with us as you discuss may we say words that are yours and not ours with us as we start till till the very end in Jesus name I believe and pray amen amen amen amen um we have a memory text for this particular um lesson and I would just like to read it over to us um from The Book of John chapter 18 verse 37 and it says pilate therefore said to him are you a king then and Jesus answered you say rightly and I am a king for this cause I was born and for this cause I have come into this world that I should bear witness to the truth and everyone who is of the truth hears my voice there is a particular country whereby we had um the leaders and there was evil happening and in this particular perspective we were having corruption that was taking place in this particular land it reached a point and uh people are questioning this particular leader in terms of we still are experiencing this evil and you just here what are you doing about it and this leader responds and says what more can I do in we say it as and this particular is wondering what what else can I do to save my people and that informs our our lesson for today in terms of the question that God is asking what more could I have done just from the previous lessons that we've been able to have we have been able to understand that God is there with us through the good times the bad times we we have God as as as part of us and even in the midst of um the evils and the bad things that are happening around us it is a tendency for us to start asking ourselves various questions is God really there and if God is really there then why is there so much evil happening and from this we were able to just dive into a different discussion where we were talking about the con Cosmic conflict and here we are looking at if God is really there then why are we experiencing evil in this world why do we have to deal with all these um bad things that are happening to us and it is very very um normal that we get to ask ourselves different questions in terms of um why all these things are happening to us and I just want to give it over to our brother chrisal uh just to be able to take us through in terms of these challenges that that we are going through in terms of these happenings that are are there in our daytoday lives how are we able to ensure that we are maintaining Victory through Christ Our Lord amen uh as you've greatly uh told us it is true throughout the lesson the we have seen and learned that there are two principles that are contending for Supremacy on one end Christ demonstrates to us love and unselfish Justice to us and this has been the continual theme that we have dwelt upon and on the opposite end of the spectrum we see the devil who demonstrates and who demonstrates selfishness who demonstrates the oppos it principles to the kingdom of God and as you see that verily in uh we learned that in the book of um uh John 8:44 we are told that uh the devil was a liar from the beginning the devil fed the LIE he it seems that he the the the principle of of the lie in scripture and even in the in the cosmic uh in the in the world that God created was brought forth in the person of Satan and and through him through him furthering the r the LIE sorry and leading on to the development of its principles in causing Adam and uh Eve to fall into sin he brings out it brought out a need a need because through the LIE we find that Satan ended up causing men to fall into sin and thus creating the need of us realizing what is the contrast of the LIE which is the truth as we know it and through this we see that God has in Christ made a demonstration of the truth to counter the lie because Satan accusations against God could not be countered by his power remember that in in uh The Book of Job that we learned about last week's lesson we saw how Satan comes before God as the accuser of the Brethren accusing them accusing accusing job before the father just take out your protection around him in Job chapter 1 take out and and and we see how God the rules of Engagement as it were how God is very has a moral constraint even how he engages with Satan because we understand that it is not about the demonstration of power but it is about the Vindication of his character in the accusations Satan renders uh before him in the throne and we also have already seen in the lesson that Satan as as as Christ demonstrated um The Truth uh of who the father is remember in John 14:6 the the very the famous text that says that I am the way the truth and the life Christ introducing himself as the embodiment of the truth the truth uh of of of who God is I believe that is what the truth of who God is the way to the father Christ is the way to the father and of course Christ is the life of the father to the world and because of that Christ's demonstration of the truth um uh has a a rle effect of uh finally vindicating not only vindicating the character of God but establishing the kingdom of the of of God in in John 18:37 when Christ is before Pilate uh when he is being um questioned about the accusations it's very interesting that he he he pilate first of all asks him are you a king and then Christ asks answers and says did you ask this question of yourself or did someone else tell you to ask the question and then verse 36 it talks about if the world if if this world would be my kingdom my servants will do what they will fight to maintain the authority therefore the authority of the kingdom of Christ we see there is not an authority demonstrated through the fight of power or through the demonstration of of of of of arms it is a a kingdom established on the principle of who God is that is God is unselfish and now verse 37 which is the focus in in the lesson which is actually our key text in the lesson says that pilate therefore said unto him art thou a king then and Jesus answered thou sayest that I am a king to this end was I born and for this cause came I into the world that I should bear witness to the truth everyone that is of the truth Hearth my voice the reason why Christ has has it's a it's a very um strong response he gives as it it's a very outward response he gives I have come he does not deny it's interesting Christ in all his answer to the questions that pilate asks him he does not deny the fact that he is a king because it is his identity as the king of the world because the authority of Satan remember as we learned last lesson is a usur Authority it is not it is under a temporary Authority on the account of the fall of Adam through the sin of through the sin of Adam and thus we see Christ is here telling telling pilate outrightly the demonstration of the truth is what will the demonstration or the manifestation as a king as though I am not in my Royal robes as a king but I the what the work that God has sent me to do on this Earth is to demonstrate the truth and everyone that is of the truth hear is the voice of the Lord and we see finally that as these principles develop through history and prophecy they are contending they are they are the ones that are contending for the supremacy we see finally the truth will Triumph nothing works against the truth but for the truth in the Book of Psalms um chapter 76:10 says that even the wrath of man shall praise the Lord eventually the truth will Triumph eventually Christ will remain Victorious because the principle of the truth the principle of Justice love and mercy as demonstrated in the life and character of Christ finally will our Eternal principles founded on the character of himself and those are the ones that will remain to the end and the challenge we have today is on which side are we on which are we choosing the lie or are we choosing the truth amen amen um and just to to to to bring us to that particular question which side are we on and I just want to pose a question to Elder oper in terms of Christ being the embodiment of Truth Christ being the embodiment of Victory um in our practical day-to-day lives how are we able to ensure and make sure that we are actually on the Victorious end and we are actually on the winning end uh thank you so much my sister I thank my brother also for enumerating in this we as you look at our topic for today is what more could I have done it is a question of somebody who is posing on what he has done it is like he has reached the ultimate the end then he poses the question what more could I have done but I love the part which my brother brought it starts by depicting Christ as the Victor yeah it the point is that the question has been posed somebody may think it is a question of hopelessness a question of Despair but then the flip side of it is that immediately that Christ is the Victor that um it gives me hope it is a statement of hope that despite all that do you know what Christ is the Victor it starts from from a question of Hess Ness to a statement of Hope and a statement of encouragement that do you know what my brother and sister despite all that Christ is the Victor and now on the question which you have asked we've seen that how is he a Victor we've seen as my brother put it that Satan or the devil or that AR uh deceiver has been clearly depicted that he's a Deceiver though is a deceiver Christ has demonstrated that him is not a deceiver though is a killer Christ is not a killer though he you serer of the rules of this world Christ comes and sets things free and then I love what is in and now the the text itself which we we we read that pilate therefore said to him are you a king then Jesus answered yes says you you say rightly that I am a king for this cause I was born and for this cause I have come into the world that I should bear witness to the truth everyone who is of the truth hears my voice everyone is of Truth so the question is how do we depict this through our choices how do we you know how do we depict this that to demonstrate that we are on the side of Christ the Victor the answer to me I would say it is through our choices through our daily choices we will demonstrate whether we are on the side of Christ who is the Victor who demonstrate it through revealing the truth my word is the truth he says my word is the truth so by living the truth by the choices we make we'll demonstrate that we are on the side of the Victor in simple terms or in simple statement I would say how do we demonstrate that we are on the side of the Victor it is by the choices we make which are the choices of Truth which continues to magnify the truth which Christ came to show and to show that Satan is on the side of Darkness but Christ is on the side of Truth and light thank you so much amen amen thank you Elder for that and uh viewers we just um getting reminded that now when it comes to understanding that Christ is the center of victory in our lives Christ being the center of Truth in our lives and that informs the choices that we are able to make and I love this because now it means that we have a center of Truth we have a place of point to to to just pick it up from but we're getting to understand that within this particular setup we are having a deceiver and the deceiver could also inform um some of the choices that we make and we want to understand as we are moving on to the next part we have the just and the justifier who is the just who's the justifier and I'll just like to roll it over to um our panelist on Soo just to be able to unpack it for us what does it mean who is the just who's the justifier the just and the justifier it says at every turn Christ's work and does the work of the devil it's it's speaking about simply it's exploring this same uh theme of the great controvery in which there are two two Powers at play and it seems as if where the devil is sowing seeds of Discord Christ comes and does a work of pruning he comes and and does a work in which now he he he he sets the Garden in a in a in in a proper in a proper manner and he sets the record straight and you see uh we're told in uh 1 John 3 and ver8 1 John 3 and ver8 speaks to us about part of the work that Christ came to do and it was and and it says that Jesus was revealed for this purpose to destroy the works of the devil so it tells us that there's something that the devil is doing and whatever he's doing is mostly in the minds and in the hearts of men there's there there's there's some propaganda there's some some some information or misinformation that he's spreading especially about God but then what Christ comes to do is to set the record straight to demonstrate that God is Not only just but beyond all that he's also the justifier continues and says um that he came to destroy the one who has the power of death that is the devil that's in Hebrews 2 and verse4 and so uh we are going to look at in considering this then we we realize that this is a work that is done two in in two aspects first through the work of the cross at the cross Christ disapproves Satan and uh his slanderous allegations and Beyond the cross later Satan and his kingdom are destroyed as is proven in the Book of Revelation and so we're going to consider uh these two aspects the first one we will consider from The Book of Romans chapter 3 Romans chapter 3 vers uh 3 sorry verses 23- 26 and and in this in this particular example Paul is is writing to the Romans and to us in general and and he's speaking to us and giving us a message that we ought to understand and to and to internalize about the work of Christ he begins and says in verse 23 he says the following setting the ground that all have sinned and come short of the glory of God there is nobody who is in proper standing there is nobody who is on high ground that they can pull the other there is nobody who can look down upon the other we we are all at high level we all equal all having fallen short of the glory of God all having sinned from Adam to the last person um to each and every single one of us he continues and says in verse 24 being justified freely that's interesting that this justification is Free by who by his grace the grace of God through who through the Redemption that is in Christ Jesus our justification is Free by the grace of who by the grace of God through the Redemption that is where that is in that is in Christ Jesus in verse 22 he says even the righteousness of God which is by faith of Jesus Christ and to all and upon all them that believe for there is no difference and so this is the righteousness of God and the grace of God that justifies us through the Redemption that is in Christ Jesus and so we see Christ undoing the work of the devil first at the cross there he becomes he not only shows that the law of God is just but beyond that he also justifies we who have broken the law of God we find Redemption through his blood in verse 25 he says whom God had set forth to be a propitiation through faith in his blood to declare his righteousness for the remission of sins that are passed through the forbearance of God it shows the mercy of God it shows the patience of God in verse 26 he says to declare I say at this time his righteousness that he might be just and the justifier of him which believed in Jesus and so we see the cross at is is is significant the cross answers the questions that the devil had accused God in heaven in the Reon that the laws of God are restrictive that God himself can has not bound himself to these laws why should we be contained by them but we see Christ coming in the form of of mankind and proving that indeed that the law of God is a law of love and of justice and of mercy and at the cross Justice and mercy kissed each other and righteousness reigned through Grace Christ then is proven to be just and equally the justifier sister white writes in the book Desire of Ages page 761 and says the following after the death of Jesus Satan saw that his disguise was thror away his administration was laid open before the unfallen angels and before the Heavenly Universe he revealed he he he had revealed himself as a murderer by shedding the blood of the Son of God he had uprooted himself from the sympathies of the Heavenly beings you see the angels in heaven always had doubts the questions that the devil had had raised in the Rebellion had never truly been answered completely but yet they chose to keep to keep their fast estate because they kept their chiefest allegiance to God though the questions were there they decided to stick with God but then you see on the cross Christ answered all their questions at the cross the devil was undressed at the cross as as as as sister white writes and says he had revealed himself as a m Christ showed that God is just and Beyond it at the cross he justified those who believe in him therefore he is both the just and the justifier now we called to consider Revelation chapter 12 verse 10 to2 what are the some of the implications uh of of the cross the Bible writes in Revelation 12: 10 John in Vision says and I heard a loud voice saying in heaven now is come salvation and strength and the kingdom of our God and the power of His Christ for the accuser of our Brethren the accuser of our Brethren is cast down which accus them before our God day and night we have found justification we have found somebody who says yes they did that but I paid it I I shed my blood says in verse 11 and the they overcame him they have overcame this accuser mean meaning he has got files you know like a prosecutor he's got evidence he's got he's got as we say evidence on paper perhaps even on record on video but it says this is a secret the recipe and they overcame him by the blood of the lamb and by the word of their testimony and they love not their lives unto death verse 12 continues and says therefore Rejoice ye heavens and he that dwell in them but W to the inhabitants of the earth and of the sea for the Devil is come down unto you with what having great threat why because he knoweth he hath but a short time from the time of the cross the devil knows this thing has been sealed Victory the the winner you know this it comes a time in a football match where the other side has has beaten you goals you know you know the goals are just overwhelming you know the way this thing is going to end at the cross this match was set it's only we are just waiting for the referee to blow the final whistle and those who are found in Christ will carry the trophy he is both the just and the justifier the lesson asks us in addition to consider Genesis 3 and verse1 15 which is the first gospel message to Adam and Eve in the Garden of Eden he speaks about the enemity between the the devil and the seed of the woman who is Christ that he will bruise his heel but the seed of the woman Christ would crush his heel almost exactly what happened at the cross we see Christ delivered a deadly blow a blow that the devil has never recovered from and never will and there at the cross Christ is proven to both be the just and the justifier and so we know that victory has been assured we know that God and His law are just and we know that by faith in his Redeeming Grace we likewise are justified by his sacrifice on the cross beautiful beautiful um uh Indulgence there by our brother onogo uh just to be able to understand that God is the just and the justifier and through the Redemption of God we we are justified through the Redemption of God I want to pose a question just to our sister renise in terms of the works on the cross in terms of the Redemption plan of God how are we able to be confident that indeed um God loves us that God is for us even when we undergoing through trials and Temptations in our daily lives sister reice thanks I and from the discussion that we've had when we just read the topic of the lesson for this week what more could I have done it gives you a state of hopelessness and Desperation because you're saying if God who is the creator who is almight who is all powerful is crying like this then what hope do I have but I want to thank God that it is not that because is not going to win it's just like RAF has used the football analogy the devil knows that he's losing and God knows that he's winning and that's why he continues to demonstrate his love and righteousness because if you was like feeling like I might lose or not you start getting desperate and Breaking the Rules of Engagement that we had discussed last week but since God is very confident in still engaging The Rules of Engagement I know that we are victorious and you see also this war is not about mle power showing I'm the one who is powerful here it can only be demonstrated and worn through love and because God is confident and is just waiting for things to play out I'm happy that the Plan of Salvation has to succeed it was instituted before the foundation of the earth and it is in progress as expected so me and you we are just waiting for the second coming of Jesus Christ for us to say celebrate the victory amen amen amen amen thank you sister renise and um we we are just trying to to get a hold of this uh love that is being shared greatly um from our maker and bringing us deeply into the the cosmic conflict and just telling us How Deeply God loves us and how much of free will he has given unto us in terms of just being able to love him genuinely um as our God and as our savior and I want to roll it over to our Elder oper in just highlighting um this kind of um of love that is there for us this kind of love that has been manifested um through the different ways um through the the works on the cross through the Redemption plan and getting to to understand um this particular song that God is actually calling us his beloved uh thank you so much I think um uh my my my my fellow uh panelists have really dwelt with this matter and really conversed it very well what more could I have done and in the song we find in the book of Isaiah chapter 5 God's disappoint pointing vineard and the text says now let me sing to my well beloved I think when you read that statement you look forward to hearing some sweet song of your beloved which I think even in the current generation we can use it the lyrics which even the genes of people who are cting can can really use these lyrics but now the turn of events can that a song of my beloved regarding his vineard still to so sweet my well beloved as a vineard on a very beautiful Fruit Hill he dug it up and cleared out its stones and planted it with the choicest vine he built a tower in its midest and also made a wine press in it so he expected it to bring forth good grapes but it now that is where things go wrong but it brought forth wild grips you see here we were asking what else would I do but God is again demonstrating something here is's continuing to build a case to build a case of what somebody would ask okay what did you do because the question is what more would I have done the question is what have you done now he brings us things which he has done he first of all says he had a garden very beautiful one a fruit Hill it must be a very fertile Place very strategic he did all that is could could be done if it is today people go for fruit trees they go to those sites of sagana if it is here in Kenya people go to kamani they get very good they go to maybe kre and all that to get Goods seedlings he all he did all this the weather he he did all that could be done but lo and behold what came out was terrible it was now uh but it brought forth wild grapes the other translation says worthless stinking fruits why was it so uh and now he says now God calls our attention I want you to reflect upon Ponder and make judgment for yourself inviting us also to make the Judgment now beloved this uh the vine owner this this Vine owner depicts God himself this is God himself and the vine dressers are a people who should have been be the people responsible by extent people who should believe like you and me who should take the right decision vineard the the the vineard honor is God himself and the vineard represents God's people but the implication here can also be expanded relative to God's broader work in this world you see God is the vine the vineard owner but the the the the the other people the vineard workers and all that represent people who should have taken responsibility what God you and I who are the recipients of God's doing he makes the fertile atmosphere he gives you opportunity in terms of good health my dear brother and sister he gives us opportunity in terms of good health in terms of resources but at the end of it instead of reciprocating the good things the vineard owner has done we do the contrary this one helps us to build the case a God to build the case what more should I have done and then in conclusion it says uh you see he shifts in verse three he shifts and now oh inhabitants of Jerusalem and Men of Judah judge please between me and my Vineyard what more could I have done to my vineard that I have not done in it why then when I expect it to bring forth good grapes did it bring forth Wild grapes and now please let me tell you what I will do to my vineard I will take away its hedge and it shall be burned and break down its wall and it shall be trampled down I don't want to go to the consequences but they are very critical that God because of God's loves he gives us from end to end though from the rule of Engagement he respects our will and but the because of love he reveals to us I give to you life and death but what do you know what you should do choose life and you'll get it will be eternal life that is how he gives us even the leakage if it was in an exam he gives us even the leakage that but do this just do this Beloved the thing is God has done is doing is done all that could be done good employment maybe blessings of the family all that but he says are we reciprocating all that for His Glory thank you amen amen thank you Elder and just from that we are getting to hear about this beautiful song I mean if if uh a poem is going to start with my beloved you know love is going to be uh spoken in so um uh big words and uh in so much dep and just from that uh particular um discussion we're getting to to see that God has given it his all and even when we started the lesson uh the question is what more could I have done I could just give it to our brother onogo just to be able to tell us what what is the significance of this particular question that is being asked what more could I have done just from this particular song from The Vineyard indeed uh I'd like to Echo a thought that per uh gave us this the setting of a classroom and it's a critical exam that's going to determine your future it's literally an exam of life and death but the one who set the exam sits next to you and tells you write this you know here I write this here literally that's that's what salvation is like it's not something that God has given us to figure out you know it's like a puzzle or like a maze you know like the way people say you're looking uh the people go for pilgrimage in India to find themselves you know it's very difficult to find this spirituality to find to locate yourself and to to transcend and and and to find the way of Buddha no when you when it comes to the way of Salvation Christ says lo I am with you even to the end of the age he says he's there with us on our right hand you will hear a voice telling you this is the way and so when he's speaking about this Vineyard you see even the way it says he he put it on a very fruitful Hill and and he doesn't he doesn't simply call it another vineard he says it my beloved like this is a vineard that he has poured himself into he says he fenced it and then he even put stones around not it's like he's fencing he's doing more than fencing and then after that he says he even at some point he says he built a tower in the midst of it and so as in he's doing so much to provide its security and then he planted the choicest vines and it is we are told that of course the rain also came he provided everything then he didn't it did not produce what more can a farmer do you know what more can a farmer do what more can a farmer do and in this particular context we are told about in Romans 5 and: 8 he says but God commandeth his love towards us in that while we were yet sinners Christ died for us while we were yet sinners Christ died for us and so when we look at the cross in the light of John 3:16 that God so loved the world that he gave his only you know when you give your only thing your only son you have given all your sons if you've if you given your only begotten son you've given all your sons so God gave everything he was left with nothing so the question indeed is what more could he have done he had even given himself the answer is UN overwhelming and overwhelming there is nothing more there is nothing more God has done whatever God has done is enough in fact it is more than enough to secure our Salvation amen it is only for us to respond to the call of God amen amen amen um that the ball is now on our court and um what you're going to do is um based on us and the choices that you're going to make and um picking it up from there we are getting from this particular song in Isaiah um 5 and from the particular song um later on when Christ um uh comes to us and he's released to us and Christ is able to pick it up from there from the song that was given in the book of Isaiah now Christ comes and brings it to us in a different Manner and we are getting that he shares it to us in form of a parable the parable of the vineyard sister renice please unpack for us the parable of the vineyard let us get to understand how is this connected when a lesson is repeated it seems like you didn't get it the the first time so at that point Isaiah explained to us what is it and now Jesus because we didn't get it is making it more simpler using a parable and so in the Book of Matthew chapter 2133 to39 the Lord even goes ahead to explain what these symbols mean so that we cannot Fain ignorance that we didn't get it and so he says the parable is about God's relationship with the humanity especially how he sent prophets and ultimately his son Jesus to call people back to him and they were rejected and killed the vineard represents the world the tenants represent those entrusted with authority and the landowner represents God and how is this played in our daytoday life at that point in time it was the tenants refused to acknowledge the owner's Authority and mistreated his Messengers it basically shows us how we have rejected God's Messengers in modern society many reject God's truth today just as people rejected the prophets and Jesus many Christians values are being pushed aside in favor of secularism faith-based morals are often seen as outd ated and those who stand for biblical truth face persecution and we see that biblical views of morality family and integrity are increasingly being censored in the media and in schools and the Bible continues to remind us that they hated me without a reason that is from John 15:25 and also the Bible encourages us that blessed are those who are persecuted because of righteousness for theirs is the Kingdom of Heaven that is from The Book of Matthew 5: 10 and that behooves us as Christians that we should boldly take stand for our faith even when it's unpopular the other thing is that corruption and Injustice by those in Authority at that point in time we see the tenants were entrusted to manage the vineyard but became greedy and unjust in the current modern days leaders in government business and even in churches often abuse the power instead of serving justly leaders are entrusted with governing governing fairly often exploit people for personal gain just like the tenants who wanted to steal the inheritance and we see that even in big businesses they exploit for profit just as the tenants exploited the land they were given and the Bible continues to encourage us and tell us wo to those who make unjust laws to those who issue oppressive decrees that is Isaiah 10: 1 and also we are reminded that the love of money is the root of all kinds of evil that is first Timothy 6 and10 and then the other lesson that we need to learn is that we are disregarding Jesus and his teaching at that point in time the tenants killed the Landon's son thinking they could take the inheritance for themselves and now what we are doing many people still reject Jesus today living as though they're in control of their own lives without God many want the blessings of God and his kingdom but reject his authority some claim Christianity but refuse to follow biblical principles people make their own laws and about right and wrong instead of following God's word just as it was in the case in the days of Judges as recorded in judges 2125 and many are prioritizing wealth success and pleasure of a seeking God just as warned in Matthew 633 and what we are reminded is that for what shall it profit a man if he gains the whole world and lose his own soul so for us this day we are called to reflect do we truly honor Jesus in our daily decisions or do we reject him by the way that we live and when you are doing all these things just like the tenants us killed the servants killed those who are sent and finally killed the son we will not Escape God's judgment will come because then we see that the landowner who is God eventually brings judgment on the wicked tenants and even for us now there will be consequences for rejecting God both in this life and in eternity Nations and individuals who persist in sin without repentance eventually face consequences God is patient and he will bring judgment and we see judgments in environmental crisises and natural disasters many of today's disasters are reminder that we are not in control and should turn to God that is Luke 2111 and also the the moral and social Decay societies that turn from God face increased violence broken families and lawlessness and the Bible continues to remind me and you do not be deceived God cannot be mocked a man reaps what he s and so this morning I would encourage us also to reflect on this fact that are we living in a way that prepare us for Christ soon return or we are ignoring his warnings and living as if it is business as usual amen amen amen ah beautiful beautiful sharings um from our sister rise and just getting to understand that God has done it all for us and it is upon us to do what is right and actually there are consequences in in rejection and rejecting what uh God has done and just to pick it up from there our sister Whitney uh maybe just to highlight to us in terms of the the griefs uh the sorrow that um God has gone through just to bring to us Redemption just to bring to us Sal salvation and what what does it mean um in terms of all these sacrifices uh that God has made on our behalf thank you so much sister irin Christ B our grief and sorrow he took upon himself the pain the suffering and judgment that you deserve because of our sins we learn this he he has done everything for us God has done everything for our salvation when you see clearly the book that we always talk about John 3:16 for God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have everlasting life God has done everything for our salvation and salvation came at the highest cost the cost of his only begotten son and also the cost of the life of Jesus Christ himself we are given salvation freely but it does not mean that it is cheap it cost life it cost God his only son so let's live with gratitude let's surrender to God's love because we are no longer bound by grief or Sorrows because Christ Christ paid it all for us amen amen beautiful beautiful there um Christ has paid it all for us and we can just be able to see that through the works of God the Father the Son and the Holy Spirit we've been able to get the Plan of Redemption and we're able to also get the perfect plan for righteousness in God and the love of God is manifested to us in different ways in different manners but the question is how is God's name Vindicated and I will give it to our sister Whitney just to tell us exactly how is God's name Vindicated thank you so much uh in our world today we always have relationships and it's not easy to have love relationship with someone you do not trust and you do not believe in so we cannot have a deep that deep love relationship with someone whose character we detest or we do not trust and we love God and God wants us to have that genuine relationship with him that's why he has to clear his name from the blames and suspicions and allegations that are brought by the devil so through the the work of the Father the Son and the Holy Spirit In The Plan of Redemption the perfect righteousness the love of God is manifested beyond any reasonable doubt when you read the book of Romans 58 all while yet while we were yet sinners Christ died for us that's how much Christ God loves us he vindicates his name so we have we have read the book Isaiah Isaiah chapter chapter 5 verse um three and four and from this all we learn that God has done everything possible for Humanity he has he has made everything possible for us first of all he gave his he sent his only son to die for us we've learned about that in John 3:16 he allowed sin to reveal itself he could have just killed Satan from the very beginning but he did not do that he gave time for us to see that he's rightous he's just we've just learned that he's just first and is the justifier instead of destroying Satan immediately God permitted sin to unfold so that we could all see its true nature and also God gave his word to and and the prophets he gave his words and Prophets to us who who came before and showed us the way H we've learned the story of the parable where he sent prophets to come tell us everything he gave us even the Ten Commandments to guide us on how we need to act as human beings everything God has done for us he worked through his people he's manifested a lot of stuff for us to really learn from him all this vindicates his name we know that the final judgment and destruction of sin will prove that God had could not have done more like he has done everything he has shown infinite patience love and Justice his name is fully Vindicated when all creation acknowledges his righteousness as we read the book of of Revelation chter 15 I'll take you through Revelation 15 verse 3 Revelation 15:3 says and they sing the song of Moses the servant of God the song of the lamp saying great and marvelous are thy Works Lord God Almighty just in true are thy ways Thou King of saints and just to add on that let's read re 19 191 to6 which is the marriage supper of the lamb and it says and after these things I heard a great voice of such people in heaven saying Allelujah salvation and glory and honor and power unto the Lord Our God for true and righteous are his judgments for Heath judged the great whom which did corrupt the Earth with her fornication and have Avenged the blood of his servant at her hand and again they said Allelujah and her smoke rose up forever and ever and the four and the 20 elders and four Beast fell down and worshiped God that sat on the throne saying amen Allelujah and a voice came out of the throne saying praise a God all ye servants and ye that fear Him both small and great and I heard as it were the voice of a great multitude and as the voice of many Waters and as the voice of Mighty Thunder saying Allelujah for the Lord God omnipotent reth god reigns in everything he vindicates his name at the at the very end because we know the Bible also says in the book of Philippians 2:12 that every knee shall bow and every tongue shall confess that Jesus Christ is Lord he vindicate himself he has done everything possible for us Humanity to claim salvation though it's free it's not cheap let's let's be ready let's let's do that which is right he has given us everything what more could he have done what more could God have done to you amen amen thank you so much uh sister Whitney and just um being able to to take us through how God vindicates himself and he's loving intentions towards us um and uh just one wanting to roll it over to the panel in terms of just giving us a closing remark when it comes to um this particular learnings for today and I'll start over with elder op per just to share with us what what are the the the the the takeaways that uh we are having for for today uh thank you so much uh my sister I think um as we are asking our question the question we had asked that what more could I have done I can see that though the statement may look A desperate situation God has revealed to us that he's gone to Greater lengths to ensure that we make the right choice I realize that there are many things we may not know but despite that I also find out that God may not always get what he wants that what what we learned last time the unfulfilled desires we may not get all that he wants but he grants us the freedom to choose because of the Rules of Engagement for love to thrive like it was presented for love to thrive the freedom of choice must be respected but with all that in the cosmic conflict God always does everything he can to bring about the best good for all and he will find finally eradicate evil forever it is ours to choose amen God thank you amen our sister with me I learned one thing God has done everything for us the vineard failed him and you know he gave consequences to that and also to us God has given us the very ultimate end and he says in the Book of Romans chapter 6:23 for the wages of sin is death but the gift of God is eternal life through Christ Jesus our lord let's choose life let's CH Jesus Christ and let's choose to do that which is right thank you amen amen um Romans 3 begins by saying what prophet there is there of circumcision much in every way uh chiefly that unto them that is the Jews was committed the Oracles of God but what if some did not believe shall their unbelief make the faith of God without effect the question is I can I I I will um as I meditate on that question what if some did not believe shall the demonstration of faith and love and Justice and mercy from God and all the advantages he has given to us shall it be without effect of course Paul answers that question by saying God forbid and to the end we see all so that the principles of the of Satan are opposed to the principles of Love Justice and mercy to God and we are told that as the days go along the evil shall works works and worse and because of that in Matthew 24:12 we are told the love of many will grow cold but the the challenge we have I want to leave uh our dear brother and sister who is watching us that the as the love of many will grow cold is your love the the challenge that but he that endures to the end he that continues growing in in looking at the demonstration of the love of God and keeping themselves within that confine of what God has done for you he that endures to the end the same shall be saved may we be those in Jesus name amen amen our brother was so good I think I would like us to consider uh the father thought on Friday it says all that has us reading from uh testimonies for the church volume 9 page 286 it says all that has perplexed Us in the providences of God will in the world to come be made plain the things had to be understood will then find explanation the mysteries of Grace will unfold before us where our in where where our finite Minds discovered only confusion and broken promises we shall see the most perfect and beautiful Harmony we shall know that infinite love ordered the experiences that seemed most trying as we realize the tender care of him who makes all things work together for our good we shall rejoice with joy unspeakable and full of glory god is both the just and the justifier let us just hold him faithful and and and wait on him and truly we shall understand it better by and by amen amen amen amen our sister re after God has done for us all including singing for us what's my response what I would like to say is that let's learn from the mistakes of others we don't have to make the same mistakes for us to learn and my response as a Christian and as a seventhday Adventist is waiting for the soon return of Jesus Christ is to accept and honor Jesus daily is to be a good Steward of What the Lord Has entrusted me with is to stand for righteousness even when it's hard and to daily prepare for his soon return I hope you'll join me in this journey amen ah beautiful beautiful there by our panelists um our brothers and sisters it has been a wonderful sharing just to get to understand God is a God of Justice he's the just and he's the justifier and he's able to reach out in so many loving ways he loves us he he adors us and he wants to have a relationship with us we've been able to even get to the point of learning that even God through his word is able to share with us the the secrets of his place and it is upon us to to to choose and get to know him better and have a relationship with him wanting to wish us of course a wonderful Sabbath as we continue to engage throughout the day and um as we also prepare for love and Justice the two greatest Commandments uh that is coming in the next Sabbath thank you very much have a beautiful Sabbath happy Sabbath to all of us okay let's believe and pray our kind and loving father and master Art in Heaven we thank you and praise your name for everything that you've done for for us dear Lord indeed what more could you have done I pray dear Lord that we believe help our

[180.3s] end in Jesus name I believe and pray
[183.1s] amen amen amen amen um we have a memory
[187.4s] text for this particular um lesson and I
[190.6s] would just like to read it over to us um
[193.4s] from The Book of John chapter 18 verse
[197.2s] 37 and it says pilate therefore said to
[201.6s] him are you a king then and Jesus
[206.0s] answered you say rightly and I am a king
[209.9s] for this cause I was born and for this
[212.8s] cause I have come into this world that I
[215.7s] should bear witness to the truth and
[219.0s] everyone who is of the truth hears my
[223.1s] voice there is a particular country
[226.1s] whereby we had um the leaders and there
[230.0s] was evil happening and in this
[232.6s] particular perspective we were having
[234.8s] corruption that was taking place in this
[237.6s] particular land it reached a point
[240.2s] and uh people are questioning this
[242.2s] particular leader in terms of we still
[245.5s] are experiencing this evil and you just
[248.4s] here what are you doing about it and
[250.6s] this leader responds and says what more
[253.9s] can I
[255.8s] do in we say it
[260.2s] as and this particular is wondering what
[264.0s] what else can I do to save my people and
[268.3s] that informs our our lesson for today in
[271.9s] terms of the question that God is asking
[275.1s] what more could I have done just from
[277.4s] the previous lessons that we've been
[278.8s] able to have we have been able to
[282.6s] understand that God is there with us
[285.3s] through the good times the bad times we
[288.5s] we have God as as as part of us and even
[293.5s] in the midst of um the evils and the bad
[298.1s] things that are happening around us it
[300.8s] is a tendency for us to start asking
[304.0s] ourselves various questions is God
[307.4s] really there and if God is really there
[310.9s] then why is there so much evil happening
[314.3s] and from this we were able to just dive
[318.3s] into a different discussion where we
[320.1s] were talking about the con Cosmic
[323.1s] conflict and here we are looking at if
[326.4s] God is really there then why are we
[329.1s] experiencing evil in this world why do
[331.8s] we have to deal with all these um bad
[334.6s] things that are happening to us and it
[337.7s] is very very um normal that we get to
[342.4s] ask ourselves different questions in
[345.1s] terms of um why all these things are
[348.0s] happening to us and I just want to give
[351.0s] it over to our brother chrisal uh just
[354.3s] to be able to take us through in terms
[358.0s] of these challenges that that we are
[360.0s] going through in terms of these
[361.8s] happenings that are are there in our
[364.2s] daytoday lives how are we able to ensure
[368.6s] that we are maintaining Victory through
[372.4s] Christ Our Lord amen uh as you've
[377.0s] greatly uh told us it is true throughout
[381.8s] the lesson the we have seen and learned
[386.5s] that there are two
[389.8s] principles that are contending for
[392.8s] Supremacy on one end Christ demonstrates
[396.6s] to us love and unselfish Justice to us
[401.8s] and this has been the continual theme
[404.7s] that we have dwelt upon and on the
[408.0s] opposite end of the spectrum we see the
[412.7s] devil who demonstrates and who
[416.0s] demonstrates selfishness who
[418.0s] demonstrates the oppos it principles to
[421.1s] the kingdom of God and as you see that
[425.0s] verily in uh we learned that in the book
[427.9s] of um uh John 8:44 we are told that uh
[433.3s] the devil was a liar from the beginning
[437.0s] the devil fed the LIE he it seems that
[441.2s] he the the the principle of of the lie
[445.9s] in scripture and even in the in the
[448.6s] cosmic uh in the in the world that God
[451.7s] created was brought forth in the person
[455.5s] of Satan and and through him through him
[460.0s] furthering the r the LIE sorry and
[463.1s] leading on to the development of its
[466.3s] principles in causing Adam and uh Eve to
[470.4s] fall into sin he brings out it brought
[475.4s] out a need a need because through the
[478.9s] LIE we find that Satan ended up causing
[484.6s] men to fall into
[486.7s] sin and thus creating the need of us
[491.0s] realizing what is the contrast of the
[494.3s] LIE which is the truth as we know it and
[499.0s] through this we see that God has in
[503.1s] Christ made a demonstration of the truth
[507.0s] to counter the lie because Satan
[510.5s] accusations against God could not be
[513.2s] countered by his power remember that in
[517.4s] in uh The Book of Job that we learned
[519.5s] about last week's lesson we saw how
[522.9s] Satan comes before God as the accuser of
[526.2s] the Brethren accusing them accusing
[530.2s] accusing job before the father just take
[533.2s] out your protection around him in Job
[536.1s] chapter 1 take out and and and we see
[538.6s] how God the rules of Engagement as it
[540.6s] were how God is very has a moral
[543.6s] constraint even how he engages with
[546.6s] Satan because we understand that it is
[550.0s] not about the demonstration of power but
[553.0s] it is about the Vindication of his
[555.3s] character in the accusations Satan
[558.3s] renders uh before him in the throne and
[562.7s] we also have already seen in the lesson
[566.0s] that Satan as as as Christ
[570.0s] demonstrated um The Truth uh of who the
[573.6s] father is remember in John
[576.2s] 14:6 the the very the famous text that
[579.2s] says that I am the way the truth and the
[582.4s] life Christ introducing himself as the
[585.1s] embodiment of the truth the truth uh of
[589.2s] of of who God is I believe that is what
[591.7s] the truth of who God is the way to the
[594.5s] father Christ is the way to the father
[596.8s] and of course Christ is the life of the
[599.6s] father to the world and because of that
[602.8s] Christ's demonstration of the truth um
[607.1s] uh has a a rle effect
[612.6s] of uh finally vindicating not only
[616.1s] vindicating the character of God but
[618.2s] establishing the kingdom of the of of
[620.4s] God in in John 18:37 when Christ is
[624.5s] before Pilate uh when he is being um
[628.8s] questioned
[630.2s] about the accusations it's very
[631.6s] interesting that
[633.4s] he he he pilate first of all asks him
[637.5s] are you a king and then Christ asks
[639.4s] answers and says did you ask this
[641.7s] question of yourself or did someone else
[643.8s] tell you to ask the question and then
[646.1s] verse 36 it talks about if the world if
[650.6s] if this world would be my kingdom my
[653.3s] servants will do what they will
[656.6s] fight to maintain the authority
[660.2s] therefore the authority of the kingdom
[662.2s] of Christ we see there is not an
[665.5s] authority demonstrated through the fight
[669.7s] of power or through the demonstration of
[672.8s] of of of of arms it is a a kingdom
[677.4s] established on the principle of who God
[680.4s] is that is God is unselfish and now
[684.2s] verse 37 which is the focus in in the
[687.0s] lesson which is actually our key text in
[689.0s] the lesson says that pilate therefore
[691.1s] said unto him art thou a king then and
[696.3s] Jesus
[697.7s] answered thou sayest that I am a king to
[701.3s] this end was I born and for this cause
[704.8s] came I into the world that I should bear
[709.3s] witness to the truth everyone that is of
[713.4s] the truth Hearth my voice the reason why
[716.2s] Christ has has it's a it's a very
[720.7s] um
[722.9s] strong response he gives as it it's a
[726.3s] very outward response he gives I have
[730.4s] come he does not deny it's interesting
[733.2s] Christ in all his answer to the
[735.6s] questions that pilate asks him he does
[739.4s] not deny the fact that he is a king
[742.6s] because it is his
[744.8s] identity as the king of the world
[747.7s] because the authority of Satan remember
[750.9s] as we learned last lesson is a usur
[753.5s] Authority it is not it is under a
[756.6s] temporary Authority on the account of
[759.5s] the fall of Adam through the sin of
[763.0s] through the sin of Adam and thus we see
[765.9s] Christ is here telling telling pilate
[771.9s] outrightly the demonstration of the
[774.5s] truth is what will the demonstration or
[778.2s] the manifestation as a king as though I
[782.1s] am not in my Royal robes as a king but I
[786.8s] the what the work that God has sent me
[788.7s] to do on this Earth is to demonstrate
[791.7s] the truth and everyone that is of the
[793.7s] truth hear is the voice of the Lord and
[796.6s] we see finally that as these principles
[801.4s] develop through history and prophecy
[804.0s] they are contending they are they are
[806.6s] the ones that are contending for the
[808.3s] supremacy we see finally the truth will
[811.4s] Triumph nothing works against the truth
[814.9s] but for the truth in the Book of Psalms
[818.7s] um chapter 76:10 says that even the
[823.2s] wrath of man shall praise the Lord
[826.4s] eventually the truth will Triumph
[829.7s] eventually Christ will remain Victorious
[833.2s] because the principle of the truth the
[836.4s] principle of Justice love and mercy
[839.7s] as demonstrated in the life and
[842.4s] character of Christ finally will our
[845.8s] Eternal principles founded on the
[848.3s] character of himself and those are the
[851.0s] ones that will remain to the end and the
[854.1s] challenge we have today is on which side
[857.4s] are we on which are we choosing the lie
[860.6s] or are we choosing the truth amen amen
[864.7s] um and just to to to to bring us to that
[868.0s] particular question which side are we on
[871.0s] and I just want to pose a question to
[873.7s] Elder oper in terms of Christ being the
[876.6s] embodiment of Truth Christ being the
[879.3s] embodiment of Victory um in our
[882.6s] practical day-to-day lives how are we
[885.3s] able to ensure and make sure that we are
[889.5s] actually on the Victorious end and we
[892.0s] are actually on the winning
[894.3s] end uh thank you so much my sister I
[897.2s] thank my brother also for enumerating in
[899.6s] this we as you look at our topic for
[902.6s] today is what more could I have done it
[906.7s] is a question of somebody who is posing
[910.4s] on what he has done it is like he has
[913.4s] reached the
[915.2s] ultimate the end then he poses the
[918.3s] question what more could I have done but
[921.2s] I love the part which my brother brought
[923.6s] it starts by depicting Christ as the
[927.4s] Victor yeah it the point is that the
[931.0s] question has been posed somebody may
[932.8s] think it is a question of hopelessness a
[935.9s] question of Despair but then the flip
[940.1s] side of it is that immediately that
[942.6s] Christ is the Victor that um it gives me
[947.0s] hope it is a statement of hope that
[951.0s] despite all that do you know what Christ
[954.4s] is the Victor it starts from from a
[958.1s] question of Hess Ness to a statement of
[961.6s] Hope and a statement of encouragement
[964.7s] that do you know what my brother and
[966.6s] sister despite all that Christ is the
[969.8s] Victor and now on the question which you
[972.8s] have asked we've seen that how is he a
[976.2s] Victor we've seen as my brother put it
[979.4s] that Satan or the devil or that AR uh
[984.6s] deceiver has been clearly depicted that
[988.1s] he's a Deceiver though is a deceiver
[990.7s] Christ has demonstrated that him is not
[994.0s] a deceiver though is a killer Christ is
[997.5s] not a killer though he you serer of the
[1001.4s] rules of this world Christ comes and
[1005.0s] sets things free and then I love what is
[1008.4s] in and now the the text itself which we
[1011.2s] we we read that pilate therefore said to
[1014.2s] him are you a king then Jesus answered
[1017.4s] yes says you you say rightly that I am a
[1022.4s] king for this cause I was born and for
[1025.4s] this cause I have come into the world
[1027.9s] that I should bear witness to the truth
[1031.2s] everyone who is of the truth hears my
[1034.9s] voice everyone is of Truth so the
[1037.6s] question is how do we depict this
[1040.4s] through our choices how do we you know
[1043.4s] how do we depict this that to
[1045.9s] demonstrate that we are on the side of
[1048.4s] Christ the Victor the answer to me I
[1051.6s] would say it is through our choices
[1054.8s] through our daily
[1056.6s] choices we will
[1058.8s] demonstrate whether we are on the side
[1062.6s] of Christ who is the Victor who
[1065.8s] demonstrate it through revealing the
[1069.1s] truth my word is the truth he says my
[1072.5s] word is the truth so by living the truth
[1075.4s] by the choices we make we'll demonstrate
[1079.0s] that we are on the side of the Victor in
[1083.2s] simple terms or in simple statement I
[1085.8s] would say how do we demonstrate that we
[1089.3s] are on the side of the Victor it is by
[1092.4s] the choices we make which are the
[1095.2s] choices of Truth which continues to
[1098.4s] magnify the truth which Christ came to
[1101.2s] show and to show that Satan is on the
[1104.8s] side of Darkness but Christ is on the
[1107.3s] side of Truth and light thank you so
[1110.1s] much amen amen thank you Elder for that
[1113.5s] and uh viewers we just um getting
[1116.1s] reminded that now when it comes to
[1119.4s] understanding that Christ is the center
[1122.0s] of victory in our lives Christ being the
[1125.2s] center of Truth in our lives and that
[1127.8s] informs the choices that we are able to
[1131.4s] make and I love this because now it
[1134.8s] means that we have a center of Truth we
[1138.2s] have a place of point to to to just pick
[1141.8s] it up from but we're getting to
[1144.7s] understand that within this particular
[1147.5s] setup we are having a
[1150.9s] deceiver and the deceiver could also
[1153.6s] inform um some of the choices that we
[1156.3s] make and we want to understand as we are
[1160.4s] moving on to the next part we have the
[1163.2s] just and the justifier who is the just
[1166.6s] who's the justifier and I'll just like
[1169.0s] to roll it over to um our panelist on
[1173.2s] Soo just to be able to unpack it for us
[1176.8s] what does it mean who is the just who's
[1179.5s] the justifier the just and the justifier
[1182.0s] it says at every turn Christ's work and
[1185.4s] does the work of the devil it's it's
[1188.0s] speaking about simply it's exploring
[1190.8s] this same uh theme of the great
[1192.4s] controvery in which there are two two
[1195.0s] Powers at play and it seems as if where
[1198.9s] the devil is sowing seeds of Discord
[1201.7s] Christ comes and does a work of pruning
[1204.5s] he comes and and does a work in which
[1206.9s] now he he he he sets the Garden in a in
[1209.8s] a in in a proper in a proper manner and
[1212.9s] he sets the record straight and you see
[1215.2s] uh we're told in uh 1 John 3 and ver8 1
[1219.6s] John 3 and ver8 speaks to us about part
[1222.1s] of the work that Christ came to do and
[1224.4s] it was and and it says that Jesus was
[1227.6s] revealed for this purpose
[1229.2s] to destroy the works of the devil so it
[1232.6s] tells us that there's something that the
[1233.8s] devil is doing and whatever he's doing
[1236.5s] is mostly in the minds and in the hearts
[1239.4s] of men there's there there's there's
[1243.4s] some propaganda there's some some some
[1246.8s] information or misinformation that he's
[1249.4s] spreading especially about God but then
[1252.3s] what Christ comes to do is to set the
[1254.5s] record straight to
[1256.3s] demonstrate that God is Not only just
[1259.4s] but beyond all that he's also the
[1261.8s] justifier continues and says um that he
[1265.7s] came to destroy the one who has the
[1268.1s] power of death that is the devil that's
[1270.7s] in Hebrews 2 and verse4 and so uh we are
[1275.4s] going to look at in considering this
[1278.0s] then we we realize that this is a work
[1279.9s] that is done two in in two
[1282.5s] aspects first through the work of the
[1285.5s] cross at the cross Christ disapproves
[1288.1s] Satan
[1289.2s] and uh his slanderous allegations and
[1291.6s] Beyond the cross later Satan and his
[1294.4s] kingdom are destroyed as is proven in
[1297.2s] the Book of Revelation and so we're
[1299.0s] going to consider uh these two aspects
[1301.6s] the first one we will consider from The
[1303.3s] Book of Romans chapter 3 Romans chapter
[1307.1s] 3 vers uh 3 sorry verses 23- 26 and and
[1313.6s] in this in this particular example Paul
[1316.9s] is is writing to the Romans and to us in
[1320.2s] general and and he's speaking to us and
[1321.8s] giving us a message that we ought to
[1324.9s] understand and to and to internalize
[1327.2s] about the work of Christ he begins and
[1329.4s] says in verse 23 he says the following
[1332.9s] setting the ground that all have sinned
[1336.1s] and come short of the glory of God there
[1338.9s] is nobody who is in proper standing
[1342.2s] there is nobody who is on high ground
[1344.4s] that they can pull the other there is
[1346.0s] nobody who can look down upon the other
[1348.3s] we we are all at high level we all equal
[1351.1s] all having fallen short of the glory of
[1353.1s] God all having sinned from Adam to the
[1356.4s] last person um to each and every single
[1359.2s] one of us he continues and says in verse
[1362.2s] 24 being justified
[1365.7s] freely that's interesting that this
[1368.5s] justification is
[1370.5s] Free by who by his grace the grace of
[1374.8s] God through who through the Redemption
[1377.9s] that is in Christ Jesus our
[1381.3s] justification is Free by the grace of
[1384.7s] who by the grace of God through the
[1386.8s] Redemption that is where that is in that
[1390.4s] is in Christ Jesus in verse 22 he says
[1393.0s] even the righteousness of God which is
[1394.6s] by faith of Jesus Christ and to all and
[1398.0s] upon all them that believe for there is
[1400.4s] no difference and so this is the
[1403.3s] righteousness of God and the grace of
[1405.4s] God that justifies us through the
[1408.5s] Redemption that is in Christ Jesus and
[1410.8s] so we see Christ undoing the work of the
[1414.0s] devil first at the cross there he
[1417.6s] becomes he not only shows that the law
[1420.6s] of God is just but beyond that he also
[1424.4s] justifies we who have broken the law of
[1427.0s] God we find Redemption through his blood
[1429.8s] in verse 25 he says whom God had set
[1433.3s] forth to be a propitiation through faith
[1436.1s] in his blood to declare his
[1438.0s] righteousness for the remission of sins
[1440.3s] that are passed through the forbearance
[1442.5s] of God it shows the mercy of God it
[1446.0s] shows the patience of God in verse 26 he
[1448.6s] says to declare I say at this time his
[1452.1s] righteousness that he might be just and
[1454.4s] the justifier of him which believed in
[1457.7s] Jesus and so we see the cross at is is
[1461.9s] is significant the cross answers the
[1463.8s] questions that the devil had accused God
[1467.0s] in heaven in the Reon that the laws of
[1469.7s] God are restrictive that God himself can
[1471.7s] has not bound himself to these laws why
[1473.8s] should we be contained by them but we
[1476.8s] see Christ coming in the form of of
[1479.2s] mankind and proving that indeed that the
[1482.1s] law of God is a law of love and of
[1484.5s] justice and of mercy and at the cross
[1486.9s] Justice and mercy kissed each other and
[1488.8s] righteousness reigned through
[1491.5s] Grace Christ then is proven to be just
[1497.4s] and equally the
[1499.3s] justifier sister white writes in the
[1501.2s] book Desire of Ages page
[1503.5s] 761 and says the following after the
[1506.2s] death of Jesus Satan saw that his
[1508.6s] disguise was thror away his
[1510.7s] administration was laid open before the
[1512.9s] unfallen angels and before the Heavenly
[1515.2s] Universe he revealed he he he had
[1518.2s] revealed himself as a murderer by
[1521.2s] shedding the blood of the Son of God he
[1523.4s] had uprooted himself from the sympathies
[1525.6s] of the Heavenly beings you see the
[1528.3s] angels in heaven always had doubts the
[1530.5s] questions that the devil had had raised
[1532.9s] in the Rebellion had never truly been
[1534.6s] answered completely but yet they chose
[1537.0s] to keep to keep their fast estate
[1539.0s] because they kept their chiefest
[1541.0s] allegiance to God though the questions
[1543.2s] were there they decided to stick with
[1545.0s] God but then you see on the cross Christ
[1547.6s] answered all their questions at the
[1549.8s] cross the devil was undressed at the
[1552.4s] cross as as as as sister white writes
[1555.2s] and says he had revealed himself as a m
[1559.6s] Christ showed that God is just and
[1562.8s] Beyond it at the cross he justified
[1565.6s] those who believe in him therefore he is
[1568.1s] both the just and the
[1570.0s] justifier now we called to consider
[1572.9s] Revelation chapter 12 verse 10
[1576.7s] to2 what are the some of the
[1579.5s] implications uh of of the cross the
[1582.7s] Bible writes in Revelation 12: 10 John
[1586.4s] in Vision says and I heard a loud voice
[1588.6s] saying in heaven now is come salvation
[1592.0s] and strength and the kingdom of our God
[1594.4s] and the power of His Christ for the
[1596.7s] accuser of our Brethren the accuser of
[1599.6s] our Brethren is cast down which accus
[1603.0s] them before our God day and night we
[1607.2s] have found justification we have found
[1610.1s] somebody who says yes they did that but
[1612.5s] I paid it I I shed my
[1615.5s] blood says in verse 11 and the they
[1618.4s] overcame him they have overcame this
[1620.4s] accuser mean meaning he has got files
[1622.4s] you know like a prosecutor he's got
[1624.4s] evidence he's got he's got as we say
[1627.5s] evidence on paper perhaps even on record
[1630.6s] on video but it says this is a secret
[1634.0s] the recipe and they overcame him by the
[1637.1s] blood of the lamb and by the word of
[1640.0s] their testimony and they love not their
[1642.8s] lives unto death verse 12 continues and
[1645.4s] says therefore Rejoice ye heavens and he
[1647.4s] that dwell in them
[1648.8s] but W to the inhabitants of the earth
[1650.5s] and of the sea for the Devil is come
[1652.4s] down unto you with
[1655.2s] what having great threat why because he
[1659.1s] knoweth he hath but a short time from
[1662.4s] the time of the cross the devil knows
[1665.4s] this thing has been sealed
[1668.4s] Victory the the winner you know this it
[1671.4s] comes a time in a football match where
[1674.7s] the other side has has beaten you goals
[1677.8s] you know you know the goals are just
[1679.2s] overwhelming you know the way this thing
[1681.2s] is going to end at the cross this match
[1685.5s] was set it's only we are just waiting
[1688.3s] for the referee to blow the final
[1689.8s] whistle and those who are found in
[1693.0s] Christ will carry the trophy he is both
[1695.4s] the just and the
[1697.4s] justifier the lesson asks us in addition
[1700.5s] to consider Genesis 3 and verse1 15
[1703.6s] which is the first gospel message to
[1705.6s] Adam and Eve in the Garden of Eden he
[1707.8s] speaks about the enemity between the the
[1711.0s] devil and the seed of the woman who is
[1714.0s] Christ that he will bruise his heel but
[1717.0s] the seed of the woman Christ would crush
[1719.3s] his heel almost exactly what happened at
[1722.7s] the cross we see Christ delivered a
[1725.8s] deadly blow a blow that the devil has
[1728.4s] never recovered from and never will and
[1731.0s] there at the cross Christ is proven to
[1733.4s] both be the just and the justifier and
[1735.8s] so we know that victory has been assured
[1739.3s] we know that God and His law are just
[1742.7s] and we know that by faith in his
[1744.8s] Redeeming Grace we likewise are
[1747.6s] justified by his sacrifice on the cross
[1751.4s] beautiful beautiful um uh Indulgence
[1755.2s] there by our brother onogo uh just to be
[1758.2s] able to understand that God is the just
[1763.0s] and the justifier and through the
[1766.7s] Redemption of God we we are justified
[1769.5s] through the Redemption of God I want to
[1772.1s] pose a question just to our sister
[1775.3s] renise in terms of the works on the
[1778.4s] cross in terms of the Redemption plan of
[1781.0s] God how are we able to be confident that
[1784.9s] indeed um God loves us that God is for
[1789.2s] us even when we undergoing through
[1791.4s] trials and Temptations in our daily
[1794.7s] lives sister reice thanks I and from the
[1799.8s] discussion that we've had when we just
[1802.2s] read the topic of the lesson for this
[1804.2s] week what more could I have done it
[1806.7s] gives you a state of
[1808.4s] hopelessness and Desperation because
[1811.0s] you're saying if God who is the creator
[1813.4s] who is almight who is all powerful is
[1816.1s] crying like this then what hope do I
[1818.0s] have but I want to thank God that it is
[1821.1s] not that because is not going to win
[1823.8s] it's just like RAF has used the football
[1826.1s] analogy the devil knows that he's losing
[1829.3s] and God knows that he's winning and
[1831.5s] that's why he continues to demonstrate
[1834.1s] his love and righteousness because if
[1837.1s] you was like feeling like I might lose
[1839.2s] or not you start getting desperate and
[1842.1s] Breaking the Rules of Engagement that we
[1844.0s] had discussed last week but since God is
[1847.7s] very confident in still engaging The
[1851.0s] Rules of Engagement I know that we are
[1853.8s] victorious and you see also this war is
[1856.4s] not about mle power showing I'm the one
[1858.4s] who is powerful here it can only be
[1860.8s] demonstrated and worn through love and
[1863.7s] because God is confident and is just
[1866.7s] waiting for things to play
[1868.7s] out I'm happy that the Plan of Salvation
[1872.4s] has to succeed it was instituted before
[1876.4s] the foundation of the earth and it is in
[1878.9s] progress as expected so me and you we
[1882.9s] are just waiting for the second coming
[1885.6s] of Jesus Christ for us to say celebrate
[1888.8s] the victory
[1890.8s] amen amen amen amen thank you sister
[1894.2s] renise and um we we are just trying to
[1898.2s] to get a hold of this uh love that is
[1901.8s] being shared greatly um from our maker
[1904.9s] and bringing us deeply into the the
[1908.2s] cosmic conflict and just telling us How
[1912.0s] Deeply God loves us and how much of free
[1916.2s] will he has given unto us in terms of
[1920.0s] just being able to love him genuinely um
[1923.7s] as our God and as our savior and I want
[1926.6s] to roll it over to our Elder oper in
[1930.0s] just highlighting um this kind of um of
[1934.6s] love that is there for us this kind of
[1937.6s] love that has been manifested um through
[1940.8s] the different ways um through the the
[1943.6s] works on the cross through the
[1945.7s] Redemption plan and getting to to
[1948.5s] understand um this particular song that
[1952.2s] God is actually calling us his
[1956.5s] beloved uh thank you so much I think um
[1960.7s] uh my my my my fellow uh panelists have
[1964.8s] really dwelt with this matter and really
[1968.0s] conversed it very well what more could I
[1970.9s] have done and in the song we find in the
[1974.5s] book of Isaiah chapter 5 God's
[1977.4s] disappoint pointing
[1979.5s] vineard and the text says now let me
[1983.2s] sing to my well beloved I think when you
[1987.4s] read that statement you look forward to
[1989.5s] hearing some sweet song of your beloved
[1994.2s] which I think even in the current
[1996.8s] generation we can use it the lyrics
[1999.6s] which even the genes of people who are
[2001.5s] cting can can really use these lyrics
[2005.2s] but now the turn of events can that a
[2008.9s] song of my beloved regarding his vineard
[2011.8s] still to so sweet my well beloved as a
[2017.1s] vineard on a very beautiful Fruit
[2020.4s] Hill he dug it up and cleared out its
[2024.2s] stones and planted it with the choicest
[2027.2s] vine he built a tower in its midest and
[2030.9s] also made a wine press in it so he
[2033.6s] expected it to bring forth good grapes
[2036.7s] but it now that is where things go wrong
[2040.1s] but it brought forth wild grips you see
[2045.4s] here we were asking what else would I do
[2049.4s] but God is again demonstrating something
[2052.3s] here is's continuing to build a case to
[2055.5s] build a case of what somebody would ask
[2059.0s] okay what did you do because the
[2060.8s] question is what more would I have done
[2063.3s] the question is what have you done now
[2066.1s] he brings us things which he has done he
[2070.0s] first of all says he had a garden very
[2072.8s] beautiful one a fruit Hill it must be a
[2075.7s] very fertile Place very strategic he did
[2079.0s] all that is could could be done if it is
[2081.6s] today people go for fruit trees they go
[2084.0s] to those sites of sagana if it is here
[2086.0s] in Kenya people go to kamani they get
[2088.4s] very good they go to maybe kre and all
[2090.9s] that to get Goods seedlings he all he
[2094.3s] did all this the weather he he did all
[2097.1s] that could be done but lo and behold
[2100.0s] what came out was terrible it was now uh
[2106.0s] but it brought forth wild grapes the
[2108.8s] other translation says
[2110.9s] worthless stinking fruits why was it so
[2116.8s] uh and now he says now God calls our
[2119.4s] attention I want you to reflect upon
[2122.6s] Ponder and make judgment for yourself
[2125.4s] inviting us also to make the Judgment
[2128.9s] now beloved this uh the vine owner this
[2134.0s] this Vine owner depicts God himself this
[2137.9s] is God himself and the vine dressers are
[2142.4s] a people who should have been be the
[2145.1s] people responsible by extent people who
[2148.8s] should believe like you and me who
[2151.2s] should take the right decision vineard
[2155.2s] the the the vineard honor is God himself
[2158.4s] and the vineard represents God's people
[2162.3s] but the implication here can also be
[2164.9s] expanded relative to God's broader work
[2168.6s] in this world you see God is the vine
[2172.6s] the vineard owner but the the the the
[2177.6s] the other people the vineard workers and
[2179.9s] all that represent people who should
[2182.2s] have taken responsibility what God you
[2185.0s] and I who are the recipients
[2188.1s] of God's doing he makes the fertile
[2191.6s] atmosphere he gives you opportunity in
[2193.8s] terms of good health my dear brother and
[2195.9s] sister he gives us opportunity in terms
[2198.2s] of good health in terms of resources but
[2200.8s] at the end of it instead of
[2203.2s] reciprocating the good things the
[2205.3s] vineard owner has done we do the
[2208.8s] contrary this one helps us to build the
[2212.4s] case a God to build the case what more
[2216.0s] should I have done and then in
[2218.5s] conclusion it says uh you see he shifts
[2222.4s] in verse three he shifts and now oh
[2225.4s] inhabitants of Jerusalem and Men of
[2227.9s] Judah judge please between me and my
[2232.3s] Vineyard what more could I have done to
[2236.2s] my vineard that I have not done in it
[2240.9s] why then when I expect it to bring forth
[2244.2s] good grapes did it bring forth Wild
[2247.7s] grapes and now please let me tell you
[2251.4s] what I will do to my vineard I will take
[2254.4s] away its hedge and it shall be burned
[2258.0s] and break down its wall and it shall be
[2261.2s] trampled down I don't want to go to the
[2263.8s] consequences but they are very critical
[2267.2s] that God because of God's loves he gives
[2270.3s] us from end to end though from the rule
[2272.5s] of Engagement he respects our will and
[2275.6s] but the because of love he reveals to us
[2278.6s] I give to you life and death but what do
[2280.9s] you know what you should do choose life
[2283.6s] and you'll get it will be eternal life
[2287.5s] that is how he gives us even the leakage
[2291.2s] if it was in an exam he gives us even
[2293.4s] the leakage that but do this just do
[2297.1s] this Beloved the thing is God has done
[2301.1s] is doing is done all that could be done
[2303.8s] good employment maybe blessings of the
[2305.9s] family all that but he says are we
[2309.0s] reciprocating all that for His Glory
[2311.9s] thank you amen amen thank you Elder and
[2316.7s] just from that we are getting to hear
[2319.2s] about this beautiful song I mean if if
[2323.1s] uh a poem is going to start with my
[2325.7s] beloved you know love is going to
[2329.3s] be uh spoken in so um uh big words and
[2335.7s] uh in so much dep
[2338.0s] and just from that uh particular um
[2341.6s] discussion we're getting to to see that
[2345.4s] God has given it his all and even when
[2349.3s] we started the lesson uh the question is
[2353.0s] what more could I have done I could just
[2356.8s] give it to our brother onogo just to be
[2359.8s] able to tell us what what is the
[2361.6s] significance of this particular question
[2364.3s] that is being
[2365.6s] asked what more could I have done just
[2368.2s] from this particular song from The
[2372.0s] Vineyard indeed uh I'd like to Echo a
[2375.9s] thought that per uh gave us this the
[2379.9s] setting of a classroom and it's a
[2382.0s] critical exam that's going to determine
[2383.7s] your future it's literally an exam of
[2385.7s] life and death but the one who set the
[2388.2s] exam sits next to you and tells you
[2391.0s] write this you know here I write this
[2393.4s] here literally that's that's what
[2395.2s] salvation is like it's not something
[2397.1s] that God has given us to figure out you
[2399.2s] know it's like a puzzle or like a maze
[2401.4s] you know like the way people say you're
[2403.6s] looking uh the people go for pilgrimage
[2406.0s] in India to find themselves you know
[2408.0s] it's very difficult to find this
[2409.8s] spirituality to find to locate yourself
[2412.3s] and to to transcend and and and to find
[2414.7s] the way of Buddha no when you when it
[2416.8s] comes to the way of Salvation Christ
[2419.3s] says lo I am with you even to the end of
[2422.0s] the age he says he's there with us on
[2424.2s] our right hand you will hear a voice
[2426.0s] telling you this is the way
[2427.9s] and so when he's speaking about this
[2430.2s] Vineyard you see even the way it says he
[2432.7s] he put it on a very fruitful Hill and
[2435.8s] and he doesn't he doesn't simply call it
[2437.9s] another vineard he says it my beloved
[2440.8s] like this is a vineard that he has
[2442.0s] poured himself into he says he fenced it
[2445.9s] and then he even put stones around not
[2448.3s] it's like he's fencing he's doing more
[2450.0s] than fencing and then after that he says
[2452.5s] he even at some point he says he built a
[2454.5s] tower in the midst of it and so as in
[2457.7s] he's doing so much to provide its
[2459.3s] security and then he planted the
[2460.6s] choicest
[2461.6s] vines and it is we are told that of
[2464.9s] course the rain also came he provided
[2467.2s] everything then he didn't it did not
[2469.6s] produce what more can a farmer do you
[2472.1s] know what more can a farmer do what more
[2475.0s] can a farmer do and in this particular
[2477.2s] context we are told about in Romans 5
[2481.0s] and: 8 he says but God commandeth his
[2483.7s] love towards us in that while we were
[2486.8s] yet sinners Christ died for us while we
[2491.0s] were yet sinners Christ died for us and
[2493.5s] so when we look at the
[2495.2s] cross in the light of John 3:16 that God
[2498.7s] so loved the world that he gave his only
[2502.0s] you know when you give your only thing
[2504.0s] your only son you have given all your
[2507.8s] sons if you've if you given your only
[2511.4s] begotten son you've given all your sons
[2514.0s] so God gave everything he was left with
[2516.4s] nothing so the question indeed is what
[2519.5s] more could he have done he had even
[2522.1s] given himself the answer is UN
[2524.6s] overwhelming and overwhelming there is
[2526.9s] nothing more there is nothing more God
[2529.2s] has done whatever God has done is enough
[2532.4s] in fact it is more than enough to secure
[2534.6s] our Salvation amen it is only for us to
[2537.4s] respond to the call of God amen amen
[2542.0s] amen um that the ball is now on our
[2545.8s] court and um what you're going to do is
[2549.5s] um based on us and the choices that
[2552.0s] you're going to make and um picking it
[2555.5s] up from there we are getting from this
[2558.8s] particular song in Isaiah um 5 and from
[2564.1s] the particular song um later on when
[2569.0s] Christ um uh comes to us and he's
[2572.0s] released to us and Christ is able to
[2575.8s] pick it up from there
[2577.9s] from the song that was given in the book
[2581.6s] of Isaiah now Christ comes and brings it
[2584.7s] to us in a different Manner and we are
[2587.3s] getting that he shares it to us in form
[2590.1s] of a parable the parable of the vineyard
[2594.3s] sister renice please unpack for us the
[2597.5s] parable of the vineyard let us get to
[2599.6s] understand how is this
[2602.8s] connected when a lesson is repeated it
[2605.8s] seems like you didn't get it the the
[2607.3s] first time so at that point Isaiah
[2610.3s] explained to us what is it and now Jesus
[2614.2s] because we didn't get it is making it
[2616.6s] more simpler using a parable and so in
[2620.1s] the Book of Matthew chapter 2133 to39
[2624.0s] the Lord even goes ahead to explain what
[2627.0s] these symbols mean so that we cannot
[2629.6s] Fain ignorance that we didn't get it and
[2632.6s] so he says the parable is about God's
[2636.2s] relationship with the
[2638.0s] humanity especially how he sent prophets
[2641.6s] and ultimately his son Jesus to call
[2644.1s] people back to him and they were
[2646.2s] rejected and killed the vineard
[2649.1s] represents the world the tenants
[2651.6s] represent those entrusted with authority
[2654.6s] and the landowner represents God and how
[2657.9s] is this played in our daytoday
[2663.2s] life at that point in
[2665.8s] time it was the tenants refused to
[2669.0s] acknowledge the owner's Authority and
[2671.5s] mistreated his
[2673.1s] Messengers it basically shows us how we
[2676.7s] have rejected God's Messengers in modern
[2680.2s] society many reject God's truth today
[2683.4s] just as people rejected the prophets and
[2686.9s] Jesus many Christians values are being
[2690.6s] pushed aside in favor of
[2693.3s] secularism faith-based morals are often
[2696.0s] seen as outd ated and those who stand
[2698.7s] for biblical truth face persecution and
[2703.0s] we see that biblical views of morality
[2705.3s] family and integrity are increasingly
[2708.3s] being censored in the media and in
[2711.0s] schools and the Bible continues to
[2713.4s] remind us that they hated me without a
[2716.8s] reason that is from John
[2719.0s] 15:25 and also the Bible encourages us
[2721.8s] that blessed are those who are
[2723.8s] persecuted because of righteousness for
[2726.2s] theirs is the Kingdom of Heaven that is
[2728.7s] from The Book of Matthew 5: 10 and that
[2733.0s] behooves us as Christians that we should
[2735.6s] boldly take stand for our faith even
[2739.1s] when it's
[2740.6s] unpopular the other thing is that
[2743.1s] corruption and Injustice by those in
[2746.4s] Authority at that point in time we see
[2749.1s] the tenants were entrusted to manage the
[2751.3s] vineyard but became greedy and
[2754.8s] unjust in the current modern days
[2757.6s] leaders in government business and even
[2759.8s] in churches often abuse the power
[2762.7s] instead of serving justly leaders are
[2766.1s] entrusted with governing governing
[2768.4s] fairly often exploit people for personal
[2771.2s] gain just like the tenants who wanted to
[2774.2s] steal the
[2776.6s] inheritance and we see that even in big
[2780.0s] businesses they exploit for profit just
[2783.5s] as the tenants exploited the land they
[2786.3s] were given
[2787.8s] and the Bible continues to encourage us
[2790.1s] and tell us wo to those who make unjust
[2793.8s] laws to those who issue oppressive
[2797.2s] decrees that is Isaiah 10: 1 and also we
[2801.5s] are reminded that the love of money is
[2804.6s] the root of all kinds of evil that is
[2807.6s] first Timothy 6 and10 and then the other
[2810.5s] lesson that we need to learn is that we
[2813.1s] are
[2814.2s] disregarding Jesus and his teaching
[2818.1s] at that point in time the tenants killed
[2821.0s] the Landon's son thinking they could
[2823.7s] take the inheritance for themselves and
[2827.1s] now what we are doing many people still
[2829.6s] reject Jesus today living as though
[2832.5s] they're in control of their own lives
[2835.2s] without
[2836.4s] God many want the blessings of God and
[2840.3s] his kingdom but reject his authority
[2844.5s] some claim Christianity but refuse to
[2848.1s] follow biblical
[2850.7s] principles people make their own
[2853.8s] laws and about right and wrong instead
[2857.8s] of following God's word just as it was
[2861.3s] in the case in the days of Judges as
[2864.2s] recorded in judges
[2867.4s] 2125 and many are prioritizing wealth
[2871.2s] success and pleasure of a seeking God
[2875.1s] just as warned in Matthew
[2880.1s] 633 and what we are reminded is that for
[2884.1s] what shall it profit a man if he gains
[2887.2s] the whole world and lose his own
[2890.8s] soul so for us this day we are called to
[2894.0s] reflect do we truly honor Jesus in our
[2897.8s] daily
[2898.9s] decisions or do we reject him by the way
[2902.6s] that we
[2903.7s] live and when you are doing all these
[2906.0s] things just like the tenants us killed
[2908.9s] the servants killed those who are sent
[2911.0s] and finally killed the
[2912.6s] son we will not
[2915.0s] Escape God's judgment will
[2918.2s] come because then we see that the
[2920.7s] landowner who is God eventually brings
[2924.2s] judgment on the wicked
[2926.8s] tenants and even for us now there will
[2930.0s] be consequences for rejecting God both
[2933.6s] in this life and in eternity
[2937.2s] Nations and individuals who persist in
[2940.0s] sin without repentance eventually face
[2944.2s] consequences God is patient and he will
[2947.2s] bring judgment and we see judgments in
[2951.3s] environmental crisises and natural
[2954.5s] disasters many of today's disasters are
[2957.8s] reminder that we are not in control and
[2961.3s] should turn to God that is Luke
[2965.2s] 2111 and also the the moral and social
[2968.3s] Decay societies that turn from God face
[2972.2s] increased violence broken families and
[2976.6s] lawlessness and the Bible continues to
[2979.0s] remind me and you do not be deceived God
[2983.4s] cannot be mocked a man
[2986.2s] reaps what he s and so this morning I
[2990.1s] would encourage us also to reflect on
[2992.2s] this fact that are we living in a way
[2996.3s] that prepare us for Christ soon return
[2999.8s] or we are ignoring his warnings and
[3003.1s] living as if it is business as usual
[3007.5s] amen amen amen ah beautiful beautiful
[3012.0s] sharings um from our sister rise and
[3015.4s] just getting to understand that God has
[3018.8s] done it all for
[3020.6s] us and it is upon us to do what is right
[3027.0s] and
[3028.2s] actually there are consequences in in
[3031.4s] rejection and rejecting what uh God has
[3034.5s] done and just to pick it up from there
[3039.2s] our sister Whitney uh maybe just to
[3042.0s] highlight to us in terms of the the
[3045.2s] griefs uh the sorrow that um God has
[3050.3s] gone through just to bring to us
[3053.8s] Redemption just to bring to us Sal
[3056.7s] salvation and what what does it mean um
[3061.6s] in terms of all these sacrifices uh that
[3065.2s] God has made on our
[3069.4s] behalf thank you so much sister irin
[3072.3s] Christ B our grief and sorrow he took
[3075.8s] upon himself the pain the suffering and
[3079.2s] judgment that you deserve because of our
[3081.0s] sins we learn this he he has done
[3083.3s] everything for us God has done
[3084.8s] everything for our salvation when you
[3086.8s] see clearly the book that we always talk
[3088.8s] about John 3:16 for God so loved the
[3092.2s] world that he gave his only begotten son
[3095.1s] that whoever believes in him shall not
[3097.4s] perish but have everlasting life God has
[3099.8s] done everything for our salvation and
[3101.7s] salvation came at the highest cost the
[3103.8s] cost of his only begotten son and also
[3106.2s] the cost of the life of Jesus Christ
[3108.1s] himself we are given salvation freely
[3110.9s] but it does not mean that it is cheap it
[3113.1s] cost life it cost God his only son so
[3116.6s] let's live with gratitude let's
[3118.2s] surrender to God's love because we are
[3120.4s] no longer bound by grief or Sorrows
[3122.9s] because Christ Christ paid it all for us
[3126.6s] amen amen beautiful beautiful there um
[3132.3s] Christ has paid it all for us and we can
[3135.7s] just be able to see that through the
[3138.0s] works of God the Father the Son and the
[3141.6s] Holy Spirit we've been able to get the
[3144.3s] Plan of Redemption and
[3147.4s] we're able to also get the perfect plan
[3149.8s] for righteousness in God and the love of
[3154.0s] God is manifested to us in different
[3157.5s] ways in different manners but the
[3160.4s] question is how is God's name Vindicated
[3165.0s] and I will give it to our sister Whitney
[3168.7s] just to tell us exactly how is God's
[3172.1s] name
[3173.6s] Vindicated thank you so much uh in our
[3176.8s] world today we always have relationships
[3179.8s] and it's not easy to have love
[3183.2s] relationship with someone you do not
[3184.6s] trust and you do not believe in so we
[3187.9s] cannot have a deep that deep love
[3190.1s] relationship with someone whose
[3191.6s] character we detest or we do not trust
[3194.2s] and we love God and God wants us to have
[3196.7s] that genuine relationship with him
[3198.7s] that's why he has to clear his name from
[3201.3s] the blames and suspicions and
[3203.2s] allegations that are brought by the
[3205.2s] devil so through the the work of the
[3208.1s] Father the Son and the Holy Spirit In
[3210.0s] The Plan of Redemption the perfect
[3212.7s] righteousness the love of God is
[3214.7s] manifested beyond any reasonable doubt
[3217.9s] when you read the book of Romans 58 all
[3221.5s] while yet while we were yet sinners
[3223.8s] Christ died for us that's how much
[3225.9s] Christ God loves us he vindicates his
[3228.4s] name so we have we have read the book
[3232.4s] Isaiah Isaiah chapter chapter 5 verse um
[3238.4s] three and four and from this all we
[3240.8s] learn that God has done everything
[3243.1s] possible for Humanity he has he has made
[3246.0s] everything possible for us first of all
[3248.4s] he gave his he sent his only son to die
[3250.5s] for us we've learned about that in John
[3252.5s] 3:16 he allowed sin to reveal itself he
[3255.8s] could have just killed Satan from the
[3257.7s] very beginning but he did not do that he
[3260.0s] gave time for us to see that he's
[3263.2s] rightous he's just we've just learned
[3265.2s] that he's just first and is the
[3267.6s] justifier instead of destroying Satan
[3269.9s] immediately God permitted sin to unfold
[3272.0s] so that we could all see its true nature
[3275.5s] and also God gave his word to and and
[3279.0s] the prophets he gave his words and
[3281.4s] Prophets to us who who came before and
[3283.7s] showed us the way H we've learned the
[3287.6s] story of the parable where he sent
[3290.1s] prophets to come tell us everything he
[3292.4s] gave us even the Ten Commandments to
[3294.2s] guide us on how we need to act as human
[3296.6s] beings everything God has done for us he
[3299.2s] worked through his people he's
[3300.8s] manifested a lot of stuff for us to
[3303.2s] really learn from him all this
[3305.6s] vindicates his name we know that the
[3307.6s] final judgment and destruction of sin
[3309.4s] will prove that God had could not have
[3313.6s] done more like he has done everything he
[3315.9s] has shown infinite patience love and
[3318.8s] Justice his name is fully Vindicated
[3321.4s] when all creation acknowledges his
[3324.1s] righteousness as we read the book of of
[3326.6s] Revelation chter 15 I'll take you
[3329.2s] through Revelation 15 verse
[3336.9s] 3 Revelation 15:3 says and they sing the
[3341.0s] song of Moses the servant of God the
[3343.6s] song of the lamp saying great and
[3346.1s] marvelous are thy Works Lord God
[3348.6s] Almighty just in true are thy ways Thou
[3352.3s] King of saints and just to add on that
[3355.2s] let's read re 19 191 to6 which is the
[3359.8s] marriage supper of the lamb and it says
[3362.8s] and after these things I heard a great
[3365.0s] voice of such people in heaven saying
[3368.3s] Allelujah salvation and glory and honor
[3371.8s] and power unto the Lord Our God for true
[3375.2s] and righteous are his judgments for
[3377.5s] Heath judged the great whom which did
[3381.2s] corrupt the Earth with her fornication
[3384.1s] and have Avenged the blood of his
[3386.4s] servant at her hand and again they said
[3389.7s] Allelujah and her smoke rose up forever
[3392.7s] and
[3394.4s] ever and the four and the 20 elders and
[3398.3s] four Beast fell down and worshiped God
[3400.6s] that sat on the throne saying amen
[3403.6s] Allelujah and a voice came out of the
[3406.0s] throne saying praise a God all ye
[3408.6s] servants and ye that fear Him both small
[3411.0s] and great and I heard as it were the
[3413.7s] voice of a great multitude and as the
[3417.0s] voice of many Waters and as the voice of
[3419.5s] Mighty Thunder saying Allelujah for the
[3422.4s] Lord God omnipotent reth god reigns in
[3426.2s] everything he vindicates his name at the
[3428.4s] at the very end because we know the
[3430.5s] Bible also says in the book of
[3432.0s] Philippians 2:12 that every knee shall
[3434.6s] bow and every tongue shall confess that
[3437.3s] Jesus Christ is Lord he vindicate
[3440.4s] himself he has done everything possible
[3443.4s] for us Humanity to claim salvation
[3446.2s] though it's free it's not cheap let's
[3449.9s] let's be ready let's let's do that which
[3452.1s] is right he has given us everything what
[3454.5s] more could he have done what more could
[3457.0s] God have done to you amen amen thank you
[3461.4s] so much uh sister Whitney and just um
[3465.3s] being able to to take us through how God
[3468.4s] vindicates himself and he's loving
[3471.1s] intentions towards us um and uh just one
[3476.2s] wanting to roll it over to the panel in
[3478.4s] terms of just giving us a closing remark
[3481.1s] when it comes to um this particular
[3483.6s] learnings for today and I'll start over
[3486.0s] with elder op per just to share with us
[3488.6s] what what are the the the the the
[3490.7s] takeaways that uh we are having for for
[3494.2s] today uh thank you so much uh my sister
[3497.5s] I think um as we are asking our question
[3501.3s] the question we had asked that what more
[3504.7s] could I have done
[3506.7s] I can see that though the statement may
[3509.6s] look A desperate
[3511.2s] situation God has revealed to us that
[3514.5s] he's gone to Greater lengths to ensure
[3518.8s] that we make the right choice I realize
[3521.6s] that there are many things we may not
[3524.4s] know but despite that I also find out
[3528.7s] that God may not always get what he
[3531.2s] wants that what what we learned last
[3533.0s] time the unfulfilled desires we may not
[3536.6s] get all that he
[3538.0s] wants but he grants us the freedom to
[3541.6s] choose because of the Rules of
[3543.6s] Engagement for love to thrive like it
[3546.3s] was presented for love to
[3549.2s] thrive the freedom of choice must be
[3552.6s] respected but with all that in the
[3555.6s] cosmic
[3557.0s] conflict God always does everything he
[3560.2s] can to bring about the best good for all
[3565.4s] and he will find finally
[3567.8s] eradicate evil forever it is ours to
[3571.7s] choose amen God thank you amen our
[3575.4s] sister with
[3577.6s] me I learned one thing God has done
[3581.1s] everything for us the vineard failed him
[3584.2s] and you know he gave consequences to
[3586.4s] that and also to us God has given us the
[3589.7s] very ultimate end and he says in the
[3591.9s] Book of Romans chapter 6:23 for the
[3594.6s] wages of sin is death
[3597.9s] but the gift of God is eternal life
[3600.4s] through Christ Jesus our lord let's
[3602.7s] choose life let's CH Jesus Christ and
[3604.8s] let's choose to do that which is right
[3606.5s] thank you amen
[3608.5s] amen um Romans 3 begins by saying what
[3612.0s] prophet there is there of circumcision
[3614.6s] much in every way uh chiefly that unto
[3617.8s] them that is the Jews was committed the
[3620.7s] Oracles of God but what if some did not
[3624.1s] believe shall their unbelief make the
[3626.4s] faith of God without effect the question
[3629.9s] is I can I I I will um as I meditate on
[3635.4s] that question what if some did not
[3637.6s] believe shall the demonstration of faith
[3641.3s] and love and Justice and mercy from God
[3645.1s] and all the advantages he has given to
[3647.4s] us shall it be without effect of course
[3651.2s] Paul answers that question by saying God
[3653.4s] forbid and to the end we see all so that
[3656.4s] the principles of the of Satan are
[3659.9s] opposed to the principles of Love
[3662.8s] Justice and mercy to God and we are told
[3665.6s] that as the days go along the evil shall
[3669.2s] works works and worse and because of
[3671.6s] that in Matthew 24:12 we are told the
[3674.9s] love of many will grow cold but the the
[3680.3s] challenge we have I want to leave uh our
[3684.3s] dear brother and sister who is watching
[3685.7s] us that the as the love of many will
[3688.4s] grow cold is your love the the challenge
[3693.0s] that but he that endures to the end he
[3696.6s] that continues growing in in looking at
[3700.2s] the demonstration of the love of God and
[3702.6s] keeping themselves within that confine
[3706.3s] of what God has done for you he that
[3708.5s] endures to the end the same shall be
[3711.3s] saved may we be those in Jesus name amen
[3715.3s] amen our brother was so good I think I
[3717.9s] would like us to consider uh the father
