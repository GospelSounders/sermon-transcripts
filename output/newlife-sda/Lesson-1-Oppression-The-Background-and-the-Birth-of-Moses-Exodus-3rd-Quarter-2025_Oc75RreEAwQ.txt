Uh on my left, you can introduce yourself. My name is Anongo Rafany. It's a pleasure to be with you uh this quarter. Thank you. Uh so Exodus the journey to the promised land we are going to experience the gospel but through the lenses of Moses. We are used to experiencing the gospel through the lenses of Matthew, Mark, Luke and John but this season we are looking at this beautiful gospel message through the book of Exodus. And and and I would like to um introduce the topic for this week operation the background and the birth of Moses. Our key text comes from the book of Exodus chapter 2 verse 23 all through 25. Uh I'm going to read this is what the Bible says. After a long time the king of Egypt died. The Israelites groaned because of their difficult labor and they cried out and their cry for help ascended to God because of the difficult labor. So God heard their groaning and he remembered his covenant with Abraham, Isaac and Jacob. God saw the Israelites and he took notice. Those are very powerful word. This same God who created now sees, hears and takes notice. It doesn't mean that God was absent when these things were happening. But it shows that his time for action had now come. Because our God is a God of time and he comes and shows himself at particular time which is normally the right time. This book resonates with those who are oppressed. I know the marginalized, the persecuted, the exploited, the degraded. We will feel how much God loves us through the degradation, through the oppression. We will experience the love of God. And it will indeed show that if God was able to deliver the Hebrews, he can make the same and deliver us even today. Now I would like to keep the ball rolling uh by asking my brother Raphael, God's people in Egypt, what can you tell us about God's people in Egypt? How did it happen that they ended up there? Indeed. Uh I think the book of uh Exodus as uh is as it is known in Hebrew is called Shemote which literally means names. And it begins and opens and it tells us in verse one of chapter 1 that now these are the names of the children of Israel which came into Egypt. Every man and his household came with who? With Jacob. Then they said Reuben, Simeon, Ley, Judah, Issachar, Zebulun, Benjamin, Dan, Napali, God, and Asher. And all the souls that came out of the li loins of Jacob were 70 souls. For Joseph was in Egypt already. And Joseph died. and all his brethren and all that generation. So in essence it begins with naming. It's it begins with the names of the children of Jacob and um these are the patriarch Jacob's family and the Bible in essence is telling us something that those who came it's sort of introducing us to how they came in because Exodus as we know it is coming out you know moving out and and and it begins with names of those who came in first and how many they were. It says there were 70 because Joseph was already there. But then in verse 7, the Bible records and says, "And the children of Israel were fruitful and increased abundantly and multiplied and waxed exceedingly mighty and the land was filled with them." So in the setting it's simply telling us how the children of God, the people of um or the children of Israel prospered in Egypt. They came in 70 and the Bible records that now uh they were fruitful and they increase abundantly. Not just a mega increase but an abundant increase and it continues and says and multiplied and waxed exceedingly mighty and the land was filled with them. I know the in in each region there is a particular tribe that we say uh is is you'll find them anywhere you go into a volcano you'll find them. These were the children of Israel. The children of Israel, the Bible records, the land was filled with them. This is how God was fulfilling that promise to Abraham that his descendants were going to multiply. That it so it shows also to a certain extent how God was faithful to them. Even in the land of refuge because they were running away from femine, God still took care of the children of Israel. They multiplied and they waxed in abundance. In that in fact in Exodus chapter 12 and verse 37 we are told that by the time uh they were going in verse 37 of Exodus and the children of Israel journeyed from Ramses to Sakot about 600,000 on foot that were men beside children. This was a multiplier effect. this 400 years in Egypt uh this span which in which they stayed in Egypt was an was a time in which they grew and they multiplied. But as as the text continues uh from verses 8 to 11 of chapter 1, it introduces us to the changes, the reason why um to a certain extent the children of Israel are crying out and and and the beginnings of them now coming out. And it introduces us to in verse 8 that there arose a new king over Egypt which knew not Joseph. It's not a new nation that does not know Joseph. It's the same nation. So Joseph is still in the in the annals of history of Egypt. But it says there arose a new king who knew not Joseph. a king who simply chose to ignore the impact and the and and and the historical um saving bit that Israel that the children of Israel through Joseph had done in not not only saving the world but also saving and preserving the power of Egypt as a superpower at that particular time when there was a great famine in the whole world for seven years. And so he he decides not to acknowledge the children of Israel. And whenever a people a particular people group grows and becomes prominent then sometimes those in power um become threatened those who uh feel like they indigenous even in our world today for example in certain countries uh like in the US there are movements uh saying immigration should be cailed because these are foreigners why are they coming to our lands you know these are foreigners why are they taking our jobs etc etc and so these movements are not knew this uh similar sentiments had been harbored by by the Egyptians especially beginning from the leader from Pharaoh himself. And therefore he comes up with a way of sort of culling this population uh uh um a system of um population control. And the Bible records in verse 8 uh verse 9, 10 and 11 that he said to his people, "Behold, the children of Israel are more and mightier than we." And it continues and says, "Come on, let us deal wisely with them, lest they multiply. And it come to pass that when they are fallth out any war, they join also unto our enemies and fight against us, and so get them up out of the land." Verse 11 says, "Therefore they did set over them task masters to afflict them with with burdens, and they built for Pharaoh treasured cities, Pitham and Ramses. But the more they afflicted them, the text says what happened? The more the more they multiplied and grew and they were grieved because of the children of Israel. The Bible is simply speaking to us and telling us the story of the children of Israel and how they came to Israel to Egypt a small number of 70 and how God blessed them and they prospered and their prosperity eventually uh led to uh the Egyptians being insecure. So sometimes even in life when we prosper and we see that our success is threatening others, when we see that our promotions are um and our growth is is is leaving others uh feeling sour and bitter, let us simply know that this is this is the way of men when they are unconverted. This is the way of a man who believes and and and and and doesn't um has has lost their faith in God to to secure their place here on earth and therefore they're threatened by other people's successes. The children of Egypt, Egypt as a nation had benefited from the presence of Israel. Joseph had saved that nation. But yet later on after even Pharaoh, the Bible records how Pharaoh gave uh Joseph his his his own ring you know and and and even gave him the second chariot made him the second in in line in power. And all this history is left out just because of what? Because of jealousy and because of fear. Because of fear because sometimes to a certain extent we are jealous because we are fear. We are fearful that somebody is going to be better than us. We are fearful that somebody is going to prosper more than us. They're going to be more happy than us. They look more happy than us. And therefore, we become we become we become afraid. And unfortunately, this pharaoh uh ruled by this fear and by this jealousy because this nation was growing great. Instead of coping their winning formula and the formula was their trust and their faith in God, he decides to oppress them and to put them down. But the Bible records, nonetheless, whatever he did, no matter the human uh um things that they did, God was still sovereign and he still saved his people. The more they punish them, the Bible records in verse 12, the more they multiplied and grew. Thank you so much. So in in essence, what you're capturing is that in every circumstance that you are in, whatever the human perspective, God still reigns. So let's go back to the history, the historical background a bit and and and look at it. Joseph went through a hard time. And anytime his brothers would see him come, they would say, "Here comes the dreamer." And they wanted to to get rid of him. What they did not know that sometimes when you're planning evil for someone, God then presents himself to use that opportunity to ensure that it benefits you plus others in in the long run. That's the essence the historical background because Joseph now finds himself in Egypt as a slave, works in Pharaoh's house. He goes through a tough time, but then eventually he ends up being the second in command just as you have mentioned. And wherever he was passing people say bow your knee an important person is coming. However through the period when we are ending verse seven then Joseph is dead and Jacob is dead and that pharaoh who had that experience the actual experience with Joseph is no longer there. So we find a new pharaoh. What will you say about this historical background? What stands out for you Chris? Uh for me I think uh I want to tie it uh to to how this story plays out in the life of Joseph and how now this comes into the scene of the corporate body of uh Israel. uh because I think you have clearly placed it out uh brought it out that first of all Joseph encounters the same hatred Israel is going to encounter from the Egyptians in his own household as an individual. He he he comes in in a a very confrontational uh relation with his brothers. And then but the idea what I loved about uh in the book of uh Genesis um chapter 39:2 says that and the Lord was with Joseph. And the Lord was with Joseph. That statement for me carries really the weight and the burden of what transpired not only in the life of Joseph but in the corporate life of Israel. Amen. Because as Joseph is undergoing suffering, he is in prison. He in uh Portifer's house and eventually he is elevated back into into into prominence through the power of God. You see the constant theme through that journey is the personal presence of God. And this is what I believe Israel should have carried through this transition that they were going through. And what we find is that it's it seems that even in the next uh phase of the lesson which we are going to come into the life of the prominent person uh the prominent person uh in in the book of Exodus who is Moses. find that it is the same thing. The Lord was with Moses and that is what makes him different as it were in the historical context of what occurs in the whole of Israel. The lesson there for for me as as I as I look at the the the this historical context of the book of Exodus was that number one through the sufferings of the men of God in scripture, what carries them through was the conscious realization that they had God with them through the experiences they were going through. And that is why he could be in prison but still be joyful. He could stand against Pifas and say I cannot do this against my God because he he has this conscious constant realization of the presence of God. Number two, because of that they were strengthened, these men and and even the corporate body of Israel, they were strengthened to go through suffering. Because suffering is a great is a very major theme in the book of Exodus. We find that because of this continuous presence of God. Because God was with them, they realized that it helped them as a nation corporately to be able from time to time when they were faithful to God to attain great victories because they knew who was with them. Yeah. Amen. It is important to know who is with you. So for the historical background of the Israelites, uh them being into bondage, what stands out for you, Rafael? I think uh what stands out for me is um that chapter one of Exodus carries a lot of um that it's almost summarizing almost uh uh almost the entirety of the 400 years of the children of Israel. how they came in, how they prospered, and how eventually a Pharaoh who knew not Moses comes about. And um the lesson writers have taken the time to to to look uh into the history and uh and um and uh um and have been able to give us um some of these deaths and we're told that um this pharaoh who knew not Moses is posited to be a Hamos who ruled from 1580 to um 1546 BC. And so uh it's telling uh and eventually the pharaoh who now um meets with Moses when Moses goes and says God is saying let my people go is Pharaoh Tut Mos III who is from 1504 to 1450 BC almost a span of around 130 years. That tells me that perhaps for around 270 years the children of Israel had been in peace and prosperity. But with the with a with a rising to power of a Hamos, then he begins to deal with what he what today we would know we would term as a problem the problem of immigrants. You know, these immigrants are growing and and and they're taking positions and and and they're prospering more than more than um more than um more than the locals. But then he fails to understand that these immigrants helped to build and preserve this nation. These immigrants, he puts them to work, you know, he puts them uh to heavy labor. But eventually, nonetheless, God still uh God still uh sustains and guides it. We're also told about um after Mos there was another another pharaoh, I mean Hotep the first later um who ruled the Israelites with fear and oppressed them. Later there was to Moses the first who issued the death decree for all the Hebrew male children which is made uh as you as you seen in verse 15 where as we shall reflect also in a later day when we're looking at uh the decree to the midwives. Okay. And so all this is panning through a lot a great chunk of time a great chunk of time. But nonetheless, this one thing we find to be uh to be consistent that through it all whether it is Joseph venturing into Egypt sold as a slave by his brother. Eventually what Joseph says is uh as as as Genesis ends, he says what that which in in in Genesis chapter 50 and verse 20. But as for you, you thought evil against me, but God meant it what? Meant it unto good to bring me to pass as it is this day to save much people alive. Amen. Sometimes, you know, even some of this persecution by the children of Israel, God used it to be the fuel for the children of Israel to desire to go back home. You know, sometimes we prosper in in in in in in places where we don't belong and God can allow us to prosper for a season. But when the time comes for us to move in, then sometimes God also orchestrate circumstances to to give us the urge that nudge to move uh and to and to settle us. And so it's simply uh telling us the historical background that indeed chapter one uh covers a large time span and many kings. But nonetheless, one God and his people and he is always faithful to them. Amen. So now to Mos Mosed the first uh in the year 1532 to 1514 is issuing a decree to the Hebrew midwives and he's telling them uh make sure you you be there when they're giving birth and and and do what? And ensure that they don't thrive. Please enlighten us more on it Chris so that we get to understand that perspective. Yes. Um you've writtly said that now there was this decree that was given to the midwives that um as soon as the baby uh the male children were to be born they were to be as it were um killed by the midwives who were who were facilitating that process. And what we find there was that a wave of it seems like um Satan was had gone had realized that there was it had come a time remember there was this prophecy that had been given that after 400 years um God shall uh uh deliver the children of Israel out of the land of of of where they had gone the land of bondage. Now, Satan being consciously aware of this prophecy uses the agency of the king who was who was at that time uh king um the pharaoh uh who issues the decree to the midwives that they should uh kill the the the children of born of the Israelite women. And the interesting thing about this history was that they as the interesting thing was that there came a time that uh the decrees varied that it was a time that uh at one point where the uh the like in the case of Moses when Moses comes into the scene he is the children were to be thrown actually into the river Nile as as it were as an offering to the god of to the god of uh uh fertility as it were. It was not only a form of persecution but it was also a form of idol idolatry that was going on because this was a society deeply entrenched in idolatry. In Exodus chapter 1, uh we also see an history uh a record that is placed there of two faithful um midwives who in spite of the king's edict to kill those children and to kill the children who had been born of the Israelites. They are faithful and in fact we find that they they stand out. And from verse 15 we we read the story that and the king of Egypt spake to the midwives. One the name of one was Shiffra and the other was poor. And he said when you do the office of midwives to the Hebrew women see them upon the stools. And if it be a son then you shall kill him. And if it be a daughter you shall live alive. But verse 17 is the key is it is that but the midwives feared God and did did not as the king of Egypt commanded them but they saved the men children alive. And the king of Egypt called for the midwives and said to them why have you done this thing and you have saved the men? And the midwife said unto Pharaoh, because the Hebrew women are not as Egyptian women, for they are lively and delivered air before the midwives come unto them. As we see here, the there is a continual theme that runs throughout through this history, through the life of of uh Joseph, through the life of uh now in the lives of these midwives. That comes into play. That really shows that God was using them to fulfill um uh the prophecy that after 400 years then the children of Israel shall be delivered out of the land of bondage. They feared not the the uh the what the Pharaoh had told them to do, which was to kill the male children. This shows us a new understanding and appreciation of what is the fear of the Lord. What really is the fear of the Lord? We're told that the fear of the Lord, I've thought about it this week. What is the fear of the Lord? The fear of the Lord, the Bible says in the book of Proverbs, is the beginning of knowledge. But is that the object the object of go of of the fear of the Lord? In the book of 1 John chapter 4, we are told that perfect love does what? Casts out fear. For fear hath torment. He that fears is not made perfect in love. As we grow initially in our journey of faith, fear and trepidation have a role in in bringing us to an understanding of who God is. But God wants us in that process to grow to perfect that fear of him. And it is perfected and anchored in the love that he has for us. And these women poor and uh Shifra are embodiment of what it means a perfected fear of God which was they had cast out the fear of man from their hearts such that they could look at the king and tell and and not follow that which was against the word of the Lord. And and this really is is an is a is is an is an interesting idea we need to have in our hearts. What kind of fear do we have? What kind of faith the quality the character quality of faith we find in these women was a deep a deepseated faith that was could not be moved even in spite of what the king was was uh was uh was giving them as as an edict. But you see the many of us in society we have the fear of man. We fear men more than we fear God. And I think it's a even as Christians if you look at the church our religious beliefs our how we function even in our corporate offices is shaped a lot by the fear of man. But God wants us to have a fear that is different that which is anchored in his word. And I think that's for me the key pick up from this point. The faithfulness of God to his covenant in terms of how they these women looked up to him. And number two, how these women had uh fear in their hearts which was the perfect love which casts out all the fear of man from from their hearts. For we are told that that if we are not perfected in love then we are as it were we can fall for anything. Yes. Thank you. Thank you. Um what therefore stands out is that uh we need only to fear God. And when you know the right thing just don't know it you need to do it. You action on it. So now Moses is born. We are translated to Exodus chapter 2. Raphael this is on you. Moses is born. Give us a a brief history of this of whatever surrounds the birth of Moses and let us experience it. Indeed. Now, Moses is born uh at a time in which there's a death decree that the Hebrew women uh especially the men the male children are supposed to to be um to be done away with. And uh chapter 2 and verse one opens and says there went a man of the house of Levy and took a to wife a daughter of Levy. So it tells us that he's from the tribe of Levy, pure bread. And it says, "And the woman conceived and bare a son and that she saw that he was a goodly child, she hid him for 3 months." We see a woman who is finds herself with child and then perhaps she was hoping and praying that let it be a girl because a girl would survive. You know, it's a it's a difficult time. It's a hard time. People are losing their children. But then lo and behold, it's a boy. But then she looks at him and the Bible records she he she saw him that he was a godly child and she hid him for 3 months and then beyond that it was difficult to hide him. Maybe she dressed him as a boy as a girl rather for a while. Maybe then after but beyond 3 months it was evident maybe this this child is not a girl you know in as much as you put him in a onesie or whatever other type of clothing you may put a child in. But now she decides now she's going to um build an ark of bulldashes. And then she puts some slime in it and pitch and then she put the child there and she laid it by the flags by the river's bank. She sets this child inside um a boat of sorts, you know, a basket made of reads. Uh and she waterproofs it and then she puts him there. And the Bible records in verse four that Moses had a sister and this older sister stood a far off to wait what will be done to him. A sister taking care worried for a younger brother. She had a she has a right to live. He deserves to die. Condemned by the very laws of the land from the king himself. And so she waits. Perhaps the mother is tense and she's gone away. But the daughter is there waiting, watching. But verse five tells us, shows us the hand of providence, the hand of God. See how God operates. Amen. Verse five says that the daughter of Pharaoh came down to wash herself at the river at that particular time, at that particular moment. And her maidens walked along by the riverside. And when she saw the ark among the flags, she sent her maid to fetch it. The divine providence led Pharaoh's daughter to behold this this this this basket hid amongst amongst uh amongst the the as they call them the flags you know uh God leads her to behold it and she asks her maidens to go and bring it and the Bible records once again and when they had when she had opened it she saw the child and the Bible records and Behold, the babe wept. Verse six says, "And she had compassion on him and said, this is one of the Hebrews children." So Pharaoh, Pharaoh's daughter knows for a fact, this is not an Egyptian child. This is one of the Hebrew children. And the Bible records she had compassion. That compassion is not only uh the reserve of the of the saved. that compassion is not only the reserve of those who know God, but I believe compassion is something that God has put in all human beings if we do not dead in our sense of it. If you do not if you do not um uh through continuous sinning and and and and evildoing to others, we we we we lose that delicate sensibility to be compassionate. Pharaoh's daughter is compassionate and she says for a fact this is one of the Hebrews children and it's at this particular point that God puts courage in Moses's sister. Verse 7 says then his sister then said his sister to Pharaoh's daughter. She comes up to royalty bold and she says shall I go and call to thee a nurse of the Hebrew women that she may nurse the child for thee? See how divine providence is bringing things together. And Pharaoh's daughter says what to her? Go. And the maid went and called the child's mother. This mother who had turned back home had broken having lost this goodly child that she had ra ra ra ra ra ra ra ra ra ra ra ra ra ra ra ra ra ra ra ra ra ra ra ra ra ra ra ra ra ra ra ra ra ra ra ra ra ra ra ra raised for three months. Lo and behold the daughter comes and says mother mother come. She asked where where are we going? We are going all the way to the royal palace. Pharaoh's daughter, the princess has taken our my my brother, your child, and you're going to be the wet nurse. You're the one who's going to take care of him and feed him, you know. And lo and behold, God gives a mother and child shelter in no other household. But that same household that made the law that this child deserves to die, this child lives in that household under the care of the daughter of the king, the princess. Indeed, God is powerful and God can provide. Regardless of what men may scheme, regardless of what men may may may may think to do, to destroy us, to put us down, if we trust in God, indeed he has a thousand1 ways to save us. Mother and child are united. And verse 10 says, "And the child grew, and she brought him into Pharaoh's daughter, and he became her son, and she called his name what? Moses." because I drew him out of the water. Moses as we know him, that is a name that is given to him by Pharaoh's daughter. It's an Egyptian name yet is a great name that many Jews today um take upon themselves and many Christians also take upon themselves Moses because he was drawn of the water. This is the wonderful story of Moses's birth. This is the wonderful story of how Moses is adopted by this princess who is known as Hateput um Hatsoot. Um uh it's a bit of a mouthful this Egyptian name but nonetheless uh Moses lives with her um and uh also under the guardianship and the patronage of uh of his own mother and his sister. Wonderful truth. How fascinating that his education and all these other things was sponsored by the same pharaoh who sought uh his own destruction telling us that God is always supreme and God will always triumph over evil. Amen. Uh such a beautiful story. It it really shows how God can interfere in the thoughts and plans that you have as human beings to ensure that his original plan comes to fulfillment. Also Moses lived there for many years but moving forward uh we realize that the education he got there you know he was being prepared to be the next pharaoh being that he was the son to to the the king's daughter so the preparation must have been great the education must have been great but then along the way there is a change of plans there was an original plan then there is a change of plan let's just look at uh Exodus chapter 2 from verses 11 all through 20 uh to verses 25 and and it is Moses now having to flee. The plan is changing because originally Moses goes and finds a Hebrew and an Egyptian fighting and then he overpowers the Egyptian and kills him and buries him. So the next time as he's walking around, you know, he's the prince, so he has authority to walk around. He finds that Hebrews are now fighting. It's a Hebrew against a a Hebrew. And he asked them, "You're brothers. So why why are you fighting? Brothers in essence are not supposed to fight." And then one of the brothers says, "Ah, who made you judge over us? Why are you trying to rule over us? Or is it your plan that you want to kill me like you killed the Egyptian?" You know, when he did that, he thought he was defending his people. But now the way it's coming out, it means therefore that the Pharaoh has. So a plan must be brought to ensure that Moses leaves to see another day. So now the plan of him becoming the prince or the next pharaoh in Egypt changes. So he has to flee to to the Medidianites. Uh it says years later after Moses had grown up he went out of his own people and observed just as I have given in a nutshell. Now he has to free to run to flee from Egypt. So he goes to Midian and finds a priest there who has seven daughters. An interaction that God had prepared before that these seven daughters will be drawing water and that there are some Ishmaelites who are troubling them. But this time around they find Moses who then offers to help them. So they go back home early enough and the Median priest is interested in this person who has saved his daughters. Eventually, the plan flows just as God intended it. In the perspective of humans, it was that Moses will become the next Pharaoh and probably use his influence to make sure that his people are well taken care of. But God has other plans to train him to become better, to give him the best training, a training that can be given by no other, but that really matters. knowing God and listening to his voice and learning to obey his word in that wilderness that he fled to. I don't know if any of you has anything they would want to say on this particular change of plan and and and how it impacts and what relevance it is in today's world. What do we see that will interfere with the plans that we have as human beings to ensure that God's plan reigns supreme eventually? Yeah. Um I think that's quite a an an a significant um uh uh background you've given us of the life of one of the probably the uh most prominent uh uh prophets in scripture and even throughout both in Christianom and even in in other religions in like Islam who is revered by by them And we see that his life generally is divided into three 40 about 40 years in each. The first 40 years is what you have introduced us to which was he spent a significant part of it. Remember there's a childhood training that he has in his mother's feet and the mom God had ordained that that early childhood training would impart on him and and uh st rub a stamp on him his identity as an Hebrew. I think that was a very it was something that could never be taken away from him. And he is of course now in the advantages provided by the household of the of of Pharaoh. He is now trained in the military sciences. He's trained in what in he's given the best skills as it were and he at the point at which he is coming in to as it were play the role of a deliverer after the 40 years Moses is he he seems he looks at himself and says I have I look I look like the best guy around here I'm the one who is able to do this and the transition Now that happens in the second 40 years of his life where he finds himself in Midian and he is uh he is in a desert and he is given the humble work of tending sheep through the desert and and it's and interestingly enough it is not the only one who goes through this training. David was also a shepherd and in in fact one of the endearing terms that God gives God God calls himself is a shepherd like if you read the book of Isaiah chapter 40 God calls him I am your shepherd and through the process of being a shepherd there are lessons he learned lessons of humility that he had not learned in the first 40 years lessons of patience of guiding of of of leadership leadership lessons that were very significant. And remember in the first 40 years Moses by the time Moses the way he wants to conduct the the deliverance would have not mirrored how God would have eventually wanted the salvation picture to h to to to be fulfilled in accordance to how uh the prophecy of a deliverer was to be because Moses is a type of Christ. He would have obliterated as it were. He would have uh cast a shadow over that beautiful image of how God was to play the role of of eventually saving the entire world from sin. And thus we I what I see in the history of Moses is is a change of plans. But it was a change of it is not really a change as it were but it is a divinely um guided uh detour of a path that he had early been on so that he could fulfill the prophecy the underlying prophecy. We are coming from a lesson which was speaking about uh uh prophet a pro which was really emphasizing about prophecy and you can see that god has to sometimes navigate us through different aspects change our stories says that and even in median I'm sure that Moses would have thought what am I doing for 40 years in median personally there was a time I had six months of my life when things were temporary sorry they were they were stagnant nothing was moving and I was wondering what is happening what is happening for 6 months nothing like life almost had come to a standstill but years later when I look back I can go back and tell God thank you for those six months because there are lifechanging lessons I took book lessons in prayer, less lessons in in waiting upon the Lord that I would have not learned in any other way than six months of stagnation. And that is what God I believe takes him through the 40 second 40 years. So that in the last 40 years where he is to play a significant role as deliverer, we find that Moses is the meakest man. Interesting. Moses is found to be the meakest man in Israel. What a title as it were for someone who was going to be to to have initially been a captain with a lot of uh charisma but now he is gentle. He is Christlike in his character. He has been molded through the the experience of the desert and he is now bearing a true reflection of Christlikkeness in him. Thank you. I think uh the change of plans also speaks to me of um sometimes we may know who we are. We may know what we are supposed to do but then we still need to wait on God. I think that is the most important thing here because this story would have read very differently. Moses need not have gone to the wilderness physically. Maybe he may have gone to the to to a wilderness mentally in terms of uh in terms of maybe being in mental anguish and looking for a way and a means by which to save the children of Israel. Perhaps God would have orchestrated in such a manner that he would have we now we would not we will not know you know um perhaps he would have being Pharaoh's daughter he may have risen at some point to become a prince you know and maybe eventually have an immigrant as a pharaoh we might never really tell you know and then maybe he will be in in uh in a position like uh Cyrus in uh amongst the mid and the persians to give a decree allowing for the children of Israel to go back, you know, and so we we we we we really won't know. But the lesson is there for us in that he decided to resort to violence, you know. Verse uh 12 says he looked this way and he looked that way, you know, and then when he saw that there was no man, he slew the Egyptian. He took matters into his own hand. You're also almost engaging in some sort of guorilla warfare and he hides this body. But then we see sister white writes in petri and prophets and says in slaying the Egyptian Moses had sinned. He was not prepared for the great work he had undertaken. He had entered upon it without divine direction and failed. It is possible for us my brothers and my sisters to know ourselves to know our mission. But then timing timing is important. We must wait on God to orchestrate our going in and our coming out to orchestrate our sitting down and our rising up. She continues and says God had not committed the work to him. God had not yet prepared him for it. And so we see his zeal was not what was not sanctified. His heart was filled with love for his people. His zeal for their deliverance was stirred. But God did not approve of violence as a method. And only time will tell how exactly uh rather history uh if we get to heaven and you ask that question if Moses had not slown the Egyptian, how would this story have gone? But nonetheless, it's also a story of the power of grace that even when we've ruined something, you know, sometimes we fail and you say, I wish I could go back. You know, you always I wish I could go back and I would have made a different decision. Some of us regret the people we married. I don't know. I wish I wish I could go back. I wouldn't have proposed, you know, but but this story tells us that even in in whatever marriage you are in in that wilderness, God is training you and he can turn uh your water into wine. Amen. And so and so God has got a way of of even when our plans change when things don't when things don't go uh ideally when we have decided to put matters into our hands and it because for for a fact verse 15 says after he realizes this thing has been known. Uh he says um Pharaoh had this thing. He sought to slay Moses, but Moses fled from the face of Pharaoh and dwelt in the land of Midian and he sat down by a well. What are the thoughts of this man who is now sitting by a well, you know, he must really be having a lot of regret. He must really be wondering what's going on now. You know, this is not the way it's supposed to go. I am the anointed of God. I am the chosen one to free my people. I have tried this thing but now my life, my very life, my very existence is in danger. Verse 14 also almost hints at what perhaps would have happened. The children of Israel are asking him who made their a prince or a judge over us. Perhaps God was pre was preparing a prince and a judge not only over the children of Israel but over the whole of the world because Egypt was a superpower. But the text tells us that God now uses where he ran. you know where he ran to this wilderness to reeducate him. God prepares a place for him there by the well. He who was drawn from the water goes back to the water. You know, he goes back to the well and there once again God meets with him and God prepares a place for him and even secures him a wife and a family and for 40 years educates him. Moses is is in such a state that even the the um uh Zippora um comes um and says uh we met an Egyptian like he doesn't even look like a like a like a Hebrew. they when they are being asked who helped you they say an Egyptian man helped us and so it's simply speaking to me also sometimes when my plans change when things don't go my way when I have failed uh or when it seems as if God has failed me because sometimes or somebody this or this or the other many our parents cannot afford to take us to the schools that we want to be taken to when our partners cannot afford maybe to give us the lifestyles that we want and we dream about that in all these things you know where we are currently today may not be where you you pictured yourself to be in this day and age. Maybe you're in your 40s, you're in your 30s, you're in your 20s, and you never really imagined you could be as frustrated and as confused as you are today. But it's simply telling us that even in our wilderness, let us find God. Even in our wilderness, God has got a plan for our lives and he will take us through and he will indeed get us to the promised land. Thank you. Uh that takes me to the thought in the book of Romans chapter 8:28. Actually, that's my all-time favorite verse. Even sometimes when I don't understand. It says, "In all things, God work for good to them that love the Lord to those who are called according to his purpose." So, the only question that I normally ask myself, even when it has taken so long, is do I still love the Lord? Because if I still love the Lord, then this thing is for my good even when I don't understand it. So as Moses was sitting at the well, he was not getting it, but it was for his own good so that the hotheadedness can be made into meekness. He can learn lessons on patience. I'm pretty sure God allowed Moses to meet Zippora and to give birth to Gashom so that he can learn a few lessons on patience. I'm a parent myself. I think I've learned to be patient because of the children God has given me. It's not very easy. You have to be very patient. So God intended those that was God's plan for Moses, not what he had planned for for himself. So at the end of it all, then we get to learn a few lessons that divine timing is often contrary to our fine desires and expectations. What you expect that's not what God expects. That's not his plan. He has his plan. So therefore, make your plan, but subject it. Commit to the Lord. uh proverbs reminds us chapter 16:3 you commit your plans and and to the lord and then they will be established meaning his will will reign supreme we also pick the lesson that sometimes evil people may violate rights of others however god promises that he will ensure that he assists those who are harmed no matter how tough it is no matter how silent it looks that god is not speaking on your terms. God is doing what he needs to do and his timing is the best. It may cost you your life but God's time truly has to come. We also pick the lesson that um when when we call upon God in our desperate times that God hears not because he wasn't listening but because he wants to act the time for action has come. So those for me are the lessons that stand out. I'll give you maybe you can tell us your closing remarks a minute each. We'll start with Chris uh before we get the entire summary and finish up. Uh thank you so much uh sister Chris. I think the the lesson for me here is about how personal God is with his people in their suffering. In Isaiah 63:9, we are told that in all Isaiah reflecting on the history of the children of Israel in the wilderness wondering, he says that in all their afflictions he was afflicted and the angel of his presence bore them all the years of their wondering. God is afflicted with his people literally. Literally. That is why when Paul persecutes the Christians in the early church and in Acts chapter 9, he is confronted by God when he is saying who art thou Lord. He says um he whom you have been persecuting persecuting and and it was not and it was not God was you Christ Christ had already resurrected and left for heaven but God identifies with the suffering of his people. So to to those who today are going through a situation that is difficult, God identifies with that situation personally to the depth of the pain. And he knows when there's a time for intervention and the time for intervention is right. Because in the children of Israel in in chapter two of of Moses, we say that God had and he saw that now it was the time to intervene and indeed there was a deliverer who is Moses who comes into the scene at this particular time and God did the work of deliverance that he had promised. Thank you. Amen. Amen. Thank you, Rafael. I think for me um it's um that those who honor God, he will honor. The midwives even their names are recorded in the Bible. Pharaoh's name is not recorded. Uh all these other even Pharaoh's daughter's name is not recorded. But we're told from chapter one the names of these midwives and how God in turn also blessed them, you know. And also another auxiliary lesson for me is sometimes the best education isn't going to isn't necessarily what we need for life. What we need for life isn't a Harvard education, isn't an Ivy League education, isn't one of the best uh type of education, but rather what we need uh is to be educated by God, to be directed by him. You see Moses thought having been educated in Pharaoh's household, he could be able to do uh to take upon himself to liberate them by power and by violence. But then we see God teaching him in the wilderness and eventually Moses as you said comes back as a meek man. Comes back as a meek man. And so sometimes our qualifications may fail us and uh may not provide a place for us and we may we may find that you have a you've got a great degree but you don't have a job. But in this wilderness in which you're in, seek God and find those lessons. And at the end of it all, you will emerge out of that situation a leader and ready and willing to fill up the purpose for which God has designed you indeed to lead not only yourself but others to the promised land. Thank you so much. Uh this book is primarily about God, not Moses. We welcome you to join this study with us. It's going to be an interesting journey. We welcome you. This is our day one. We have 13 more days to delve into it. Ensure that you join us each and every Sabbath morning. So, let's bow our heads and pray in closing. Let's pray. Father Lord, we thank you so much for your presence that has walked with us and enabled us to study these words. And indeed, we have seen that you are a God who hears. You're a God who relates. You are a God who feels. And eventually, you are a God that acts. And when you act, it is always the right time. Please intervene in in in in our situations, in the operations that we feel, the overwhelming circumstances. We call upon your presence that your grace will be sufficient to carry us through. And that at the end of it all, we shall say, indeed, this is the Lord's doing, and we have been delivered, and we are free. Bless us as we enjoy the rest of this Sabbath. bring us again to study your word the the next coming Sabbath and subsequent Sabbaths that we may enjoy this book the gospel book through the lenses of Moses for we have prayed in Jesus name. Amen. Amen. Amen. Thank you.

TIMESTAMPED TRANSCRIPT:
[6.6s] Happy Sabbath. I hope your Sabbath is
[9.4s] starting out fine. We welcome you to
[11.8s] this lesson, discussion uh study. This
[15.2s] is another new quarter that we are
[16.9s] grateful for. We are looking at the book
[18.9s] of Exodus. Uh before we begin this uh
[22.4s] very vital study, I would like us to bow
[25.0s] our heads and pray and then we can delve
[27.7s] into it. Let's pray.
[29.8s] Almighty God Jehovah, you are a loving
[32.2s] God. You're a mighty God. We thank you
[33.8s] for this Sabbath. We thank you for this
[36.2s] good and beautiful study of your word.
[39.0s] As we begin to delve into the book of
[41.0s] Exodus, may the power of the Holy Spirit
[43.4s] manifest himself to give us
[44.8s] understanding of your word and to give
[46.8s] us hope. Be with us as we start. Bless
[50.1s] the listeners until the end. For we have
[53.0s] prayed in Jesus name. Amen. So I'm
[56.2s] joined by uh we are three of us here. My
[59.1s] name is Christine Anguru. I'll be your
[61.8s] host for this morning. Uh on my right
[64.9s] side, uh you can introduce yourself.
[68.1s] Happy Sabbath. My name is Chrisal Beera.
[71.6s] I'm happy to be here today and welcome
[74.6s] you to our study today. Thank you.
[77.2s] Welcome. Uh on my left, you can
[79.0s] introduce yourself.
[79.8s] My name is Anongo Rafany. It's a
[81.7s] pleasure to be with you uh this quarter.
[83.6s] Thank you. Uh so Exodus the journey to
[87.4s] the promised land we are going to
[89.8s] experience the gospel but through the
[92.0s] lenses of Moses. We are used to
[94.3s] experiencing the gospel through the
[95.8s] lenses of Matthew, Mark, Luke and John
[97.9s] but this season we are looking at this
[100.8s] beautiful gospel message through the
[103.8s] book of Exodus. And and and I would like
[106.4s] to um introduce the topic for this week
[109.8s] operation the background and the birth
[112.6s] of Moses. Our key text comes from the
[115.4s] book of Exodus chapter 2 verse 23 all
[119.3s] through 25. Uh I'm going to read this is
[122.2s] what the Bible says. After a long time
[125.0s] the king of Egypt died. The Israelites
[127.8s] groaned because of their difficult labor
[130.1s] and they cried out and their cry for
[132.2s] help ascended to God because of the
[134.2s] difficult labor. So God heard their
[136.3s] groaning and he remembered his covenant
[138.6s] with Abraham, Isaac and Jacob. God saw
[142.0s] the Israelites and he took notice. Those
[145.5s] are very powerful word. This same God
[148.8s] who created now sees, hears and takes
[153.6s] notice. It doesn't mean that God was
[156.7s] absent when these things were happening.
[159.2s] But it shows that his time for action
[162.0s] had now come. Because our God is a God
[164.2s] of time and he comes and shows himself
[167.1s] at particular time which is normally the
[169.3s] right time. This book resonates with
[172.5s] those who are oppressed. I know the
[175.1s] marginalized, the persecuted, the
[177.0s] exploited, the degraded. We will feel
[180.2s] how much God loves us through the
[182.7s] degradation, through the oppression. We
[185.0s] will experience the love of God. And it
[187.8s] will indeed show that if God was able to
[190.6s] deliver the Hebrews, he can make the
[193.3s] same and deliver us even today. Now I
[196.2s] would like to keep the ball rolling uh
[199.0s] by asking my brother Raphael, God's
[201.8s] people in Egypt, what can you tell us
[204.3s] about God's people in Egypt? How did it
[206.5s] happen that they ended up there?
[208.7s] Indeed. Uh I think the book of uh Exodus
[211.9s] as uh is as it is known in Hebrew is
[215.4s] called Shemote which literally means
[217.4s] names. And it begins and opens and it
[220.3s] tells us in verse one of chapter 1 that
[223.5s] now these are the names of the children
[225.2s] of Israel which came into Egypt. Every
[227.4s] man and his household came with who?
[230.4s] With Jacob. Then they said Reuben,
[232.9s] Simeon, Ley, Judah, Issachar, Zebulun,
[235.3s] Benjamin, Dan, Napali, God, and Asher.
[237.8s] And all the souls that came out of the
[239.9s] li loins of Jacob were 70 souls. For
[243.3s] Joseph was in Egypt already. And Joseph
[246.2s] died. and all his brethren and all that
[249.5s] generation. So in essence it begins with
[252.8s] naming. It's it begins with the names of
[256.0s] the children of Jacob and um these are
[259.5s] the patriarch Jacob's family and the
[262.5s] Bible in essence is telling us something
[264.7s] that those who came it's sort of
[267.6s] introducing us to how they came in
[269.9s] because Exodus as we know it is coming
[271.8s] out you know moving out and and and it
[274.4s] begins with names of those who came in
[276.5s] first and how many they were. It says
[279.1s] there were 70 because Joseph was already
[281.4s] there. But then in verse 7, the Bible
[283.8s] records and says, "And the children of
[285.0s] Israel were fruitful and increased
[287.0s] abundantly and multiplied and waxed
[289.8s] exceedingly mighty and the land was
[293.0s] filled with them." So in the setting
[296.2s] it's simply telling us how the children
[299.6s] of God, the people of um or the children
[302.2s] of Israel prospered in Egypt. They came
[305.3s] in 70 and the Bible records that now uh
[309.6s] they were fruitful and they increase
[311.9s] abundantly. Not just a mega increase but
[315.4s] an abundant increase and it continues
[317.3s] and says and multiplied and waxed
[319.3s] exceedingly mighty and the land was
[322.5s] filled with them. I know the in in each
[325.6s] region there is a particular tribe that
[327.5s] we say uh is is you'll find them
[330.2s] anywhere you go into a volcano you'll
[332.3s] find them. These were the children of
[333.7s] Israel. The children of Israel, the
[335.5s] Bible records, the land was filled with
[338.4s] them. This is how God was fulfilling
[340.9s] that promise to Abraham that his
[342.7s] descendants were going to multiply. That
[345.6s] it so it shows also to a certain extent
[347.8s] how God was faithful to them. Even in
[350.5s] the land of refuge because they were
[352.6s] running away from femine, God still took
[354.9s] care of the children of Israel. They
[357.6s] multiplied and they waxed in abundance.
[360.6s] In that in fact in Exodus chapter 12 and
[363.8s] verse 37 we are told that by the time uh
[368.2s] they were going in verse 37 of Exodus
[370.6s] and the children of Israel journeyed
[371.8s] from Ramses to Sakot about 600,000 on
[375.4s] foot that were men beside children. This
[380.0s] was a multiplier effect. this 400 years
[383.7s] in Egypt uh this span which in which
[387.5s] they stayed in Egypt was an was a time
[389.9s] in which they grew and they multiplied.
[392.5s] But as as the text continues uh from
[395.1s] verses 8 to 11 of chapter 1, it
[398.9s] introduces us to the changes, the reason
[402.1s] why um to a certain extent the children
[404.7s] of Israel are crying out and and and the
[407.6s] beginnings of them now coming out. And
[410.1s] it introduces us to in verse 8 that
[413.3s] there arose a new king over Egypt which
[417.5s] knew not Joseph. It's not a new nation
[420.2s] that does not know Joseph. It's the same
[422.1s] nation. So Joseph is still in the in the
[424.8s] annals of history of Egypt. But it says
[428.6s] there arose a new king who knew not
[431.5s] Joseph. a king who simply chose to
[434.1s] ignore the impact and the and and and
[436.7s] the historical um saving bit that Israel
[441.2s] that the children of Israel through
[442.6s] Joseph had done in not not only saving
[445.4s] the world but also saving and preserving
[447.6s] the power of Egypt as a superpower at
[449.8s] that particular time when there was a
[451.5s] great famine in the whole world for
[454.2s] seven years. And so he he decides not to
[458.2s] acknowledge the children of Israel. And
[460.5s] whenever a people a particular people
[463.2s] group grows and becomes prominent then
[467.0s] sometimes those in power um become
[469.6s] threatened those who uh feel like they
[472.2s] indigenous even in our world today for
[474.7s] example in certain countries uh like in
[477.0s] the US
[477.9s] there are movements uh saying
[480.3s] immigration should be cailed because
[482.1s] these are foreigners why are they coming
[483.4s] to our lands you know these are
[484.8s] foreigners why are they taking our jobs
[486.9s] etc etc and so these movements are not
[489.4s] knew this uh similar sentiments had been
[493.0s] harbored by by the Egyptians especially
[496.2s] beginning from the leader from Pharaoh
[498.3s] himself. And therefore he comes up with
[501.7s] a way of sort of culling this population
[505.2s] uh uh um a system of um population
[508.9s] control. And the Bible records in verse
[511.4s] 8 uh verse 9, 10 and 11 that he said to
[514.2s] his people, "Behold, the children of
[515.5s] Israel are more and mightier than we."
[518.9s] And it continues and says, "Come on, let
[521.0s] us deal wisely with them, lest they
[522.9s] multiply. And it come to pass that when
[525.2s] they are fallth out any war, they join
[528.2s] also unto our enemies and fight against
[531.2s] us, and so get them up out of the land."
[534.9s] Verse 11 says, "Therefore they did set
[537.3s] over them task masters to afflict them
[539.8s] with with burdens, and they built for
[542.3s] Pharaoh treasured cities, Pitham and
[544.9s] Ramses. But the more they afflicted
[547.6s] them, the text says what happened?
[550.1s] The more
[550.7s] the more they multiplied and grew and
[553.6s] they were grieved because of the
[555.5s] children of Israel. The Bible is simply
[558.4s] speaking to us and telling us the story
[561.2s] of the children of Israel and how they
[563.8s] came to Israel to Egypt a small number
[567.7s] of 70 and how God blessed them and they
[571.0s] prospered and their prosperity
[572.7s] eventually uh led to uh the Egyptians
[577.1s] being insecure. So sometimes even in
[580.0s] life when we prosper and we see that our
[582.6s] success is threatening others, when we
[584.7s] see that our promotions are um and our
[587.6s] growth is is is leaving others uh
[590.2s] feeling sour and bitter, let us simply
[592.7s] know that this is this is the way of men
[595.5s] when they are unconverted. This is the
[597.4s] way of a man who believes and and and
[600.0s] and and doesn't um has has lost their
[604.0s] faith in God to to secure their place
[606.6s] here on earth and therefore they're
[607.6s] threatened by other people's successes.
[609.5s] The children of Egypt, Egypt as a nation
[611.6s] had benefited from the presence of
[613.8s] Israel. Joseph had saved that nation.
[616.4s] But yet later on after even Pharaoh, the
[620.2s] Bible records how Pharaoh gave uh Joseph
[623.1s] his his his own ring you know and and
[626.1s] and even gave him the second chariot
[628.2s] made him the second in in line in power.
[630.9s] And all this history is left out just
[633.8s] because of what? Because of jealousy and
[636.4s] because of fear. Because of fear because
[639.0s] sometimes to a certain extent we are
[640.3s] jealous because we are fear. We are
[641.9s] fearful that somebody is going to be
[643.9s] better than us. We are fearful that
[645.5s] somebody is going to prosper more than
[647.0s] us. They're going to be more happy than
[648.2s] us. They look more happy than us. And
[649.7s] therefore, we become we become we become
[651.9s] afraid. And unfortunately, this pharaoh
[655.1s] uh ruled by this fear and by this
[657.4s] jealousy because this nation was growing
[659.7s] great. Instead of coping their winning
[662.9s] formula and the formula was their trust
[664.7s] and their faith in God, he decides to
[666.7s] oppress them and to put them down. But
[668.6s] the Bible records, nonetheless, whatever
[671.8s] he did, no matter the human uh um things
[676.6s] that they did, God was still sovereign
[679.0s] and he still saved his people. The more
[681.2s] they punish them, the Bible records in
[684.1s] verse 12, the more they multiplied and
[686.9s] grew.
[687.7s] Thank you so much. So in in essence,
[689.6s] what you're capturing is that in every
[692.0s] circumstance that you are in, whatever
[694.8s] the human perspective, God still reigns.
[697.4s] So let's go back to the history, the
[699.8s] historical background a bit and and and
[702.4s] look at it. Joseph went through a hard
[705.3s] time. And anytime his brothers would see
[708.9s] him come, they would say, "Here comes
[710.0s] the dreamer." And they wanted to to get
[712.3s] rid of him. What they did not know that
[715.0s] sometimes when you're planning evil for
[717.4s] someone, God then presents himself to
[720.7s] use that opportunity to ensure that it
[723.4s] benefits you plus others in in the long
[727.3s] run. That's the essence the historical
[729.5s] background because Joseph now finds
[731.8s] himself in Egypt as a slave, works in
[735.4s] Pharaoh's house. He goes through a tough
[737.5s] time, but then eventually he ends up
[740.0s] being the second in command just as you
[741.6s] have mentioned. And wherever he was
[744.1s] passing people say bow your knee an
[745.8s] important person is coming. However
[748.2s] through the period when we are ending
[750.2s] verse seven then Joseph is dead and
[753.6s] Jacob is dead and that pharaoh who had
[755.9s] that experience the actual experience
[757.9s] with Joseph is no longer there. So we
[760.3s] find a new pharaoh. What will you say
[763.2s] about this historical background? What
[765.3s] stands out for you Chris? Uh for me I
[767.8s] think uh I want to tie it
[771.0s] uh to to how this story plays out in the
[775.8s] life of Joseph
[777.5s] and how now this comes into the scene of
[780.5s] the corporate body of uh Israel. uh
[783.7s] because I think you have clearly placed
[786.2s] it out uh brought it out that first of
[789.3s] all Joseph encounters
[791.9s] the same hatred Israel is going to
[794.1s] encounter from the Egyptians in his own
[796.6s] household
[798.3s] as an individual. He he he comes in in a
[803.9s] a very confrontational
[806.4s] uh relation with his brothers.
[810.0s] And then but the idea what I loved about
[813.2s] uh in the book of uh Genesis
[815.9s] um chapter 39:2 says that and the Lord
[819.4s] was with Joseph.
[821.4s] And the Lord was with Joseph. That
[824.1s] statement for me carries really the
[826.4s] weight and the burden of what transpired
[829.7s] not only in the life of Joseph but in
[832.7s] the corporate life of Israel.
[834.4s] Amen.
[834.9s] Because
[836.2s] as Joseph is undergoing suffering,
[839.2s] he is in prison. He in uh Portifer's
[843.3s] house and eventually he is elevated back
[846.8s] into into into prominence through the
[850.4s] power of God. You see the constant theme
[853.0s] through that journey is the personal
[855.9s] presence of God.
[857.6s] And this is what I believe Israel should
[860.7s] have carried through this transition
[862.6s] that they were going through. And what
[865.3s] we find is that it's it seems that even
[868.4s] in the next uh phase of the lesson which
[871.8s] we are going to come into the life of
[873.9s] the prominent person uh the prominent
[876.4s] person uh in in the book of Exodus who
[878.6s] is Moses. find that it is the same
[880.6s] thing. The Lord was with Moses
[883.8s] and that is what makes him different as
[887.4s] it were in the historical context of
[890.1s] what occurs in the whole of Israel.
[893.5s] The lesson there for for me as as I as I
[896.2s] look at the the the this historical
[899.0s] context of the book of Exodus was that
[902.9s] number one through the sufferings of the
[907.1s] men of God in scripture,
[910.4s] what carries them through was the
[914.9s] conscious realization that they had God
[918.4s] with them through the experiences they
[920.5s] were going through. And that is why he
[924.1s] could be in prison but still be joyful.
[930.3s] He could stand against Pifas and say I
[934.2s] cannot do this against my God because he
[938.2s] he has this conscious constant
[941.0s] realization of the presence of God.
[943.0s] Number two, because of that they were
[946.2s] strengthened, these men and and even the
[949.6s] corporate body of Israel, they were
[951.4s] strengthened to go through suffering.
[953.9s] Because suffering is a great is a very
[955.9s] major theme in the book of Exodus. We
[958.0s] find that because of this continuous
[961.0s] presence of God. Because God was with
[963.4s] them, they realized that it helped them
[966.9s] as a nation corporately to be able from
[971.3s] time to time when they were faithful to
[972.9s] God to attain great victories because
[975.9s] they knew who was with them. Yeah.
[979.4s] Amen. It is important to know who is
[981.4s] with you. So for the historical
[983.8s] background of the Israelites, uh them
[986.1s] being into bondage, what stands out for
[988.4s] you, Rafael?
[990.2s] I think uh what stands out for me is um
[993.7s] that chapter one of Exodus carries a lot
[997.4s] of um that it's almost summarizing
[1001.0s] almost uh uh almost the entirety of the
[1004.2s] 400 years of the children of Israel. how
[1006.5s] they came in, how they prospered, and
[1008.8s] how eventually a Pharaoh who knew not
[1011.1s] Moses comes about. And um the lesson
[1013.8s] writers have taken the time to to to
[1016.1s] look uh into the history and uh and um
[1019.6s] and uh um and have been able to give us
[1022.6s] um some of these deaths and we're told
[1024.3s] that um this pharaoh who knew not Moses
[1026.9s] is posited to be a Hamos who ruled from
[1030.3s] 1580 to um 1546 BC. And so uh it's
[1035.8s] telling uh and eventually the pharaoh
[1038.6s] who now um meets with Moses when Moses
[1041.9s] goes and says God is saying let my
[1043.9s] people go is Pharaoh Tut Mos III who is
[1048.1s] from 1504 to 1450 BC almost a span of
[1052.6s] around 130 years. That tells me that
[1055.3s] perhaps for around 270 years the
[1058.2s] children of Israel had been in peace and
[1060.2s] prosperity. But with the with a with a
[1063.7s] rising to power of a Hamos, then he
[1067.4s] begins to deal with what he what today
[1069.7s] we would know we would term as a problem
[1072.1s] the problem of immigrants. You know,
[1074.0s] these immigrants are growing and and and
[1075.8s] they're taking positions and and and
[1078.0s] they're prospering more than more than
[1080.2s] um more than um more than the locals.
[1083.0s] But then he fails to understand that
[1085.4s] these immigrants helped to build and
[1087.3s] preserve this nation. These immigrants,
[1089.9s] he puts them to work, you know, he puts
[1091.5s] them uh to heavy labor. But eventually,
[1094.9s] nonetheless, God still uh God still uh
[1098.5s] sustains and guides it. We're also told
[1101.5s] about um after Mos there was another
[1104.4s] another pharaoh, I mean Hotep the first
[1107.9s] later um who ruled the Israelites with
[1110.7s] fear and oppressed them. Later there was
[1112.2s] to Moses the first who issued the death
[1114.3s] decree for all the Hebrew male children
[1116.6s] which is made uh as you as you seen in
[1119.0s] verse 15 where as we shall reflect also
[1121.6s] in a later day when we're looking at uh
[1123.4s] the decree to the midwives. Okay. And so
[1127.0s] all this is panning through a lot a
[1129.8s] great chunk of time a great chunk of
[1131.8s] time. But nonetheless, this one thing we
[1134.6s] find to be uh to be consistent that
[1137.8s] through it all whether it is Joseph
[1140.2s] venturing into Egypt sold as a slave by
[1142.6s] his brother. Eventually what Joseph says
[1144.7s] is uh as as as Genesis ends, he says
[1147.6s] what that which in in in Genesis chapter
[1151.4s] 50 and verse 20. But as for you, you
[1153.8s] thought evil against me, but God meant
[1156.1s] it what? Meant it unto good to bring me
[1159.0s] to pass as it is this day to save much
[1161.5s] people alive.
[1162.8s] Amen.
[1163.2s] Sometimes, you know, even some of this
[1165.3s] persecution by the children of Israel,
[1166.9s] God used it to be the fuel for the
[1169.0s] children of Israel to desire to go back
[1170.8s] home. You know, sometimes we prosper in
[1173.2s] in in in in in places where we don't
[1175.7s] belong
[1176.6s] and God can allow us to prosper for a
[1178.7s] season. But when the time comes for us
[1180.5s] to move in, then sometimes God also
[1183.4s] orchestrate circumstances to to give us
[1185.8s] the urge that nudge to move uh and to
[1189.4s] and to settle us. And so it's simply uh
[1192.0s] telling us the historical background
[1193.8s] that indeed chapter one uh covers a
[1197.4s] large time span and many kings. But
[1200.6s] nonetheless, one God and his people and
[1203.5s] he is always faithful to them.
[1205.2s] Amen. So now to Mos Mosed the first uh
[1209.7s] in the year 1532 to 1514 is issuing a
[1213.3s] decree to the Hebrew midwives and he's
[1216.6s] telling them uh make sure you you be
[1219.4s] there when they're giving birth and and
[1220.7s] and do what? And ensure that they don't
[1223.4s] thrive.
[1224.8s] Please enlighten us more on it Chris so
[1226.8s] that we get to understand that
[1228.2s] perspective.
[1229.4s] Yes. Um you've writtly said that now
[1233.2s] there was this decree that was given to
[1235.7s] the midwives that um as soon as the baby
[1241.9s] uh the male children were to be born
[1245.0s] they were to be as it were um killed by
[1249.4s] the midwives who were who were
[1251.3s] facilitating that process. And what we
[1254.8s] find there was that
[1257.8s] a wave of it seems like um Satan was had
[1263.2s] gone had realized that there was it had
[1266.7s] come a time remember there was this
[1269.0s] prophecy that had been given that after
[1271.8s] 400 years
[1274.0s] um God shall uh uh deliver the children
[1277.3s] of Israel out of the land of of of where
[1280.8s] they had gone the land of bondage.
[1283.3s] Now, Satan being consciously aware of
[1287.0s] this prophecy uses
[1290.0s] the agency of the king who was who was
[1294.4s] at that time uh king um the pharaoh uh
[1299.3s] who issues the decree to the midwives
[1302.0s] that they should uh kill the the the
[1307.0s] children of born of the Israelite women.
[1310.6s] And the interesting thing about this
[1313.4s] history was that
[1316.8s] they as the interesting thing was that
[1321.0s] there came a time that uh the decrees
[1326.0s] varied that it was a time that uh at one
[1329.8s] point where the uh the like in the case
[1332.3s] of Moses when Moses comes into the scene
[1335.9s] he is the children were to be thrown
[1338.5s] actually into the river Nile as as it
[1340.6s] were as an offering to the god of to the
[1344.6s] god of uh uh fertility as it were. It
[1349.1s] was not only a form of persecution but
[1353.4s] it was also a form of idol idolatry that
[1357.4s] was going on because this was a society
[1360.4s] deeply entrenched in idolatry.
[1364.3s] In Exodus chapter 1, uh we also see an
[1368.3s] history uh a record that is placed there
[1372.1s] of two faithful um midwives who in spite
[1377.4s] of the king's
[1380.4s] edict
[1381.9s] to kill those children and to kill the
[1385.7s] children who had been born of the
[1387.4s] Israelites. They are faithful and in
[1390.2s] fact we find that they they stand out.
[1395.4s] And from verse 15 we we read the story
[1398.2s] that and the king of Egypt spake to the
[1400.1s] midwives. One the name of one was
[1403.0s] Shiffra and the other was poor. And he
[1405.5s] said when you do the office of midwives
[1408.1s] to the Hebrew women see them upon the
[1411.2s] stools. And if it be a son then you
[1413.4s] shall kill him. And if it be a daughter
[1416.0s] you shall live alive. But verse 17 is
[1419.3s] the key is it is that but the midwives
[1423.1s] feared God and did did not as the king
[1427.0s] of Egypt commanded them but they saved
[1429.8s] the men children alive. And the king of
[1433.0s] Egypt called for the midwives and said
[1435.2s] to them why have you done this thing and
[1437.3s] you have saved the men? And the midwife
[1439.8s] said unto Pharaoh, because the Hebrew
[1442.8s] women are not as Egyptian women, for
[1445.3s] they are lively and delivered air before
[1449.0s] the midwives come unto them.
[1453.0s] As we see here, the there is a continual
[1457.3s] theme that runs throughout through this
[1461.0s] history, through the life of of uh
[1463.4s] Joseph, through the life of uh now in
[1466.6s] the lives of these midwives. That comes
[1469.5s] into play. That really shows that God
[1472.1s] was using them to fulfill um uh the
[1475.0s] prophecy that after 400 years then the
[1478.6s] children of Israel shall be delivered
[1480.1s] out of the land of bondage. They feared
[1483.2s] not the the uh the what the Pharaoh had
[1488.2s] told them to do, which was to kill the
[1490.3s] male children. This shows us a new
[1494.6s] understanding and appreciation of what
[1496.6s] is the fear of the Lord. What really is
[1499.3s] the fear of the Lord? We're told that
[1500.6s] the fear of the Lord, I've thought about
[1502.6s] it this week. What is the fear of the
[1504.2s] Lord? The fear of the Lord, the Bible
[1505.6s] says in the book of Proverbs, is the
[1507.6s] beginning of knowledge. But
[1511.2s] is that the object the object of go of
[1514.2s] of the fear of the Lord? In the book of
[1516.6s] 1 John chapter 4, we are told that
[1518.9s] perfect love does what? Casts out fear.
[1524.2s] For fear hath torment. He that fears is
[1526.9s] not made perfect in love.
[1529.8s] As we grow initially in our journey of
[1533.7s] faith, fear and trepidation have a role
[1538.2s] in in bringing us to an understanding of
[1541.9s] who God is. But God wants us in that
[1546.4s] process to grow to perfect that fear of
[1550.2s] him. And it is perfected and anchored in
[1553.3s] the love that he has for us. And these
[1556.6s] women poor and uh Shifra are embodiment
[1561.4s] of what it means a perfected fear of God
[1564.6s] which was they had cast out the fear of
[1567.8s] man from their hearts such that
[1572.5s] they could look at the king and tell and
[1574.8s] and not follow that which was against
[1578.2s] the word of the Lord. And and this
[1580.8s] really is is an is a is is an is an
[1584.4s] interesting idea we need to have in our
[1587.0s] hearts. What kind of fear do we have?
[1589.4s] What kind of faith the quality the
[1591.8s] character quality of faith we find in
[1593.4s] these women was a deep a deepseated
[1597.7s] faith that was could not be moved even
[1600.7s] in spite of what the king was was uh was
[1604.4s] uh was giving them as as an edict. But
[1608.1s] you see the many of us in society we
[1611.3s] have the fear of man. We fear men more
[1613.9s] than we fear God. And I think it's a
[1617.9s] even as Christians if you look at the
[1620.6s] church our religious beliefs our how we
[1625.7s] function even in our corporate offices
[1628.8s] is shaped a lot by the fear of man. But
[1632.0s] God wants us to have a fear that is
[1635.6s] different that which is anchored in his
[1638.3s] word. And I think that's for me the key
[1641.4s] pick up from this point. The
[1643.2s] faithfulness of God to his covenant in
[1646.0s] terms of how they these women looked up
[1648.7s] to him. And number two, how these women
[1651.9s] had uh fear in their hearts which was
[1655.4s] the perfect love which casts out all the
[1658.9s] fear of man from from their hearts. For
[1661.3s] we are told that that if we are not
[1662.8s] perfected in love then we are as it were
[1667.6s] we can fall for anything. Yes. Thank
[1670.6s] you. Thank you. Um what therefore stands
[1674.0s] out is that uh we need only to fear God.
[1677.5s] And when you know the right thing just
[1679.5s] don't know it you need to do it. You
[1682.1s] action on it. So now Moses is born. We
[1685.3s] are translated to Exodus chapter 2.
[1687.8s] Raphael this is on you. Moses is born.
[1690.8s] Give us a a brief history of this of
[1694.2s] whatever surrounds the birth of Moses
[1695.8s] and let us experience it.
[1698.6s] Indeed. Now, Moses is born uh at a time
[1701.0s] in which there's a death decree
[1702.8s] that the Hebrew women uh especially the
[1705.4s] men the male children are supposed to to
[1708.6s] be um to be done away with. And uh
[1712.0s] chapter 2 and verse one opens and says
[1713.9s] there went a man of the house of Levy
[1716.1s] and took a to wife a daughter of Levy.
[1718.8s] So it tells us that he's from the tribe
[1720.4s] of Levy, pure bread.
[1722.1s] And it says, "And the woman conceived
[1723.7s] and bare a son and that she saw that he
[1726.0s] was a goodly child, she hid him for 3
[1728.6s] months."
[1729.4s] We see a woman who is finds herself with
[1733.7s] child and then perhaps she was hoping
[1736.2s] and praying that let it be a girl
[1738.2s] because a girl would survive. You know,
[1740.4s] it's a it's a difficult time. It's a
[1742.3s] hard time. People are losing their
[1743.9s] children.
[1745.3s] But then lo and behold, it's a boy. But
[1748.4s] then she looks at him and the Bible
[1751.1s] records she he she saw him that he was a
[1755.2s] godly child and she hid him for 3 months
[1758.6s] and then beyond that it was difficult to
[1760.7s] hide him. Maybe she dressed him as a boy
[1763.6s] as a girl rather for a while. Maybe then
[1765.8s] after but beyond 3 months it was evident
[1767.8s] maybe this this child is not a girl you
[1770.0s] know in as much as you put him in a
[1772.2s] onesie or whatever other type of
[1774.2s] clothing you may put a child in. But now
[1777.6s] she decides now she's going to um build
[1782.7s] an ark of bulldashes. And then she puts
[1786.2s] some slime in it and pitch and then she
[1788.7s] put the child there and she laid it by
[1791.2s] the flags by the river's bank. She sets
[1794.2s] this child inside um a boat of sorts,
[1797.5s] you know, a basket made of reads.
[1799.8s] Uh and she waterproofs it and then she
[1803.5s] puts him there. And the Bible records in
[1805.9s] verse four that Moses had a sister and
[1809.3s] this older sister stood a far off to
[1812.2s] wait what will be done to him. A sister
[1815.9s] taking care worried for a younger
[1819.4s] brother.
[1820.5s] She had a she has a right to live. He
[1823.3s] deserves to die. Condemned by the very
[1826.0s] laws of the land from the king himself.
[1829.0s] And so she waits. Perhaps the mother is
[1832.2s] tense and she's gone away. But the
[1834.2s] daughter is there waiting, watching. But
[1837.1s] verse five tells us, shows us the hand
[1839.4s] of providence, the hand of God. See how
[1841.5s] God operates.
[1842.3s] Amen.
[1842.6s] Verse five says that the daughter of
[1843.9s] Pharaoh came down to wash herself at the
[1846.2s] river
[1847.0s] at that particular time, at that
[1848.5s] particular moment. And her maidens
[1850.3s] walked along by the riverside. And when
[1853.3s] she saw the ark among the flags, she
[1855.8s] sent her maid to fetch it. The divine
[1858.5s] providence led Pharaoh's daughter to
[1861.4s] behold this this this this basket hid
[1864.8s] amongst amongst uh amongst the the as
[1868.4s] they call them the flags you know uh God
[1872.7s] leads her to behold it and she asks her
[1875.4s] maidens to go and bring it and the Bible
[1878.2s] records once again and when they had
[1881.0s] when she had opened it
[1883.6s] she saw the child and the Bible records
[1887.1s] and Behold, the babe wept.
[1891.1s] Verse six says, "And she had compassion
[1894.1s] on him and said, this is one of the
[1897.4s] Hebrews children." So Pharaoh, Pharaoh's
[1901.3s] daughter knows for a fact, this is not
[1903.8s] an Egyptian child.
[1905.1s] This is one of the Hebrew children. And
[1907.5s] the Bible records she had compassion.
[1910.8s] That compassion is not only uh the
[1913.0s] reserve of the of the saved. that
[1915.1s] compassion is not only the reserve of
[1917.3s] those who know God, but I believe
[1919.0s] compassion is something that God has put
[1920.8s] in all human beings if we do not dead in
[1923.4s] our sense of it. If you do not if you do
[1925.9s] not um uh through continuous sinning and
[1928.8s] and and and evildoing to others, we we
[1932.2s] we we lose that delicate sensibility to
[1935.4s] be compassionate. Pharaoh's daughter is
[1938.1s] compassionate and she says for a fact
[1941.0s] this is one of the Hebrews children and
[1942.8s] it's at this particular point that God
[1944.5s] puts courage in Moses's sister. Verse 7
[1947.2s] says then his sister then said his
[1949.6s] sister to Pharaoh's daughter. She comes
[1951.8s] up to royalty bold and she says shall I
[1955.9s] go and call to thee a nurse of the
[1958.2s] Hebrew women that she may nurse the
[1961.2s] child for thee? See how divine
[1963.3s] providence is bringing things together.
[1965.4s] And Pharaoh's daughter says what to her?
[1967.3s] Go. And the maid went and called the
[1970.2s] child's mother. This mother who had
[1972.6s] turned back home had broken having lost
[1975.6s] this goodly child that she had ra ra ra
[1977.6s] ra ra ra ra ra ra ra ra ra ra ra ra ra
[1977.6s] ra ra ra ra ra ra ra ra ra ra ra ra ra
[1977.7s] ra ra ra ra ra ra ra ra ra ra ra raised
[1977.9s] for three months. Lo and behold the
[1979.9s] daughter comes and says mother mother
[1982.3s] come. She asked where where are we
[1985.0s] going? We are going all the way to the
[1987.2s] royal palace. Pharaoh's daughter, the
[1989.8s] princess has taken our my my brother,
[1993.5s] your child, and you're going to be the
[1995.8s] wet nurse. You're the one who's going to
[1997.5s] take care of him and feed him, you know.
[2000.6s] And lo and behold, God gives a mother
[2005.5s] and child shelter in no other household.
[2009.0s] But that same household that made the
[2010.7s] law that this child deserves to die,
[2013.4s] this child lives in that household under
[2015.8s] the care of the daughter of the king,
[2018.4s] the princess. Indeed, God is powerful
[2022.3s] and God can provide. Regardless of what
[2024.7s] men may scheme, regardless of what men
[2026.8s] may may may may think to do, to destroy
[2029.4s] us, to put us down, if we trust in God,
[2032.7s] indeed he has a thousand1 ways to save
[2036.5s] us. Mother and child are united. And
[2038.7s] verse 10 says, "And the child grew, and
[2040.9s] she brought him into Pharaoh's daughter,
[2043.4s] and he became her son, and she called
[2046.5s] his name what? Moses." because I drew
[2050.1s] him out of the water. Moses as we know
[2052.6s] him, that is a name that is given to him
[2055.4s] by Pharaoh's daughter. It's an Egyptian
[2058.0s] name yet is a great name that many Jews
[2060.7s] today um take upon themselves and many
[2063.5s] Christians also take upon themselves
[2066.2s] Moses because he was drawn of the water.
[2069.6s] This is the wonderful story of Moses's
[2072.5s] birth. This is the wonderful story of
[2075.4s] how Moses is adopted by this princess
[2079.4s] who is known as Hateput
[2082.0s] um Hatsoot.
[2084.0s] Um uh it's a bit of a mouthful this
[2086.7s] Egyptian name but nonetheless uh Moses
[2089.8s] lives with her um and uh also under the
[2093.7s] guardianship and the patronage of uh of
[2096.6s] his own mother and his sister. Wonderful
[2099.7s] truth. How fascinating that his
[2102.2s] education and all these other things was
[2104.9s] sponsored by the same pharaoh who sought
[2108.0s] uh his own destruction telling us that
[2110.2s] God is always supreme and God will
[2112.7s] always triumph over evil.
[2115.4s] Amen. Uh such a beautiful story. It it
[2119.0s] really shows how God can interfere in
[2122.0s] the thoughts and plans that you have as
[2124.4s] human beings to ensure that his original
[2127.3s] plan comes to fulfillment. Also Moses
[2131.3s] lived there for many years but moving
[2134.2s] forward uh we realize that the education
[2137.0s] he got there you know he was being
[2138.3s] prepared to be the next pharaoh being
[2140.2s] that he was the son to to the the king's
[2143.4s] daughter
[2144.6s] so the preparation must have been great
[2147.0s] the education must have been great but
[2149.3s] then along the way there is a change of
[2152.1s] plans there was an original plan then
[2154.5s] there is a change of plan let's just
[2156.6s] look at uh Exodus chapter 2 from verses
[2159.8s] 11 all through 20 uh to verses 25 and
[2163.7s] and it is Moses now having to flee. The
[2166.4s] plan is changing because originally
[2168.7s] Moses goes and finds a Hebrew and an
[2171.4s] Egyptian fighting and then he overpowers
[2174.7s] the Egyptian and kills him and buries
[2176.9s] him. So the next time as he's walking
[2179.7s] around, you know, he's the prince, so he
[2182.2s] has authority to walk around. He finds
[2184.4s] that Hebrews are now fighting. It's a
[2186.5s] Hebrew against a a Hebrew. And he asked
[2189.1s] them, "You're brothers.
[2190.7s] So why why are you fighting? Brothers in
[2193.0s] essence are not supposed to fight." And
[2194.8s] then one of the brothers says, "Ah, who
[2199.0s] made you judge over us? Why are you
[2201.3s] trying to rule over us? Or is it your
[2203.9s] plan that you want to kill me like you
[2206.0s] killed the Egyptian?" You know, when he
[2208.0s] did that, he thought he was defending
[2210.2s] his people. But now the way it's coming
[2211.8s] out, it means therefore that the Pharaoh
[2214.2s] has. So a plan must be brought to ensure
[2218.2s] that Moses leaves to see another day. So
[2221.5s] now the plan of him becoming the prince
[2223.9s] or the next pharaoh in Egypt changes. So
[2226.6s] he has to flee to to the Medidianites.
[2229.4s] Uh it says years later after Moses had
[2232.8s] grown up he went out of his own people
[2234.6s] and observed just as I have given in a
[2237.6s] nutshell. Now he has to free to run to
[2241.2s] flee from Egypt. So he goes to Midian
[2245.5s] and finds a priest there who has seven
[2247.8s] daughters. An interaction that God had
[2250.2s] prepared before that these seven
[2252.5s] daughters will be drawing water and that
[2255.0s] there are some Ishmaelites who are
[2256.8s] troubling them. But this time around
[2258.1s] they find Moses who then offers to help
[2260.2s] them. So they go back home early enough
[2263.4s] and the Median priest is interested in
[2266.2s] this person who has saved his daughters.
[2268.8s] Eventually, the plan flows just as God
[2272.4s] intended it. In the perspective of
[2275.4s] humans, it was that Moses will become
[2277.3s] the next Pharaoh and probably use his
[2279.6s] influence to make sure that his people
[2282.3s] are well taken care of. But God has
[2284.3s] other plans to train him to become
[2286.8s] better, to give him the best training, a
[2289.3s] training that can be given by no other,
[2291.8s] but that really matters. knowing God and
[2296.6s] listening to his voice and learning to
[2298.8s] obey his word in that wilderness that he
[2302.2s] fled to. I don't know if any of you has
[2304.6s] anything they would want to say on this
[2306.7s] particular change of plan
[2309.2s] and and and how it impacts and what
[2311.8s] relevance it is in today's world. What
[2315.6s] do we see that will interfere with the
[2318.2s] plans that we have as human beings to
[2319.8s] ensure that God's plan reigns supreme
[2322.0s] eventually?
[2322.9s] Yeah. Um I think that's quite a an an a
[2325.7s] significant
[2327.5s] um uh uh background you've given us of
[2332.1s] the life of one of the probably the uh
[2336.2s] most prominent
[2338.1s] uh uh prophets in scripture
[2341.0s] and even throughout both in Christianom
[2343.6s] and even in in other religions in like
[2347.4s] Islam who is revered
[2350.5s] by by them And we see that his life
[2354.6s] generally is divided into three 40 about
[2358.9s] 40 years in each. The first 40 years is
[2362.7s] what you have introduced us to which was
[2365.6s] he spent a significant part of it.
[2368.0s] Remember there's a childhood training
[2370.6s] that he has in his mother's feet and the
[2373.8s] mom God had ordained that that early
[2378.8s] childhood training would impart on him
[2382.6s] and and uh st rub a stamp on him his
[2386.7s] identity as an Hebrew. I think that was
[2389.8s] a very it was something that could never
[2392.2s] be taken away from him. And he is of
[2395.4s] course now in the advantages provided by
[2398.0s] the household of the of of Pharaoh. He
[2401.0s] is now trained in the military sciences.
[2404.6s] He's trained in what in he's given the
[2407.8s] best skills as it were and he at the
[2411.4s] point at which he is coming in to as it
[2415.2s] were play the role of a deliverer after
[2417.0s] the 40 years Moses is
[2421.6s] he he seems he looks at himself and says
[2424.7s] I have I look I look like the best guy
[2427.0s] around here
[2428.7s] I'm the one who is able to do this
[2432.9s] and the transition Now that happens in
[2435.7s] the second 40 years of his life where he
[2438.6s] finds himself in Midian and he is uh he
[2443.0s] is in a desert and he is given the
[2446.3s] humble
[2447.9s] work
[2449.5s] of tending sheep
[2453.1s] through the desert and and it's and
[2455.8s] interestingly enough it is not the only
[2458.3s] one who goes through this training.
[2460.2s] David was also a shepherd and in in fact
[2464.9s] one of the endearing terms that God
[2467.8s] gives God God calls himself is a
[2471.8s] shepherd like if you read the book of
[2473.2s] Isaiah chapter 40 God calls him I am
[2476.1s] your shepherd
[2477.9s] and
[2479.8s] through the process of being a shepherd
[2482.2s] there are lessons he learned lessons of
[2484.6s] humility that he had not learned in the
[2487.0s] first 40 years lessons of patience
[2490.0s] of guiding of of of leadership
[2493.1s] leadership lessons that were very
[2495.4s] significant. And remember in the first
[2497.8s] 40 years Moses by the time Moses the way
[2500.8s] he wants to conduct the the deliverance
[2504.1s] would have not mirrored how God would
[2508.1s] have eventually wanted the salvation
[2512.1s] picture to h to to to be fulfilled in
[2516.0s] accordance to how uh the prophecy of a
[2518.6s] deliverer was to be because Moses is a
[2521.0s] type of Christ. He would have
[2523.3s] obliterated as it were. He would have uh
[2527.0s] cast a shadow over that beautiful image
[2530.3s] of how God was to play the role of of
[2535.8s] eventually saving the entire world from
[2539.1s] sin. And thus we I what I see in the
[2543.6s] history of Moses is is a change of
[2547.3s] plans. But it was a change of it is not
[2550.7s] really a change as it were but it is a
[2554.6s] divinely
[2556.1s] um guided uh detour of a path that he
[2561.4s] had early been on so that he could
[2564.7s] fulfill
[2566.8s] the prophecy the underlying prophecy. We
[2569.0s] are coming from a lesson which was
[2571.3s] speaking about uh uh prophet a pro which
[2575.5s] was really emphasizing about prophecy
[2578.2s] and you can see that god has to
[2581.4s] sometimes navigate us through different
[2584.9s] aspects change our stories says that and
[2588.6s] even in median I'm sure that Moses would
[2590.6s] have thought what am I doing for 40
[2592.4s] years in median personally there was a
[2596.0s] time I had six months of my life when
[2599.0s] things were temporary sorry they were
[2601.7s] they were stagnant nothing was moving
[2605.5s] and I was wondering what is happening
[2609.4s] what is happening for 6 months nothing
[2613.1s] like life almost had come to a
[2615.2s] standstill but years later when I look
[2618.3s] back I can go back and tell God thank
[2622.1s] you for those six months because there
[2625.1s] are lifechanging lessons I took book
[2628.6s] lessons in prayer, less lessons in in
[2631.8s] waiting upon the Lord that I would have
[2634.1s] not learned in any other way than six
[2636.6s] months of stagnation. And that is what
[2639.4s] God I believe takes him through the 40
[2642.0s] second 40 years. So that in the last 40
[2644.3s] years where he is to play a significant
[2647.5s] role as deliverer, we find that Moses is
[2651.2s] the meakest man. Interesting. Moses is
[2654.7s] found to be the meakest man in Israel.
[2657.0s] What a title as it were for someone who
[2660.6s] was going to be to to have initially
[2663.4s] been a captain with a lot of uh charisma
[2667.6s] but now he is gentle. He is Christlike
[2671.8s] in his character. He has been molded
[2674.4s] through the the experience of the desert
[2677.4s] and he is now bearing a true reflection
[2681.8s] of Christlikkeness in him. Thank you. I
[2686.0s] think uh the change of plans also speaks
[2687.9s] to me of um sometimes we may know who we
[2692.8s] are. We may know what we are supposed to
[2696.2s] do but then we still need to wait on
[2699.8s] God. I think that is the most important
[2702.9s] thing here because this story would have
[2705.5s] read very differently. Moses need not
[2707.8s] have gone to the wilderness physically.
[2710.3s] Maybe he may have gone to the to to a
[2712.5s] wilderness mentally in terms of uh in
[2715.2s] terms of maybe being in mental anguish
[2717.4s] and looking for a way and a means by
[2719.3s] which to save the children of Israel.
[2721.3s] Perhaps God would have orchestrated in
[2723.6s] such a manner that he would have we now
[2726.0s] we would not we will not know you know
[2728.4s] um perhaps he would have being Pharaoh's
[2731.4s] daughter he may have risen at some point
[2733.9s] to become a prince you know and maybe
[2736.6s] eventually have
[2739.4s] an immigrant as a pharaoh
[2741.1s] we might never really tell you know and
[2743.2s] then maybe he will be in in uh in a
[2745.8s] position like uh Cyrus in uh amongst the
[2749.2s] mid and the persians to give a decree
[2751.2s] allowing for the children of Israel to
[2753.1s] go back, you know, and so we we we we we
[2758.6s] really won't know. But the lesson is
[2760.6s] there for us in that he decided to
[2763.4s] resort to violence, you know. Verse uh
[2767.0s] 12 says he looked this way and he looked
[2769.4s] that way, you know, and then when he saw
[2772.0s] that there was no man, he slew the
[2774.3s] Egyptian. He took matters into his own
[2776.3s] hand. You're also almost engaging in
[2778.2s] some sort of guorilla warfare and he
[2779.8s] hides this body. But then we see sister
[2782.6s] white writes in petri and prophets and
[2784.8s] says in slaying the Egyptian Moses had
[2787.8s] sinned. He was not prepared for the
[2790.1s] great work he had undertaken. He had
[2793.0s] entered upon it without divine direction
[2795.8s] and failed. It is possible for us my
[2799.5s] brothers and my sisters to know
[2801.2s] ourselves to know our mission. But then
[2804.2s] timing timing is important. We must wait
[2807.6s] on God to orchestrate our going in and
[2811.4s] our coming out to orchestrate our
[2813.4s] sitting down and our rising up. She
[2816.2s] continues and says God had not committed
[2818.3s] the work to him. God had not yet
[2821.0s] prepared him for it. And so we see his
[2824.2s] zeal was not what was not sanctified.
[2826.6s] His heart was filled with love for his
[2828.5s] people. His zeal for their deliverance
[2830.3s] was stirred. But God did not approve of
[2833.2s] violence as a method. And only time will
[2837.0s] tell how exactly uh rather history uh if
[2840.8s] we get to heaven and you ask that
[2842.0s] question if Moses had not slown the
[2843.8s] Egyptian, how would this story have
[2845.9s] gone?
[2846.6s] But nonetheless, it's also a story of
[2848.7s] the power of grace that even when we've
[2851.0s] ruined something,
[2852.4s] you know, sometimes we fail and you say,
[2855.2s] I wish I could go back. You know, you
[2857.6s] always I wish I could go back and I
[2859.6s] would have made a different decision.
[2861.1s] Some of us regret the people we married.
[2863.0s] I don't know. I wish I wish I could go
[2865.2s] back. I wouldn't have proposed, you
[2866.6s] know, but but this story tells us that
[2868.6s] even in in whatever marriage you are in
[2870.9s] in that wilderness, God is training you
[2873.2s] and he can turn uh your water into wine.
[2876.3s] Amen. And so and so God has got a way of
[2879.7s] of even when our plans change when
[2882.0s] things don't when things don't go uh
[2884.3s] ideally when we have decided to put
[2886.6s] matters into our hands and it because
[2889.2s] for for a fact verse 15 says after he
[2893.5s] realizes this thing has been known. Uh
[2896.5s] he says um Pharaoh had this thing. He
[2899.9s] sought to slay Moses, but Moses fled
[2901.8s] from the face of Pharaoh and dwelt in
[2903.6s] the land of Midian and he sat down by a
[2906.4s] well. What are the thoughts of this man
[2909.3s] who is now sitting by a well, you know,
[2913.0s] he must really be having a lot of
[2914.9s] regret. He must really be wondering
[2916.8s] what's going on now. You know, this is
[2918.8s] not the way it's supposed to go. I am
[2920.2s] the anointed of God. I am the chosen one
[2922.4s] to free my people. I have tried this
[2924.7s] thing but now my life, my very life, my
[2926.8s] very existence is in danger. Verse 14
[2929.6s] also almost hints at what perhaps would
[2931.7s] have happened. The children of Israel
[2933.2s] are asking him who made their a prince
[2935.3s] or a judge over us. Perhaps God was pre
[2938.4s] was preparing a prince and a judge not
[2941.3s] only over the children of Israel but
[2942.9s] over the whole of the world because
[2945.2s] Egypt was a superpower. But the text
[2948.2s] tells us that God now uses where he ran.
[2952.4s] you know where he ran to this wilderness
[2954.6s] to reeducate him. God prepares a place
[2956.8s] for him there by the well. He who was
[2959.5s] drawn from the water goes back to the
[2961.1s] water.
[2961.8s] You know, he goes back to the well and
[2963.4s] there once again God meets with him and
[2966.0s] God prepares a place for him and even
[2968.2s] secures him a wife and a family and for
[2971.0s] 40 years educates him. Moses is is in
[2973.8s] such a state that even the the um uh
[2977.5s] Zippora um comes um and says uh we met
[2983.4s] an Egyptian like he doesn't even look
[2985.6s] like a like a like a Hebrew. they when
[2987.8s] they are being asked who helped you they
[2989.2s] say an Egyptian man helped us and so
[2991.9s] it's simply speaking to me also
[2993.9s] sometimes when my plans change when
[2995.5s] things don't go my way when I have
[2997.4s] failed uh or when it seems as if God has
[3000.6s] failed me because sometimes or somebody
[3003.0s] this or this or the other many our
[3005.1s] parents cannot afford to take us to the
[3006.6s] schools that we want to be taken to when
[3008.4s] our partners cannot afford maybe to give
[3010.7s] us the lifestyles that we want and we
[3012.4s] dream about that in all these things you
[3015.0s] know where we are currently today may
[3017.3s] not be where you you pictured yourself
[3019.0s] to be in this day and age. Maybe you're
[3021.0s] in your 40s, you're in your 30s, you're
[3022.8s] in your 20s, and you never really
[3024.7s] imagined you could be as frustrated and
[3026.7s] as confused as you are today. But it's
[3028.7s] simply telling us that even in our
[3030.2s] wilderness, let us find God. Even in our
[3032.7s] wilderness, God has got a plan for our
[3034.3s] lives and he will take us through and he
[3036.6s] will indeed get us to the promised land.
[3040.3s] Thank you. Uh that takes me to the
[3042.4s] thought in the book of Romans chapter
[3044.2s] 8:28. Actually, that's my all-time
[3046.3s] favorite verse. Even sometimes when I
[3048.2s] don't understand. It says, "In all
[3051.4s] things, God work for good to them that
[3054.3s] love the Lord to those who are called
[3056.0s] according to his purpose."
[3057.8s] So, the only question that I normally
[3059.7s] ask myself, even when it has taken so
[3061.4s] long, is do I still love the Lord?
[3064.0s] Because if I still love the Lord, then
[3065.8s] this thing is for my good even when I
[3068.4s] don't understand it. So as Moses was
[3070.2s] sitting at the well, he was not getting
[3072.8s] it, but it was for his own good so that
[3075.5s] the hotheadedness can be made into
[3078.1s] meekness.
[3079.3s] He can learn lessons on patience. I'm
[3081.6s] pretty sure God allowed Moses to meet
[3083.6s] Zippora and to give birth to Gashom so
[3086.7s] that he can learn a few lessons on
[3088.2s] patience. I'm a parent myself. I think
[3090.6s] I've learned to be patient because of
[3092.6s] the children God has given me. It's not
[3094.7s] very easy. You have to be very patient.
[3096.9s] So God intended those that was God's
[3099.4s] plan for Moses, not what he had planned
[3101.3s] for for himself. So at the end of it
[3104.0s] all, then we get to learn a few lessons
[3107.0s] that divine timing is often contrary to
[3109.5s] our fine desires and expectations.
[3112.2s] What you expect that's not what God
[3114.2s] expects. That's not his plan. He has his
[3116.4s] plan. So therefore, make your plan, but
[3119.4s] subject it. Commit to the Lord. uh
[3121.5s] proverbs reminds us chapter 16:3 you
[3124.8s] commit your plans and and to the lord
[3127.1s] and then they will be established
[3129.0s] meaning his will will reign supreme we
[3131.9s] also pick the lesson that sometimes evil
[3134.5s] people may violate rights of others
[3137.3s] however god promises that he will
[3140.7s] ensure that he assists those who are
[3144.2s] harmed
[3145.5s] no matter how tough it is no matter how
[3147.8s] silent it looks that god is not speaking
[3150.9s] on your terms. God is doing what he
[3152.9s] needs to do and his timing is the best.
[3156.1s] It may cost you your life but God's time
[3159.1s] truly has to come. We also pick the
[3162.2s] lesson that um
[3164.8s] when when we call upon God in our
[3167.0s] desperate times that God hears not
[3170.3s] because he wasn't listening but because
[3172.8s] he wants to act the time for action has
[3175.8s] come. So those for me are the lessons
[3178.0s] that stand out. I'll give you maybe you
[3180.4s] can tell us your closing remarks a
[3182.4s] minute each. We'll start with Chris uh
[3185.4s] before we get the entire summary and
[3188.0s] finish up.
[3189.0s] Uh thank you so much uh sister Chris. I
[3191.8s] think the
[3193.5s] the lesson for me here is about how
[3197.3s] personal God is with his people in their
[3200.7s] suffering. In Isaiah 63:9, we are told
[3204.8s] that in all Isaiah reflecting on the
[3209.0s] history of the children of Israel in the
[3211.5s] wilderness wondering, he says that in
[3213.7s] all their afflictions he was afflicted
[3216.4s] and the angel of his presence bore them
[3218.7s] all the years of their wondering.
[3222.7s] God is afflicted with his people
[3225.9s] literally.
[3227.3s] Literally. That is why when Paul
[3231.1s] persecutes the
[3233.5s] Christians in the early church and in
[3236.2s] Acts chapter 9,
[3238.9s] he is confronted by God when he is
[3242.4s] saying
[3244.9s] who art thou Lord. He says um he whom
[3249.4s] you have been
[3250.6s] persecuting
[3251.2s] persecuting and and it was not and it
[3254.1s] was not God was you Christ Christ had
[3257.4s] already resurrected and left for heaven
[3260.2s] but God identifies with the suffering of
[3263.6s] his people. So to to those who today are
[3267.5s] going through a situation that is
[3269.2s] difficult,
[3270.7s] God identifies with that situation
[3272.8s] personally to the depth of the pain. And
[3277.6s] he knows when there's a time for
[3279.4s] intervention and the time for
[3281.4s] intervention is right. Because in the
[3283.4s] children of Israel in in chapter two of
[3287.0s] of Moses, we say that God had and he saw
[3291.8s] that now it was the time to intervene
[3294.8s] and indeed there was a deliverer who is
[3297.8s] Moses who comes into the scene at this
[3300.9s] particular time and God did the work of
[3304.2s] deliverance that he had promised. Thank
[3306.1s] you.
[3306.3s] Amen. Amen.
[3307.0s] Thank you, Rafael. I think for me um
[3309.7s] it's um that those who honor God, he
[3312.6s] will honor. The midwives even their
[3315.0s] names are recorded in the Bible.
[3316.7s] Pharaoh's name is not recorded.
[3318.7s] Uh all these other even Pharaoh's
[3321.0s] daughter's name is not recorded.
[3323.5s] But we're told from chapter one the
[3326.6s] names of these midwives and how God in
[3329.4s] turn also blessed them, you know. And
[3331.8s] also another auxiliary lesson for me is
[3334.9s] sometimes the best education isn't going
[3338.3s] to isn't necessarily what we need for
[3341.0s] life.
[3341.8s] What we need for life isn't a Harvard
[3344.0s] education, isn't an Ivy League
[3346.2s] education, isn't one of the best uh type
[3349.0s] of education, but rather what we need uh
[3351.8s] is to be educated by God, to be directed
[3354.2s] by him. You see Moses thought having
[3356.4s] been educated in Pharaoh's household, he
[3358.2s] could be able to do uh to take upon
[3360.8s] himself to liberate them by power and by
[3363.1s] violence. But then we see God teaching
[3365.7s] him in the wilderness and eventually
[3368.2s] Moses as you said comes back as a meek
[3370.6s] man. Comes back as a meek man. And so
[3373.0s] sometimes our qualifications may fail us
[3376.0s] and uh may not provide a place for us
[3377.8s] and we may we may find that you have a
[3379.4s] you've got a great degree but you don't
[3381.0s] have a job. But in this wilderness in
[3383.2s] which you're in, seek God and find those
[3385.9s] lessons. And at the end of it all, you
[3388.2s] will emerge out of that situation a
[3390.4s] leader and ready and willing to fill up
[3393.7s] the purpose for which God has designed
[3396.1s] you indeed to lead not only yourself but
[3399.0s] others to the promised land.
[3401.1s] Thank you so much. Uh this book is
[3403.6s] primarily about God, not Moses. We
[3406.3s] welcome you to join this study with us.
[3409.1s] It's going to be an interesting journey.
[3411.1s] We welcome you. This is our day one. We
[3413.3s] have 13 more days to delve into it.
[3416.3s] Ensure that you join us each and every
[3418.1s] Sabbath morning. So, let's bow our heads
[3420.5s] and pray in closing. Let's pray. Father
[3423.8s] Lord, we thank you so much for your
[3425.7s] presence that has walked with us and
[3428.0s] enabled us to study these words. And
[3431.0s] indeed, we have seen that you are a God
[3433.1s] who hears. You're a God who relates. You
[3435.6s] are a God who feels. And eventually, you
[3437.8s] are a God that acts. And when you act,
[3440.5s] it is always the right time. Please
[3442.9s] intervene in in in in our situations, in
[3446.0s] the operations that we feel, the
[3448.0s] overwhelming circumstances. We call upon
[3450.0s] your presence that your grace will be
[3451.9s] sufficient to carry us through. And that
[3454.2s] at the end of it all, we shall say,
[3456.2s] indeed, this is the Lord's doing, and we
[3458.2s] have been delivered, and we are free.
[3460.8s] Bless us as we enjoy the rest of this
[3462.6s] Sabbath. bring us again to study your
[3464.5s] word the the next coming Sabbath and
[3467.0s] subsequent Sabbaths that we may enjoy
[3470.2s] this book the gospel book through the
[3473.0s] lenses of Moses for we have prayed in
[3475.2s] Jesus name.
[3475.9s] Amen.
[3476.2s] Amen.
[3476.8s] Amen.
[3477.5s] Thank you.
