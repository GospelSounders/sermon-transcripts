Good morning, dear viewers. Happy happy Sabbath. Shabbat. Shalom. Sabbath. And good morning to you all from wherever you are watching from. My name is Leila Awino and I'm so glad you could join us this morning for another blessed Sabbath worship right here at New Life SDA Church, Fifth Gang Avenue at the heart of Nairobi. It's a bright and warm Sabbath morning here at Nairobi, Kenya. And we're so glad that you could find time this special Sabbath day to join us. And we pray that you shall be blessed. I hope that your week was an amazing week. If at all maybe your week wasn't the best, worry not because your joys lie in this Sabbath and I'm sure that the Holy Spirit will work through the speakers that you'll hear today to bless you all. Today at New Life Church, we are having our strategic plan Sabbath. This Sabbath only comes once in every five years where we launch our strategic plan for the next five years. And it is exciting to hear that we are going to launch a new plan this Sabbath because we can't wait to see what plans that this book contains for the various departments that we have in this church. If you have been following through, you may notice that we do have many departments and for the smooth running of these departments, we do need this plan to help us in this church. Well, our elder, our head elder will be sharing some valuable insights from the Bible this Sabbath day based on the book of Matthew chapter 28, the great commission. And we can't wait to hear what he has to tell us. Well, I hope that you will have an amazing Sabbath this Sabbath day. And we pray that you will be blessed. Tell our friend to tell our friend. Make sure you join with your whole family. If at all you can't make it to New Life SDA church, follow us on all our social media platforms which include our YouTube channel at New Life SDA Church, our Facebook channel page at New Life SDA Church, the 2CBN YouTube channel, and of course, Radio Nama. Well, with all that said, may the Lord's will be done. My name is Leila. Why don't you have a happy Sabbath?
