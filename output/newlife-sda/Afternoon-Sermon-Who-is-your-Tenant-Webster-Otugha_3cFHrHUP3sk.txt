FULL TRANSCRIPT:
We dedicate every child in this sacred place. Holy, holy, holy, holy, God is here. And this is Bethl. A lesson we are going to learn from a military tradition. There was a colonel who fell into a well. A soldier was summoned to throw a rope into the well and pull the canel out. The moment the colonel was about to get out of the well, the soldier would leave the rope, stand at a ten shon and salute and the colonel would fall back into the well. This happened many times. Someone suggested that uh a brigadier be requested to help because he wouldn't have to salute the colonel. A brigade arrived after he threw the rope rope into the well and the colonel grabbed it on pulling the rope. As soon as the colonel was about to come out of the well on spotting the brigadier, you can imagine what he did. He immediately let go of the rope to salute and he fell back into the well again. There was total silence. Then everyone heard the desperate Colonel's voice from down below. I will drown here. Please get hold of my one of my classmates. I will drown here. Please get hold of one of my classmates. I will drown here. Please get hold of my classmates. I will drown here. Please get hold of my classmates. The moral of the story is classmates are important. Try and stay connected with your classmates or your classmates even after school. You'll need them at one time or they may need you at one time. We need each other in life. Eventually he was rescued because a classmate was sent and classmate came to his rescue. We are all classmates. Happy Sabbath. We are all classmates. Happy Sabbath. Alliance girls. We are all classmates. Happy Sabbath. Stare boys. We are all classmates. Happy Sabbath. Uh Upper Hill High School. All right. Mang Manga. Happy Sabbath. Happy Sabbath. The preacher got up and said, "Stand to your feet. We'll start with a prayer. If you have a need, let it be heard, saints. Let it be known. We are all family and we're not alone. [Music] That's when he saw her in the back of the church. Silence and sadness cried out the heart. The kind shepherd knew just what to say. I need to know before we pray. an unspoken [Music] request. Does anybody have one here tonight? Did you come with a burden? You can share a need in your life. Just lift up your hand to the one who can give you rest. Child, have no fear. Our God can hear, an unspoken [Music] request. Well, the preacher whispered as she raised her hand. Sweet Holy Spirit, come by her and stand. When her tears started falling, he had no doubt that in the throne room of heaven, her secret was out, an unspoken request. Does anybody have one here tonight? Did you come with a burden? You can share a need in your life. Just lift up your hands to the one who can give you rest. Child, have no fear. Our God can heal an unspoken request. Child, have no fear. Our God can hear an unspoken request. [Music] We are all classmates here. Spirit of God our teacher be Christ our Lord is the principle. Sweet Sabbath school is this place. We are all equal in this place. Let us pray. Savior and friend, we have a long way to go yet a short time to get there. Master, the fields are ripe but the harvesters are few. How we pray that may your spirit one more time come down the same way Samson prayed this one more time oh Lord we pray one more time that may you come down and occupy us inside and outside one more time that our viewers online may also connect with you this one more time oh Lord is our sincere prayer through Christ our Lord and Savior. Amen. A story is told of uh that is about 15 20 years ago somewhere in South B a story is told of a family that came somewhere from Mandera I don't know who they were and they rented a house and the family was big so they rented a house which uh they rented two houses bungalows which were connected they were in the same block but they were separate houses and these people paid a rent for five years meaning that the landlord was not coming to see the house for 5 years and he was happy. He enjoyed the the lumpsum amount that he was given. When the five years ended, he came to the house only to realize that the two houses were no longer two but one cuz the the sitting rooms, the wall that was separating the sitting rooms had been brought down. And if you're on this side of the sitting room, you can walk through the other side. And when he checked again, he realized that the doors leading to the various places like kitchen store and all those others because they were wooden, they had been turned into firewood and there were no doors there and the kitchen walls were black. That tells you that they were using firewood to cook in that house. When the tenant, the the landlord came in, he realized that he had rented a house, but he did not know unto whom he did the the the renting. He did not know who the tenant was. The sinks were broken. And someone also told the same the person who was telling me the story told me that the that the toilet was also in a dilapidated state. not to talk about the tiles and the floors. Everything was just bad. And that reminds me of also another story about my auntie that when where I was staying when I was staying with her and she had some rental houses, some rental rooms and she was very categorical that she'd rent it out to anyone except someone who's doing uh butchery business. I didn't understand why. But when I heard the story later, I realized that indeed that if you are a house owner, if you are a landlord, then you are the one who decides who the tenant is. There are some constructive tenants and there are some destructive tenants. There are some tenants who when they come into the place, they change the tiles into the best the quality the market can offer. They change in the the ceiling the best that the market can offer. And the the the place is so well decorated. And when you walk into the compound, it is well manicured. You can tell that this is a constructive tenant. But they are also destructive tenants. Hence the question, who is your tenant? Happy Sabbath. Happy Sabbath. I'll be requesting for your indulgence, please. when I ask you what our sharing is all about about the the rhetorical question, please just respond. I know the food was nice and at this particular time other faculties are shutting down and you want to rest but please just bear with us for this moment. What is the title of our sharing? What is it ladies from alliance? Okay. What is it? Mangu men. All right, alliance, please show them how it should be done. All right, who will come to our rescue? People from uh upper hill, are you there? Where is Christ? Where is Christ? Where is Christ? Where is Christ? What is our title this afternoon? Who is your tenant? Thank you very much. Upper Hill. upper hill staying in the upper room and who is inside? Who is inside? Okay, Christ is inside. Who is the tenant? That is the question that we are asking. Is there all right I will I I will disre I will try and uh disregard the children. They're enjoying themselves. Number one thing that you have to realize is that you must test the spirit. If you must if you have to vet the tenant before allowing them to occupy your house or your ten or your temple, the question still remains, who is your tenant? Is it God or is it the the legion? The rogue tenant has come to steal, to kill and destroy. When the rogue tenant comes in, there is no peace. There is no sanity of mind. There is no clothes and there is no house for this person to occupy. That is an example we see from the demoniac. But when Christ comes in, he says, "I have come that you might have life and have it abundantly." Let us go to the book of Luke 8 26 all the way to number 40. Luke 8 26. And they arrived at the country of the gatherines which is over against Galilee. And when he went forth to land, there met him out of the city a certain man which had devils long time and wore no clothes, neither abode in houses but in the tombs. There's something that is interesting in verse number 27. When the tenant is of a different pedigree, then this is what happens. When he and and when he went forth to land, there met him out of the city a certain man. Who was the tenant in this man which had devils long time? How long did the did the tenants had stay? These tenants had stayed a very long time in this house. And now look at the consequences of this this kind of tenants staying in this house. They made the landlord not to wear any clothes. They made the landlord not to abide in houses. They made the landlord to just constantly stay in the tombs. And when he saw Jesus, he cried out and he fell down before him and with a loud voice said, "What have I to do with thee, Jesus, thou son of God most high? I beseech thee, torment me not." Verse 29. For he had commanded the unclean spirit to come out of the man. for often times it had caught him and he was kept abound. He was kept bound with chains and infetters and he broke the bonds and he was driven of the devils into the wilderness. Now when this kind of rogue tenants stay even if you're bound with chains and fetterss they give you some certain extraordinary strength that you break the fetterss and you are you go and dwell in the wilderness. And Jesus asked him, now I'm paraphrasing today. And Jesus asked him, saying, "Who is your tenant? What is thy name?" And he said, "Please answer me in a chorus." And he said, "Leion." Because many devils were entered into him. And they besought him that he would not command them to go out into the deep. And there was there a herd of many swine feeding on the mountain. And there besought him and they besought him that he would suffer them to enter into the swine. And he allowed them to enter into the swine. Then went the devils out of the man and entered into the swine. When you have a rogue tenant, he doesn't spare human beings. He doesn't spare animals, too. And the hard ran violently down a steep place into the lake, and were choked. When they and when they that fed them saw that what was done, they fled and went and told it in the city and in the country. Then they went out to see what was done and came to Jesus and found the man out of whom the devils were departed. Sitting at the feet of Jesus, number one, clothed number two, and in his right mind, number three, and they were afraid. Now when the rogue tenants have been kicked out then you find that this individual and the Holy Spirit comes in to stay. Then this individual can be found number one sitting at the feet of Jesus number two clothed decently number three in his right mind and other people really get afraid because of what they see. Let us take a pose and look at what is happening there. More often than not, we usually look for uh the people called counselors to help out because we look for people. Why? Because we we try and uh give it some scientific uh terms and call it uh schizophrenia. Other people call it mental illness and other people call it so many things. But the question that I'm asking is these people who are having these conditions, have you ever asked your the question who the tenant is? Most of the time we give them physical medicine to tackle physical flesh and blood, but we don't get rid of the tenant who is affecting the well-being of this individual. And after we've given them those drugs, they they drool and they rest there, but the tenant is still inside. given an opportunity, you still find them going to kill themselves. In order to have the in order to have this thing fully tackled, then we must get rid of the rogue tenants inside. And the rogue tenants are but demons, are but legions. And once they are gotten rid of, then you'll find these individuals, they will be in their right minds. And the right mind is when Christ is inside. Happy Sabbath. Where is Christ? Where is Christ? Where is Christ? Inside. Where is Christ? Inside. Inside inside. And when Christ is inside, we can be found sitting at his feet. We can be found clothed with his righteousness and in our right mind. And others will be afraid and wondering what had happened. Let us first of all ask ourselves this question before we take them to counselors and before we spend all that money in those counseling sessions. Let us ask ourselves now we have taken them to the counselors but do we know who their tenant is? That is the question that we need to ask. Once we get rid we once we get to know who the tenant is then we will know how to handle the tenant how to get rid of the tenant and how to reverse the condition and these people will eventually join us in sanity of mind. Hallelujah to the lamb of God. Verse number 36. They also which saw it told them by what means that he that was possessed of the devils was healed. Then the whole multitude of the country of gatherines round about besought him to depart from there for they were taken with great fear and he went up into the ship and returned back again. I'm wondering if someone has come and brought salvation why are you chasing him away? Verse 38. Now the man out of whom the devils were departed besought him that he might be with him. But Jesus sent him away saying verse 39 return to thy own house one more time cuz when the this rogue tenant came in he drove you from the house and you were staying among the tombs. Now one now you need to go back to your own house. Now that exactly reminds us of what the pastor had talked about in the morning here that you come as disciple then now you go back as a missionary. Now return to your own house and show how great things God has done unto thee. And when he went his and he went his way and published throughout the whole city how great things Jesus had done unto him. When Christ comes in, you cannot keep quiet with it. When Christ comes in, you cannot walk naked anymore. When Christ comes in, you cannot stay amongst the tombs. And it came to pass when Jesus was returned, the people gladly received him, for they were all waiting for him. Hallelujah to the lamb of God. If you have a rogue tenant, you the victim, get up and storm the heavenly courtroom and tell the powerful, the most powerful, the righteous judge that you cannot afford the legal fees. You cannot handle it anymore. Your tenant is rogue and you need deliverance. Cry out like Peter cried and God will help you immediately. For such cries, God does not delay to respond. Matthew chapter 14 verse number 29 30 and 31 and he said come and when Peter was come down out of the ship he walked on the water to go to Jesus but when he saw the wind boisterous he was afraid and beginning to sink. He cried saying Lord save. That is the prayer that we need to offer when we are attacked by the rogue tenant. We just cry out Lord save. Hallelujah. I'm seeing some young man really tuning some young beautiful girl and I'm busy toiling here. Happy Sabbath. Some young man is busy tuning some beautiful girl somewhere and they are seated right in front and uh so now what do I do? Should I let them carry on or should I continue preaching? All right, you can do that later. It is at this particular time we are concentrating on who the tenant is. The story you're telling there is already a a testimony of who the tenant is in those people who are talking. Happy Sabbath. Let's bring our minds into this place cuz we have got a short time and by in a little while the this session will be over. It is an edification time. Note tuning ladies time. Happy Sabbath. Happy Sabbath. Let us go. Matthew chapter 14 verse number 29. And he said, "Come." And when Peter was come down out of the ship. He walked on the water to go to the to Jesus. But when he saw that the wind was boisterous, he was afraid and beginning to sink, he cried, saying, "Lord, save." Now let us emulate Peter. Anytime the rogue, the rogue tenant comes in, we cry to the Lord, saying, "Lord, save." And such cries, the Lord never delays to respond to such. Verse number 31. And immediately Jesus stretched forth his hand and caught him and said unto him, "Oh thou of little faith, where did you doubt? Why did you doubt?" Resist the the evil tenant. Don't sympathize and start accommodating him by accommodating a small few small bad behaviors here and there. But instead, James 4:7 tells us one thing. Submit yourselves therefore to God. Resist the devil and he will free he will flee from you. Submit yourselves therefore to God. Resist the devil and he will flee from you. One thing we realize is that the the tenant determines your eternal destiny. If you have the good tenant, your destiny is eternal glory. But if you had the wrong tenant, you are forever lost. The tenant determines your eternal destiny. Look at the Egyptians who are lost forever. Exodus 14:3. The Egyptians cherished the rogue tenant in them that were instead of joining the the Lord's side, they decided to mistreat the Israelites. And when the Israelites were going back home, they decided to run after them to bring them back. Now, Exodus chapter 14 verse number 13 is a very sad sad statement. And and it's because the tenant who in them determined their eternal destiny which was lost. Exodus 14:13. And Moses said unto the people, "Fear ye not. Stand still and see the salvation of the Lord which he will show you which he will show to you today. For the Egyptians whom you have seen today, you shall see them again no more forever. For the tenant inside of them has lied to them and in a little while they are going to drown and forever lost eternally. The tenant determines your destiny. Happy Sabbath. Happy day. All right. Thank you. Let us look at Judas the betrayer. The one who loved money. He even decided to betray a cause, an eternal cost just for a few pieces of silver. Matthew chapter 27 verse number 3, 4 and 5. Then Judas which had betrayed him when he saw that he was condemned. No, in fact, let us not even jump that. Let us let us uh first of all go back and read uh Luke chapter 22 verse number three where Satan entered into Judas. Luke 22:3 4 5 and 6. Then entered Satan into Judas son named Iscariot being of the number of the 12. and he went his way and communed with the chief priests and captains. I realize something here that is very sad that sometimes the chief priests, the captains, the elders, the evangelists like me and the rest of us, sometimes we commune with people whom Satan has entered inside. And the sad statement is can two walk together unless they are in agreement. If Satan has entered that individual and we are communing with him and we are coming into a consensus with him then something is wrong. The tenant who's the devil who's the tenant in the other person means that he's also occupying me. Sometimes we go for these counelss and Judas also comes along and Judas comes along after Satan has entered into him and while he's communing with the chief priest they are in one accord then it means that not all councils are being led by the Holy Spirit. So we have to be very careful that before we sit down in every council, we must first ask ourselves who is the tenant inside. Who is the tenant who is occup who is chairing that meeting? And when Christ is inside it is well. But when it is Satan it is betrayal. It is death and it is destruction. then centered earth. Then Satan entered into Judas and named his Scariot being of the number of the 12. And he went his way and communed with the chief priests and captains how he might betray him unto them. And they were glad and covenanted to give him money. And he promised and sought opportunity to betray him unto them in the absence of the multitude. Oh, this is the man who has always walked with Christ. Now he decides to deci he decides now to betray him because of money. Matthew chapter 27 verse number three. Judas the betrayer now lost forever. Then Judas which had betrayed him when he saw that he was condemned repented himself and brought again the 30 pieces of silver to the chief priests and elders saying I have sinned in that I have betrayed the innocent blood. And they said, "What is it to us that is up to you?" And he cast down the pieces of silver in the temple and departed and went and hunged himself. It is a sad thing that young individuals nowadays think that the end of their sorrow, the end of their sufferings is to kill themselves. Young people are thinking that to end their sorrow that to bring an end to their misery they kill themselves. Young people nowadays think that suicide is the sweetest way to die. And I will take like a minute to talk about that part. In the year 2020 during COVID time we lost five young Adventists who killed themselves. And I realized that the sermons that were were used to be the sermons that used to be preached in the 80s and 90s are no longer preached anymore because people say that hey if you tell them that they will run away. Uh-uh. Give them the truth that even if they run away they are running with the truth inside. Anyone who kills himself dies is a murderer and no murderer will partake in the blessed resurrection. Anyone who kills himself dies a murderer and there is no murderer who will partake in the blessed resurrection. People on this side, anyone who kills himself dies is a murderer and there is no murderer who will enter heaven. The devil has come to steal, to kill, and destroy. and he's lying to young individuals that now that the sweetest way to end misery is to kill yourself. No, you will die, go to the grave and you will be resurrected a thousand years late when the first resurrection had taken place and that second resurrection is for you to be given your judgment and to be destroyed eternally. Don't accommodate the rogue tenant. For when you accommodate him, you will eventually end up like Judas who killed himself. When we attend funerals of our young individuals who have killed themselves, we look at the person lying in the in the casket and we know for sure that songs are being sung, someone are being preached, people are busy encouraging each other that we will meet on the beautiful show. But we know 100% sure this one lying here will not partake in the crossing into the beautiful Baha land. Will not enter the new Jerusalem. Happy Sabbath. Who is your tenant? Your tenant determines your eternal destiny. We are having just a few more more verses to read then uh we end this session. The destroyer's work. There is a piece of art that I borrowed from an artist and I gave it a new title. The destroyer's work. You'll know the place by a shaky barn that stands in the field by a rundown farm, by a pond filled up with stagnant water. Then you'll see a shark nearby. You'll ask yourself, "I wonder why you look so cold and lifeless all around. Chimney rocks are falling out. It looks as though the fire's gone out and the biggest part of the house is rotted down. The window panes are broken. The door frames existed a decade ago and an antill towers roof high at the farthest corner. Graffiti cover the walls with tattoos all over as a sign of internal turmoil. The landlord suffers from an aching heart which eventually sends him to an early grave. But on the other side, we see the works of the flesh and the fruit of the Holy Spirit. Galatians 5:1 16 all the way to 26. Then we ask ourselves a few questions who the tenant is. Then we wind up with another song and we call it a a a sharing. Galatians 5:1 16. This I say then walk in the spirit and you shall not fulfill the lust of the flesh. For the flesh lusteth against the spirit, and the spirit against the flesh, these are contrary the one to other to the other, so that you cannot do the things that you would. But if but if you be led of the spirit, you are not under the law. Now the works of the flesh are manifest. The works of the rogue tenant are manifest. Which are these? Adultery, fornication, uncleanness, lasciviousness, idolatry, witchcraft, hatred, variance, emulations, wrath, strife, seditions, heresies, envyings, the list is going on and on. murders, drunkenness, revelings, and such like, of the which I tell you before, as I have also told you in the time past, that they which do such things shall not inherit the kingdom of God. Them who are occupied by the rogue tenant will eventually get lost eternally. Verse 22, but the fruit of the spirit, the fruit of the Holy Spirit is love. The fruit of the Holy Spirit is joy. The fruit of the Holy Spirit is peace, longsuffering, gentleness, goodness, and faith, meekness, temperance. Against such there is no law. And they that are in Christ have And they that are in Christ have crucified the flesh with affections and lusts. If we live in the spirit, let us walk also in the spirit. Let us not be desirous of vain glory, provoking one another, envying one another. What are we talking about? Know ye not that ye are the temple of God, and that the spirit of God dwelleth in you? 1 Corinthians chapter 3:16. Know ye not that you are the temple of God and the spirit of God dwelleth in you? 1 Corinthians 3:17. If any man defiles the temple of God, him shall God destroy. For the temple of God is holy, which temple ye are. Now I'm asking for your indulgence. You people know that I love poetry and I always uh ask for your intelligence. Please, please respond. Please respond. And the response that I'm requesting from you is the question, who is your tenant? Are we together? Are we together? Please say it in a chorus. Who is your tenant? Okay. Is your house filled with death and gloom? or is your house filled with life and bloom? Who is your tenant? Number two, is your house filled with sad ashen faces or joyful glowing aces? Who is your tenant? Number three, is your speech filled with grace and seasoned with salt? Or is your speech filled with grossness, cursing, and loaded with insults? Who is your tenant? Number four, are your walls painted with graffiti and metals hanging in the form of tattoos and ornaments? Or are your walls glowing naturally with the skin tones decked with natural beauty? Who is your tenant? Number five, is your house filled with fermented alcoholic wine? Or is your house filled with fresh, nutritious, wholesome juice from the vine? The question remains, who is your tenant? Is your plate greased with trashy junk food loaded with loaded with cinogens or your plate is loaded with nature's clean and healthy foods? The question remains, who is your tenant? Is your album made up of loud destructive noises full of abominations or cool constructive music that rejuvenates the body and edifies the soul? The question remains who is your tenant? Is your house exposed due to scanty covering with the with the moto my dress my choice or decency inspires the theme of your dress code? The question remains, who is your tenant? Is your upper room in shambles with mental instability and nudity? Or are you found clothed in your right mind in the house seated at the feet of Jesus? The question remains, who is your tenant? The last one is, is your house filled with envy, covetousness, hate and murder, or is it filled with love, warmth, and joyous laughter? The question remains, who is your tenant? I join Joshua in saying, for me and my house, I will serve the Lord. Joshua chapter 24:14 to 18. Others are wondering who their tenants will be and they don't care. But I join Joshua in saying, "For me and my house, I will serve the Lord." Verse number 14. Now therefore, fear the Lord and serve him in sincerity and in truth. My brothers and sisters who have just been baptized. Now, therefore, fear the Lord and serve him in sincerity and in truth. And put away the gods which your fathers served in the other side of the flood and in Egypt, and serve ye the Lord. And if it seem evil unto you to serve the Lord, s choose you this day whom you will serve, when the gods which whether the gods which your fathers served that were on the other side of the flood or the gods of the Amorites in whose land you dwell. But as for me and my house, we will serve the Lord. And the people answered and said, God forbid that we should forsake the Lord to serve other gods. For the Lord our God, he is that brought us up and our fathers out of the land of Egypt, from the house of the bondage, which did those great signs in our sight, and preserved us all. Preserved us in all the way, wherein we went among all the people uh whom we passed. And the Lord drove from before us all the people, even the Amorites which dwelt in the land. Therefore, we will also serve the Lord, for he is our God. Christ is winding up by knocking on our doors. Revelation chapter 3 verse 20 21 and 22. There has been a rogue tenant inside but Christ has now taken time cuz he was waiting for your invitation and the invitation has taken too long. Now he's inviting himself and he's knocking on the door. Behold, I stand at the door and knock. If any man hear my voice and open the door, I will come into him and will s with me h with him and he with me. To him that overcomemeth, I will grant him to sit with me on my throne, even as I see even as I also overcame, and I'm set down with my father in his throne. He that hath an ear, let him hear what the spirit says unto the churches. Hear the savior at the door, let him in. Let him in. He has knocked there before. Let him in. Let him in. It is the Savior standing at the door. He's been watching, waiting there before. Open wide thy heart of sin. Let the blessed Savior in. Let him in. Let him in. He is your best and truest friend. Let him in. One who will always defend you. Let him in. Do not let him knock in vain. Let him in. He may never come again. Let him in. Hear his gentle, loving voice. Let him in. Bid him welcome and rejoice. Let him in. It is the savior standing at the door. He's been watching, waiting there before. Open wide thy heart of sin. Let the blessed savior in. Let him in. Let him in. Now we are winding up by going back to the cross. For it is the cross where we get salvation full and free. And that old rugged cross made the difference for me when I was in high school. That old rugged cross made the difference for me when I was going through college. That old rugged cross is still making the difference for me even as we are still serving people by taking them all over the place. And that old rugged cross made the difference for me and is still making the difference. How I encourage you that once you have gone in and you have become a successful people, please let us join in the ministry and keep on encouraging others to love this Lord with all their hearts, with all their minds, with all their souls so that they can come in. Join us in this walk because the the close of probation is just about to happen. There is this song that I love singing. The old rugged cross made the difference. It was a life filled with aimless [Music] desperation. It was a life filled with aimless desperation. Without hope walked the shell of a man. Then a hand with a nail printint stretched downward. Just one touch. Then a new life began. [Music] And the old ruged cross made the difference in a life bound for heartache and defeat. I will praise him forever. Forever and ever. For the cross made the difference for [Music] me. Barren walls. They could harshness and anger. Little feet ran in terror to hide. Now those walls ring with love, warmth and laughter. [Music] Since the giver of life moved inside. [Music] Now there's a room filled with s aen [Music] faces without hope. Death has wrapped them in gloom. [Music] But at the side of a saint there rejoiceing for life can't be sealed in a tomb. [Music] Oh, and the old rugged cross make the difference in a life bound for heartache and defeat. [Music] I will praise him forever and never for the cross made the difference for me. Yes. The cross made the difference for me. For me, let us pray. Savior and friend. The tenant determines our eternal destiny. We have often times looked at the few pieces of silver and betrayed the master. But when we look deep inside, we realize that it was the rogue tenant that came in. Satan who's desiring to have this young man, desiring to have us all that he may sift us as wheat. But you're still praying for us that our faith fails not. Master, if you are the tenant, when the Holy Spirit comes and says stays within, then sanity of mind is restored. Decency in our clothing is restored. We can be found dwelling in houses and in the house of the Lord. And we can be found at the feet of Jesus. Master, we have often played with the enemy for so long and now like the Egyptians, we are almost getting lost. But we are crying like Peter, Lord, save. And we thank you that that is the only prayer that anytime it comes from a sinner, you don't delay even a microscond. Master, we are crying, please save because we have been attacked by the rogue tenant who has come in and destroyed the walls, the roofs, the floors, the windows and some of us are lost forever. We who are still alive, oh Lord, we are requesting that you may come in such that the places which is filled with sad ashen phases may be one more time filled with joy, laughter, peace, but above all else contentment. Dear Lord, we only share as human beings. But when you come in, then these words will forever ring in our minds until the day faith is made sight, until the clouds are rolled back as a scroll. Master, we have our friends who are watching online who are asking themselves, who their tenant is, and they don't know how to get rid of him. Lord God Almighty, we are crying on their behalf. Oh Lord, go and save them and get rid of that tenant. The same way you crossed over and to gatherines and you got rid of the of the legions. Master, I'm also praying for our special guest, our special friend from Upper Hill who is the second time fellowshipping with us, the Adventist. He joined us last Sabbath. Oh Lord, our brother James, he came oh Lord to listen to your word. How I pray that from the morning service that may he also enroll as a as a as a disciple. Then he goes out as a as a missionary. We are praying dear Lord that even this sharing may also ask himself who the tenant is and he requests you to come in and be the one that occupies him. Thank you Lord for hearing our prayer. This session Lord was meant for that one individual and that for that one individual you will reach him. the rest of us were escorting him. But even in case there are many others who also needed this message, glory be to God, but above all else, oh Lord, may we not be like Judas on the missionary field, but at the last minute goes away and betrays the cause. May we not be like Judas, but instead be like Peter, be like John, be like Paul, that we die in this course. For this is the place where we pray. For this is the place where we cry. For this the place where we start till death do us part where we say goodbye. Oh Lord, here we leave all our fears and our pains and we get grace. We get mercy. Here we walk down the aisle. We dedicate every child in this sacred place. Thank you for allowing us to dwell in Bethl. And thank you oh Lord for allowing the Holy Spirit to be the one that dwells inside. That when you dwell inside us and we dwell in Bethl, then when we are asked how is it with our souls, then we will answer and say it is well. It is well, it is well with our souls. Thank you for hearing our prayers and always answering us when we call through Christ our Lord your holy name we pray. Amen. And may the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ and the love of God and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit be with us now and forever more. Amen. Amen. Amen. 

==================================================

TIMESTAMPED TRANSCRIPT:
[0.0s] We dedicate every child in this sacred
[2.7s] place. Holy, holy, holy, holy, God is
[8.8s] here. And this is
[11.7s] Bethl. A lesson we are going to learn
[14.2s] from a military tradition. There was a
[17.5s] colonel who fell into a well. A soldier
[21.4s] was summoned to throw a rope into the
[23.6s] well and pull the canel out. The moment
[27.2s] the colonel was about to get out of the
[30.0s] well, the soldier would leave the rope,
[33.5s] stand at a ten shon and salute and the
[36.7s] colonel would fall back into the well.
[40.2s] This happened many
[41.9s] times. Someone suggested that uh a
[44.9s] brigadier be requested to help because
[47.8s] he wouldn't have to salute the colonel.
[50.6s] A brigade arrived after he threw the
[54.2s] rope rope into the well and the colonel
[57.0s] grabbed it on pulling the rope. As soon
[60.1s] as the colonel was about to come out of
[61.9s] the well on spotting the brigadier, you
[65.0s] can imagine what he did. He immediately
[67.3s] let go of the rope to salute and he fell
[70.2s] back into the well
[73.0s] again. There was total silence.
[76.6s] Then everyone heard the desperate
[78.6s] Colonel's voice from down
[81.2s] below. I will drown here. Please get
[86.3s] hold of my one of my
[88.5s] classmates. I will drown here. Please
[92.6s] get hold of one of my classmates. I will
[97.0s] drown here. Please get hold of my
[100.3s] classmates. I will drown here. Please
[103.4s] get hold of my classmates.
[106.8s] The moral of the story is classmates are
[111.9s] important. Try and stay
[114.7s] connected with your classmates or your
[117.2s] classmates even after
[119.6s] school. You'll need them at one time or
[122.1s] they may need you at one time. We need
[124.6s] each other in life. Eventually he was
[127.7s] rescued because a classmate was sent and
[131.5s] classmate came to his rescue.
[134.2s] We are all classmates. Happy Sabbath. We
[138.1s] are all classmates. Happy Sabbath.
[140.3s] Alliance girls. We are all classmates.
[144.5s] Happy Sabbath. Stare
[147.2s] boys. We are all classmates. Happy
[150.2s] Sabbath. Uh Upper Hill High
[154.1s] School. All
[156.1s] right.
[158.0s] Mang
[160.8s] Manga. Happy Sabbath.
[164.2s] Happy
[170.1s] Sabbath. The preacher got up and said,
[173.7s] "Stand to your feet. We'll start with a
[177.6s] prayer. If you have a need, let it be
[182.5s] heard, saints. Let it be
[186.5s] known. We are all family and we're not
[191.4s] alone.
[194.8s] [Music]
[196.3s] That's when he saw her in the back of
[199.4s] the
[200.2s] church. Silence and sadness cried out
[204.6s] the heart. The kind shepherd knew just
[209.0s] what to
[211.4s] say. I need to know before we pray.
[219.2s] an unspoken
[221.2s] [Music]
[223.6s] request. Does anybody have one here
[228.3s] tonight? Did you come with a burden? You
[233.0s] can share a need in your life.
[239.2s] Just lift up your
[241.5s] hand to the
[244.0s] one who can give you rest. Child, have
[250.4s] no fear. Our God can
[255.4s] hear, an unspoken
[259.0s] [Music]
[262.0s] request. Well, the preacher whispered as
[265.5s] she raised her hand. Sweet Holy Spirit,
[270.4s] come by her and stand. When her tears
[273.9s] started falling, he had no
[277.6s] doubt that in the throne room of heaven,
[281.5s] her secret was
[285.2s] out, an unspoken
[290.6s] request. Does anybody have one here
[295.1s] tonight? Did you come with a burden? You
[300.1s] can share a need in your
[305.2s] life. Just lift up your
[308.5s] hands to the
[311.1s] one who can give you rest. Child, have
[317.4s] no fear. Our God can
[322.5s] heal an unspoken
[328.0s] request. Child, have no fear. Our God
[332.3s] can
[334.8s] hear an unspoken request.
[342.5s] [Music]
[349.8s] We are all classmates here. Spirit of
[352.6s] God our teacher be Christ our Lord is
[356.1s] the principle. Sweet Sabbath school is
[358.8s] this place. We are all equal in this
[362.5s] place. Let us pray. Savior and friend,
[366.6s] we have a long way to go yet a short
[368.5s] time to get there. Master, the fields
[371.6s] are ripe but the harvesters are few. How
[374.8s] we pray that may your spirit one more
[377.7s] time come down the same way Samson
[380.7s] prayed this one more time oh Lord we
[384.6s] pray one more time that may you come
[388.0s] down and occupy us inside and outside
[392.2s] one more time that our viewers online
[394.8s] may also connect with you this one more
[397.3s] time oh Lord is our sincere prayer
[399.8s] through Christ our Lord and Savior.
[401.9s] Amen.
[404.3s] A story is told of uh that is about 15
[409.4s] 20 years ago somewhere in South B a
[412.0s] story is told of a family that came
[414.0s] somewhere from Mandera I don't know who
[415.8s] they were and they rented a house and
[418.5s] the family was big so they rented a
[420.6s] house which uh they rented two houses
[423.5s] bungalows which were connected they were
[425.8s] in the same block but they were separate
[427.5s] houses and these people paid a rent for
[430.6s] five
[431.5s] years meaning that the landlord was not
[434.1s] coming to see the house for 5 years and
[436.6s] he was happy. He enjoyed the the lumpsum
[439.4s] amount that he was given. When the five
[442.3s] years ended, he came to the house only
[445.8s] to realize that the two houses were no
[448.7s] longer two but one cuz the the sitting
[451.8s] rooms, the wall that was separating the
[453.8s] sitting rooms had been brought down. And
[456.3s] if you're on this side of the sitting
[457.8s] room, you can walk through the other
[459.3s] side. And when he checked again, he
[461.8s] realized that the doors leading to the
[465.0s] various places like kitchen store and
[467.8s] all those others because they were
[469.6s] wooden, they had been turned into
[471.6s] firewood and there were no doors there
[474.4s] and the kitchen walls were black. That
[477.2s] tells you that they were using firewood
[479.4s] to cook in that house.
[482.1s] When the tenant, the the landlord came
[484.8s] in, he realized that he had rented a
[487.7s] house, but he did not know unto whom he
[490.8s] did the the the renting. He did not know
[493.3s] who the tenant
[495.6s] was. The sinks were broken. And someone
[500.1s] also told the same the person who was
[501.8s] telling me the story told me that the
[504.2s] that the toilet was also in a
[506.9s] dilapidated state. not to talk about the
[510.4s] tiles and the floors. Everything was
[512.9s] just
[514.4s] bad. And that reminds me of also another
[517.1s] story about my auntie that when where I
[519.8s] was staying when I was staying with her
[521.3s] and she had some rental houses, some
[523.6s] rental rooms and she was very
[525.7s] categorical that she'd rent it out to
[528.0s] anyone except someone who's doing uh
[531.7s] butchery business. I didn't understand
[534.6s] why. But when I heard the story later, I
[537.2s] realized that indeed that if you are a
[539.5s] house owner, if you are a landlord, then
[542.1s] you are the one who decides who the
[544.2s] tenant is. There are some constructive
[547.0s] tenants and there are some destructive
[549.1s] tenants. There are some tenants who when
[551.4s] they come into the place, they change
[553.4s] the tiles into the best the quality the
[555.8s] market can offer. They change in the the
[558.4s] ceiling the best that the market can
[560.5s] offer. And the the the place is so well
[563.0s] decorated. And when you walk into the
[565.0s] compound, it is well manicured. You can
[568.0s] tell that this is a constructive tenant.
[570.7s] But they are also destructive
[573.6s] tenants. Hence the question, who is your
[578.8s] tenant? Happy
[580.8s] Sabbath. Happy Sabbath. I'll be
[584.1s] requesting for your indulgence, please.
[587.3s] when I ask you what our sharing is all
[590.2s] about about the the rhetorical question,
[592.6s] please just respond. I know the food was
[594.6s] nice and at this particular time other
[596.6s] faculties are shutting down and you want
[599.4s] to rest but please just bear with us for
[602.2s] this moment. What is the title of our
[606.5s] sharing? What is it ladies from
[611.0s] alliance? Okay. What is it? Mangu men.
[617.5s] All
[618.4s] right, alliance, please show them how it
[620.9s] should be
[625.1s] done. All right, who will come to our
[627.4s] rescue? People from uh upper hill, are
[629.9s] you there? Where is Christ? Where is
[633.6s] Christ?
[635.1s] Where is Christ? Where is Christ? What
[638.9s] is our title this afternoon?
[642.2s] Who is your tenant? Thank you very much.
[644.9s] Upper Hill. upper hill staying in the
[647.9s] upper room and who is inside?
[651.9s] Who is
[653.2s] inside? Okay, Christ is
[656.5s] inside. Who is the tenant? That is the
[659.6s] question that we are
[664.8s] asking. Is
[667.5s] there all right I will I I will disre I
[670.2s] will try and uh disregard the children.
[672.4s] They're enjoying themselves.
[674.8s] Number one thing that you have to
[676.1s] realize is that you must test the
[678.4s] spirit. If you must if you have to vet
[681.0s] the tenant before allowing them to
[683.3s] occupy your house or your ten or your
[685.8s] temple, the question still remains, who
[688.2s] is your tenant? Is it God or is it the
[691.1s] the legion? The rogue tenant has come to
[694.3s] steal, to kill and destroy. When the
[697.5s] rogue tenant comes in, there is no
[699.5s] peace. There is no sanity of mind. There
[702.2s] is no clothes and there is no house for
[705.1s] this person to occupy. That is an
[707.2s] example we see from the demoniac. But
[709.5s] when Christ comes in, he says, "I have
[711.8s] come that you might have life and have
[713.8s] it abundantly." Let us go to the book of
[716.2s] Luke 8 26 all the way to number 40. Luke
[720.6s] 8
[723.4s] 26. And they arrived at the country of
[726.6s] the gatherines which is over against
[729.4s] Galilee. And when he went forth to land,
[733.0s] there met him out of the city a certain
[735.4s] man which had devils long time and wore
[738.7s] no clothes, neither abode in houses but
[741.6s] in the
[742.5s] tombs. There's something that is
[744.5s] interesting in verse number 27. When the
[747.7s] tenant is of a different pedigree, then
[752.3s] this is what happens. When he and and
[755.4s] when he went forth to land, there met
[759.1s] him out of the city a certain
[761.3s] man. Who was the tenant in this man
[764.8s] which had devils long time? How long did
[767.7s] the did the tenants had stay? These
[769.8s] tenants had stayed a very long time in
[771.9s] this house. And now look at the
[773.9s] consequences of this this kind of
[776.4s] tenants staying in this house. They made
[779.5s] the landlord not to wear any clothes.
[782.2s] They made the landlord not to abide in
[785.2s] houses. They made the landlord to just
[787.8s] constantly stay in the tombs. And when
[791.2s] he saw Jesus, he cried out and he fell
[794.1s] down before him and with a loud voice
[796.3s] said, "What have I to do with thee,
[799.4s] Jesus, thou son of God most high? I
[802.4s] beseech thee, torment me
[804.8s] not." Verse 29. For he had commanded the
[808.6s] unclean spirit to come out of the man.
[811.2s] for often times it had caught him and he
[815.0s] was kept abound. He was kept bound with
[817.8s] chains and infetters and he broke the
[820.0s] bonds and he was driven of the devils
[823.0s] into the wilderness. Now when this kind
[825.7s] of rogue tenants stay even if you're
[828.2s] bound with chains and fetterss they give
[830.5s] you some certain extraordinary strength
[832.1s] that you break the fetterss and you are
[834.3s] you go and dwell in the wilderness. And
[837.2s] Jesus asked him, now I'm paraphrasing
[840.7s] today. And Jesus asked him, saying, "Who
[845.2s] is your tenant? What is thy name?" And
[850.1s] he said, "Please answer me in a chorus."
[853.0s] And he said,
[855.2s] "Leion." Because many devils were
[858.4s] entered into
[859.8s] him. And they besought him that he would
[862.6s] not command them to go out into the
[864.6s] deep. And there was there a herd of many
[867.8s] swine feeding on the mountain. And there
[870.2s] besought him and they besought him that
[872.3s] he would suffer them to enter into the
[874.5s] swine. And he allowed them to enter into
[877.0s] the swine. Then went the devils out of
[880.1s] the man and entered into the swine. When
[883.7s] you have a rogue tenant, he doesn't
[886.3s] spare human beings. He doesn't spare
[888.9s] animals, too. And the hard ran violently
[893.1s] down a steep place into the lake, and
[896.0s] were
[897.1s] choked. When they and when they that fed
[900.4s] them saw that what was done, they fled
[905.0s] and went and told it in the city and in
[908.1s] the country. Then they went out to see
[911.8s] what was done and came to Jesus and
[914.5s] found the man out of whom the devils
[917.0s] were
[918.3s] departed. Sitting at the feet of Jesus,
[921.3s] number one, clothed number two, and in
[924.7s] his right mind, number three, and they
[927.0s] were afraid. Now when the rogue tenants
[930.4s] have been kicked
[932.3s] out then you find that this individual
[936.0s] and the Holy Spirit comes in to stay.
[938.7s] Then this individual can be found number
[940.7s] one sitting at the feet of Jesus number
[943.3s] two clothed decently number three in his
[946.6s] right mind and other people really get
[949.4s] afraid because of what they see. Let us
[952.6s] take a pose and look at what is
[954.6s] happening there. More often than not, we
[957.8s] usually look for uh the people called
[960.9s] counselors to help out because we look
[963.8s] for people. Why? Because we we try and
[966.6s] uh give it some scientific uh terms and
[969.8s] call it uh schizophrenia. Other people
[972.6s] call it mental illness and other people
[975.7s] call it so many things. But the question
[977.9s] that I'm asking is these people who are
[981.0s] having these conditions, have you ever
[983.1s] asked your the question who the tenant
[987.0s] is? Most of the time we give them
[989.8s] physical medicine to tackle physical
[992.5s] flesh and blood, but we don't get rid of
[995.3s] the tenant who is affecting the
[997.2s] well-being of this individual. And after
[1000.0s] we've given them those drugs, they they
[1002.7s] drool and they rest there, but the
[1004.9s] tenant is still inside. given an
[1007.3s] opportunity, you still find them going
[1009.4s] to kill
[1011.8s] themselves. In order to have the in
[1014.4s] order to have this thing fully tackled,
[1017.0s] then we must get rid of the rogue
[1019.2s] tenants inside. And the rogue tenants
[1021.7s] are but demons, are but legions. And
[1024.3s] once they are gotten rid of, then you'll
[1026.6s] find these individuals, they will be in
[1028.6s] their right minds. And the right mind is
[1031.4s] when Christ is inside. Happy Sabbath.
[1035.2s] Where is Christ? Where is
[1038.3s] Christ? Where is Christ? Inside. Where
[1041.4s] is Christ? Inside. Inside inside. And
[1043.7s] when Christ is inside, we can be found
[1046.3s] sitting at his feet. We can be found
[1048.6s] clothed with his righteousness and in
[1050.6s] our right mind. And others will be
[1052.8s] afraid and wondering what had happened.
[1056.6s] Let us first of all ask ourselves this
[1059.4s] question before we take them to
[1061.0s] counselors and before we spend all that
[1063.3s] money in those counseling sessions. Let
[1065.9s] us ask ourselves now we have taken them
[1068.3s] to the counselors but do we know who
[1070.8s] their tenant is? That is the question
[1073.8s] that we need to ask. Once we get rid we
[1076.4s] once we get to know who the tenant is
[1078.5s] then we will know how to handle the
[1080.6s] tenant how to get rid of the tenant and
[1083.2s] how to reverse the condition and these
[1086.3s] people will eventually join us in sanity
[1089.3s] of mind. Hallelujah to the lamb of God.
[1092.2s] Verse number
[1093.6s] 36. They also which saw it told them by
[1098.1s] what means that he that was possessed of
[1101.2s] the devils was healed. Then the whole
[1103.8s] multitude of the country of gatherines
[1106.2s] round about besought him to depart from
[1108.8s] there for they were taken with great
[1112.2s] fear and he went up into the ship and
[1115.4s] returned back
[1116.6s] again. I'm wondering if someone has come
[1120.0s] and brought salvation why are you
[1122.3s] chasing him
[1123.5s] away? Verse 38. Now the man out of whom
[1127.5s] the devils were departed besought him
[1130.3s] that he might be with him. But Jesus
[1134.6s] sent him away saying verse 39 return to
[1139.9s] thy own house one more time cuz when the
[1143.9s] this rogue tenant came in he drove you
[1146.5s] from the house and you were staying
[1148.6s] among the tombs. Now one now you need to
[1151.7s] go back to your own house. Now that
[1154.6s] exactly reminds us of what the pastor
[1157.0s] had talked about in the morning here
[1159.0s] that you come as disciple then now you
[1161.3s] go back as a missionary. Now return to
[1164.2s] your own house and show how great things
[1167.0s] God has done unto thee. And when he went
[1169.9s] his and he went his way and published
[1172.4s] throughout the whole city how great
[1174.6s] things Jesus had done unto him. When
[1178.5s] Christ comes in, you cannot keep quiet
[1181.0s] with it. When Christ comes in, you
[1184.1s] cannot walk naked anymore. When Christ
[1186.6s] comes in, you cannot stay amongst the
[1194.4s] tombs. And it came to pass when Jesus
[1198.0s] was returned, the people gladly received
[1200.9s] him, for they were all waiting for him.
[1204.7s] Hallelujah to the lamb of God. If you
[1207.4s] have a rogue tenant, you the victim, get
[1211.0s] up and storm the heavenly courtroom and
[1214.3s] tell the powerful, the most powerful,
[1216.5s] the righteous judge that you cannot
[1218.6s] afford the legal fees. You cannot handle
[1221.2s] it anymore. Your tenant is rogue and you
[1224.2s] need deliverance. Cry out like Peter
[1226.6s] cried and God will help you immediately.
[1229.3s] For such cries, God does not delay to
[1232.5s] respond. Matthew chapter 14 verse number
[1235.2s] 29 30 and 31 and he said come and when
[1239.8s] Peter was come down out of the ship he
[1242.3s] walked on the water to go to Jesus but
[1244.5s] when he saw the wind boisterous he was
[1247.2s] afraid and beginning to sink. He cried
[1251.0s] saying Lord save. That is the prayer
[1255.0s] that we need to offer when we are
[1257.8s] attacked by the rogue tenant. We just
[1260.1s] cry out Lord save.
[1263.5s] Hallelujah. I'm seeing some young man
[1266.0s] really tuning some young beautiful girl
[1268.0s] and I'm busy toiling here. Happy
[1271.6s] Sabbath. Some young man is busy tuning
[1274.6s] some beautiful girl somewhere and they
[1277.1s] are seated right in front and uh so now
[1280.0s] what do I do? Should I let them carry on
[1282.0s] or should I continue
[1285.4s] preaching? All right, you can do that
[1287.8s] later. It is at this particular time we
[1290.3s] are concentrating on who the tenant
[1293.5s] is. The story you're telling there is
[1296.2s] already a a testimony of who the tenant
[1298.5s] is in those people who are
[1300.8s] talking. Happy Sabbath. Let's bring our
[1304.2s] minds into this place cuz we have got a
[1306.6s] short time and by in a little while the
[1309.3s] this session will be
[1313.7s] over. It is an edification time.
[1318.2s] Note tuning ladies time. Happy
[1322.0s] Sabbath. Happy
[1324.8s] Sabbath. Let us
[1327.6s] go. Matthew chapter 14 verse number 29.
[1331.3s] And he said, "Come." And when Peter was
[1334.3s] come down out of the ship. He walked on
[1336.8s] the water to go to the to Jesus. But
[1339.6s] when he saw that the wind was
[1340.9s] boisterous, he was afraid and beginning
[1343.5s] to sink, he cried, saying, "Lord, save."
[1348.0s] Now let us emulate Peter. Anytime the
[1350.7s] rogue, the rogue tenant comes in, we cry
[1353.5s] to the Lord, saying, "Lord, save." And
[1356.2s] such cries, the Lord never delays to
[1359.2s] respond to such. Verse number 31. And
[1361.8s] immediately Jesus stretched forth his
[1363.9s] hand and caught him and said unto him,
[1367.0s] "Oh thou of little faith, where did you
[1370.2s] doubt? Why did you doubt?" Resist the
[1373.4s] the evil tenant. Don't sympathize and
[1376.2s] start accommodating him by accommodating
[1378.9s] a small few small bad behaviors here and
[1381.6s] there. But instead, James 4:7 tells us
[1384.5s] one thing. Submit yourselves therefore
[1387.1s] to God. Resist the devil and he will
[1390.5s] free he will flee from you. Submit
[1393.8s] yourselves therefore to God. Resist the
[1396.6s] devil and he will flee from
[1400.4s] you. One thing we realize is that the
[1403.8s] the tenant determines your eternal
[1407.4s] destiny. If you have the good tenant,
[1410.3s] your destiny is eternal glory. But if
[1413.3s] you had the wrong tenant, you are
[1415.4s] forever lost. The tenant determines your
[1419.5s] eternal
[1421.1s] destiny. Look at the Egyptians who are
[1424.2s] lost forever. Exodus
[1426.9s] 14:3. The Egyptians cherished the rogue
[1430.2s] tenant in them that were instead of
[1432.6s] joining the the Lord's side, they
[1434.6s] decided to mistreat the Israelites. And
[1437.4s] when the Israelites were going back
[1439.0s] home, they decided to run after them to
[1441.4s] bring them back. Now, Exodus chapter 14
[1443.9s] verse number 13 is a very sad sad
[1446.8s] statement. And and it's because the
[1449.4s] tenant who in them determined their
[1452.5s] eternal destiny which was lost. Exodus
[1455.8s] 14:13. And Moses said unto the people,
[1459.2s] "Fear ye not. Stand still and see the
[1463.5s] salvation of the Lord which he will show
[1465.9s] you which he will show to you today. For
[1469.9s] the Egyptians whom you have seen
[1473.0s] today, you shall see them again no more
[1478.6s] forever. For the tenant inside of them
[1481.9s] has lied to them and in a little while
[1484.6s] they are going to drown and forever lost
[1488.9s] eternally. The tenant determines your
[1492.4s] destiny. Happy
[1494.5s] Sabbath. Happy
[1496.6s] day. All right. Thank you.
[1499.8s] Let us look at Judas the betrayer. The
[1503.0s] one who loved money. He even decided to
[1505.5s] betray a cause, an eternal cost just for
[1508.5s] a few pieces of silver. Matthew chapter
[1511.0s] 27 verse number 3, 4 and 5. Then Judas
[1515.5s] which had betrayed
[1517.2s] him when he saw that he was condemned.
[1520.2s] No, in fact, let us not even jump that.
[1522.6s] Let us let us uh first of all go back
[1525.0s] and read uh Luke chapter 22 verse number
[1528.7s] three where Satan entered into
[1532.4s] Judas. Luke
[1534.4s] 22:3 4 5 and
[1537.2s] 6. Then entered Satan into
[1541.7s] Judas son named
[1544.7s] Iscariot being of the number of the 12.
[1548.6s] and he went his way and communed with
[1551.9s] the chief priests and
[1554.9s] captains. I realize something here that
[1557.6s] is very sad that sometimes the chief
[1562.1s] priests, the captains, the elders, the
[1565.3s] evangelists like me and the rest of us,
[1568.1s] sometimes we commune with people whom
[1571.3s] Satan has entered
[1573.4s] inside. And the sad statement is can two
[1576.9s] walk together unless they are in
[1578.5s] agreement. If Satan has entered that
[1581.0s] individual and we are communing with him
[1583.4s] and we are coming into a consensus with
[1585.8s] him then something is wrong. The tenant
[1589.0s] who's the devil who's the tenant in the
[1591.1s] other person means that he's also
[1593.0s] occupying me.
[1595.3s] Sometimes we go for these counelss and
[1598.2s] Judas also comes along and Judas comes
[1601.0s] along after Satan has entered into him
[1603.9s] and while he's communing with the chief
[1605.8s] priest they are in one accord then it
[1608.6s] means that not all councils are being
[1611.1s] led by the Holy Spirit. So we have to be
[1613.7s] very careful that before we sit down in
[1616.5s] every council, we must first ask
[1618.8s] ourselves who is the tenant inside. Who
[1621.9s] is the tenant who is occup who is
[1624.1s] chairing that meeting? And when Christ
[1626.7s] is inside it is well. But when it is
[1629.3s] Satan it is betrayal. It is death and it
[1632.9s] is
[1635.0s] destruction. then centered earth. Then
[1637.5s] Satan entered into Judas and named his
[1639.6s] Scariot being of the number of the 12.
[1642.3s] And he went his way and communed with
[1644.4s] the chief priests and captains how he
[1646.9s] might betray him unto them. And they
[1650.2s] were glad and covenanted to give him
[1653.5s] money. And he promised and sought
[1656.4s] opportunity to betray him unto them in
[1659.3s] the absence of the multitude. Oh, this
[1663.0s] is the man who has always walked with
[1664.8s] Christ. Now he decides to deci he
[1667.5s] decides now to betray him because of
[1669.9s] money. Matthew chapter 27 verse number
[1672.8s] three. Judas the betrayer now lost
[1675.7s] forever. Then Judas which had betrayed
[1679.1s] him when he saw that he was condemned
[1682.6s] repented himself and brought again the
[1684.4s] 30 pieces of silver to the chief priests
[1687.0s] and elders saying I have sinned in that
[1690.2s] I have betrayed the innocent blood. And
[1692.8s] they said, "What is it to us that is up
[1695.7s] to you?" And he cast down the pieces of
[1697.9s] silver in the temple and departed and
[1701.6s] went and hunged
[1705.8s] himself. It is a sad thing that young
[1709.2s] individuals nowadays think that the end
[1712.0s] of their sorrow, the end of their
[1713.8s] sufferings is to kill themselves.
[1718.2s] Young people are thinking that to end
[1720.4s] their sorrow that to bring an end to
[1723.0s] their misery they kill
[1725.4s] themselves. Young people nowadays think
[1728.2s] that suicide is the sweetest way to die.
[1732.5s] And I will take like a minute to talk
[1735.0s] about that part. In the year 2020 during
[1737.9s] COVID time we lost five young Adventists
[1742.6s] who killed
[1744.1s] themselves. And I realized that the
[1746.5s] sermons that were were used to be the
[1748.5s] sermons that used to be preached in the
[1749.9s] 80s and 90s are no longer preached
[1752.2s] anymore because people say that hey if
[1755.4s] you tell them that they will run away.
[1757.4s] Uh-uh. Give them the truth that even if
[1759.9s] they run away they are running with the
[1761.8s] truth
[1762.7s] inside. Anyone who kills himself dies is
[1766.1s] a murderer and no murderer will partake
[1769.2s] in the blessed
[1770.7s] resurrection. Anyone who kills himself
[1774.4s] dies a murderer and there is no murderer
[1777.5s] who will partake in the blessed
[1780.4s] resurrection. People on this side,
[1782.7s] anyone who kills himself dies is a
[1785.1s] murderer and there is no murderer who
[1787.9s] will enter
[1791.0s] heaven. The devil has come to steal, to
[1794.3s] kill, and destroy. and he's lying to
[1798.0s] young individuals that now that the
[1800.2s] sweetest way to end misery is to kill
[1803.0s] yourself. No, you will die, go to the
[1806.4s] grave and you will be resurrected a
[1808.9s] thousand years late when the first
[1811.9s] resurrection had taken place and that
[1814.4s] second resurrection is for you to be
[1816.7s] given your judgment and to be destroyed
[1820.0s] eternally.
[1821.7s] Don't accommodate the rogue tenant. For
[1824.8s] when you accommodate him, you will
[1826.9s] eventually end up like Judas who killed
[1830.4s] himself. When we attend funerals of our
[1833.0s] young individuals who have killed
[1834.7s] themselves, we look at the person lying
[1837.2s] in the in the casket and we know for
[1839.4s] sure that songs are being sung, someone
[1842.2s] are being preached, people are busy
[1844.0s] encouraging each other that we will meet
[1846.2s] on the beautiful show. But we know 100%
[1849.4s] sure this one lying here will not
[1852.5s] partake in the crossing into the
[1855.9s] beautiful Baha land. Will not enter the
[1859.0s] new
[1862.7s] Jerusalem. Happy
[1864.6s] Sabbath. Who is your tenant? Your tenant
[1868.2s] determines your eternal destiny.
[1872.1s] We are having just a few more more
[1874.6s] verses to read then uh we end this
[1879.2s] session. The destroyer's
[1883.0s] work. There is a piece of art that I
[1886.2s] borrowed from an
[1887.6s] artist and I gave it a new title. The
[1890.5s] destroyer's work.
[1893.0s] You'll know the place by a shaky barn
[1896.2s] that stands in the field by a rundown
[1898.5s] farm, by a pond filled up with stagnant
[1902.0s] water. Then you'll see a shark nearby.
[1905.1s] You'll ask yourself, "I wonder why you
[1907.4s] look so cold and lifeless all around.
[1910.6s] Chimney rocks are falling out. It looks
[1913.4s] as though the fire's gone out and the
[1915.7s] biggest part of the house is rotted
[1917.9s] down. The window panes are broken. The
[1920.8s] door frames existed a decade ago and an
[1923.6s] antill towers roof high at the farthest
[1926.7s] corner. Graffiti cover the
[1929.9s] walls with tattoos all over as a sign of
[1933.5s] internal turmoil. The landlord suffers
[1936.3s] from an aching heart which eventually
[1938.6s] sends him to an early
[1941.3s] grave. But on the other side, we see the
[1945.8s] works of the flesh and the fruit of the
[1948.8s] Holy Spirit.
[1951.1s] Galatians 5:1 16 all the way to 26. Then
[1955.7s] we ask ourselves a few questions who the
[1958.3s] tenant is. Then we wind up with another
[1961.6s] song and we call it a a a
[1965.2s] sharing. Galatians 5:1
[1968.5s] 16. This I say then walk in the spirit
[1972.9s] and you shall not fulfill the lust of
[1974.8s] the flesh. For the flesh lusteth against
[1977.4s] the spirit, and the spirit against the
[1979.7s] flesh, these are contrary the one to
[1982.4s] other to the other, so that you cannot
[1985.4s] do the things that you would. But if but
[1990.0s] if you be led of the spirit, you are not
[1993.3s] under the law. Now the works of the
[1996.0s] flesh are manifest. The works of the
[1999.1s] rogue tenant are
[2002.0s] manifest. Which are these?
[2005.4s] Adultery,
[2007.2s] fornication,
[2008.9s] uncleanness, lasciviousness,
[2012.2s] idolatry,
[2013.7s] witchcraft,
[2015.2s] hatred, variance,
[2018.2s] emulations, wrath, strife, seditions,
[2022.7s] heresies, envyings, the list is going on
[2025.8s] and on. murders,
[2028.4s] drunkenness, revelings, and such like,
[2032.5s] of the which I tell you
[2034.8s] before, as I have also told you in the
[2037.7s] time past, that they which do such
[2040.3s] things shall not inherit the kingdom of
[2043.9s] God. Them who are occupied by the rogue
[2047.8s] tenant will eventually get lost
[2050.4s] eternally. Verse 22, but the fruit of
[2054.9s] the spirit, the fruit of the Holy Spirit
[2058.2s] is love. The fruit of the Holy Spirit is
[2061.3s] joy. The fruit of the Holy Spirit is
[2063.8s] peace,
[2065.4s] longsuffering, gentleness, goodness, and
[2069.2s] faith, meekness, temperance. Against
[2073.2s] such there is no law.
[2076.6s] And they that are in Christ have And
[2079.2s] they that are in Christ have crucified
[2081.4s] the flesh with affections and lusts. If
[2084.2s] we live in the spirit, let us walk also
[2088.0s] in the spirit. Let us not be desirous of
[2091.3s] vain glory, provoking one another,
[2094.2s] envying one another. What are we talking
[2097.3s] about? Know ye not that ye are the
[2099.8s] temple of God, and that the spirit of
[2101.9s] God dwelleth in you? 1 Corinthians
[2104.2s] chapter 3:16.
[2106.2s] Know ye not that you are the temple of
[2107.9s] God and the spirit of God dwelleth in
[2110.0s] you? 1 Corinthians
[2112.2s] 3:17. If any man defiles the temple of
[2115.2s] God, him shall God destroy. For the
[2118.2s] temple of God is holy, which temple ye
[2126.0s] are. Now I'm asking for your indulgence.
[2129.5s] You people know that I love poetry and I
[2132.4s] always uh ask for your intelligence.
[2135.1s] Please, please respond. Please respond.
[2138.6s] And the response that I'm requesting
[2141.0s] from you is the question, who is your
[2146.0s] tenant? Are we together? Are we
[2149.2s] together? Please say it in a chorus. Who
[2153.4s] is your tenant? Okay. Is your house
[2158.0s] filled with death and gloom? or is your
[2161.6s] house filled with life and bloom? Who is
[2166.8s] your
[2168.0s] tenant? Number
[2170.4s] two, is your house filled with sad ashen
[2174.4s] faces or joyful glowing
[2177.7s] aces? Who is your tenant? Number three,
[2183.8s] is your speech filled with grace and
[2186.7s] seasoned with salt? Or is your speech
[2190.6s] filled with grossness, cursing, and
[2193.0s] loaded with
[2194.4s] insults? Who is your tenant?
[2199.8s] Number four, are your walls painted with
[2202.9s] graffiti and metals hanging in the form
[2205.5s] of tattoos and
[2207.3s] ornaments? Or are your walls glowing
[2211.2s] naturally with the skin tones decked
[2214.1s] with natural beauty? Who is your tenant?
[2220.6s] Number five, is your house filled with
[2223.9s] fermented alcoholic wine? Or is your
[2227.6s] house filled with fresh, nutritious,
[2230.3s] wholesome juice from the vine? The
[2232.4s] question remains, who is your
[2235.5s] tenant? Is your plate greased with
[2237.8s] trashy junk food loaded with loaded with
[2240.6s] cinogens or your plate is loaded with
[2244.2s] nature's clean and healthy foods? The
[2246.3s] question remains, who is your tenant? Is
[2250.0s] your album made up of loud destructive
[2253.3s] noises full of abominations or cool
[2257.0s] constructive music that rejuvenates the
[2259.5s] body and edifies the soul? The question
[2262.1s] remains who is your tenant? Is your
[2265.4s] house exposed due to scanty covering
[2268.6s] with the with the moto my dress my
[2271.3s] choice or decency inspires the theme of
[2275.3s] your dress code? The question remains,
[2277.7s] who is your
[2279.2s] tenant? Is your upper room in shambles
[2282.2s] with mental instability and nudity? Or
[2285.5s] are you found clothed in your right mind
[2288.4s] in the house seated at the feet of
[2290.6s] Jesus? The question remains, who is your
[2293.9s] tenant? The last one is, is your house
[2297.6s] filled with envy, covetousness, hate and
[2301.0s] murder, or is it filled with love,
[2303.6s] warmth, and joyous laughter? The
[2306.3s] question remains, who is your
[2309.8s] tenant? I join Joshua in saying, for me
[2314.6s] and my house, I will serve the Lord.
[2318.0s] Joshua chapter 24:14 to 18. Others are
[2322.0s] wondering who their tenants will be and
[2323.8s] they don't care. But I join Joshua in
[2326.5s] saying, "For me and my house, I will
[2329.3s] serve the Lord." Verse number 14. Now
[2331.4s] therefore, fear the Lord and serve him
[2334.1s] in sincerity and in truth. My brothers
[2337.0s] and sisters who have just been baptized.
[2339.2s] Now, therefore, fear the Lord and serve
[2342.0s] him in sincerity and in truth. And put
[2344.7s] away the gods which your fathers served
[2346.9s] in the other side of the flood and in
[2348.9s] Egypt, and serve ye the Lord. And if it
[2351.0s] seem evil unto you to serve the Lord, s
[2354.0s] choose you this day whom you will serve,
[2356.5s] when the gods which whether the gods
[2358.9s] which your fathers served that were on
[2360.6s] the other side of the flood or the gods
[2362.6s] of the Amorites in whose land you dwell.
[2365.2s] But as for me and my house, we will
[2367.7s] serve the Lord. And the people answered
[2369.7s] and said, God forbid that we should
[2373.0s] forsake the Lord to serve other gods.
[2374.8s] For the Lord our God, he is that brought
[2377.4s] us up and our fathers out of the land of
[2379.5s] Egypt, from the house of the bondage,
[2381.5s] which did those great signs in our
[2383.9s] sight, and preserved us all. Preserved
[2386.8s] us in all the way, wherein we went among
[2389.8s] all the people uh whom we passed. And
[2392.6s] the Lord drove from before us all the
[2395.6s] people, even the Amorites which dwelt in
[2397.4s] the land. Therefore, we will also serve
[2399.4s] the Lord, for he is our God.
[2403.8s] Christ is winding up by knocking on our
[2407.9s] doors. Revelation chapter 3 verse 20 21
[2412.1s] and 22. There has been a rogue tenant
[2414.8s] inside but Christ has now taken time cuz
[2418.2s] he was waiting for your invitation and
[2420.3s] the invitation has taken too long. Now
[2422.4s] he's inviting himself and he's knocking
[2424.7s] on the door. Behold, I stand at the door
[2428.1s] and knock. If any man hear my voice and
[2431.4s] open the door, I will come into him and
[2434.1s] will s with me h with him and he with
[2437.0s] me. To him that overcomemeth, I will
[2439.4s] grant him to sit with me on my throne,
[2441.8s] even as I see even as I also overcame,
[2444.8s] and I'm set down with my father in his
[2447.2s] throne. He that hath an ear, let him
[2450.1s] hear what the spirit says unto the
[2454.1s] churches. Hear the savior at the door,
[2457.8s] let him in. Let him in. He has knocked
[2460.7s] there before. Let him in. Let him in. It
[2463.8s] is the Savior standing at the door. He's
[2466.2s] been watching, waiting there before.
[2468.9s] Open wide thy heart of sin. Let the
[2470.9s] blessed Savior in. Let him in. Let him
[2473.4s] in. He is your best and truest friend.
[2476.2s] Let him in. One who will always defend
[2479.1s] you. Let him in. Do not let him knock in
[2482.2s] vain. Let him in. He may never come
[2485.3s] again. Let him in. Hear his gentle,
[2487.8s] loving voice. Let him in. Bid him
[2490.4s] welcome and rejoice. Let him in. It is
[2493.4s] the savior standing at the door. He's
[2495.7s] been watching, waiting there before.
[2498.4s] Open wide thy heart of sin. Let the
[2501.0s] blessed savior in. Let him in. Let him
[2505.6s] in.
[2508.1s] Now we are winding up by going back to
[2511.6s] the cross. For it is the cross where we
[2515.1s] get salvation full and free. And that
[2518.1s] old rugged cross made the difference for
[2521.2s] me when I was in high school. That old
[2523.8s] rugged cross made the difference for me
[2526.1s] when I was going through college. That
[2529.2s] old rugged cross is still making the
[2531.6s] difference for me even as we are still
[2533.7s] serving people by taking them all over
[2536.1s] the place. And that old rugged cross
[2539.0s] made the difference for me and is still
[2541.0s] making the difference. How I encourage
[2543.4s] you that once you have gone in and you
[2546.1s] have become a successful people, please
[2549.0s] let us join in the ministry and keep on
[2551.5s] encouraging others to love this Lord
[2553.8s] with all their hearts, with all their
[2555.8s] minds, with all their souls so that they
[2558.2s] can come in. Join us in this walk
[2560.3s] because the the close of probation is
[2562.6s] just about to happen. There is this song
[2565.1s] that I love singing. The old rugged
[2568.1s] cross made the difference.
[2572.6s] It was a life filled with aimless
[2576.1s] [Music]
[2594.1s] desperation. It was a
[2597.3s] life filled with
[2600.4s] aimless
[2606.0s] desperation. Without
[2609.0s] hope walked the
[2611.9s] shell of a
[2617.6s] man. Then a
[2620.7s] hand with a nail printint stretched
[2629.3s] downward. Just one touch. Then a new
[2635.2s] life began.
[2638.0s] [Music]
[2642.1s] And the
[2644.3s] old ruged
[2647.2s] cross made the
[2653.2s] difference in a
[2656.0s] life bound for
[2659.0s] heartache and
[2664.8s] defeat. I will praise
[2668.3s] him
[2670.1s] forever. Forever and
[2676.4s] ever. For the cross made the
[2682.5s] difference for
[2688.8s] [Music]
[2693.8s] me. Barren walls.
[2698.2s] They could
[2700.5s] harshness and
[2705.5s] anger. Little
[2708.4s] feet ran in
[2712.0s] terror to
[2716.8s] hide. Now those walls ring with love,
[2724.0s] warmth and laughter.
[2728.0s] [Music]
[2729.5s] Since the
[2732.0s] giver of life
[2735.5s] moved inside.
[2738.9s] [Music]
[2742.6s] Now there's a
[2745.2s] room filled with
[2750.0s] s aen
[2753.4s] [Music]
[2756.4s] faces without
[2759.6s] hope. Death has wrapped
[2763.2s] them in gloom.
[2767.1s] [Music]
[2770.2s] But at the
[2772.4s] side of a saint
[2776.3s] there
[2780.6s] rejoiceing for
[2783.9s] life can't be sealed in a tomb.
[2790.6s] [Music]
[2792.8s] Oh, and the
[2795.6s] old rugged
[2798.4s] cross make the
[2804.4s] difference in a
[2807.2s] life bound for
[2810.2s] heartache and defeat.
[2813.0s] [Music]
[2817.0s] I will praise
[2819.4s] him
[2822.8s] forever and
[2827.4s] never for the cross
[2830.9s] made the
[2833.7s] difference for
[2839.1s] me. Yes. The cross
[2842.6s] made the
[2845.5s] difference for
[2851.0s] me. For
[2861.9s] me, let us pray.
[2865.4s] Savior and
[2867.8s] friend. The tenant determines our
[2870.6s] eternal
[2872.4s] destiny. We have often times looked at
[2875.3s] the few pieces of silver and betrayed
[2878.2s] the master.
[2882.0s] But when we look deep inside, we realize
[2884.8s] that it was the rogue tenant that came
[2887.7s] in. Satan who's desiring to have this
[2890.9s] young man, desiring to have us all that
[2893.5s] he may sift us as wheat. But you're
[2896.2s] still praying for us that our faith
[2898.9s] fails not.
[2902.4s] Master, if you are the tenant, when the
[2906.2s] Holy Spirit comes and says stays
[2909.0s] within, then sanity of mind is
[2912.8s] restored. Decency in our clothing is
[2917.3s] restored. We can be found dwelling in
[2920.6s] houses and in the house of the Lord. And
[2923.7s] we can be found at the feet of Jesus.
[2927.7s] Master, we have often played with the
[2930.4s] enemy for so
[2931.8s] long and now like the Egyptians, we are
[2934.7s] almost getting lost. But we are crying
[2937.3s] like Peter, Lord, save. And we thank you
[2941.2s] that that is the only prayer that
[2944.2s] anytime it comes from a sinner, you
[2946.7s] don't delay even a microscond.
[2950.4s] Master, we are crying, please save
[2954.7s] because we have been attacked by the
[2956.2s] rogue tenant who has come in and
[2959.4s] destroyed the walls, the roofs, the
[2962.1s] floors, the
[2963.6s] windows and some of us are lost forever.
[2967.9s] We who are still alive, oh Lord, we are
[2970.3s] requesting that you may come in such
[2972.2s] that the places which is filled with sad
[2974.2s] ashen phases may be one more time filled
[2977.2s] with joy, laughter, peace, but above all
[2980.6s] else
[2982.4s] contentment. Dear
[2984.4s] Lord, we only share as human beings.
[2988.3s] But when you come in, then these words
[2991.9s] will forever ring in our minds until the
[2994.7s] day faith is made sight, until the
[2996.8s] clouds are rolled back as a scroll.
[2999.0s] Master, we have our friends who are
[3001.4s] watching online who are asking
[3005.2s] themselves, who their tenant is, and
[3008.9s] they don't know how to get rid of him.
[3011.3s] Lord God Almighty, we are crying on
[3013.8s] their behalf. Oh Lord, go and save them
[3016.9s] and get rid of that tenant. The same way
[3019.1s] you crossed over and to gatherines and
[3021.4s] you got rid of the of the
[3024.2s] legions. Master, I'm also praying for
[3028.2s] our special guest, our special friend
[3031.0s] from Upper Hill who is the second time
[3034.4s] fellowshipping with us, the
[3036.5s] Adventist. He joined us last Sabbath. Oh
[3039.2s] Lord, our brother James, he came oh Lord
[3043.0s] to listen to your word. How I pray that
[3046.2s] from the morning service that may he
[3048.2s] also enroll as a as a as a disciple.
[3051.8s] Then he goes out as a as a missionary.
[3057.9s] We are praying dear Lord that even this
[3061.6s] sharing may also ask himself who the
[3064.9s] tenant is and he requests you to come in
[3068.0s] and be the one that occupies
[3070.7s] him. Thank you Lord for hearing our
[3073.9s] prayer. This session Lord was meant for
[3077.3s] that one individual and that for that
[3079.5s] one individual you will reach him. the
[3082.5s] rest of us were escorting him. But even
[3084.7s] in case there are many others who also
[3086.5s] needed this message, glory be to God,
[3089.5s] but above all else, oh Lord, may we not
[3092.6s] be like
[3094.0s] Judas on the missionary field, but at
[3097.4s] the last minute goes away and betrays
[3101.5s] the cause. May we not be like Judas, but
[3105.0s] instead be like Peter, be like John, be
[3108.6s] like Paul, that we die in this course.
[3112.7s] For this is the place where we pray. For
[3115.5s] this is the place where we cry. For this
[3118.2s] the place where we start till death do
[3120.7s] us part where we say goodbye. Oh Lord,
[3124.0s] here we leave all our fears and our
[3126.2s] pains and we get grace. We get mercy.
[3130.2s] Here we walk down the aisle. We dedicate
[3132.6s] every child in this sacred place. Thank
[3135.5s] you for allowing us to dwell in Bethl.
[3138.0s] And thank you oh Lord for allowing the
[3140.7s] Holy Spirit to be the one that dwells
[3143.1s] inside. That when you dwell inside us
[3145.8s] and we dwell in Bethl, then when we are
[3148.5s] asked how is it with our souls, then we
[3150.9s] will answer and say it is well. It is
[3154.6s] well, it is well with our souls. Thank
[3157.9s] you for hearing our prayers and always
[3160.0s] answering us when we call through Christ
[3162.3s] our Lord your holy name we pray. Amen.
[3165.1s] And may the grace of our Lord Jesus
[3167.7s] Christ and the love of God and the
[3170.2s] fellowship of the Holy Spirit be with us
[3173.0s] now and forever more. Amen. Amen. Amen.
