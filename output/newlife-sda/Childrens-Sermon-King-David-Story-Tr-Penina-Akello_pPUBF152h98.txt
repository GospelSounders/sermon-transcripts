The Lord does not look at the things people look at. People look at out of appearance but the Lord looks at the heart. Sorry. The Lord says no. You have the look but not the heart. Next. Next. Psalm please. Abinadab. Abinadab. Are you Abinadab? Are you a binadab? They call me a binadab their abble. I've been carrying sheep all week. Look at these muscles. But is your heart able abinadab?

Charming, but not the chosen one. One by one, all the sons of Jesse passed, but God said no. David Jesse, are these all your sons or you're hiding the good one? Well, David, is David tending the ship? You You know this is sweaty playing up David? Well, he slings better than slingshot. Send for him. We'll not sit down until he comes. Even though it takes all day. So they sent for David. He runs. He's dusty. He's humble. Smelling like sheep with a sling on his belt, but with humility in his hand. David. David. Dad is calling you. That is him. Rise and anoint him. He is the one. Samuel David, the Lord has chosen you from shepherd to king because God sees what no one else can. He's He sees your inside, not your outside. The least expected is God's elected. This this boy who takes care of sheep. Ah and the way he stinks. This boy ruling over us. Man looks at the outward appearance but the Lord looks at the heart. And from that day forward, the spirit of the Lord came powerfully upon David. He wasn't the biggest, the strongest, or the most obvious, but he had what God was looking for, a heart like his own. Even though the world forgets you in the field, God will still send for you. Amen. Did you forget me? But you may feel overlooked, underestimated or unseen. But know this, God doesn't look at your outside. He sees your heart, your worship, and your quiet obedience. God sees from the inside.

[38.5s] God who sees from the inside. It comes
[41.4s] from the book of 1 Samuel chapter 16.
[47.9s] The theme is
[50.2s] God likes and chooses people from the
[54.0s] heart not outward appearance. Welcome
[62.3s] Happy Sabbath church. Before we start
[65.5s] this kit, let us pray. They deserve to
[68.2s] thank for this day that have to set upon
[69.8s] us. Thank you for protecting all of us
[71.4s] as we are coming to church. As we do our
[73.8s] skit, may be with us. Protect us. May it
[76.6s] be something in our lives. For this is
[78.6s] in Jesus name we pray. Amen.
[94.9s] God chooses based on the heart, not
[98.0s] outward appearance.
[101.6s] Amen. Amen.
[108.1s] In the days when soul disobeyed God,
[111.0s] they don't look for a man after his own
[113.3s] heart.
[114.5s] So he sent his prophet Samuel on a
[117.0s] secret mission.
[144.8s] How long
[147.1s] will you mourn for Saul? Since I have
[150.2s] rejected him as king over Israel,
[153.6s] fill your horn with oil and go. I will
[156.9s] send you to Jesse of Bethlehem. I have
[159.6s] chosen one of his sons to be king. But
[162.8s] Lord, if Saul hears about this, won't he
[166.2s] kill me?
[169.6s] Take a h and say I have come to
[172.6s] sacrifice to the Lord. Invite Jesse to
[176.5s] the sacrifice and I will show you what
[179.4s] to do. You are to anoint one of the son
[183.0s] I indicate.
[185.8s] So Samuel obeyed because when God speaks
[189.4s] his servants move on. On his way he
[192.8s] meets with the elders of Bethlehem. They
[195.4s] were afraid and they were trembling.
[197.4s] Elders,
[200.2s] do you come in peace?
[210.1s] In peace I come.
[212.8s] Relax. No fire or brimstones today. Have
[216.8s] come to sacrifice for the Lord. Get
[219.6s] Jesse and his sons. God has his eye on
[222.7s] someone.
[237.1s] Jesse,
[248.0s] the Lord has called me here. Bring your
[251.4s] sons before me. Of course. Prophet
[256.0s] boys
[258.1s] line up. Alabid
[261.6s] Sharma line up. Stand tall. Chest out.
[266.4s] Sod
[276.5s] up.
[278.1s] Ellie up. Step forward.
[297.1s] Surely the Lord's anointed stands before
[299.8s] you. I mean, look at me. Look at me.
[304.1s] Surely the Lord's anointed stands before
[306.7s] the Lord.
[309.4s] Do not consider his appearance or his
[311.8s] height. For I have rejected him. The
[314.8s] Lord does not look at the things people
[316.6s] look at. People look at out of
[319.2s] appearance but the Lord looks at the
[321.5s] heart. Sorry. The Lord says no. You have
[326.0s] the look but not the heart. Next. Next.
[329.0s] Psalm please.
[331.9s] Abinadab.
[334.2s] Abinadab. Are you Abinadab?
[337.8s] Are you a binadab?
[343.7s] They call me a binadab their abble. I've
[347.5s] been carrying sheep all week. Look at
[350.5s] these muscles. But is your heart able
[353.6s] abinadab? The lord says no. Next son,
[358.0s] please.
[360.8s] Sha, are you Shamba? Are you the third
[365.0s] born to J?
[369.7s] I am the third times the charm. I have
[372.2s] the voice of a psalmist and the face of
[374.5s] a king. Of course, it's me. Charming,
[377.7s] but not the chosen one.
[382.1s] One by one, all the sons of Jesse
[384.4s] passed, but God said no.
[394.3s] David
[397.1s] Jesse, are these all your sons or you're
[400.4s] hiding the good one? Well, David, is
[404.6s] David tending the ship? You You know
[408.9s] this is sweaty playing up David?
[414.2s] Well, he slings better than slingshot.
[417.7s] Send for him. We'll not sit down until
[420.5s] he comes. Even though it takes all day.
[434.2s] So they sent for David. He runs. He's
[438.1s] dusty. He's humble. Smelling like sheep
[442.3s] with a sling on his belt, but with
[445.8s] humility in his hand. David. David. Dad
[450.2s] is calling you.
[461.4s] That is him. Rise and anoint him. He is
[464.7s] the one. Samuel
[472.0s] David, the Lord has chosen you from
[474.5s] shepherd to king
[477.9s] because God sees what no one else can.
[480.7s] He's
[482.3s] He sees your inside, not your outside.
[487.1s] The least expected is God's elected.
[492.6s] This this boy who takes care of sheep.
[495.9s] Ah
[498.2s] and the way he stinks.
[503.2s] This boy ruling over us. Man looks at
[507.0s] the outward appearance but the Lord
[509.6s] looks at the heart.
[515.4s] And from that day forward, the spirit of
[518.3s] the Lord came powerfully upon David. He
[521.3s] wasn't the biggest, the strongest, or
[524.3s] the most obvious, but he had what God
[527.9s] was looking for, a heart like his own.
[535.9s] Even though the world forgets you in the
[539.0s] field, God will still send for you.
[542.3s] Amen.
[544.4s] Did you forget me? But you may feel
[546.9s] overlooked, underestimated or unseen.
[550.1s] But know this, God doesn't look at your
[553.0s] outside. He sees your heart, your
[555.4s] worship, and your quiet obedience. God
[558.7s] sees from the inside.
[572.6s] The memory verse is from the book of 1
[577.4s] Samuel
[579.2s] 16 verse 7 and it says but the Lord said
[585.5s] to Samuel
[587.7s] do not look at his outward appearance or
[591.5s] his physical stature because I have
[595.2s] refused him because
[599.4s] does not see as man sees. For man looks
[603.3s] at the outward appearance, but the Lord
[607.2s] looks at the heart. Amen. Amen.
[618.0s] We're going to sing a song.
