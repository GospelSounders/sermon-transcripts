TIMESTAMPED TRANSCRIPT:
[2.6s] good morning dear viewers happy happy
[6.2s] Sabbath shabbat shalom sabat and sabat
[12.0s] to all you who are watching from every
[14.3s] corner of this world it's a beautiful
[17.0s] day here at New Life 7th Day Adventist
[19.3s] Church Nairobi we see the sunshine right
[22.8s] after the rainfalls and you know what
[24.6s] that means the rainbow is out and just
[27.4s] as the children remind us when you see
[29.5s] the rain
[30.5s] remember that God is love may that be
[33.6s] our encouragements to come on down to
[35.6s] New Life 7th Day Adventist Church today
[38.0s] for a blessed Sabbath worship we warmly
[41.0s] welcome you once again and we're so
[43.4s] grateful that you could find time to
[45.2s] join us on our social media platforms I
[49.0s] hope you have had a fantastic week
[51.0s] myself I have had a fantastic week and I
[54.2s] praise God from whom all blessings flow
[57.8s] for this fantastic week and if I maybe
[60.6s] your week wasn't the best week we still
[63.7s] have hope in the Sabbath and I pray that
[66.2s] you will find your joy through this
[68.5s] sabbath day like the hangers
[72.8s] say what more do you need you've already
[75.4s] seen the rainow may that be our
[77.3s] encouragement today at New Life Church
[80.2s] today we have our education Ministry
[82.7s] Sabbath and it's is a very important and
[85.6s] special Sabbath where we will see how
[88.1s] education and our spiritual life
[90.4s] work hand in hand the great in my
[93.0s] opinion I feel like the greatest scholar
[95.2s] in the Bible is Apostle Paul even from
[98.5s] his letters we see how he's so learned
[101.2s] and still grounded firm and deep in the
[104.4s] savior's love isn't that's great he's
[107.4s] written over the most the most books in
[110.4s] the Bible and that's really admirable to
[112.7s] think that God would use such a man to
[115.2s] write to work for his
[117.8s] purpose through this sabbath I pray that
[120.6s] you will see how important it is for
[123.0s] education and spiritual life to work
[125.3s] together for the glory of God and above
[129.3s] all I pray that you will draw n to God
[132.8s] and he night to you and you you will be
[136.2s] blessed through this sabbath day and you
[138.0s] will grow spiritually we will grow
[140.8s] spiritually as a
[142.3s] church well like Apostle Paul bids his
[147.0s] fellow um his readers grace to you and
[151.2s] peace from God our Father and the Lord
[153.2s] Jesus Christ well with all that said May
[155.6s] the Lord's will be done my name is Leila
[158.4s] aino why don't you have a happy Sabbath
[160.8s] Chas take us away
